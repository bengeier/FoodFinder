{"text":"Fantastic food and service! My husband's first Chicago Pizza, he was in Nirvana! Be prepared to wait a little but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Meh.

I mean look- I get it.

Lou's has a fantastic atmosphere.  I cannot deny that this is the kind of joint that I would love to go with a bunch of friends.  The kids will love it.  Family-oriented vibe, undoubtably. 

But I've gotta be honest- I was expecting a little bit more from this place given the hype that has sat behind it since the Phoenix location made its debut.  To be honest,  It just wasn't an artisan pie experience.  But that's ok.  Maybe Lou's is the kind of joint that's good if you're good, and fine with nothing out of this world.  But I really was expecting out of this world, and given the history, I expected something glorious.  

It just wasn't a homerun on this swing.

But look- I get it.

The place is fun.  Bar is cool.  Atmosphere is beautiful.  Lou's is the kind of place to go with the family.  If you like pie, you'll like this place.  But it's not a death-bed za.

And that's ok.

Thanks Lou.  Might be back for round 2 given the right circumstances.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Of course the pizza is to die for! But for take-out I wouldn't recommend any of the salads because they don't make them fresh to order.  And you need to ask for condiments and utensils!"}
{"text":"Lou Malnati's is such a pleasant surprise to have here in the valley. I had never had authentic Chicago style deep dish before and this place was an eye opener! 

My favorite is the Lou that comes with leafy spinach,  cheese crusted tomatoes, and savory mushrooms. You really can't go wrong with an inch of melty indulgent cheese, tangy tomatoes, and buttery flaky crust."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to have to post a poor review for Lou's. I am from Illinois and have been going there for years and years. The quality of the pizza has decreased and the thickness of the crust has become thin. You used to have to eat it with a fork, now I see people picking it up like a thin crust pizza. The flavor is inconsistent, the sauce has decreased, the flavor not what I used to look forward to. After being so excited about Lou's opening in Phoenix,  I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Well I am writing another review. The company is very pro-active....Some young lady contacted me back. Very impressive! (still want that \"Lou's\" sausage taste.....Thank-You."}
{"text":"Great pizza place with a owner that makes great pizza... the owner is a hard worker that makes his customers happy it can be really busy at times because his oven isn't big enough to do huge orders but it's worth the wait. My boyfriend loves it there he even dreams about the food"}
{"text":"Pizza takes a while, but they are very clear about that, and it's worth the wait. Real, authentic, delicious Chicago style Pizza. 

My son lives in Chicago and complains about the pizza here. Federal and Bianco make tasty food that has pizza-like features, but for him, pizza is deeep and loaded with delicious thick crust.

Btw, our server the last time was fabulous. How she found time to engage with us and still attend to all her tables so efficiently is a great mystery. That's an art."}
{"text":"This is some great pizza and better still, it's only a couple of blocks from my home!  The huge crowds are a bit off-putting, but they seem to handle them with aplomb.  I have only used their takeout service so far, so I can't speak about the dine-in experience.  The pizza is awesome - way better than I remember Pizzeria Uno's being back in their Mill Avenue days.  The one modification that I think I will make in the future is to ask for no chunks of tomato on the top of the deep dish pizza, just sauce.  I realize that this is the way it's done in Chicago, but I'm just not a fan of big tomato pieces.  Other than that one personal preference, the deep dish is excellent, and so is their thin crust variety.  You really can't go wrong with either pizza, in my opinion.  It's a little pricey, but you can be sure that you're getting a high quality product."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent... have been 3 separate times and the service gets worse every time! Wait an hour to get the wrong pizza...the wrong COLD pizza... wait another 30 minutes for a Manager who doesn't seem to care much and then offer a dessert?! Uh no thanks....besides it would only take another 30 minute... excuse me, do we even have a waiter??!! I think I saw one guy give us water.... oh there goes another 30 minutes for the bill... \"would you like anything else?\" NO!  Horrible every time. Get organized and try to care!"}
{"text":"I took my sons to Lou Malnati's, and have to say it was just an \"OK\" place.  We waited a few months after they opened to avoid the long wait lines.  We went for lunch and luckily there wasn't a wait.  I had been to Lou Malnati's in Chicago years ago and had remembered I liked it a lot.  The restaurant was full, but not packed.  After sitting awhile, we had to flag down the waiter that appeared to be working our side of the room.  We all ordered personal deep dish pizza's, cheese bread and sodas.  I had hoped to order a Caesar Salad, but was told they didn't have one in Phoenix, and they are still trying to \"Dial In\" their kitchens.  Our drinks and cheese bread that we ordered came relatively fast, but then we waited, and waited, and waited for the pizza's to arrive.  When they finally showed up at our table (about 45 minutes after we finished our appetizers), I almost began to chuckle but kept my composure.  The \"Personal-sized\" pizzas are so small, I almost thought it was a joke.  As for the deep dish....the pizza had thick (and very hard) crust, however the bottom part was only about 1/4\" thick and the pizza sauce had a lot of watery runoff.  We all finished our pizzas in about 5 minutes.  Then we sat and waited for our bill.  We eventually had to flag down our waiter again just to get the check so we could leave.  All-in-all, we were there almost two hours and left hungry.  I think I'll stick to some other locally established pizza places until they can \"Dial-In\" their kitchens a bit more, and would definitely order a larger pizza.  Their prices are very high for what you get as well."}
{"text":"Thank G*D that they are here! Taste just as GREAT as it did in Chicago and it's great to have a taste of THE BEST DEEO DISH PIZZA IN THE WORLD so close and with out a airplane ride of sent frozen overnight!"}
{"text":"The Chicago Classic is just simply delicious. The tomato sauce is so fresh and the sausage is on point. Not too spicy, not too heavy, not too greasy...just plain ole' good. I'm not a thick crust guy, but if you like deep dish pizza and want a light buttery crust, you'll love this one."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an impromptu lunch with a friend and we both walked away longing for more. Ordered the Malnati Salad (Family Size) and crushed the entire thing. Also ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic with extra sauce. This thing didn't stand a chance. The crust was thin and buttery, just the right amount of cheese, that sausage that I love, and where do those tomatoes come from!?!?! There's no pizza flavor like it. I'm not a thick crust person, and sometimes imitation Chicago deep dish is just that; bread and more bread. Chicago pizza is not that!! This was the perfect blend of everything. Great thin crust cut into squares, Stuffed pizza with lots of REAL ingredients and sauce on top, and perfect deep dish are what Chicago pizza is all about. can't wait to try everything else on the menu. Thank you Mark Malnati, for coming to Phoenix. Saves me a plane flight."}
{"text":"If you are wondering if it tastes as good here as it does in Illinois, it really does! It was absolutely perfect and our server, Timothy, was great!"}
{"text":"I'll just cut to the chase. 

The wait was obscene @1.5 hours for a party of 8 on a Friday. They don't do rezos so get in line.

Once seated, the service was exceptional. Very friendly and attentive as all of our non-alcoholic drinks were kept filled the entire time.

The apps were hot and fresh and included the usual cheesy bread and fried bits of goodness including cheese balls. All served with fresh marinara. 

The pizza took a bit but was made to our specifications (extra 7mins in the oven) to insure crust crispness. The challenge with Chicago deep dish is that it's usually burdened with heavy, wet, oily toppings that almost always sog the crust. I despise soggy crust. And, well, despite the extra 7mins in the oven, the crust was about 60% soggy. 

We ordered the large Malnati Chicago Classic pies with Lou's lean sausage and a third 3-item large, for 8 people. The pizza (despite the soggy crust) was delicious! What I really loved about Malnati's is that NOTHING was over-salted. I could taste the delicate balance of flavors in the sauce and the sausage. 

Prior to ordering, the slim waitress told us she usually fills up after one slice. And coming from a rather well-nourished family, I silently laughed her silly comment off and happily ordered three large deep dish pies wondering if the pies would satisfy my large, hungry group.

Needless to say, we had 1.5 pies leftover. And the best part? The next 2 days, we feasted on toaster oven heated pizza that actually yielded a crispy crust. Super delicious and fresh even two days out.

My rating = 4/5 primarily for the crazy wait time and less so for the moderately soggy crust which I easily overlooked considering how fresh and wonderful the pies tasted!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is Amazing! Wonderful service and  great atmosphere with pleasant staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is not the Lou Malnati's pizza I used to eat in Elk Grove Village in the 70s and 80s.  The pizza sauce on the deep dish was tasteless and undercooked.  The crust had no body and was too flakey. Good cheese and mediocre sausage.  I wasn't  sure it was Italian sausage.

The service was very good and the house dressing salad was tops.

Don't get me wrong, the pizza was okay. Just not the original five-star pizza in my memory.  I am sure the waiting lines will soon dissappear.  Try it and judge for yourself. Maybe my memory is just failing."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got done eating at the pizzeria and it was most excellent the food was delicious the staff was friendly very very nice atmosphere thank you very much"}
{"text":"Since arriving in the valley we beleived our initial visit was a fluke. On our second visit it was established that maybe it's best if we get our pizza drop shopped from Chicago which is what we are used to. The pizza is just not that well made here in Arizona, best efforts aside this place is unable to re-create that amazing flavorful crust and true malnati's flavor...sorry but we have decided to not make the 55 minute drive into the city for this pizza..."}
{"text":"What can I say , the food speaks for itself , the location is perfect ,the inside of this place is amazing, really really nice inside and out ,the bar area is nice, plenty of parking ,me and the family sat out side even that was nice. BUT here's the thing the food takes forever to get to you forever. Hopefully sooner or later they figure something out because waiting like that was extremely long 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place, but we were very disappointed because sauce is very bland and tasteless.  My husband had the traditional Chicago deep dish pie which had sausage to give it good flavor.  I had the gluten free pie with mushroom, the only taste was the mushroom.  Crust had no flavor at all.  I'll stick to Spinato's."}
{"text":"Order a Chicago style pizza from Lou Malnati's yesterday July 7th 2016 received my pizza open the box and there was water floating on top of my pizza took me 9 paper towels to dry out all the water on top of my pizza I called Lou Malnati's back told them the problem they said that they would make me another one and not be charged for either one the other Pizza arrived the Chicago-style deep-dish same problem water floating on top another 9 paper towels to mop up all the water floating on top of my pizza so I called them back and explain to them there was more water on top of the second pizza and they told me it was because of the vegetables that I ordered on my pizza which was only Tomatoes mushroom and spinach and that was the problem too many vegetables never had a problem with it from any other pizza place plus the dog was Dewey and I asked to have it cooked well done both times July 8th 2016 I find a charge on my card for the amount of the pizza I will not order from them again they did nothing to really fix the problem sorry Lou Malnati's you lost a customer five stars I won't give you one"}
{"text":"This was probably the most unique dining atmosphere of a mix between a throwback ode to the 70's and modern day. If I was rating based on experience and decor alone it would be a 5 star rating, but the food is the biggest factor so I had to weigh it out. I got the lunch special, which is a soup or salad, with a personal pizza, and a soda. My total tab was about 10$ so you cannot beat such a deal. I loved the salad and the garlic lemon dressing. The pizza was the perfect amount of pie but honestly lacked in flavor. I did not love the sauce, and found the cheese to be more sticky than anything. I would absolutely come back to the establishment to try a pasta and their wings looked amazing. As far as the pizza goes I personally would sit it out.I am from New Jersey, so disclaimer, no, I am not a deep dish pizza fan as it is not my typical Italian culture from that part of back east. I can however, appreciate a good pie, deep dish or not, when I have one."}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic, just like back home. Service was friendly and fast, ordered carry out and literally waited two minutes.  Can't wait to go back and so happy there is finally authentic Chicago deep dish in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza. Actually all the items are great.  Hope they open one further north."}
{"text":"First time for me and my family at the new phoenix location. Lou's didn't fail to deliver as usual ...a perfect pizza! Keep it up Lou's you will soon have locations all over the valley.
The wait was extreme, but what else do you expect?"}
{"text":"Style is retro and would be nice to have retro music to go along with.  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been reading about Lou's for a couple of years now--the raves from national publications and food shows, the raves from fellow chefs etc. Up till now, the central location and long lines kept me at bay. Lil Miss BBQ is the only food joint I'll wait an hour in line for.

The Arcadia location opened recently so finally I knocked something off my bucket list. We got a small (serves 2) Lou's Classic that we picked up Friday afternoon. Ordering online was simple which made the pickup as easy as it comes.

I agree with another poster here. This place is about 7 minutes away from us now, and this is going to be a real problem. Simply put, this was the best pizza I've ever eaten. It was the perfect combo of sausage, tomato sauce and butter crust. Every bite was pure bliss.

This is hands down the best crust I've ever had on a pizza. Someone on another review for the uptown location complained that the crust wasn't thick enough. This shows what Costco has done, with their 1 1/2 inch bland crusts...people think that's what thick crust should be. This is actually a pizza where the crust was as flavorful as the ingredients (the sausage is killer!).

The crust here is buttery crunchy and superb. Next time we are going to try the Three-Cheese Bread side order with dipping sauce, hoping that will be just a big amount of that great crust-bread.
We are going to systematically go thru the entire menu. We want to try one of the frozen pizzas, but since the Arcadia location is so close, it seems silly not to just let Lou's do the cooking. We are so excited Lou's came to the neighborhood. Let the word spread near and far!"}
{"text":"Got a medium deep dish pizza to go tonight and was incredibly disappointed.  The whole thing tasted like it had been pre-frozen and heated up before I came to pick it up.  The cheese wasn't very cheesy and the crust wasn't very favorable.  Maybe the pizza is better when you sit down and order in the restaurant, but the the take-out pizza is not the way to go here.

On a positive note, the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant is incredible."}
{"text":"This is a good pizza spot in the city. I came here of course because of the Yelp reviews I read and I wasn't disappointed. The garlic clam pizza was packed with flavor in every single bite taken. The texture of the bread was good as well. I feel it would have been better had I be fortunate enough to try it fresh out of the oven although it's one of those places that's it's luck of the draw with your timing of arrival."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant. When I heard the best deep dish pizza was at Lou's, I order two pies from chi-town. The first one I made, blew my mind. It was cheesy, the pepperoni was delicious and the crust was special. The second one, was not like the first and made me wonder if it was worth the cost to reorder again. After I heard they were opening one here in phoenix, I thought I'd give it another try-I shouldn't have! The pizza at Lou's in Phoenix was terrible. It wasn't cheesy, the crust was tough and the tomato sauce was salt! Oreganos has a better deep dish, so after I try giodannos, I'll know who the king of deep dish is on Arizona."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Chicago Pizza in AZ  How sweet it is!"}
{"text":"Have been to Lou's in Chicago area many times. The deep dish pizza here is every bit as good as the Chicago restaurants. The patio is great. If you like deep dish I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had tickets to the pre-grand opening but didn't go that day. We went about a week later, and there was a line waiting for the restaurant to open. We were about the 20th party in line, and when they opened, we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. We talked to Mark, the owner, at this location, and he was very friendly. One of us in our party knew Mark's father.  Mark walked around the restaurant and greeted customers and asked them how everything was. The restaurant is very clean and the decor looks very much like a pizzeria. 

We ordered a family house salad, which was out-of-this-world good. It had mixed greens, tomatoes, black olives, and cheese in it, but the dressing is what really made it tasty. The waiter served each of our salads. There were five of us, and there was plenty of salad left over. Then we ordered 3 small deep dish pizzas, and we ended up taking a whole pizza home. One had pepperoni, and the other two were plain cheese. The pizzas had so much delicious, melting, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, and the pizza crust was original in taste and very good.

I recommend getting there early at opening time, which is 4 p.m. The atmosphere is somewhat loud, most likely due to the amount of people inside the restaurant, but very amiable. The servers are very conscientious and friendly, and they will go out of their way to make sure your experience is a good one. A few servers walk around just to make sure everyone is taken care of. There is a bar, and there are televisions inside the restaurant as well.

We're from Chicago, and one of us had been at the very first 2 restaurants that opened there. This is Chicago-style pizza that can't get any better!"}
{"text":"My wonderful wife and I were very impressed with the service that we received along with the quality of the food! Every comment that we read before on Yelp, we literally experienced. From the professionalism and fancy dining that this place offers! Will be referring all my family and friends! Our server Malik was quick and friendly! I loved that as soon as we walked in we were greeted and were checked in with a tablet. Even though the wait time was 25 minutes, the host offered a convenient option to pre order so by the time we sit down the food would be out shortly! Loved it and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food with great friends! Lou's was just how I remembered when visiting downtown Chicago! The decor was mid century and sat in our cozy chairs for a table of 4. Our wait was minimal on a Thursday night. It's great that they allow you to place the pizza order while waiting. By the time you get to table...bam!! Pizza arrives!! We pigged out though and we were able to squeeze in the tasty Malnatis salad, hot wings and honey bbq wings! Of course I paid homage to Chicago by ordering Goose Island Green Mile to wash down the goodness. Our deep dish \"The Lou\" and thin crust with sausage mushrooms and pepperoni pizzas were gobbled up! We had minimal leftovers but still boxed it up to enjoy for tomorrow's lunch. Definitely will return for more deep dish fill! BTW folks this is way better than Oregano's. Lou's is in a class all on its own!!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review. After our bad experience a couple of weeks ago a representative from the restaurant contacted me to send us a coupon to try the pizza again.  We ordered the same deep dish pizza, but this time without the extra butter crust. There was still a little butter flavor in the crust but overall it was better.  I think maybe we're just not fans of this type of pizza. Anyway, our server, Carlos, was fantastic; the restaurant was very busy, and he was friendly and attentive. We didn't present the coupon until the bill came, so I believe the server's attitude and actions were just based on good customer service. So while I am not a huge fan of the food, I am impressed by their customer service and Carlos, our server."}
{"text":"We went to the Arcadia location, and I'm wondering if some of the positive reviews are for the Central location? I can not see how people would be happy spending top dollar on this.  As mentioned before this place is reheating frozen pizza and not doing a very good job of it. I did not know that prior to going as I did not read yelp. In fact I just signed up to Yelp today just to comment...attention Lou Malnattis cause that's not good. I have been looking forward to going here since they opened, I drive by every night.  So finally ordered up 2 pizzas. One was the classic Chicago deep dish I'm not from Chicago but I imagine there they are fully cooked! Ours on the other hand was warm some spots cold in others, you know like when you under cook a frozen pizza!!. The second was a small thin crust cheese for the kid, she took one bite and said nope. She can be a picky eater and I mean we are talking about a thin crust cheese pizza...can't really screw that up! Wrong, I also took one bite and man straight into the trash it went, I've had better frozen from the grocery store.  Hell I will even save nasty old Dominos for the next day. I really hope the managers are reading this and certainly hope future non customers are too. $40.00 folks that's premium pricing for two of the worst pizzas I have ever had!!! I love pizza and I like to support business in my neighborhood. What a bummer."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I had better tasting pizza from pizza Hut and let's face it,pizza Hut pizza is trash. Will never spend my money here again. #overrated"}
{"text":"Real Chicago-style deep dish pizza.  I spent a long time in Chicago and had been to the usual staples - Giordano's, Gino's East, and Pizzeria Uno, but never Lou Malnati's.  The taste is authentic and delicious.  My only criticism was that the crust was a bit tough (like hard to cut with a knife hard)"}
{"text":"After listening to people talk up this place like it was the best pizza, I made a point to drive the 45 minutes to get there. I ended up pretty disappointed, still hungry and lighter in the pocket. The staff was very friendly and this has nothing to do with them. 
First of all, since I was eating alone, I was looking at the personal pans but noticed they were almost nine bucks. That would have been fine but I was worried that it wasn't going to be enough food. If I wanted to order a small (next size up) the price would jump up to over 14 buck! Again, this was lunch. On top of that, if you want to add a topping on this tiny pizza, like say pepperoni, you pay a dollar per topping. Realizing that I might not get enough food, I searched for a Caesar salad to help curve my appetite. They don't make a Cesar salad. They had one option of you want a small salad and it was about 6 bucks! I ordered a minestrone soup since it was closer to 4 bucks. It was good. The pizza was ok but not worth the money. I don't mind paying top dollar for food if it is good and satisfying but the price for my soup, personal pizza and a water was over 16 bucks plus tip.(added two toppings) 

Overrated !"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to taste fresh Lou Malnati's again rather than order frozen from Chicago. Ordered a large cheese pizza for take-out Monday morning for pick-up after work. Pizza was ready on time, staff was very nice and friendly. My taste buds were anxiously awaiting that first bite....
I have to say, I was a little disappointed. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. But it tasted a little bland. I'm not sure why.....  When I had a bite that included the fresh tomato, it tasted better. Maybe there was not enough tomatoes included? 
I'm not giving up on Lou Malnati's. I will try again. In fact, my office plans to order 8 or 9 pizzas next week once they're open for lunch. We'll order an assortment so maybe some other toppings will help improve the flavor. I'll write another review after our luncheon to comment again."}
{"text":"I was super excited to hear Lou's was opening a restaurant in Phoenix as I was a Chicago boy who loved Lou's thick crust pizza.  I even ordered frozen pies through the Lou's website.  This pizza gave Lou's a bad name.  The crust was 1 1/2 inch thick on one side and about an 1/8th of an inch on the other side.  It was inedible.  We threw it out because it was so bad!! It had no flavor and even our boys (who will eat anything) wouldn't eat it.  My wife ordered a small thin crust which was okay, but not up to Lou's  standards.  Dominos tasted better.  The frozen ones we ordered online tasted  A LOT better."}
{"text":"My husband and I came into this restaurant Sunday evening for dinner. It was our first time here and I have to say it was awesome! We both split a deep dish Chicago classic since our server mentioned that it was the signature dish and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and we were always greeted with a smile. Our server Danielle kept our drinks full promptly and gave us excellent service! We will definitely be back! I also love that you can pre order your pizzas ahead of time, we will be doing that the next time we come in."}
{"text":"One of our top two pizza places in the valley, the other being Piazza al Forno. Malnatti's is how deep dish pizza is supposed to taste."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan in Chicago. Was always excited to take out of town business clients there. Kinda a case of how you remember things being better than they really were? Maybe. All I know is we got a pie to go their first week open, and it just wasn't anything special to write home about. Sauce didn't have as much zip as I remember, and the crust was dry. Just overall disappointing after so much anticipation."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. I like the sausage. I would go there for the salad. Everything tastes fresh and homemade.  Great service. I lived in Chicago and went to the original restaurant for many years. The pizza is the same. Love the atmosphere of the new place."}
{"text":"Maybe it is a Chicago thing. We didn't like the pizza at all. It is more like a stewed pie. The salad was great, cocktail was great and the service was probably 4 1/2 stars. You do wait quite awhile for the pizza because they are apparently cooking it for 1/2 hr - which makes it different. But, to those Chicago-ians, enjoy.  Not our cup of tea!"}
{"text":"This place had the best deep dish pizza I have ever had and I don't normally like that kind of pizza. I am so glad I finally tried it and sorry that I waited this long to go there. it came highly recommended and I recommend you try it also you won't be sorry. If you get it to go call ahead as the deep dish takes about 30 minutes to make. If you love cheese as I do this pizza will not disappoint there is serious cheese porn happening here. Enjoy a true Chicago treasure as soon as you can."}
{"text":"I love Lou's. If you're a fan of deep dish, check this place out. I knew I made the right choice when I saw plenty of Chicagoans in line for the \"Chicago-style\" pizza. I went on opening week and have been back another couple times since. Service is excellent and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"Totally worth the 1 hour wait!! We did pre-order while we waited for our table & that was a smart suggestion. Glad Lou Malnati's chose Phoenix Az to be the 1st out state for their pizzeria. Definitely a smart choice since their is so many of us Chicagoans here.. Sausage deep dish pizza is my personal favorite with their buttery crust. 
Last note: The president of the company was awesome to my boys.. Wish I could give more than 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Tasted just like the pizza from any of the locations in Chicago.  Place was insanely busy but customer service was on point.  Multiple staff checked on us and made sure we were taken care of.  Hopefully they open a location in Tucson."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and lived 5 minutes from Lou's restaurant so I am a little picky when it comes to writing a review about my favorite place.  My first experience with Lou in AZ was to carry out a pizza because the line for dining when they opened was very, very long.  I ordered a classic original deep dish and a spinach one to go.  The classic was good but the spinach pizza had sliced tomatoes all over the top of the pizza and \"cheddar cheese\" underneath it.  That was not good.  Then last week we decided to try and eat at the restaurant so we went at 3:30 in the afternoon during the week.  Good time to go, only two couples in the restaurant eating.  I ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was over cooked.  They brought us another order that was cooked perfectly.  We then ordered the classic original deep dish pizza and I noticed it has pieces of sausage under the tomato sauce and NOT one solid piece of sausage.  I questioned the mgr and he agreed it was made incorrectly.  They waived our pizza on the bill which was very nice.  Living in the dessert also creates a bit of a problem with the dough rising.  The butter crust taste was there because they installed a special filtration system for the water but the crust wasn't as thick as it was back home. Lou has been open for 8 months and still has Chicago folks working at this restaurant.  I am hopeful they will be able to work out their issues  and make pizza again the way it should be made. If you want to send someone a pizza from Lou's, you must call the Chicago number to have it sent on dry ice.  They do not ship from the AZ location.  I did buy two frozen pizza's to take home and hope they are made correctly."}
{"text":"One easy way to start an argument about pizza is to put the words \"deep dish\" in front of it. Is it still pizza? Or more like a lasagna? Is it legal to eat pizza with a knife and fork? Who's willing to wait a half hour while their pizza bakes?

All these questions would be answered in my visit to Lou Malnati's and my first time encountering deep dish pizza after years of NY and Neapolitan. For the sake of comparison I sampled both their classic deep dish and the thin crust. My final conclusion: While there are a lot of differences, I can understand the hype to a degree. It's an interesting take on pizza with some positives and negatives. 

Let's start with the sauce. The cooked deep dish sauce features roughly ground tomato chunks floating around and a very subtle flavor. The deep dish is proportionately mostly sauce but it doesn't dominate the pizza.  It's really more reminiscent of a marinara made for pasta, lending credence to my pre-conception that deep dish is closer to lasagna than pizza. The sauce on the thin crust pizza was noticeably different in a good way. It exploded with a big kick of sugar and butter which was very enjoyable. I can understand not using it in the deep dish because it would be way too much; on the thinner crust though, it shined. 

Onto the cheese- Malnati's places their Wisconsin mozzarella on the bottom layer of the pizza just above the dough. It makes for an interesting experience but I'm not so sure I enjoy it. The weak flavor of mozzarella cheese really benefits from the browning it gets when on top in the oven. Buried beneath all the sauce, it never really had a chance. If ooey-gooey white cheese if your thing, you might like it more. But for others, I'd recommend asking for less. The thin crust pizza had a solid layer which didn't brown very much either, but it didn't detract from the experience because there was so much less of it. 

The crust is where Malnati's caught my interest. It's a very different crust than every other pizza place I've visited. It's the most enjoyable part of the entire pie highlighted by some major differences. The crust is very buttery and flakey, almost more similar to a pie crust. Aside from using a good amount of butter, this is likely due to a low hydration level on the dough. When you use less water, the dough gets thick and tears instead of stretching. There's also little to no gas bubbles in the crust which means some combination of low hydration and under/over fermenting. The differences are essential to deep dish! You need a compact and tough dough that can stay crispy and firm under the weight of sauce and cheese. A normal airy dough would collapse completely. The strong buttery taste also helps the dough to stand out in the final mix. The thin crust pizza featured more or less the same dough, and it served to create the same experience on a smaller scale. 

While I wasn't impressed by the deep dish sauce or cheese, I can see myself coming back for the unique crust. But push come to shove, and I'm likely to opt for the thin crust which was a far better overall experience. I just can't get over the feeling that I'm eating pasta. Un-browned cheese, chunks of tomatoes in the marinara, and ground sausage in their signature pie makes me think lasagna, not pizza. I'm a firm believer that less is more on a pizza. A deep dish pizza takes the exact opposite stance -that more is more and even more is even better.  

Service was very good, but waiting up to 40 minutes for a pizza is a bit absurd. There may be a line out the door at night but that's more because it takes so long to serve each table. You're committing to over an hour which isn't economical if you're on a lunch break. Is it worth a visit? I would say yes just to try it out, but I'm not sure how many times I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Thank you Lou Malnati's-for coming to Arizona and feeding us the BEST PIZZA EVER!!! #AMAZINGPIZZA"}
{"text":"Expect a long wait - that's ust the way it is - plan to make it an evening with friends.

To those Chicagoan wondering, Yes, it's tastes like the one's back home.
To those who haven't tried it - make a night of it.  The deep dish has a different taste than most pizzas.  You takes the individual flavors of the ingredients, not just the combined pie.  Definitely pizza, but taste unlike any you've had.  Guaranteed that you'll tell your friends"}
{"text":"I normally not a fan of Chicago deep dish but this was amazing !! Butter crust and very flavorful . We ordered the Lou Malnati's classic with pepperoni and sausage ! The service was impeccable and I liked the fact we could pre order our pizza and have it cooking while we wait for our table . I was definitely impressed with the food and service all around and the location is superb . I can't wait to try their chocolate chip pizza next time."}
{"text":"I went with friends on a Friday night which may not have been the best time for someone like me because the noise level was tremendous!  The salad was good, the pizza was delicious and the staff did a remarkably good job of getting the food served under pressure.  My stomach was upset for the next two days, so I guess that Chicago style is a little to greasy for me.  I think this place is best for young, or young-at-heart people who like being in a big, noisy crowd."}
{"text":"Lou Malnati's is stellar in every way a restaurant should be! Both times our family has dined there have been super due to the pleasant, knowledgeable and adept servers and other staff. It's like they know exactly what you need/want before you even have to ask. All the servers especially our primary waitress were so accommodating. Order the pizza 1st? -No problem. Extra cup for the toddler? -Of course. How about an extra table so you can fit all your baby stuff? (Let me just say many restaurants aren't this sweet and accommodating toward minions, I mean... little ones. Lol. Not an issue at Malnati's.)
Food- so yummy (order anything- you can't go wrong), drinks- just right, music, lighting, decorations and overall ambiance- on point. I love the giant homage to Sky Harbor/American Airlines hanging on the Northern wall. 
The location alone is super cute since it's nestled in the center of the Uptown Plaza. Parking is a breeze. Upon entering the restaurant, one is welcomed by an outstretched patio with water features, a lawn, and large potted flowers with succulents. Both the outdoor patio and indoor spaces are spacious with highly appealing interior design. I must be honest about how the initial reception area is confusing since the actual hostess area is further back. Is that purposeful in some way? It's humbling for sure.
Regardless of the latter, Lou Malnati's will most definitely deliver an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I should have known better. Chicago style. Had the pepperoni and sausage. Without a doubt the worst pizza I have ever consumed. Service was good and place was nice. Just terrible overladen watery saucy pizza. Could not taste anything except the watery tomatoes. Just awful."}
{"text":"This place is absolute garbage. If you're thinking about coming here, first understand the only people who find this place appealing are yuppie,  white privileged, losers that like that watered down crap."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! Great pizza (we got a deep Chicago classic) & Lou's Bruschetta, talk about filling  superb food.  Our server Kathleen was attentive and full of information to our many questions.  I could not have asked for a better experience. We will be returning very soon, the pizza and bruschetta are addictive."}
{"text":"Great service and fabulous pizza. Fun location too with the ice cream place next door and cute shopping in the center."}
{"text":"By far one of the best tasting deep dish pizzas in all of Phoenix!  Honestly, the wait time is horrible and the wait staff not very attentive or prompt but when your pizza arrives all is forgotten as your taste buds enter it ecstasy!  Cheese tastes so real and authentic and the ingredients are fresh and so tasty (especially the sausage)!"}
{"text":"Karl is the man. We didn't realize this location was not sit-down. He was super helpful and recommended pizza options for us to order at their dine-in locations. He also gave us a coupon for a free appetizer/dessert for our trouble. I haven't even tried the pizza yet and I'm already a happy customer!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Lou Malnatis was slightly disappointing. I heard great things about their pizza, but it didn't live up to the hype for me. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good and the service/our waiter was great. However, we waited about 40 min for a pizza that was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Confusing menu for the Customers and the waiters. I thought I ordered The Malnati Chicago Classic but what I received was the The \"Lou\". I guess I was not clear when I ordered the Lou Malinati pizza not reading down the menu to the \"Lou\".  I was so looking forward to a sausage pizza. Next time I'll be more careful. The waiter was apologetic."}
{"text":"Food is great but the only problem is when you walk in it smells like a dirty dishwasher.  You definitely should not eat at the bar on the inside.  They have a dishwasher to clean glasses that smelled like vinegar or bleach while we were there trying to eat.  I told manager and we will see if the suggestion makes it up the managers chain of command.  Also their credit card system was not working so we had to pay cash.  They need the Revel System so they never have the problem.  We moved from bar and no smell in main restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't think there is anything wrong with the pizza -- it's just not for me.  There was a layer of sausage all the way through my pizza and I'm not a big sausage fan.  I should've known not to order it but everyone suggested it so part of this is my own fault... I hope to go back so I can amend this review as the location is great and the restaurant is very neat inside.  Hopefully I'll have a better experience next time.  If so, I'll definitely amend this post."}
{"text":"I relocated from the Chicago area about 19 years ago and used to live near a Lou Malnati's. I am THRILLED they have come to the valley!  Their Chicago-style deep dish pizza is second to none.  The sauce is on the sweeter side and the crust is delicious-never overdone.  It tastes the same as if I were back in the midwest.  

My husband and I ordered our pizza for take-out because of long waits.  It was just as good eaten at home!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place to open. My family is from Chicago and we all love deep dish pizza. I can understand long wait times as they're new and everyone wants to try it. We waited almost 2 hours and we pre ordered 2 pizzas. The pre order system they have is great. The dough was flavorless and tasted as if it had been stretched in the morning and maybe frozen. The sauce and cheese weren't very hot and lacked any seasoning. The ambience is fun and great for families. Hopefully they work out some kinks because they have tons of potential in their location."}
{"text":"The REAL DEAL Chicago Style Pizza served here is quite simply the Pizza of the God's!

Being from Chicago, I heard that Lou Malnatti's was now in the area and I drove 50 minutes to pick up two Large deep dish pizza's! Yep, it's that good! Lou's didn't disappoint! The pizza was just like it is in Chi town! 

If you love Pizza its an ABSOLUTE MUST TRY! The thick cheesy, saucy, buttery crusted goodness is absolutely overwhelming! 

ALL You cracker crust chicken with BBQ sauce \"Pizza\" weenies just wouldn't understand! However, If your a Lover of the finer things in life? Get some TODAY!"}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza that we have ordered for years was not the same. SAUCE WAS FLAT AND TASTELESS.  We want to come back and give it another try so hopefully this review will help the restaurant (that we have loved for many years)!"}
{"text":"I am honestly not sure what went wrong here. It was a weekday night our server had maybe 3-4 tables of up to 4 people each (I, myself have been a server before but no judgement) and yet we were waiting and waiting and waiting.. I think our server was purposely trying to bypass us out of anxiousness as I think our order was placed in a untimely manner or delayed? Our server seemed intimidated and I am not sure why we were a group of 3 women - a mother and two daughters. We went up to the front and told the hostess it's been an hour since we got here and its been 50 minutes since he took the order. She told us that the manager would come talk to us which we didn't care about because it was already late we just wanted to cancel and go sleep. An hour later and we have our SMALL GLUTEN-FREE PIZZA AND SMALL DEEP-DISH yielding two people. The only thing that came out in a timely manner was the combo appetizer platter (which was delicious). Our server managed to disappear yet again.. so I went up to the front to ask for a box and the hostess asked if the manager had spoken to us (which they didn't) I said no and she redirected me to sit and wait for my server (which wouldn't been find if he wasn't M.I.A.) eventually I got agitated and went to the kitchen door to receive to-go boxes from another waiter. The bill ended up being $50+ for something that took long, considering the small size and thin nature of one of the pizzas so I was wanting to just pay and leave. The manager never came, server never visited us and the food took to long for the price tag that followed with it - no discount, no apology. Our server seemed flustered (I understand everyone is different, different and I don't discriminate) had I not been a server myself I probably wouldn't have tipped him 15% off an already over priced meal with awkward ambiance. We actually have family back in Illinois so I will stick to my Lincolnwood  location from now on as well as Schamburg and Elk Grove Village. It's unfortunate because we really did try to love this place as we are fans from back home. It may be a while before I try to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely nailed it.  Happy for me because I love Lou's, happy for them because they will have sustained success here."}
{"text":"My son and I ate dinner here last night. While we know the pizza is what the restaurant is known for, we just weren't that hungry. We decided on the Bruschetta appetizer and to split the Italian Beef Sandwich. 

The Bruschetta is AMAZING!  We split it between 2 of us, but there were enough that it easily could've been shared by 3-4 people. The topping of diced tomato, a little balsamic, basil, garlic and shaved Parmesan cheese was fresh and had awesome flavor.  It may just be my main course next time!!

The beef sandwich was excellent with VERY generous portions of beef topped with melted Provolone on a French roll. It comes with Gardinare (sp?), and au jus, along with a side of curly fries. My son ate the fries and said that they were good. 

Our waiter was very nice, friendly and didn't hover. He did seem to be there when we needed him and was helpful about beer selections and food. 

As far as seating goes, I've witnessed long waits, however on a Wednesday evening at 5:00 pm we were able to walk in and be seated immediately.  The patio is really nice and it'll be great to come back and sit there during nice weather. 

All in all it was a nice dinner. Price wise, it was what I expected, so no surprises. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Long wait for mediocre pizza.  Service was excellent and wait staff was very attentive.  The group I was eating with found the pizza to be dry and the sauce rather tasteless. Perhaps one has to be from Chicago to crave this deep dish disappointment."}
{"text":"Great pizza, there were always many people in this place. My friend recommended me to have a try last week, and it was worthy."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent ambience. Pizza is delicious and their pasta is totally homemade. Portions are a bit large but worth it. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Went with some of my family on a whim. The service was great, all the servers were friendly. Ours was very attentive without being bothersome.

We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic (large) and the Lou (small).  My granddaughter had the spaghetti with marinara sauce from the kids menu. Everything was delicious! The crust on the Malnati was buttery and slighty crisp. Both pizzas tasted fresh with just the right amount of cheese. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great taste of home (Chicago) here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The pizza and the service are excelllent. I also bought a few frozen pizza's to take home and they cook up really nicely, as good as dining in. What a welcome addition to AZ!"}
{"text":"Came here while in town with family. It was a Saturday night and we got there just in time!! I've had the privilege of going to a Lou's in Chicago this past summer. This location did not disappoint!! Right after we were seated, people started waiting quite some time and lines started forming. 

We had a wonderful server. We ordered the calamari, bruschetta and 2 deep dishes. OMG!!! Loved the bruschetta!! My son and I shared a pie- half mushroom pep and half pep and basil and with butter crust- of course!! I think I like the crust more than the pizza. Not one bit soggy, breaks apart with a little nudge from the fork. We made sure to get a large enough pizza so we could take some home. My aunt and uncle did the same. 
It was a Saturday night and we got there just in time!!
 
The left overs were just as good as when they first came out. It did not get soggy in the microwave. We were too hungry to wait to hear it in the oven. Enjoyed another meal. 

Only down to the restaurant was the noise level. Sound bounced off walls, radio loud. We were lucky as we were the last booth against the wall. Didn't have as much sound traveling over us.  But believe me, that will not us from stop lying by the next time we are there!!!!

Or please- open one in the Bay Area in Cali!! (Monterey/Carmel preferably)!!!"}
{"text":"Real Chicago pizza finally available in phoenix---yes, the wait is long--but that is because they do things right--making the pizza to order.  For those who miss chicago pizza, this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I was skeptical about if they could pull off an Arizona location and make it taste the same. Well.......they did it.  Bravo!!!

The service was great. The atmosphere was open and airy. Things flowed smoothly and people constantly checked on the customers to make sure they were all taken care of while waiting. Met lots of nice people and fellow Chicagoans. The restaurant was very clean and tended to. 

We ordered deep dish style with sausage and spinach.  The pizza was juicy (not greasy) and the crust was so very tasty.  The meat was hearty and not salty like some to other places that claim to have \"Chicago style\" pizza. Everything tasted fresh. 

We Also had the key lime pie. I was not disappointed at all. 

Thank you. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My wife and I our son and his girlfriend attended the soft opening Friday night. I estimate we have been to Lou's probably 200 times in Chicago since 1972. We couldn't wait for the opening. It was great. I used to rate the pizza every timeless went. They did good Friday night. I gave it a 9.2 of 10. I took off .4 for a little liquid in the pan and  .4 for the crust being just a tad not browned enough. Had a Chicago Classic with mushrooms and the Malnati salad. I can only imagine what the lines will be when they open for real on Monday. They have gotten a lot of media attention."}
{"text":"Very good deep dish pizza if your looking for that Chicago feel, I heard the ph in the water is even balanced to that of chicagos. Great staff very friendly delivery service."}
{"text":"This pizza is to die for. I don't know how they make their crust but we have never been dissatisfied. 

I don't even have words. 

We have ordered delivery twice now. 

The pizza is not the cheapest but boy is it worth it. 

Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and service. Nice atmosphere.  Great for the family.  A little dark and loud inside, but nice patio outside.  You don't have to pick one. Lou Malnati's and Oreganos are both good!"}
{"text":"I think we found a new spot! After talking to our awesome server Eric, I discovered I've been to one of the Chicago locations. Delicious enough that I remember it a couple years later! We had the spinach bread and the Malnati's classic deep dish. Food was fantastic, service was excellent, restaurant was clean. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My buddy Craig H. from Chicago says you have to try Malnati's pizza I said is it anything like
 Spinato's that I don't like? The thick is really good and I stated I'm a thin guy but Oh you will like it
 So I ordered a 14\" thin to go ( Sunday 29th) at 5pm. At this time they were backed up till 6;30 already.
     I said  make it 7:30 and so I showed up 5 minutes before and as I walked toward the building,WHAT, it looked like a concert line with 60 people deep. I walked around the line and got my pizza and went home. I turned on my STL cards game I had taped earlier and enjoyed the 1st bite of many. Holy Sheeeet this pizza is rock star great! The flavor of all the ingredients is #1 and if you go tell them Billyray's  sent you. No doubt it will be my new favorite pizza joint in town. I'm for the most part I'm a pizza snob and the Phx area is not known for killer pizza spot.
  Some of my go to spots for kick azz flavor are about 3.  One is Pizzafarro's in Cave creek another Red Devil and the last is up in Prescott next St Michaels now this is my favorite it is call
 Genovese\"s WOW WOW and Mainati's you might just kick the door down.
      Malinati's thanks for coming to Phoenix!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Called at 7:28p on Thur....pizza delivered at 8:51p was cold, dry and over cooked. Fortunately manager made it right by comp'ing order but many options for pizza in this town."}
{"text":"I'm a Chicago area native now living in Phoenix Arizona. Always wanted to try Lou Malnati's ever since they opened here. The service was very good. The prices are reasonable. But the food! Makes me homesick for Chicago. The personal size pizzas are just perfect. I will be going back."}
{"text":"The thick pizza is delicious. I got the basil and garlic topping options which really added a lot of flavor. The server was excellent and we were told it would take 35 minutes and in exactly 35 minutes our pizza was delivered. Amazing! It was very busy there and I can see why. This pizza was different than I ever had, yet outstanding. I would recommend a visit here."}
{"text":"First time at Lou's, we were seated right away.  Our waitress was Erica, she asked if we had dined there before and finding we hadn't..she went thru the menu, with the favorites,  the ingredients,  recommended a few.  We chose the deep dish half pepperoni, half black olives,(one of us was a vegetarian) buttercrust....incredible!! We were told up front it would take about 40 mins since we were there in a Sunday at lunchtime, so we ordered the 3 cheese bread..also very good..the marinara sauce was excellent! Our glasses were never empty, Erica kept an eye on napkins and clean plates if needed. ..you have new regular customers! Our 30% tip hopefully expressed to Erica what a fine job she did."}
{"text":"There is no such thing as a bad pizza. This place got so much hype months before they opened the doors that I expected this pizza to blow my favorites away. Unfortunately, it was just overhyped. I tried both the thick and thin crust pies here on different occasions. It is very expensive and the way you wait and order is unusual. Both myself and another friend who went on his own agreed that the business model probably works well in Chicago, but in Phoenix, people are not willing to wait for food like that. We also agreed that the pizza just isn't that great. For me, I find the stewed tomatoes do not have the appeal or the texture of a great tomato sauce on a pizza that I would rather eat. I have seen plenty of great reviews for this place and I just don't get it."}
{"text":"We were in AZ for Cubs spring training and it was SO GOOD to have Lou Malnatis pizza here. The restaurant is at the end of a strip mall, but there is plenty of parking. The atmosphere is casual and fun, and the pizza is just like home. We have recently moved to SC and really miss deep dish pizza. So it was great to get our fix while we were here."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a buddy who is originally from Chicago.  I let him order and I was blown away.  We got the classic pie and everything was fresh, from the mozzarella to the diced tomatoes.  If you have room for dessert, get the cookie pie.  Great  time.  Our server Hannah was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out...medium Malnati Classic. It all tasted previously frozen, chewy crust, cheese wasn't melty, overall underwhelming and overpriced. With that being said, I think this is the kind of place to enjoy in the ambiance. Will definitely try dining in next time!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Chicago, I have only eaten \"Chicago style\" a couple of times. I'm no expert on the style but I can say this is some of the best pizza I've ever had whether it's true Chicago style or not. I got the Chicago classic (sausage, extra cheese, and butter crust) and it was spectacular. Our office is close by so I look forward to trying this place out for catering. The lunch menu was very reasonably priced and the food was delicious. The personal pizza is more than enough for one person but with pizza that good I didn't stop when I was full. I'd love to try the cookie pizza sometime, just don't know if I have the will power to save room for dessert.

Go, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We did go in last Saturday, October 1st.  There were 5 of us and we were seated immediately.  Dad and Mom really enjoyed the pizza and they also had the beef sandwich, which they loved.  My youngest sister had never been before and also, very much enjoyed.  I don't know the name of our server (she was from Lithuania I believe) was so great! She was friendly, remembered anything we asked for (extra napkins etc) and she and another gal at the end of our lunch, brought Dad a warm, ramekin filled chocolate dessert with whip cream and a candle and sang with us Happy Birthday to Dad.    It was just wonderful.  Thank you Malnati's for making his 81st birthday so special."}
{"text":"The pizza is out of this world! Definitely the taste of Chicago. Make sure to get the deep dish. Donny, (the native Chicagoan) was an excellent server. His energetic personality along with his attention to detail made for a spectacular night."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was good, but it did not blow my mind.  I don't see what all the hype is about.  The atmosphere is nice.  Also, expect to wait about an hour for the pizza.  Order appetizers and drinks to hold you over."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Just like you get at their restaurants in Chicago land. Full bar and great salads and apps too. Why are you still reading this? Get the car out. Go Go You can thank me later when you get home , saying\"oh that was the best deep dish I've ever tasted\"


Oh you're back.
Yes you're welcome."}
{"text":"Now I start this review with I am a New York City guy that's loves Nyc pizza to death. But to be number 1 you need a number 2 and beyond. This place brings Chicago pizza to number 2. It was so good. The cheese way gooey and yummy. The crust was buttery and light the way a crust is supposed to be. I can see why my friends said this was the place to go for real Chicago pizza. And the app plate was delish with fried cheese cubes were yummy and they don't skimp on the dips with real buttermilk ranch.

The owner was super nice and chatted up all the people waiting for tables. The wait was 20 mins but so worth it and they text you when your table is ready and even an app shows you your place in line. The waiter was super nice and the staff are very friendly and great with their tips on good food.

Overall a great place to have pizza and get your deep dish fix with. Also the back corner booth is great for people watching. You can see the whole place."}
{"text":"The decor is great and the concept is great. The service and staff were very patient and helpful. I'm taking 3 stars away because the food was sub par. The salad we had was something out of Frys, the dressing was so faint almost none flavored. The cheesy bread we ordered for 5 of us and they gave us 2 long uncut pieces we had to cut ourselves. The PIZZA now: we went with people who have eaten it several times and another person who is from Chicago...they all said with great disappointment that this is not the same Lou's they are familiar with in Chicago. The crust/cheese ratio was way off basically. Maybe to those who don't know what it's supposed to taste like it is great, but to those who know what it's supposed to be like its def not worth the 1.5 hour wait (2 weeks after opening by the way)."}
{"text":"Good pizza. The ravioli was also good. Our order of \"easy spinach\" could have been better distributed.  Friendly service & helpful host stand. The chocolate chip cookie pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"Don't go here if anyone in your party gets hangry.  Wait, wait, wait.. that's all we did.  Took just under an hour to get our pizza after we were seated.  We sat there with empty glasses as our waitress walked by multiple times.  The pizza....eventually...was good, but the service was slow and poor.  I doubt I will ever go back for sit down service.  I'll grab one and take it home.  At least the drinks at home are plentiful."}
{"text":"I love Chicago style pizza, both thick and thin but this was not for me. The butter crust left a lot to be desired. The atmosphere was A+ perfect. Maybe I ordered wrong"}
{"text":"Gotten pizza here quite a few times now but always for pick up because the place is always packed no matter what time of day it is! Love the deep dish pizzas with the buttercrust! Have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was aaaammmaaaaazzzziiiinnnngggg and the deep dish pizza was different but delicious"}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza comes to the valley...Just don't confuse the word \"authentic\" with the word \"good.\"  As you know, Phoenix has some of the greatest pizza places in the country, and this is clearly not one of them.

Being a fan of deep dish I was excited that we were finally getting an authentic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza restaurant, since I've been having withdrawals ever since I moved to Phoenix.  

The \"butter crust\" had way too many consistencies, from soft in the middle to the \"more stale than crisp\" edges. The cheese was ample and chewy, but bland, and the tomatoes you could tell were fresh....out of the metallic can that they tasted like.  The sausage was equally disappointing and bland, missing a lot of the spices that would make them \"Italian\" sausages.

My three co-workers had similar comments...

Oh, and one last thing...Speaking of \"Authentic,\" lets talk about the wall-sized historic photo of the Airport which is clearly titled \"SKY HARBOR AIRPORT, PHOENIX, AZ,\" but is actually a photo of a historic airfield in Glendale, California!!"}
{"text":"Nice little outdoor seating area with TV's for catching the  Our Server was awesome! She was quick to replenish our drinks as well as our napkins, plates and such."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! Chicago is one of my favorite cities and I was blown away. It felt like I was back in the windy city. Great Chicago Style Pizzle. :)"}
{"text":"Was disappointed in the pizza it was watery and not to flavorful tasted a little better a couple of nights later will try again hope it's better next time"}
{"text":"The service was amazing! So many people on staff constantly walking around and checking on tables. Pizza was just as good as being in Chicago! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great pizza make it how u want it . Thin crust thick crust simply delicious! I had thin crust sausage ,  tomato , gardenia and cheese really sorry to see the last PC disappear !! Oh so good ."}
{"text":"It's awesome best pizza I was also told by a friend that it's the closest thing to a Chicago deep dish and they filter there water from Lake Michigan Just for the pizza cool huh!!"}
{"text":"Not your regular style pizza, but what a treat. A thick cross section of Melty cheese, super fresh tomatoes, and seasoned meats (sausage is unreal). You may only eat one or two slices, but oh what a slice. Chicago style is a great change of pace pizza with a crispy buttery crust. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not pleased when I came back for the second time. Asked for a booth when I checked in and hostess wanted to put me outside in the heat. I told her I asked for a booth when checking in so she puts me at a high top. I've been working all day and wanted to take my girlfriend out for her birthday and they aren't concerned about what the customer requests. Just disappointed. Next time I'm taking it the pizza to-go."}
{"text":"Every bit as good as what you get in Chicago, plus an outdoor patio and several fine local craft beers.  Your pizza takes awhile to cook, just as it does in Chicago, but the service here is very attentive"}
{"text":"Best deep dish pie in the valley. Great atmosphere and nice service. not of that even matters because the pie is awesome. great tasting cheese and quality ingredients. get well done if your planning on doing a carry out. yum."}
{"text":"I came here with two buddies from work because we heard so much about it. Well, I think my buddies are going to be mad that I gave three stars because they were not pleased with the pizza. Objectively, it's not horrible, but it's just so overrated. I just don't get the hoopla, there's so many other better pizza joints in town. I think Spinatos is way better, personally."}
{"text":"The casserole at Malnati's is good but a bit heavy. If pizza had been invented in the Midwest this is what it would have looked like."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic pizza. We went with  9 friends. Sometimes with a large party the service is poor, but our waitress was very attentive. We tried several appetizers including the combo plate of batter fried mushrooms, zucchini, cheese curds and mozzarella sticks. We also tried the mild wings and the three cheese bread.  All were very good.  The combo plate was more along the mediocre chain restaurant style but the cheese bread was great. I had thin crust pizza and it was fantastic. I am not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but I did taste it and the deep dish was very good.  It does take about 40 minutes to get your order so probably not the best choice for younger children."}
{"text":"Say cheese.. Meat...and delicious buttery crust! I am so happy this famous pizza joint decided to bless Phoenix. Tip: order a size down. The portions are HUGE trust me when I say you'll be good on one slice."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza!  The sausage has a great taste.  Had not yet found great pizza in the Phoenix area, but this is as good as deep dish gets.  Definite place to try if you have not yet been.  I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"The proud Chicago-style pizza tradition continues in unlikely places, like Lou Malnati's Pizzeria.  With both indoor and outdoor seating, I was lucky to get a seat outside where I could still feel the air conditioning seeping out of the building.  

I ordered one of their deep dish specials, and although it says no substitutions, they have no problems with additions, so I was able to perfect their recipe by adding pepperoni.  And it had the classic deep dish qualities one wants: buttery crispy crust, plenty of melty cheese, roasted tomatoes instead of red sauce, and a balance of flavors.  I was impressed that it wasn't too bready (in quantity or quality), which is a common flaw among American deep dish pizzas.

Service was friendly and prompt, both at the front register and my table, so I couldn't imagine how anything could have been any better.  It was just a couple blocks off of the light rail too."}
{"text":"Our second time here and it didn't disappoint.  The portions were big and although my pizza wasn't as hot as I would have preferred, we'll still be going back.
My biggest recommendation is to arrive early if you're doing dinner on the weekend.  This place gets busy quickly and there is a line out the door."}
{"text":"So happy they moved into the neighborhood!  My husband, being from Chicago, is especially pleased.  We ordered the second day they were open on our way home from our son's game and they are already up and running smoothly.  And the pizzas were outstanding!  We got the Classic deep dish and an SMOG thin crust and both were delicious!  Just like my husband remembered!  We will be eating a lot more pizza than usual now that they are so close!"}
{"text":"Restaurant manager, Meghan, reached out to us in response to our initial, three-star review. Offered us a comp to come back for a second visit. I assured her that nothing about our average experience called for a refund, but I did glady accept her generous gesture with gratitude. 
  It's now been nearly a week since Meghan messaged me to let me know my \"credit\" was being sent to me by mail. Maybe Meghan's changed her mind, who knows? Whatever. 
  This morning, I returned to Lou Malnati's Yelp! site. Meghan's sent a few more form responses  to folks who've written lackluster reviews more recently than mine. Maybe she'll make good on those. As for me and mine, a dull and odd experience for us, start to finish. We're done here."}
{"text":"This is truly the best pizza I have ever had. The service was great. Our waitress was the best she always asked us if we needed anything and never left us waiting for anything!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant! The service is always great and the food is amazing! I HIGHLY recommend their buffalou wings & their deep dish Lou pizza."}
{"text":"A few odd things...
Why single restrooms for such a busy, larger restaurant. 1 mens can, 1 ladies. ??

We waited 38 minutes for a table, only to be seated at a table that was open and clean the ENTIRE time that we waited.  We saw many others open too, as we dined for almost 45 minutes, never to be sat, yet a long list of people waiting outside for tables.

Too many staff working at the various host stands, but few know what they are doing, or greet you, you juat stand and wait as they talk to the other staff members.  

Oh, and about the pizza-  it was good but not like best ever, gotta go back soon, and wait forever for no reason good."}
{"text":"The first time I was here, it was right after the opening so it was understandably hectic and the 2 hour wait for our meal was forgivable. 

The second time, we came after 9 and the restaurant was pretty empty and the time it took was more reasonable.

I felt the price was a little high for pizza that I didn't feel loved up to the hype."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. When I ate here had just eaten at the one in Chicago.  The Chicago location was far superior. In all honesty it was not worth the wait and hype. I will try it again to make sure."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!!

I've only tried deep dish pizza a couple of times in my life, & my husband wanted to try this place out. The small size is perfect for 2 people, and it was good!!! We ordered pepperoni and sausage deep dish. The sausage was a little bit too salty but that's my only complaint. I also ordered an individual house salad and that was also good portioned. Love the ambiance, and now that the weather is getting nicer it's the perfect spot to sit outside. Our server was very friendly too.. I wish I got her name! Great spot"}
{"text":"Great food, customer service, and ambiance! So happy to have a new favorite spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great traditional Chicago style pizza available in Phoenix. Don't mess with the thin crust nor the deep dish...get the The Malnati Chicago Classic! You can't go wrong with the butter crush, extra cheese, sausages and tomatoes"}
{"text":"I had a great cheese pizza here except I didn't really like the crust.You might like it though."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good! Or pizzas took 45 minutes and the server and manager both felt really bad so they gave us a free chocolate chip pizza and bruschetta. Cool place to eat! Honestly the pizza wasn't that impressive to me just pretty mediocre. Hence the 3 stars. And if it wouldn't have taken 45 minutes to come out it would've taken 30 which is still pretty long to me"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Lou Malnati's. I really wanted to love this place but the pizza didn't wow me like I had hoped. Maybe it was all the great reviews that set the high expectations. My overall experience was good though as the service we received was good.
I got there early around 4:30pm to put my name down for a party of 7. There was a line out the door but it was moving as the hostess takes down your name in the system so that you will get notified by text message on your phone. Then you can go place your order for the deep dish pizza since they take 30 minutes to cook. I was expecting a 1+ hour wait especially with a larger group but we were seated in about 45 minutes, not bad considering it was the 2nd week they were open. We were seated outside in the patio area but it was ok since the misters were on. The restaurant space is actually not very large.
We ordered a bruschetta appetizer and the combination platter. I liked the bruschetta,but the combo platter was average. Then our pizza came. Everything came out quickly especially with the pre-order of the pizzas. We got a Classic and a Lou as well as a small gluten free cheese to try. The deep dish pizza looked so good coming out but then I don't know what it was but I just didn't think it was that great. I want to say that maybe it's still the first few weeks and they are working out the kinks but other reviewers say it taste just like in Chicago. I don't know, I never had Lou's in Chicago but even my friend who did have it in Chicago seemed disappointed. 
DO NOT order the gluten free pizza! I know I know, why would I go to a deep dish pizza place and order gluten free pizza?!?!?! Well, I have friends that are gluten free and I'm always looking for places where we can go eat together and have more options for them to choose from other than salads. The gluten free pizza here was terrible. We didn't even finish one slice between the 7 of us. The crust was really hard. I've had good gluten free pizza so I know it's possible. 
The pizza cookie dessert was yummy and our server was attentive so overall the experience was good. I just wish the pizza impressed me more. I might come back again in a couple months after the crowds level out and try it again to see if I can update my review."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. 

Service sucked tonight. .The hour wait was fine and preorder option nice however, we were not offered appetizers salads or desert. 

The waitress was flown in to train new staff but needs training herself. So the pizza is a preorder while your waiting. We sit and I inquire about a salad the waitress tries to talk us out of when we insist we want a salad before our pizza she seems irritated. 

She dropped the check and we said we want dessert again felt like we irratated her but we got it and she forgot to print us a new check with the new total. 

I actually thought she was new and understanding. But, challenged my dinner partner and we asked if its been a busy week and when we found out she wasn't from here we were bothered by her horrible service.

Great pizza and welcome to Arizona get rid of this girl very bad impression for the business."}
{"text":"We came in for a soft opening preview - whose proceeds benefit a great local charity, Crysalis - and really enjoyed our meal on the patio. 

Our pizza wasn't served piping hot but it WAS delicious and like I remember from Chicago! It was served up to us by the runner. 

They have several local beers and a few cocktails, though we stuck to wine and waters. 

Our server Katia was friendly, sweet, knowledgable (including warning us that pizzas take 30 minutes and the cookie takes 10). 

I expect it'll get a whole lot busier when they officially open, but it was a super enjoyable patio meal with yummy food and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had been excited to try this place, having heard so many great things about their pizza and the long lines they had when they first opened.
When we arrived on a Wednesday around 8pm there was no line and it wasn't very busy.  
We came hungry and ordered a combination of their fried appetizers followed up with the deep dish cheese pizza. 
The appetizers were no different than would you should expect from any sports bar and the pizza wasnt much better.
I'm not sure  if it had been sitting for a while but the cheese wasn't hot and stretchy as we served ourselves a piece. It was slightly warmer than room temperature and was just meh.
Probably not going back considering the cost for a less than stellar pizza."}
{"text":"Took 18 young ladies from a soccer team for dinner with fantastic results. The staff was prepared and offered solid service. The food is very good and the atmosphere is clean and vintage. Our server, Dannie, did a great job with the group. Thank you."}
{"text":"0-2 Chicago. First portillo's, now this. Lou Malnati's, is not deep dish. It's just thick crust. The crust is tasteless, not oily or buttery. It's just like NY Sicilian. Portillo's is utter diarrhea and this place is just average. People from Chicago have no taste buds. Lou Malnati, what you just made is one of the most insanely average things I've ever eaten. At no point during my meal was it even close to be considered awesome. Everyone that has eaten there is now dumber because of it. I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul."}
{"text":"This place had been hyped up for so long...I was really excited to try it. It was an extremely disappointing experience. The crust was very bland and quite frankly so was the entire pizza. The bottom of the pizza was soggy and not crisp at all. The sauce was chunky and limited with no flavor. For a pizza that costs so much I expected better. There are a lot of wonderful local pizza places in Phoenix that offer a much better pizza at a better price."}
{"text":"Hands down best experience I have had dining out, very impressed with the way the present themselves. I know it's the first week and expected there to be at least a 1 hour wait. Our wait was 50 minutes and they time the pizza to go in 15 minutes prior to seating you so you only really sit for 20 minutes and the pizza arrived. What really impressed our family is as my wife and 3 kids were outside waiting I went to the bar to request a few waters, tea, and bread sticks because my wife in pregnant and needed something now. As I mentioned this to the bartender a few moments later the president of the company Mark came over and with 2 waters in his hand and walked me out to my family and provided the tea and the breadstick on the house. He conversed with us for about 5 minutes and also later on that evening as well as we were finishing dinner. Pizza goes without saying that its top notch!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was fantastic. I had the thin crust pizza with sausage and pepperoni and the flavors were phenomenal. Downsides are the waiting time for the pizza (40ish minutes-it's worth it) and it gets really loud in the back area. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service! Environment friendly but noisy. Went there today for lunch with family. We ordered three cheese garlic bread with marinara sauce for dipping. It really brought me back to the original Malnati locations in Chicago. Our sausage and onion pizza was tasty but too many onions. There was more crushed tomatoes on the pizza then I remember, a little sloppy but delicious."}
{"text":"I live in Utah but grew up in Chicago.  Every time I come to Phoenix I come to Lou's!  Best pizza around!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, OK service. Worth trying once, a little to thick for our taste. Pizza nachos are awesome!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly authentic pizza. The service was fairly slow and awful.  Our waitress made it quite clear that she was displeased that two of us were sharing one pizza and was MIA after we ordered and she realized we would not have a large bill.  Originally gave this place 4 stars until it took forever to pay our bill in an early empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Look, I know a lot of people love this pizza, however I was not impressed.  If this is a representation of what Chicago pizza tastes like then may I never eat in Chicago. t was actually the worst pizza I've ever had. There was zero flavor and it was draped in sauce. I feel like this pizza is over priced and over hyped. $30 for a medium pie is utterly ridiculous. Still, we wanted to try it and customers obviously pay for it. Michael, the manager, was pleasant and agreed to give me my money back. I was able to then give the pizza to a homeless couple that were very thankful and loved it."}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. 
Retro atmosphere. Great server. 
Can't say enough."}
{"text":"Redemption at its finest......

That's what I'm talking out.  Our first experience was completely different from the first time.  The last time I came, we waited for 2 hours, and this time we waited less than 5 minutes.  This time we stopped in on a Thursday night.  It was around 6:00 and we were seated pretty quickly.  The service was spot on this time.  Our waitress was Charlene, she was awesome!  She was attentive, friendly, and very accommodating  We had an idea what we wanted, but she recommended the Chicago classic, which we went with.  As my previous review stated, I've always been a huge fan of Lou's seriously some of the best deep dish pizza ever and in Phoenix, there is no contest. 

In conclusion, the wait times can get pretty long, especially on the weekends.  Its not a very huge place, but they do have a big area for the bar and outside.  I would recommend going during the week.  Overall, best deep dish pizza without a doubt.  The sausage and the cheese is a difference maker, your not gonna find anything even close in the Phoenix area.

Thanks Nicole!"}
{"text":"I called to place an order over the phone so I wouldn't have to wait long once my party arrived- so I was told. I placed my order at 5:30pm. We arrived at 7:05pm and had to wait outside for our table until 7:20pm. Once we were seated we figured we had already ordered almost two hours ago and our food should arrive \"shortly.\"  It didn't. We had 5 very hungry kids at our table. Our pizza didn't arrive until almost 820pm. I know it's a deep dish but 3 hours for a pizza is a little unheard of, right? It was very good- I will say that. We ordered the Lou special and a pepperoni/ sausage. Both were very good. The kids shared a small cheese and a gluten free sausage. They seemed to enjoy those as well. I would rate the restaurant a 4 star but I don't feel 3 hours for a pizza deserves 4 stars. I was a little dissatisfied with that part of it. What's the point of calling before hand if you're still having to wait 1.5 hrs more? :("}
{"text":"Without going in to too much detail,  we had some delivery issues with Lou's and the delivery was quite a bit late.  I called and spoke to the manager and he graciously comp'd our entire order without me asking. On top of that,  the delivery driver gave us two free frozen deep dish pizzas and was also very apologetic for the delay.     The food showed up piping hot and was as delicious as you'd expect from Lou Malnati's.   They made the best of a bad situation and were polite and professional throughout the entire ordeal. Thanks to Carl and the crew!"}
{"text":"I had the sausage pizza. We had to wait half an hour to be seated because it was so busy. I liked that when we first entered the restaurant, there were two greeters. The greeters made sure that we were checked-in and that we weren't there for pick-up or that we waited unnecessarily for some other reason. I'm not sure pre-ordering our pizza saved much time - it still took 30-40 minutes from when we were seated. The building was quite open to the outside so I wonder how they deal with monsoons when dust could blow into the restaurant from the outside through the large \"garage door\" near the bar. The pizza crust was quite sturdy and I had difficulty cutting through it. Chicago style deep dish pizza has the tomato sauce on the top, sandwiching the ingredients and cheese between the bottom crust.  The tomato sauce tasted like fresh canned tomatoes and it didn't taste like marinara sauce. There were a few large television monitors in the room playing a Cubs game. Overall a delicious example of real (Chicago style) deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"you are going to wait a long time when you come at least 1 hour before you get in and 30 min before you vet your food and that's if there not crazy busy is it worth the wait maybe to some people I didn't mind now for the food the. buffalo salads was the best I ever had spring lettuce crumbled blue cheese crispy chicken pieces and watermelon what the  it works together crazy the wings just bad soggy and they were cold the sauce had no heat or flavor good thing there blue cheese dressing is so good or I wouldn't be able to eat them now the pizza I am on the fence about it was good but not grate I think I was the dough it was crispy but had no flavor it was like salt less cracker even the deep dish the sauce was grate the cheese was good too it was the dough  they just open they need to tweak so things I'll come back in a few months so they can fix things"}
{"text":"Superior Pizza. Recently visited a competitor in Chicago... and THIS pizza is BY FAR superior. More flavor, tangy, fresh, savory DELISH. Instant family favorite. Worth the drive from the east valley- we will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Went here for my friends birthday and we had a larger party. It was a Saturday night and the wait to be seated was pretty average, around 50 minutes. We liked that you were able to put your pizza order in ahead of time so when you were seated they would start making it since the dish pizza takes a longer to cook. The service was excellent. We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I went early at opening to avoid a wait. What I found was a lunch special that was a steal. I got a personal size pepperoni pizza & salad that was out quickly & just my size. Also tried the bruschetta app & it was fresh ingredients & delish too. I would go again for lunch or dinner. I have to admit I'm not the easiest to please with cheesy cuisine specifically pizza but I truly enjoyed it. The crust while hearty was both crispy & chewy. The cheese was ooey gooey goodness & the sauce had robust flavor with chunks of tomato just the way I like it. I look forward to going back & trying the wings & the Chicago beef. YUM!"}
{"text":"Donny was amazing and the food was fantastic. Tastes just like Chicago. But seriously I can't rave enough about Donnys service. I talked to the manager and gave a her a compliment about his amazing service. He was honestly one of the best servers I have ever had. Very up beat and energetic. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Not great. The crust is closer to apple pie crust than pizza crust, which I find very un-pizza-like and weird. The ingredients are fresh and tasty but it's like eating stewed tomatoes and hunks of parmigiano cheese thrown together and heated up in a bowl. Also begs the question, is this really pizza? Can't see why it takes them at least half an hour to make except for the strange crust which I really didn't like. FYI the place is an extremely LOUD zoo!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and amazing service! We will be back again as soon as possible to enjoy another meal with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Normally I'm a thin crust lover but since their specialty is deep dish we ordered it.  Fabulous.  Great atmosphere at the bar and in the dining room."}
{"text":"After waiting a very long time for a taste of home, I was more than excited to hear this was opening in the Valley of the Sun. Finally made the pilgrimage to have lunch today and it more than exceeded my expectations. The sauce, tomatoes, filling, crust, all of it was off the charts. Our server gave us a little cool backstory on how they got their crust just right and had to use special water systems to imitate Chicago Water from Lake Michigan. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff and amazing food!!! On our way out, we decided to pickup a frozen pie to-go for later. They were having some trouble with their credit card machine and after a few failed attempts, the manager just smiled and said, This one's on us!!! Amazing service, blew my expectations away, we will continue to make the journey from East Mesa every time I want REAL PIZZA!!!!"}
{"text":"This is what I call GOOD PIZZA!!!!! If your in the mood for traditional or everything on it...this is your pizza place. The staff is great and the place is comfortable. Can't find a reason not to go. Also, if your like me and like your pizza HOT out of the oven....I repeat...this is your pizza place. Price is great too."}
{"text":"Went for my first time last night with my boyfriend and the food was fantastic! We had a deep dish and the appetizer platter which were both incredible. Our server, I think his name was fritz or fitz?, was awesome too. 

The rest of our service though was barely mediocre. We sat at the bar first since we were quoted a wait, and were there for only about 10 minutes until we were called to our table. During those 10 mins, the bartenders never acknowledged us, no smile, I'll be right with you, nothing. As we were leaving, there were a handful of hosts and servers standing at the host stand talking, and no one acknowledged us once again. No goodbyes or thank you's, and one clearly made eye contact with me. I'm not one to complain, at ALL, but we both work in the service industry and were just extremely surprised by this. It's food industry 101 and makes a huge difference in the taste in your mouth when you leave a restaurant. 

Food was fantastic though, and again, our server rocked it."}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes to pick up a pizza that I ordered online. Nothing more than a fake smile saying sorry about the wait. Welcome to Phoenix Lou, bad service is the norm in this town. It was good pizza however."}
{"text":"I haven't had a better deep dish pizza than good 'ol Lou Malnati's. I was introduced to their fabulous pizza back in 2013 when I was working in Chicago and had my first mouthwatering experience. Deep dish pizza is something I only treat myself to a few times a year, so I only go for the best.

Upon hearing that Lou's was coming to Phoenix, my excitement was off the charts. It's not exactly next door, but it's easy to rally friends or anyone from Chicago to come with. 

The butter crust really sets Lou's pizza apart. We usually get the two classic style pizzas (Malnati and the Lou) which you can't go wrong with. If I were to only get one pizza, I would do The Lou and add their sausage. For a vegetarian pizza The Lou is pure excellence. The combination appetizer was quite good too. 

I've found the staff to be very friendly and helpful at this location, and I really like the way they designed the place. If the weather is nice take advantage of the patio. Kids love the play area just outside the restaurant. It may not have the nostalgia that it does when you eat it in Chicago, but it's still delicious."}
{"text":"This Phoenix Lou Malnati's Pizza is easily the same as you would get in Chicago. I lived about a mile form the original restaurant on Lincoln Avenue. Our family ate there many times. The Pizza from the Phoenix location is equal in every way. Most probably because it is family owned and not franchised. This store even treats the water to duplicate Chicago water for consistency in the crust."}
{"text":"A lot of hype for Lou's and waited 40 minutes on a Tuesday night!  They allow patrons to order their pizza while waiting for a table to help speed up the wait process once seated. Nevertheless, once we were seated, it still took about another half an hour to receive our pizza.  We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic deep-dish pizza and a house salad. Overall, our meal was tasty! Though, the pizza crust almost tasted like a pie crust one would use for dessert--so, not my favorite.  Still, our bus boy and server were kind and gave us time to chit chat and answer questions despite how busy they were."}
{"text":"We love this place ! Highly recommend their famous malnati's salad and their thin crust pizza. We ate the deep dish but it was too much dough. We like to stick to the thin crust. I had been to the Malnati's in Chicago so I was super excited to see one pop up right in my own neighborhood. Love it!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I was thrilled after stumbling upon a Lou Malnati's in the Phoenix area. I was prepared for the food to pale in comparison to the Chicago locations, but I was wrong! Out Malnati classic was every bit as good here as in Chicago. If you've never had Lou's, head over as soon as you can!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They allow you to order ahead of time since the pizza takes a while to cook, so I ordered pizzas first (Classic and the Lou). Then waited almost an hour for a table. Then waited at the table another hour to finally get the pizzas. After all the wait, sadly, it was mediocre at best. The ingredients or dough taste like they may be frozen. Taste is poor due to bland sauce and seasoning. The crust was not crispy or airy, but more of a cracker-like texture. Immediately after I left the restaurant, I felt nausea and upset stomach. I'm from Arizona and have had far better deep dish pizzas in Arizona. It is hugely hyped being a big name restaurant from Chicago. The only positive thing I can say is that the design and atmosphere of the place is nice."}
{"text":"Only bad thing i can say is the time it takes to get a pizza but man is it delicious, if u dnt want to wait long get one of their pasta dishes superb stuff right there i promise you."}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza anywhere. Never thought I'd get good pizza in AZ. Thanks Lou's!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta hand it to em' best pizza out there! My fiancé and I love food & of course pizza and this was outstanding! It's easily in our top 5 and we travel often! Went on a Sunday evening and it was still very busy, we tried the trio of the dips with pizza chips & it was amazing! We haven't ever had anything quite like it! We shared a small pepperoni & sausage (love there sausage!) deep dish with butter crust and man was that delicious! We drove all the way from downtown chandler and can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Out of all of the reviews I have done this one has challenged me the most. 

Pros: 

the pizza. Duh. I actually like the thin better and the GF is tasty also!

They nail cheese big time. This means amazing cheese sticks, yummy curds and again, pizza. Probably the best cheese I have had in a moz stick or pizza.

The Salads do look amazing but I have not tried one yet ....

Cons:

Theare terrible with chicken anything. I know it's a pizza joint but I've tried the sandwich, might be the worst one I have ever had. I've had chicken pasta, like the sandwich the chicken was SO dry and I tried the wings tonight- soggy 

Also the service is super inconsistent also. I asked for a to go cup of water (I work next door) was told only employees could have to go cups. I'm here ordering almost 3-4 times a week, I work next door... really? 

When I call in an order half the time they are way off on when it will be ready. I get it is not an easy task but usually off by 10-15 minutes 

The menu says for the buffalo wings you can select two sauces. When I ordered them tonight, she insisted it is just one. Weird. I even showed her and she said it doesn't imply that ... see picture attached \"chicken wings...comes with your choice of two varieties\" then lists the 3 flavors ... smh 


Update: so being so close for work I have ate there maybe a dozen times since this last review. It's definitely a much better experience. I think the best thing on the menu is the bow tie pasta (add mushroom) 

If you are going for the first time, I recommend ordering a thin crust personal and thick crust personal both so can try both."}
{"text":"So excited that Lou Malnatis, my favorite Chicago pizza has come to Phoenix! Thick pizza is amazing. If you haven't tried it, try it. Don't compare it to Thin NY pizza, because they're different and both amazing. For NY pizza, I love pepperoni. But for Chicago pizza, sausage all the way. You get a single layer of sausage, so every bite has sausage. It's so good. 

It's so thick that one slice will fill you up. You will use a knife and fork. You cannot hold it up and fold it in half. 

Their house salad is the perfect supplement to their pizza. Try them together. This location is in the plaza with Shake Shack and other food spots. The neon lights are so bright and inviting. There's a large eating area, and carry out is also available. However pizzas do take 30 min so call ahead of time."}
{"text":"We researched Chicago pizza in Phoenix and this one had great reviews. It did not disappoint. Crust was flaky and toppings are fresh. My son and I were both full after two slices."}
{"text":"This is as good as pizza gets!  My wife and I just travelled through Italy for 3 weeks and of course we had plenty of pizza; a lot of it really good.  But, honestly, we couldn't wait to get back and have Lou's!  There was nothing that came close.  Sorry Italy, Lou's wins!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is the pizza worth the wait, but their service is incredible. Came here after a day at the children's museum with 4 hungry kids 2 are toddlers. Party of 7 all together. It was packed since it was Labor Day but we were seated within 15 minutes. Not bad! From the minute we walked in, everyone from the hostess to the bar tender to the waitress and bussers were extremely nice, attentive and courteous! Our waitress, (wish I would've caught her name) was amazing! She was also the bartender and did a great job! The kitchen forgot to put in one of our pizzas (it was busy and we are all human) and the waitress came to our table was honest and we still wanted the pie but got it to go. No charge! 
Some of the food we got were the wings (delicious) the thin crust pepperoni (for the kids) also delicious! The pepperoni deep dish was amazing! I got the Lou's classic which even after i brought it home and want it up, it was super delicious!  My first experience was amazing and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Chicago style pizza however this pizza is fantastic.  Very cool restaurant and great service."}
{"text":"First time visitor and the place was hopping busy on a Saturday night.  30 minute wait.  
We had the cheese deep dish pizza and mozzarella sticks.  Mozzarella sticks were greaseless (that's a good thing) and  the marinara sauce that came with it was really good--not those sweet marinaras which I dislike.  The pizza came piping hot and was quite good.
We had a mix up with our order and Raul, one of the managers, gave us excellent customer service.  Knowing that the manager is so hands on and responsive, makes me want to come back.  The pizza of course was well prepared and tasty."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here since it opened and bit the bullet on the one hour wait time, figuring that wasn't going to change anytime soon. 

Went on a Friday at about 6:30 and waited just over an hour. You can't make reservations or call ahead, but when you arrive, they'll take your pizza order so that can get started and text you when your table is ready. You'll still have to wait a while at the table, but it's a while less. 

Pizza was tasty, but none of us thought it was worth an hour wait. The garlic bread was very good also. 

The bathrooms were odd. We saw several people waiting outside them, because they are single bathrooms, two for women and two for men. But that wasn't obvious in the hallway, because unless you walked all the way down, you wouldn't see it went \"W\", \"M\", \"W\" and then \"M\" - felt like you were going somewhere you shouldn't (like the office)."}
{"text":"I love Lou Malnati's pizza! Being from the Chicagoland area Malnatis is one of the those hometown favorites that you miss when you move away. My husband and I arrived on a Thursday afternoon about 4:45pm and the place was nearly packed.  Our server was Carlos and he was awesome. Very attentive and super friendly despite the crowd. We ordered a thin crust pizza. I know, thin crust and not the Chicago deep dish? I'm a thin crust girl but we did order a deep dish carry out for our daughter and she devoured it in minutes and she's a Gino's East fan! So her actions speak louder than any words I can write. But our pizza was just as delicious! I'm already planning our return. Thank you Lou M for bringing this to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my 24th birthday here and was beyond happy with my choice. As Chicago natives my family was hesitant to try the pizza restaurant in Phoenix but we were absolutely blown away. From the service to the food, everything was perfect. 

Our server Andrea was amazing, always refilling the drinks of my perpetually thirsty family. The deep dish pizza is authentic as they come! We also found a new favorite, the Malnati salad. The sweet vinaigrette is delicious. 

I am so happy we spent our evening here."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. We went the first week it was opened... service was poor. The wait was close to 2 hours. The pizza was extremely mediocre. It may be Chicago's best, but it is definitely one of Arizona's worst. 

If you want amazing deep dish, hit up Vito's in central Phoenix. It puts this place to shame."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to try Lou's in Chicago.  I was SO excited that one opened up in PHX near my house!!!!!!!!!!!  BEST PIZZA ON THIS PLANET.  I like the Lou ;-)"}
{"text":"I love the butter crust. The deep dish is what I was raised on in the Chicagoland area. I miss the wine press in the entrance of the one in Elk Grove. The atmosphere at this location is bright and casual.  We had the deep dish sausage peperoni.  The crust is the authentic butter crust that is crunchy and rich in flavor. The sausage is chuncky and quite delicious. The peperoni is peperoni (not a lot to say there). There is heavy tomato sauce over the top of all. For me this is a great thing. There sauce is one of my favorites. (could be San Marzanos, but not sure) The house cabernet was reasonably priced and held up to the pizza just fine. The food and service were perfect. The atmosphere could stand to be more intimate.  The pricing seemed appropriate. If eating there for the first time, the deep dish really is their signature meal. This pizza re-heats very well. Don't be afraid to take some home."}
{"text":"Went to Lou Malnati's today for lunch and dined-in, so I am updating my review. We got to the restaurant around 11:30a and we were promptly seated. We had a crustless cheese pizza and it was amazing! The service was great and there wasn't really anything that I could say needed improvement. Didn't notice any difference in quality of food versus a Lou's in Chicagoland.  Today was a night and day experience from my initial review."}
{"text":"We ate here several times already since they've opened and we love them! Nice to live so close to such a great pizza place! If you come here super hungry the meat lovers will do the trick"}
{"text":"Good food. Had the Bbq wings to start really liked the Gorgonzola dressing with them. Wife had sausage pasta and I had a deep dish pizza. If we make it back to Phoenix we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Chicago-style pizza in the valley. We order from here all the time and have never been disappointed. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came to Lou's with my mom around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon. We gave our name to the hostess to reserve a table, who informed us there was about a 20-25 minute wait to be seated, then headed over to another hostess stand to pre-order our pizza. We ordered a large \"half Lou's and half Classic\" and continued to wait. There were only a few chairs to sit on in the waiting area (aside from the bar, which was full), so I was a bit upset that my mother and my husband who had worked on his feet all day, had nowhere to sit while we waited. Thankfully, the wait was only about 15 minutes to get a table and we were ushered in to a lively but slightly dark dining room area and seated in a booth. Our server was Donnie, and he immediately made us feel welcome and relaxed. He had a great personality that lasted throughout our meal. We ordered a house salad and while we originally going to order the family salad, our server suggested that we order 2 individual salads as it would save a bit of money. Unless the pricing on the website is incorrect, it's actually cheaper to order the family salad vs. two smaller salads but perhaps this was an oversight by our server. In any case, the salad was just so-so and we anxiously awaited our main course. The pizza arrived and it was excellent. I as expecting a bit more flavor and flakiness of the \"garlic buttercrust\" we had ordered; not tasting a hint of garlic or butter in the crust but the toppings were excellent and the sauce was fresh, flavorful and there was plenty of it. Between the three of us, we ate 2 slices each and had 2 slices to take home. By the time we left the restaurant at 6pm, the front lobby was jam packed with people waiting to be called for their table. Overall, the pizza was very good and we will definitely be back when craving deep dish, the service was great but we could have done without the TVs in the dining room and a bit more light."}
{"text":"Finally a real taste of home!! I was a little worried that they would ruin my taste buds causing me to crave real chi-town deep dish even more. I have to say they nailed it!! If you are a true Chicago deep dish fan you have to make it here!! Guess I'll save a few extra bucks on air fare now lol.

{"text":"I love pizza and I have been craving good deep dish for a while. However, it is hard to come by in Phoenix; so imagine my excitement when I learned about the Lou Malnati grand opening. I continued to scope it out for weeks! \"Open...open...open!\"

My boyfriend and I ordered takeout to avoid the Friday night crowd, wrapping around the building. We ordered online one medium \"the Lou.\" The online system was user-friendly. Despite taking two hours, we were impressed with the accuracy of the slated pick up time. 

On one hand, the sauce, cheese, and toppings (spinach/mushrooms/tomato) tasted deliciously and seemed fresh, BUT the crust was beyond bland and artificial in flavor and texture!  I was disappointed since this was the main point of ordering deep dish pizza and so my craving continues unfulfilled. I'm not even sure if it's worthwhile to see if the taste improves by dining in the restaurant. 

After a bad meal, there are two things you can't get back: your money and appetite."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 1 star because of the horrible service we had. Do NOT get Laura as your server. No personality. And she acts like it is an inconvenience to serve you. 

Also, the name takers got our table request wrong, causing us to wait even longer. And the girl who delivered our pizza set it down on one of our cell phones. 

The bar staff are the absolute slowest people on the planet. Watch them, they move like snails. 

The crust is bland. There is no sauce.  And the fresh ingredients leave the pizza watery on top. 

So if you want to wait 2 hours for this service you won't  see me there."}
{"text":"Super original Chicago pan pizza. I highly recommend it. The pasta however was average. The pizza is worth the wait and/or drive. Try to order the pizza ahead of time and then pick it up if you live close by. We ended up waiting an hour and 45 minutes to be seated and then once you order it takes 40 minutes for the pizza to cook. If I lived closer I would just order it to go and pick it up. I will be back."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad just had Lou malinatis in Chicago over Easter weekend had the exact same thing the the Lou salad and the Lou's pizza did not even compare ! pizza was watery and runny the tomatoes were thrown on top ! the salad leaves were old I will never go here again stay away from the Phoenix area Lou Malinatis  no wonder why they were not busy on a Friday night ... pure disappointment"}
{"text":"Love the ease of the Lou Malnati's app for ordering from home. Their pizza is the best. Fresh, simple, and yummy. Even simple cheese deep dish is delicious."}
{"text":"Had a medium deep dish with butter crust, delivered. It came piping hot, uncut per our order. Cheese undetectable. Sauce OK, mushroom, olives, basil: barely there. The garlic must have been cut from a greening clove. Bitter. Uncooked. Not worth the $$$. 
What worked for it: not overladen with cheese.

I Don't understand the big deal. I've had deep dish in Chicago. With Malnati's owning so many restaurants now--this is a restaurant- industrial pizza."}
{"text":"My friend and I made an order online for pick up. We got a medium deep dish pizza with regular crust, basil, tomatoes and pepperoni. The place looked really cool and hipster inside. We told them about our order, paid and then waited a couple minutes for our pizza and come out. 

It took us a while to get back to my friends place. The pizza was still warm, but the cheese suffered. It wasn't stringy or melted at all. I liked all the toppings. It's just the crust was lacking. It just seemed like bread. It wasn't crispy or crunchy. It was just like table bread. There were options when ordering online for what crust you wanted. I expected the regular crust to be a least a little crunchy, but it wasn't at all. If we eat here again we're totally getting the super crispy crust."}
{"text":"I was very impress with my pizza, My 1st deep dish pizza, I can understand why the lines are long on the weekends, its worth it to me!!! Very good and very thick.."}
{"text":"I am so excited this is here! Best pizza hands down and I don't have to wait for a trip to Chicago to enjoy it. Chicago Classic is the way to go and the spinach garlic bread is delicious! There will always be a wait but you can get a half baked pizza and take it home to cook it. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first deep dish pizza experience and it was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that it was not too cheesy and the crust wasn't too thick. I would go back again for more!"}
{"text":"Average! I've been wanting to go to Chicago just to try Lou Malnati's! I'm not a deep dish connoisseur but have eaten at Masa in LA and Uno enough to know what I like and don't like in a deep dish pizza.

I thought the crust of the Original at Malnati's was too hard! Even though it was called butter crust, it was flaky or buttery, just too crunchy! To be honest I thought it tasted better as left overs because some of the crunch was gone and I could taste the buttery crust better. 

I got the original which comes with extra cheese, sausage and sauce.  The sauce was amazing...next time I'll order it with extra sauce. There was a lot of cheese but not too much which I was happy about.

The overall ambience at the establishment was great. I loved the outdoor seating and the misters in the almost summer heat were wonderful.

I would DEFINITELY recommend getting the Malnati's salad. Everyone in my party LOVED it, and if I ever came back here again I might just order a salad and eat that instead of the pizza.

We came at 5:45 and were seated immediately. This alone was worth coming to the Phoenix location! I'd go again, but this wasn't my favorite deep dish I've ever had."}
{"text":"What a great place.  I have been here a few times.  This place is really good. 

I know it can take up 45 minutes.  
I know it is thick.
I know it is not thin crust. 
Blah blah blah. 
Now that should appease all of the cry babies.  

Now on to the review.  We put a order in for our pizza on Saturday night.  We got there and were seated with in a few minutes.  The server did a good job.  I ordered the soup they have there.  It was good as always.  Our pizza came out and it was good.  A Lou classic add pepperoni.   It was the bomb.  My better half ordered a cookie thing with ice cream. She said it was good.  

We understand that the pizza takes time.  We do something that 94 percent of the people at the restaurants do not do while at the table.  We have a conversation about our day and week."}
{"text":"Tried my first Malnati's pizza last night and while I still prefer thin NYC pizza, this pizza was amazing. We ordered a small deep dish and a medium thin crust so we could compare. Both are good, but I think we will stick to the deep dish from now one and get our thin crust elsewhere. The Malnati's salad was very good and enough for 3 people. The manager(?) spoke to us and really seemed interested in our business. Staff was great. As this location is on my way home from work, I see using the grab and go frozen pies and ready to eat salads in my future."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicago style deep dish pizza. Great customer service here! I'm not a big fan of sausage but their sausage deep dish pizza is just great! If you're going on a busy day and you're starving just make sure to order your pizza ahead of time! :)"}
{"text":"I'm a Chicago Native and if it weren't 120 degrees outside you may think you're in Chicago at Lou's.  Same great food that I remember from Chicago.

Sam was our bartender, very helpful and personable."}
{"text":"I cannot thank this location enough for their spectacular service. Sunday was the day of my fitness show that I've been training for since February. So needless to say I was on an extremely tight regimen. All I could think about after show was having some GOOD pizza, and through many recommendations Lou Malnati's was said to be the best place in town! So I waited very patiently for 3 months to have their pizza. Unfortunately though when I called on Sunday to make an order for pick up it was are 20 min out from their closing time and my show still had about 30 more min to go. I thought well I guess I'll have to wait to get the pizza some other time. SIKE!!!! The Arcadia location was SO WONDERFUL they stayed late to make sure I received my first meal after show properly and supplied me with additional goodies. How awesome is that!? And on top of that THE PIZZA WAS AMMMMAZZZINGGG. So perfect I think I had tears in my eyes lol. I will 100% be back and I will 150% recommend this to anyone who is in the neighborhood. THANK YOU SO MUCH and a very special thank you to the gentleman who stayed late, I believe his name was Kevin? But I could be wrong, look at the schedule and see exactly who it was to give this man credit! PLEASE!!!THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOUUUUU!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago pizza in Illinois and now the best in the West! Malnati's deep dish pizza is one of the things that make me homesick for Chicago. But, now I can get it in Phoenix - delivered! I LOVE that fresh mozzarella cheese."}
{"text":"Extra star for great customer service on delivery. My first order was the Lou to my gated property near Park Central. Got a call during my scheduled delivery time that they were running a few minutes late. That takes dedication to stop your busy production to give heads up to the customer. Great pizza without a ton of salt. Get acquainted with your taste buds again and taste the flavors of natural ingredients."}
{"text":"First time and definitely will not be my last I just wish I had gone with more people so that I could've tried more stuff."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I guess I was part of the hype train. I enjoy deep dish pizza. I had heard that this was one of the better joints in Chicago so I was excited. I tried to order last week but was told they were not accepting delivery or carry out orders anymore.

Ordered online and the delivery was right on time. Ordered it uncut (per their recommendation).  The first thing I noticed was how watery the pizza was. It took about 5 sheets of paper towel to dab over the pizza and it was still soggy. Then my 2nd bite was into a chunk of bone, almost chipped my tooth.

From there it was just a rather bland tasting pizza. 

Maybe my experience would have been better for dine in but the pizza that was delivered was a big fail... I think I'll stick to Oreganos"}
{"text":"Lou's management emailed me and hooked me up because of my last review..  I wasn't looking for handouts, nor have I ever took one before on yelp even though they were offered.   But this is Lou's we are talking about.  Was the best pizza I ever tasted in my life when I ate it in Chicago.   And this Phoenix version didn't disappoint.    

Ordered ahead, got the Lou.  Was a great great great pizza.   Lou Malnati's is still the best pizza I ever ate...   Hands down."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...this place is amazing! The pizza taste exactly like it does in Chicago! When you think Chicago Pizza this should be the first place that comes to your mind.  They import all of their sausage from Chicago, cheese from Wisconsin and use the same suppliers that they do in Chicago. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad which was very fresh and tasty! The use a balsamic vinaigrette that is perfect!  We also tried the cheesy spinach bread which was the same bread dough as the pizza buttercrust. We ordered the Malanati's Chicago Classic pan pizza which is good ol' fashioned fresh Chicago Italian sausage layered between fresh cheese and vine ripe tomato sauce! Excellence in a pan!"}
{"text":"Chicago's best right here in AZ??? I read up on the reviews and ordered accordingly. You have to get the combination appetizer and their original classic pizza. It was fantastic! I ate until it hurt! Great service and great atmosphere! We got there at 11:08 and were seated right away. It got busy quick so get there early!!!!! Fantastic pizza!"}
{"text":"Refuses to change channel and accommodate for customers despite preference. Lazily states \"can't change it because preset from the morning\" clearly in an effort to not deal with it. D2 college football game is on ESPN news, asked to change to ABC to watch Louisville vs. Clemson, no response and doesn't care. This is sitting at the bar not in the restaurant. Also, there is a ridiculous fan that is blowing constantly that allegedly \"cannot be turned off.\" Bottom line is that there is no flexibility to adjust for customer preference. Can't respect that."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. Bruschetta appetizer was not memorable. We got the Malnati Chicago Classic, at the waiter's suggestion. The sauce and crust was bland. I had some sort of bourbon cocktail that was both delicious and strong. But the pizza was such a bummer."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times before. Always great service, amazing food and wait times are never bad. Tonight, the printers were down and they were having a horrible night. We sat out on the patio and watched the whole thing unfold. My sister, my boyfriend and I watched other tables complain and the manager going around to apologize. As a server myself, I can say our server did everything he could. He kept drinks full, took orders as fast as he could and kept tables informed of what was going on. Yes, their food was taking a long time. The poor guy was doing everything he could, yelling at him wasn't helping anything. Our server was so nice and took great care of us, especially given the circumstances. The manager was very polite and offering to buy entire families meals and buying them drinks while they wait. Our food was amazing as always. The table next to us spoke to us laughing about how they hadn't gotten food yet.. I told them how great everything always was and that this is an off night. I told them the food is worth it and to give it another shot. Good job handling things the best you could! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large Chicago Classic with Butter Crust for Delivery.  Not only was it absolutely phenomenal and most definitely enjoyed by all who sampled it, it was delivered during the time window that was promised.  Patience is a virtue when ordering deep dish.  I'm glad they delivered to South Scottsdale as I'm about 4.5-5 miles from the Arcadia Take Out location! Exceptionally good Pie and fairly priced for what you receive!  Very Special and I've yet to find any competitors that can duplicate the taste and quality of Lou's."}
{"text":"After Marc sent me the nicest email and we both determined it was just a misunderstanding on both our parts I have to say, what a gentleman. Thanks for proving me wrong Marc!"}
{"text":"Lou's is definitely one the best type of Chicago Style pizza in the valley. The service is always wonder, either when you dine in or take out. Which I will say, when ever I do get take out, Tyler is usually the one who handles that order and always makes sure our order is right and provides the best service. The pizza is always amazing. From the Lou to a Chicago Classic, even a standard pepperoni, the deep dish is always so delicious. I recommend Lou's to everyone."}
{"text":"Just as good as when I had it in Chicago. Staff kept me updated on my wait time and the manager Karl chatted with me as I waited. It's nice to see a Chicago restaurant in Phoenix. While it may not be the cheapest pizza in town, the quality is better than the rest."}
{"text":"Lou's is definitely the best. We had to try the new guy in town (Giordano's).  We are from Chicago and Lou's taste like Chicago's did.  Giordano's is a lesser version of it's original."}
{"text":"My colleague chose this restaurant for her birthday lunch.  We had a group of 8-- we expected to have to wait a bit but actually waited an hour before our food arrived.  We purposely arrived at about 11:30 to avoid a rush and were one of only a few people in the restaurant.  When we kept asking when the food would arrive the server kept saying that is was \"just about up.\"  

I ordered a personal deep dish pizza for one, but was charged for a small pizza for two, about a $8-9 difference.  My colleague whose birthday we were celebrating was asked if she wanted a complimentary dessert, which she accepted to go. It took forever to arrive and then she was charged for the dessert on her bill.  

I have had many many deep dish pizzas--- and was actually excited to try this place as I have spent many wonderful times in Chicago pizza joints. My pizza was not very good-- not flavorful and even though I ordered the cheese and sausage variety, I could not find any sausage on the pizza at all.  

Trying to get our checks cashed out was a never ending process....even though the server knew that we needed to get going.

Not a good experience.....I will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza, but it can be a hassle to get! Expect long wait times on the weekend, hopefully that'll ease up. I suggest buying it half baked and finishing at home, that's what we like to do. It's easier for us. This is Chicago style, it is deep dish. After so many faux-Chicago style places in the Valley, I appreciate this popping up here."}
{"text":"Never really a big fan of deep dish pizza until I tried Lou Malnati's deep dish with the butter crust.  Great food and excellent service.  We'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Disappointment, is the first thing that comes to mind.  You walk in and its promising, with the new decor location and layout. We sat at the bar since I like more of the atmosphere there.  First we ordered the wings which only come in choice of 2 sauces hot and bbq.  It would be fine if it was a their specialty, but we could tell it is not.  The hot sauce has a touch of sweet that throws off the whole flavor and it doesn't work.  On to the pizza, we ordered 2 different kinds, so we could share and try both.  The pizza looked like a kids pizza size and it took 35 mins to make, very unrealistic based on the proportions of the pizza and the wait time to make.  The pizza it self did not feel or tasted like a pizza its consistency was more like a pot pie.  There lots of dough with little tasteless ingredients in the middle.  I had the real thing back in Chicago, that felt, smelled, was served in the actual deep dish that was made in, but more importantly it tasted like real Pizza.  This is a commercialized cheap version of it.  Don't believe the hype.  One day soon there will be a real Deep dish Pizza here in Phoenix; unfortunately Malnati's is not it!"}
{"text":"Long long longgggg wait......we were told about the wait when we arrived but decided to stay not realizing we would be waiting in a tiny bar area crowded with all the other peeps.   The pizza was amazing, however, I don't think it was worth waiting (uncomfortably) for almost 2 hours."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time in and I would say it was only fair. The crust was dry and not buttery or flakey. We prefer pizzeria Uno which is far superior. This was a disappointment for us."}

{"text":"I've been a customer of Malnati's since it opened in Lincolnwood circa 1971? My stepfather was a liquor salesman and one of his accounts was this building, he had the business in that place before it was Malnati's too. So I remember Lou from the first month he was open and I was a kid in 8th grade. Nuff said.

I love their pizzas. Everytime I go to Chicago we ALWAYS get Malnati delivery. 

They have carry-out frozen pizzas (10\"); sausage, cheese, pepperoni and two others for sale right inside the front door on the left in a tall freezer case, just grab what you want and pay for them right at the counter just inside from the front door, doesn't get much easier than that.

These frozen pizzas are simple to cook: preheat the oven to 425, remove the cardboard top from the frozen pizza pan, remove the frozen pizza, wipe the pan dry and spray the inside with any kind of lite oil, replace and stick it in the oven for 40 minutes.

Remove the pizza, use a scissors to make several vertical cuts in the side of the aluminum baking pan so you can slide the pizza out onto your own pizza pan for slicing.

This is without a doubt the best frozen pizza in this country. I buy them three at a time, it costs me about $45 for three to carry out. I have a styrofoam box I carry them home in since I live like 35 miles from this place.

It's in the strip mall at the north-east corner of Camelback at Central, way back in the corner of the mall. Look for the ice cream place next door. The place is hard to see from the parking lot, but it's there. The mall is right across the street from a tall bronze and black colored office building about ten stories tall, let that be your landmark to watch for. Turn into the mall at the traffic light on Cameback at 1st Street. 

My only complaint about this place is the employees can be lacking in motivation sometimes. If I could I would give Malnati's in Phoenix 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Okay, like everybody in Phoenix, I am from Chicago and Lou's has always been one of my favorite deep dish pizzas. I wanted to wait a while before I tried the new location, let alone write a review.
My sister had ordered a deep dish for take out a few months ago. We were pretty disappointed at the cheese to crust ratio and lack of overall flavor.
This weekend, we were meeting some friends for pizza and they suggested Lou's. I was willing to give it another shot and I am glad I did!
Deep dish was very good. Crust was thinner and flakier. Plenty of gooey cheese and the sausage was awesome! 
Now, was this an exact replica of Lou's in Chicago? Nope. However, they are getting much closer than before. I would say they are 75-80%. Will it ever taste as good as ordering in Chicago? May be not, but I am very happy with the progression so far.
BTW - we did order a thin crust also, which has never been my go to for Chicago thin, but was a good pizza overall. It is not really a traditional thin Chicago pie (they don't even cut it into squares) yet, with the right combo, it can hit the mark."}
{"text":"In a town that has world class thin crust pizza, I was excited to try what I am told is one of the great authentic Chicago deep dish places. I don't eat pizza all that often, so it needs to be special if I'm going to indulge. Malnati's does not make the cut. It was fine, tasty enough. But not even close to being in the same league as Pizzeria Bianco or Cibo, or even the modest Pino's. And there's the long wait. I'll let others wait. I'll spend my time and money on better pies."}
{"text":"Just terrible. Soggy pizza, which I have never tasted  in my life since, never. My roommate ordered the super deep dish pizza they are known for, bruschetta, and a salad. $60+ for all this mind you for 4 people. Called in earlier in the day for ample time and when came in, hadn't even started the order. Sat and waited, waited some more. Was told this and that by staff/owner why there was a delay, which ultimately set the bar. And failed. Will not be coming back do to lack of staff/owner sensitivity and less than par food. Shame on you for trying to sell the hype"}
{"text":"So glad Lou's opened in Phoenix! Great Spinach and Cheese stuffed bread for the appetizer. This is a first for me. Excellent, excellent, excellent start to the meal!!! We shared a Medium Chicago Pepperoni Pizza. Pairing this with the bread, we had over half of pizza to take home. Cool atmosphere and good service. A quality experience to have a lunch (or dinner)."}
{"text":"When the place first opened, the lines were up to two hours.  Now they have a second location in Arizona and are comparable with all the best pizzerias.  Arizona is the pizza capital of the US.  The place is true to its Chicago origins and the salads and deep dish are incredibly good and unique.  We did half meaty Chicago classic and the spinach and tomato Malnati.  One slice and you're about full.  Great upscale, environment too in the Uptown plaza shopping center."}
{"text":"Great pizza. What more can you say. Friendly staff and so glad to have this pizza close by. It was hot and perfect by the time we got it home. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Wow !!!! What's the fuss about !!!!!!????? First time here today and total disappointment !!! Sat down immediately. Was greeted by our waitress immediately. But here's the problem we ordered a deep dish pizza and a salad. Waited a good 45 mins for our food !!!!!!!! I wish our waitress would have told us deep dish pizza takes longer than usual. When our food arrived it was not worth waiting 45 mins for plus had a piece of hair in my slice eww !!!We didn't say anything just wanted to have lunch and leave. The pizza isn't as good as everyone raves about.  We're not from Chicago nor do we know much about Chicago pizza. I just know we Won't be back here."}
{"text":"The wait was long, as expected. But they text you when the table is ready.  The food was worth the hour wait. Donny C. was our server. He was helpful and friendly which added to the positive experience."}
{"text":"I am from the Chicago Suburbs and love me some deep dish. This place is great and the pizza tasted as I remembered it. The issue I have is the size of the restaurant and the fact that there are basically two waits you have to go through. It was misleading. First you have to wait outside for 30 minutes, then you get inside and they hostess takes your name down on a tablet and tells you there is another 45 minute wait.

Once we got a text that our table was ready I went up to the check in desk and was asked if we pre-ordered our pizza. Umm nooooo, nobody asked me so how would I have known to do that.

The inside dining room is very small. Like tiny. The pizza tasted great and if thats all that matters then its a 5 stars, but the surrounding issues should make some pause to re-plan for a day they can waste.

Overall it was a long day, but great food."}
{"text":"Still a very busy place. On a Saturday, before five, at the end of July, the wait was to be an hour, we were told. So, in light of that, the service deserves a five star review. Waitress, Mary, was always smiling and readily available. The support crew was on top of their jobs as well.

The reason for one star from me is that the pizza is a tasteless, blob of cheese on soggy thick crust. Four of us shared three small pizzas, the sausage, a cheese and the spinach and mushroom. They pretty much looked and tasted the same - like a tasteless blob.
I guess I am more of a thin crust fan. But really I am a fan of taste and that didn't exist here. Should have skipped the crowd and went across the street to Sauce."}
{"text":"Finally a good pizza place in Arizona!  I get the deep dish cheese with butter crust.  I tried the sausage my first visit as I love meat toppings, but I didn't care for it.  I guess the NY in me wants meatball, but that is not an option here.  Stick to the cheese as it packs a perfect slice.  Real pizza should always have the gooey cheese that keeps going and going.  Thank you Chicago for finally giving Arizona a deep dish pizza joint.

The waiters are friendly and it is fun to hear the excitement in the air of being at the restaurant.  You hear a lot of Chicago accents around you, but even us non-Illinois folks can appreciate a good pizza. 

Friendly tip: if you go between 4:30 and 7:30 the wait can be crazy so be prepared as tables move slowly as the pizza takes 35-45 minutes to bake."}
{"text":"We came to Lou Malnatis on a Saturday evening. It was very busy, which was expected, and we gladly waited. We were updated through an app what place we were in line, very good communication. We put our order in ahead of time, so that by the time we were sat, our food came to us very quickly. As soon as we dug in, my boyfriend dropped half his personal pizza on the floor. The kind workers of Lou Malnotis replaced his pizza, with an even bigger pizza so that it could come out to us as soon as possible. They went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. We are very thankful and will definitely be back! 
P.S. The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I will be back. We started with the Stuffed Spinach Bread and it was delicious. Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Next we had the Chicago Classic Deep Dish, YUM! This is fork and knife pizza! For dessert we had the Tiramisu. I recommend all 3 dishes. My husband, who normally does not eat deep dish pizza, loved it and agreed to come back."}
{"text":"Dry. That would be the key word. DRY AND MORE DRY.

Also, asked for uncut and when I traveled back to my home in Gilbert it was already cut. Really stinks because it was quite messy. Thanks guys.

First time. Maybe last time. Lived in Phoenix all my life and know of most places for pizza. Lous not in the top 15 yet. Give it more time? I understand the hype of a new place but this one didn't live up to anything."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed!!!  I was super excited that Arizona was getting a Lou Malnati's. I used to work at Lou Malnati's in the Chicagoland suburbs and have eaten there so many times.  I know they have good pizza.  The combination platter was ok. Not awesome.  The sausage and pepperoni pizza was bland and super watery. I asked the manager and she said the ingredients were from Chicago.  That must mean it's the people assembling the pizza aren't doing a good job.  I will not being going back to Lou Malnati's in Arizona...but I will in Chicago."}
{"text":"Very overrated! If you exclude the hype, several Valley pizzerias make better stuffed Chicago style pizza. My issue with their stuffed pizza is their lack of cheese. When you bite into a Chicago deep dish pizza, it has to be luscious and full of cheesy goodness. This pizza totally lacks that factor. It almost tastes like a quiche with red sauce on top. Everything is baked in. 

In some ways I can see why people prefer this style. It is not very greasy and it eats pretty clean both in terms of your plate and in terms of no ensuing heartburn that I usually receive after eating deep dish pizza. The crust is it's selling point. It it is flaky and can stand on it's own. Most Chicago deep dish, the crust is an afterthought. However, I really did miss that stuffed gooey cheese experience. I still prefer Vitos (in Glendale), Giordanos, Oreganos (stuffed pizza) and Rosatis (yeah the same one down the corner). 

What does receive recognition is their online ordering process. It is very organized, easy to use and you pay online before picking it up. The pizza was ready in 45 minutes and when I went to pick it up, it was pretty seamless. I didn't have to go wait at the bar for a bartender to cash me out and then another 10 minutes for them to bring it to me (Grimaldis)  For busy professionals and parents, this really makes picking up pizza a cinch!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, wait time for us wasn't terrible but before we got there and after  (2-3pm) there were tons of people waiting. Food was good, though we decided Chicago style pizza is not our favorite! One of those \"try it once\" places, though you might find you love it! Beware one slice is more like a piece of lasagna, you'll only need one or two!"}
{"text":"Went early.   5:30 on a Tuesday.  Place was empty.  Did get busy.   Ordered the app sampler with deep fried mozzarella, cheddar cubes zucchini and mushrooms.   Bit over fried.  Breading was Hard.  Couldn't stab with fork very easily.   Service was mediocre at best as our drinks were empty more than once and it was not busy.  Obviously you are coming here for the pizza right?  Well they bring it.  We ordered the Malnati Chicago classic which is sausage, extra cheese and butter crust.  They press ot the sausage so it is like a huge sausage patty that covers the whole pizza.  Sausage and extra cheese in every bite.  Now that does not suck.  Pizza comes out literally bubbling hot.  Oreganos was the \"go to\" pizza place...  now...  think I'm coming back here. Easily top 3 pizzas in AZ"}
{"text":"Lou malnati's (not Illuminati) is one of Chicago's famous deep dish pizza shops. We're lucky to have a location here in Phoenix on camelback and central. 

The wait was one hour on a Sunday night but I'm not going to take a star off for being popular. The front desk service was slow even just to be put on the wait list. Preorder either before you arrive or before you sit down, so your food gets on the table once you sit down. The pizza usually takes approximately 45mins from the time you place your order. Order your salads and appetizers at the table.

For appetizers, for got the calamari fritti. The breading was light and the sauce was salsa/tomato-like. Definitely different than any other calamari I've ever had. The Malnati salad was filled with bunch of ingredients.  The small was plenty to split amongst our table of 4. We went with the Malnati Chicago Classic, an extra cheesy pan cooked deep dish pizza with sausage and buttery crust. We got the large for $24. One slice was more than enough for us after all the appetizers. Overall, better than Oregano's but not like the Giordano's I ate in Chicago."}
{"text":"Have no clue why the pizza is dirt here. Maybe it's the Phoenix water. The pizza is stove top, at best. The waiters and waitress stand around staring at each other. I need a job like that. Please note this is not chicago deep dish! Don't compare this to the real thing.  You use the name and think it's the same, it's far from it."}
{"text":"This pizza was seriously...SO GOOD! Deep dish, lots of cheese, perfect balance of flavors. Finished off our meal with a Chocolate Chip Pizza; a warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream. We had great service too."}
{"text":"So, I would like to start by saying that I was not a fan of deep dish pizza. I know!! But, Lou Malnati's has changed my mind. We order the Malnati's Chico classic and I couldn't wait to try it smelling it all the way home. The butter and garlic had me interested. We ordered the wings, mild Buffalo, they are meaty and very tasty.  I also order a Malnati's salad and it was better than expected. Chopped salami, mushrooms, Blu cheese crumbles and what appears to be seasoned, diced tomatoes with a sweet dressing. That was delicious as well.  The staff was very friendly as well, even though the cashier was on the phone she still aknowledged me.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place after hearing all the great things others were saying. I will put it all out there though, I am a New Yorker! I love NY Pizza but that being said, I also love deep dish pizza, just not this one. We started with some of the stuffed spinach bread which was really good just a bit small to share with more than 2 people. After finally getting the pizza we were a bit underwhelmed. The cheese really had no flavor, but the sausage, pepperoni and the sauce were delicious!  I can't say we will go out of our way to go back but I can say at least I tried."}
{"text":"Best deep dish I've had! I tried the one with spinach and mushrooms and didn't like it as much as the classic Lou's. Definitely would be back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes.. but have to say it was somewhat disappointing. the food was ok.. but the screaming kids, it felt like up scale chucky cheese.. I will give it one more try because the place looks cool. But better to just get deliver to enjoy the pizza. The service was good, but I have to say the management was hands off with regards to kids running around the tables, while the waiters were carrying hot pans of pizza."}
{"text":"I was in town for business from California. I had the pleasure of dining here. The food was really great. The reason i am taking the time to write this is to praise your waitress Senait. Wow just wow. She attended to our every need. Never letting our drinks get low and was helpful and pleasant. Very attentive to her customers needs. She is truly a hidden gemstone here. Great employee. If you are looking for some great pizza and you find yourself in Phoenix check them out. Ask for Senait if you want a fantastic dining experience"}
{"text":"Excellent food great atmosphere. The food tastes just as good at the one in Chicago! So happy to be able to get my hometown pizza in az. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Best deep dish I've ever had.
Even the salad is good. I will definitely keep Lou's at the top of my list. 
I've eaten at the restaurant and I've had it delivered to my house and both were outstanding."}
{"text":"2nd Attempt: 
The 2nd time was a bit better, we got the butter crust on the deep dish pizzas this time and it made a difference. It's ok at best, I will definitely not get the this crust there, not worth it at all, in my opinion. All I can say is for the hype of the name of this place, I think the pizza is much better in Chicago then it is here in AZ maybe it has something to do with the water, the altitude but I think it's quality of ingredients. The patio area is really nice to sit for drinks but then there are many bar areas in Phoenix and surrounding areas that have a really nice bar area with food to match. There was a comment a manager and a waiter said to me \"we are still trying to get our bearings and smoking out the kinks\" I think for recipes, prep, and execution on Food kinks should have all ready been worked out. 

1st attempt:
We had the Malnati's salad that was the only thing that tasted good coming out of the kitchen. We ordered the Malnati's Chicago Deep Dish, a sausage and spinach deep dish and a thin crust pizza and we could not figure out if it was the cheese or the sauce that just didn't taste quite right. Something was off and the waitstaff just told us it must be our taste buds that differed from theirs (the restaurant) but 6 people, 3 of whom are chefs and the others of FOH & 1 food writer I believe we have a good idea of how things should taste. But somehow all 6 of us had it wrong. Needless to say, if I do go back it will be only because I could not get out of a family gathering and I will not eat anything unless it's from the bar ."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  I was a little nervous about time since deep dish takes awhile and we were here for lunch.  Turns out they have it covered and have \"express\" deep dish.   I would eat here again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"My bf loves deep dish pizza. He received a gift card for his birthday from a friend for here so we finally made it in (we don't really live close to here). It was totally worth the drive!! We went on a Sunday afternoon and didn't have much of a wait, maybe 10 minutes at the most. We shared a salad and each had a beer. The salad was great and good sized. Our waitress was very sweet and helped us pick out a pizza to share and it was so good. I'm not usually a deep dish pizza girl but I would definitely come here again! I definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"The Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish is definitely worth the wait. Got it with sausage and pepperoni. It is as good as its reputation. Also, the buffalo wings are excellent. A little spice, a little sweet. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I've tried about every Chicago style pizzeria out there (lived in the mid-west 10 years) and this is an excellent pizza.  Not my favorite (that goes to Uno) but an excellent pizza nonetheless.  The only thing that stops me from giving 5 stars is I feel their butter crust tastes chalky & flavorless.  The main reason I felt a need to write this review because I don't write many was the \"WOW\" service Jasmine gave tonight.  Smiling with all of her diners, on top of everything, several food updates & never let my soda go dry.  About as pleasant as anyone I've seen in many years and maybe the best service I've ever had & I'm 47 years old.   Nothing phony about her, just a genuine happy person.  Ask for her by name, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Lou Malnati's is known for their deep dish pizza - and it is the best I've ever had. This is Lou's first location they have ever built outside of Chicago, and I reallllly hope they expand to Vegas. 

This location is TINY. I'm talking maybe 20 tables inside and 20 outside on the patio. The dining room is so small we couldn't bring the stroller in because it's a fire hazard. We showed up around noon shortly after they opened so there was no wait, but I can imagine it gets very crowded during dinner time so PLAN AHEAD!   

Their signature pizza is The Malnati Chicago Classic which has lean Italian sausage, lots of gooey mozzarella cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes all on a delicious buttery deep dish crust. The sausage is formed into a disc and placed onto the crust so you get sausage in every bite! Then the yummy cheese and tomatoes are added and it's off to the oven where it takes about 30 minutes or so to bake. 

Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ordered a salad, meatballs, a large pizza and a beef sandwich. Since the pizza takes a while we enjoyed the meatballs and salad first. The Malnati salad had chopped salami, gorgonzola cheese cubes, mushrooms, and black olives. It comes with a sweet vinegarette dressing which I don't care for, but the lemon garlic dressing is delightful as well as the house vinegarette. The beef sandwich is tasty, piled high with thinly sliced beef, giardiniera, and au jus on the side for dipping. The meatballs were good too but the star of the show for me is the pizza. 

If you are ever in the Phoenix area do yourself a favor and check this place out. And if you can't make it, you can order their pizza online to be shipped frozen to your house."}
{"text":"I will start out that the experience for food and customer service are about as expected which is not really outstanding but still enough to keep me satisfied. The prices are reflective of the atmosphere which I realized is why I was paying that amount for a pizza. I much prefer paying for quality over atmosphere especially if both are great. This vote for me just was influenced solely by atmosphere. Also, be sure to set aside some time for the pizza to be prepared. This style of pizza takes a little time to cook through thoroughly."}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza was very good. The crust is flaky and so much better than Oregano's deep dish. One to two slices will fill you up. The wings are also very good. The place is jammed with people most nights so plan ahead and plan to wait. You can place your order while you wait which is brilliant! A deep dish pizza takes 45 minutes so it's ready when your table is!"}
{"text":"Of course I immediately accepted Robyn N's invitation to try out Lou Malnati's after she was able to score tickets for their Wednesday evening soft opening; I had been waiting for this pizzeria to open in my neighborhood. The very cool Mid-Century Modern theme of Uptown Plaza is reflected outside and inside the pizzeria, and the staff was very enthusiastic and friendly. Robyn and I shared a Malnati salad: romaine, tomatoes, black olives, salami bits (love that!) and gorgonzola cheese with their house sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese; it was delicious and a perfect prelude for the pizza to come. I ordered a small (serves two, so I could take half home for later snacking) \"Lou\" - spinach, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese. It was a dynamite combination of ingredients, and the garlic buttercrust is so good. My friends from Chicago have been raving about Lou Malnati's forever and now I know why. I look forward to coming back to try other pizza variations."}
{"text":"I was told about this place from a friend who has also experienced pizza in Chicago. I loved it! The food was delicious. The only issue is the wait, I was starving. If you have time to kill, check them out."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening, checked in and was told 35 minute wait but you could pre order your pizza. Great idea! We were seated very quickly about 15 minute wait. Eric our server was great! We ordered drinks , appetizers, wings and of course deep dish pizza ! All was wonderful."}
{"text":"If you like people swooshing around you and noisy hipsters looking for the new \"it\" spot,Then Lou malnatis is it. First no one asked if my son needed a high chair it was just assumed and therefore we got sat at a table and that would not had been a problem except for it was the worst table in the place. A round table right next to the entrance of the bathrooms. We asked to move and they said sure no problem. As for the food well we ordered wings, bruschetta, salad and of course the \"famous\" pizza with butter crust. The wings and bruschetta were very good but the salad was nothing other than a bag of salad they tried to gussy up with a few croutons here and there. On to the pizza maybe it's because I have never experienced \"real\" Chicago style pizza or the pizza was just the horrible. The crust was nothing other than pie crust. The only thing good about the pizza was giant chunks of tomatoes that sat on top of it. Oh and maybe the fact that I know I will never be going back to Lou Malnatis."}
{"text":"The best meal ever!  The combo appetizer was fabulous. A little bit of everything.  The Lou Malnati salad is off the hook! So much more than lettuce. Cheese deep dish pizza, oh my goodness, heaven! With the butter crust. Wow! Seriously, gotta be the best meal ever! Well worth the wait.... Donny was our amazing server!  We'll see ya soon."}
{"text":"Just as good as the one in Chicago. If you get your pizza to go be sure to get it uncut."}
{"text":"First time trying the restaurant.  There was a 55 minutes  I'd wait . We ordered our pizza ahead of time but it still took 35 minutes  to get our pizza . We had their  special , the pizza is very rich , a bit salty . We could only eat one slice . I thought  that it was average . We did order their appetizers  combo which was good  and also ordered  the family  salad . Both were large . I also ordered  the chicken  Louie. Their portions are large. Prices  are reasonable.  The server  was very good  and attentive.  A two hour and 15 minutes  dinner is too long"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and decor of this restaurant. They have a nice outdoor patio with heating lamps. I tried the thin crust pizza and it had great flavors. Honey BBQ wings were tasty and crispy. Calamari was tasty also. Loved the service provided by waiter 'Vito'. I had a great experienced and relaxed."}
{"text":"*silenced* I was speechless after my first bite. I got a large pepperoni and mushroom butter crust deep dish. Let me take you on a journey, just as the pizza here did for me. I lifted my pizza out of the box and it did not droop. Nothing fell off even though the pizza was over an inch thick. Next was that nostalgic sauce with perfectly melted cheese and fresh toppings. I was blown away by this alone. Then that crust. Oh my higher deity. The crust was thick, crispy, buttery and so flavorful. The perfect vessel to carry all the goodness that was piled on top. I talk about this pizza every week and look forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I LOVE this pizza!  While not a huge fan of deep dish, you so have to try the deep Italian sausage.  I could hear Lake Michigan in the background.  Visit the one @ Central and Camelback now and understand they are opening in Arcadia, but only carry out and delivery.  Hope that is not true.  The aromas from the kitchen just add to the Chicago deep dish experience."}
{"text":"Love love love Lou Malnaties!! Great deep dish Chicago style pizza. Ordered the deep dish sausage pizza. One of the best pizza slices I have had in Phx. (I'm a New Yorker!) Had a great waiter, Tim. I went with my family. A large pizza can feed 4! Hope they open up more locations throughout the valley"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Was told 1 hour wait and seated 2 hours later. After seated we ordered water and drinks and 30 mins later we only got water. It took another 30 mins to get our pizza even after pre-ordering pizza. So total wait time 3 hours for pizza. Spent approx $20 a person and wait staff has my family passing the plates/food/drinks. Never bothered to see if we wanted more beer or if we like the food. Got bill before being aske if wantes desert. I would have tried the key lime pie. Will not be back. Just not worth it!! Had to push one star but wanted to push none."}
{"text":"Dear Lou,

I'm sincerely sorry I forgot to write a review about you from my visit a few months ago.  This indeed was your first location when you popped your cherry in AZ and your absolutely crushing it!

I mean c'mon what's not to like about your tomatoey, cheesy Chicago Classic?!  Your buttahrific crust is really good and sets the standard for a deep dish pie.  I'm so looking forward to stopping by to give you more of my money once again.  Please help me get the bad taste out of my mouth after some Jack-O named Gus gave me gas at some other chop shop pie shop!  But enough about that disaster!  

Congrats on your upcoming second full service restaurant location in Scottsdale.  But oh please don't ever change that crustless pizza that my friend raves about that I need to try.  Thank you so much for offering that as an option for folks looking to downsize their spare tires and buns.

Oh by the way, just an FYI Lou, there is already an exotic Sausage Fest being served in that part of town your headed to.  But they got nothing on your lean seasoned sausage topping.  Wherever you are in deep dish heaven you should be oh so proud of what your family has accomplished.  Do you Lou do you!  RIP.  Rest In Pie.  

Regards,

-David Burro"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite pizza place in Phoenix. We love many pizza places, but this one is most like what we had back home. The best deep dish pizza you can get in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here following a Cub's spring training game and was not disappointed!  Having grown up in Chicago most of my life, it is a great to enjoy Chicago pizza outside of Chicago.  I am gluten intolerant so was apprehensive about going here uncertain if they have GF pizza band THEY DO!!!!  I was so happy!!! Preferred the GF pizza and it was the best GF pizza I have ever had!  Lou Malnati's thank you for creating a delicious GF pizza crust; you have no idea how happy I was to learn that!  Highly recommend!  Great atmosphere and o food of course!"}
{"text":"This Pizza is in my top 3 of my entire life. So much flavor with every bite. I'm so glad this place in PHX."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed. The service was fine, the pizza dough looked like it was processed, not prepared by hand. The crust was bland, didn't have that Chicago Lou corn meal taste. I requested for it to be well done, the bottom of the crust was not completely done.
The location on Camelback is much better.

The manager Ken reached out to me. I was impressed with his concerns about the quality of their product. He assured me changes have been made in their preparation of the pies and improved to the quality of their pizza. I appreciate the effort."}
{"text":"The wait isn't as bad as when they first opened. But yes it takes 45 minutes for a deep dish no matter what. The plus is when the wait is long they will take your pizza order a head of time and there are tons of little shops in the plaza to keep you busy while waiting. And they deliver :)"}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago and Lou's was our goto place for pizza. For years we internet ordered frozen pizzas from them to \"get our fix\" locally. We were never so happy as to when Lou's opened up in Phoenix and their food here is as good as it was in Chicago. 
They are busy during peak hours but an early or late meal and you can walk right in. For my birthday we ordered 5 pizzas to go and they were hot and ready at the prescribed time. 
Their sausage pizza is my absolute favorite followed by the cheese pizza. It is a slice of home and it makes both me and my stomach very happy!"}
{"text":"*Review for Take-Out Only*

This seems to be either a love it or hate it kind of joint.  So I am splitting the score down the middle of my husband's score and my own.

So my husband loves the rich, buttery, flakey crust.  He feels the dense toppings and unorthodox style of the deep-dish make it unique.  He enjoyed the flavors and looks forward to trying different varieties.  We also got a salad, which he thought was fine but had WAY too many tomatoes.

Hubby: 4/5

Myself (and my young daughters) thought it was pretty gross.  Wet in the middle, way too thick and with a crust better suited for some sort of dessert pie.  The pizza sauce was not robust, the meat tasted bland - give me Schreiners anyday...  The salad was pre-made, bland and had WWAAAYYY too many tomatoes...jeez...

Waifu: 2/5

We've agreed that my husband is going to have to go at it alone and get a personal pizza if he has a hankering for this place.  I'd rather grab a slice from AJ's next door..."}
{"text":"This is a stuffy place in a stuffy neighborhood. Service is great and prompt, and they have good lunch specials to attract the professional crowd. I got a veggie pie and a salad, and it was all good, yet not outstanding. With that said, I would go back and try other dishes. Did i say it was a beautiful space?"}
{"text":"My Wife & I arrived around lunch time for our first visit. Lou Malnati's is located in a strip mall, easy to find if you see it---in a ^ shaped part of the mall. We were seated right away and went over the menu. We usually get the large pie to bring leftovers home as it freezes & reheats great. It would take about 30 minutes--at the time we were there--to bake out order. We ordered the Large Deep Dish Chicago Classic with one extra item @ $27.25, Mozzarella sticks @ $6.25 to pass the time and two soft drinks @ $2.45 each. Refills were NOT an issue and appeared without asking! Service was great and very attentive. My wife could handle one slice while I have two---very filling but have 5 slices left for next week. Chicago type is not thin crust but a deep dish pie that we knew about. They have a full menu for all including salads, thin crust pizza & a kids menu if required. We would highly recommend this Pizzeria to all."}
{"text":"This place it awesome. I visited for my first time with my kids a few nights ago and we all loved it! Fun atmosphere and excellent service. Our server Danielle was so attentive and sweet...she made the experience so enjoyable. Good service like hers is hard to find these days! We ordered a pizza to share and my boys loved it (they're picky eaters!) If you're looking for some authentic Chicago style pizza and great service, you'll find it here. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place.  I love chicago style pizza.  The place was busy and the staff handled it very well.  I really like the app they use so you can see where you are in line.  Our waiter was great.  As for the food.... Gru's mom put it best meh..  the crust was pretty flavorless.  If you take a bite of just the crust itself it quickly turns to a mushy flour paste in your mouth.  We ordered a chicago style cheese with garlic and basil.  The sauce was very sparse and probably would have helped add more flavor if there had been more of it on the pizza.   I would say try it once since everyones taste expectations vary."}
{"text":"Try the \"Lou\" well done. So extremely satisfying  and worth every penny. Try the calamari if you're hungry because the pizza takes about thirty minutes to cook."}
{"text":"I went here 2.1 to have my favorite pizza. As usual the my deep dish pizza tasted really great. Since I'm originally from chi town and I know what deep dish pizza looks. This time it didn't look deep and when I brought it to my she agreed too. I just hope this was just a one time thing. I'm still a fan of Lou since back where they originally started."}
{"text":"Pizza looks a lot better than it tastes, Service was great atmosphere great I think they forgot to put some ingredients in the pizza - mainly salt in the dough.  Just not a fan

This review is from last month for some reason didn't get posted"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed!!! I patiently waited for this to come to Arizona. The Hype was so big. I run a very large food page and have a good amount of members from Chicago. They kept telling me how good this place was going to be. The pizza wasn't good at all. The sauce tasted like it came out of a can. I am very upset and let down. Bummer!!! The only reason I didn't give one star is because our server was very nice."}
{"text":"1st time here, but won't be the last. Got the veggie deep dish and wasn't disappointed in either the food or the service.

I almost got annoyed because the waiter kept coming by and asking if everything was OK...guess I'm not used to decent customer service.

If nothing else, I'll be grabbing a couple of pies to go for lunch for work to turn people on to Chicago deep dish!"}
{"text":"The prices are way to high for the size and quality of pizza. Small selection for pizza toppings and their large is a size of a medium at Pizza Hut. Not worth the time or money. Better pizza places in the area at a more affordable price."}
{"text":"Lou makes THEE BEST Chicago Beef around. THRILLED to be here on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I went here when they first opened and the pizza was very good. Typically though I don't review until I eat at a restaurant more than once. Now that I've gone to Lou Malnatis a few times I have to say that the pizza was only good that one time. Who ever that cook was that day they should've kept him. The dough is lousy and the pizza is just not put together right. Either too dry or not enough of the flavors added to make it tasty. One time when I ordered it to be delivered it wasn't even what I ordered and when I called them to complain they had turned their phones off!!! The restaurant was still open for another hour but yet the phone was on a answering machine that informed me they were no longer taking calls. Really!!! The staff here is more concerned about themselves then the food and their customers. Overall this is certainly not worth their high prices. I don't mind paying good money for a great pizza but this pizza isn't close to being great. There are many restaurants in Phoenix that have great food, Lou Malnatis isn't one of them."}
{"text":"If your looking for a deep dish pizza this is the place. First time I came here we had a great experience. The pizza is pretty pricey because we always add stuff to it so it's like $40-$50 for a pizza. 

The wings are really good you can order them with sauce or without sauce. I prefer without sauce. They do charge you for extra ranch. It's 50 cents. 

We also got the combination platter which is really good. I love the zucchini & cheddar bites! 

They also have a bar. And they have seating outside. 

There is a happy hour menu. Monday thru Thursday from 3-6 on drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Love the pizza especially with how many pizza places are in the Biltmore/Arcadia area."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Lou Malnati's a couple of times while in Chicago. They have been a staple there since the early seventies and have locations all over the windy city. With the Cub's spring training and the all the Chicago folks that come here, restaurants like Lou's, Portillo's and Genos East are making their way to the Valley. What makes this one special is that it is located in the renovated Uptown Plaza (a landmark 1950s shopping center that is now a hotbed of new restaurants). Lou Malnati's did a lot of preparation and research to try and replicate the chain's signature pizza for their first location outside of Chicago.

The restaurant itself is tucked away in the back corner of Uptown Plaza with lots of room for people to mix and mingle on a grassy area while waiting for a table. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. We actually didn't wait too long for a table. If you are going to order one of their delicious deep dish pizzas, give yourself a good 30 - 45 minutes for them to make it. The flaky, buttery crust is made from scratch and they use fresh mozzarella cheese, vine-ripened tomatoes and a nice blend of sausage. You just can't beat how good Chicago deep dish is and we ended up taking most of it home. I think we are pretty lucky to have a little taste of Chicago here in AZ. It can get a little crowded at times, but the experience makes it worth it."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place since all the reviews were so good but honestly the pizza was okay . We tried the deep dish pizza ready to experience pizza heaven but unfortunately we were let down. We were choking and gagging on the thick fat balls of cheese they must use like a pound of cheese on each pizza !! The service and ambience was very nice though!"}
{"text":"Experience was great :) we went on a Wednesday evening.  It looked really packed but we were sitting at a table in about 20min, we chose to sit on the patio which was not bad at all plenty of shade and the misters kept it cool.  Our server was great! kept drinks refilled.  We even had other servers ask how everything else was going.  I experienced deep dish pizza in downtown Chicago so I was very excited to hear of one opening up in Phx.  It was my sons 1st experience and they are pizza freaks & loved it!  Pizza was great, will definitely be going back again.  #loumalnatis #PHX #loumalnatisPHX"}
{"text":"Having been a fan from up in the Chicago area upon learning there was a Lou's down in the valley we had to try it.  We ordered a crust less pizza.  OMG was it amazing!  Of course it was so good that we ate way more than necessary on one sitting lol.  

The decor is interesting.  Be careful of the floor.  If you are impaired in anyway it may be quite trippy and tough to walk on.  

Be Leary when ordering an ice tea.  They did not tell us that they did not have just plain iced tea.  It is all flavored and has sugar in it.  

We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The location, for me, was nostalgic.  Where Lou Malnatis now sits use to be a quaint little coffee shop, The Orbit, back in the 90's.  Anyway moving on to the new restaurant that now sits where many memories were once made....

The atmosphere and energy of the restaurant itself is all good vibes.  Retro feel, a happening scene, lots of smiles and laughter all around you.  We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess who explained how we can pre order our deep dish while waiting to be seated (brilliant).  The wait was only about 15 minutes for a 8pm Friday night dinner.

After being seated our server greeted us, full of energy, smiles, and even a Chicago accent making the experience that much better. He told us about the restaurant's history and shared a few recommendations.  

We ordered their signature Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish for 2, the chicken Louie, and the trio dip appetizer.  

The Manati Chicago Classic was 5 stars.  Very authentic, full of flavor, the crust was to die for, and yeah - very yummy.

The Chicken Louie.  Oh how this dish disappointed.  We are alfredo pasta snobs.  I love a good dish of alfredo.  The pasta came out in this super cute real bowl and looked heavenly but open shoveling this cheesy goodness into my mouth, disappointment.  Eh, maybe it's just me.  Then my husband had the same look of disappointment.  We both agreed it was bland, tasteless, and honestly not far off from a frozen lean cuisine.  

The trio dip I would give 3.5 stars.  The artichoke dip was good but not the best I've had, the garlic dip was over the top, and the hummus, well, was hummus.  I'd skip on this appetizer next time personally.

The manager took off the pasta for us, no issue. 

Overall this place is worth the visit, just stick to the pizza.  We will definitely be back and bringing friends.  I've already given a shout out on Facebook and told a few close friends to check it out.  Worth the visit and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Had our 4th meal at Lou Malnati's today.  Again everything was exceptional from the time we walk through the door.  I think we were greeted by a manager who asked us if this was our first time here. Told us if we needed anything to let her know.  Daniel G. was our server.  He went above and beyond what was required to make our dinner a pleasent experience.  The food was great as usual.  If you are pizza lover you will not be disappointed.  Be sure and try the house specialty Buttercrust.  Pies are made individually and take abit of time, enough to knock back a couple of cool ones or a glass of wine.  Salads are great because dressing is mixed in.  They are huge too.  The resturant is spotless.  I have to drive from North Glendale...hope one of the new locations is near Arrowhead."}
{"text":"Love Lou Malnatis pizza in Chicago as the crust and sauce are to die for.
Always been my favorite pizzeria.
Was so excited to have this one open here in Phoenix just 10 minutes from my home.

Got there at 520 and of course there was a line. However, you could sit outside right away and outside patio is adorable.
Mist fans and covered seating. It was 104 degrees but so didn't feel like it.

Omg...try the Buffalo chicken, watermelon salad with balsamic vinaigrette and gorgon zola if you like Bleu cheese.  Order your own for $8?95 or family portion for $12.95. Sounds a little unusual but it was so good.

Combination fried appetizer plate is just standard. Comes with Ranch and salsa.

The pizzas...the classic is the best as they put the toppings under the sauce and the butter crust is just simply fantastic. 
The Lou is no sauce but has vine ripened tomatoes that are juicy to make up for that. Spinach and mushroom. You can half the pizzas to try different toppings.
Large pizzas are about $23.95 per and have 8 slices.
Pizzas can take 35 to 40 minutes each so order appetizers.

Plenty of parking in the shake shack/aj market shopping center."}
{"text":"Wow finally a real deep dish pie ! I am only giving 4 stars because the dough was not cooked all the way and was still a little doughy I will update my post after giving then to get it right. Lou Malnati's is definitely worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am not the biggest pizza fan. (I know, crazy right?) Lou Malnati's however in my opinion, is the best pizza I have ever had. Their deep dish pizza is out of this world. I could literally eat it every day. I love it so much that I would pick it over the pizza I have had in Italy and New York. I used to prefer thin crust pizza before I tried Lou Malnati's. I always get the Chicago Classic. The tomato sauce on top is just the right amount, and is not too salty or tasty. The crust and the dough taste like buttery heaven and the sausage on top pairs well with everything. I prefer to just stick with it as it is, instead of adding more toppings to it. The thin crust pizza definitely isn't as good as the deep dish in my opinion.

Their chicken wings are good, and the mozzarella sticks aren't bad. My boyfriend loves the Malnati salad. We first tried Lou Malnati's in the first week they were open so the service was not the best. I remember one of the managers being kind of rude, but I think she was just rattled by how busy it was. Over all, I love this place and I am so ecstatic that they are a two minute drive from me!"}
{"text":"We tried stopping in a month ago and the line was ridiculously long, so we decided to be strategic on our revisit and arrive around 4:30pm on a Thursday night.  We showed up and were immediately seated and promptly waited on.  The restaurant is light and airy and really comfortable, the service is good and the classic deep dish pizza was quite delicious, but oh so filling!  The pizza takes 35 minutes to make, so beware that this isn't a quick in and out type of restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was a total let down. I grew up in the Chicagoland area and disappointed doesn't even begin to tell how I feel about this place. The pizza was so bland I had to ask for hot sauce to put on the pizza. With Gino's East and Giordano's set to open in Phoenix this place better step their game up. Until then I'll just go to Oregano's for a deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was amazing--salad and pizza.  The wait staff was incredibly attentive and friendly.   We would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Lou's is still a great place to take the family on Sunday evening!  Their takeout is really fast too. 

We had the large extra sausage and garlic Deep Dish. It is delicious, as is the medium cheese Deep Dish. But you must... order their Lou's Salad. It was outstanding and better than any other salad we've had, even better than CPK's Chopped!

Negatives are still the uneven service. For instance the Dip Trio appetizer arriving with our pizzas. Our server tried to say they timed it like that. Yeah okay, I'll bite, why was it cold then?  Oops. 

It was nice to see our previous server from Lincoln Park is now one of the Managers. Great hire and promotion!

Anyway, nothing negative can detract from the really good Chicago comfort food of Lou's. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here since they opened but was scared off by the crowds and long wait times. We stopped by for lunch today and were pleasantly surprised to find that there was no wait. In fact they were maybe only half full. I loved the fun retro styling and colors and the service was very friendly and welcoming. 

It was lunch time so we opted for the lunch special. I honestly think that is where we went wrong. The special was a personal deep dish, soup or salad and a beverage. All that for under $10 a person! I ordered the salad, the sausage deep dish and a soda and my friend had the pepperoni. The salad was good with a nice mix of chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions on top and croutons. The pizza crust seemed a little over cooked and heavy on the tomatoes and light on cheese but it was ok. I was expecting to be blown away after all the hype but found myself thinking it was just alright. It is entirely possible that when I try them again and order the butter crust I will change my story as I hear that is the way to go. We just didn't have the time to wait for it today during lunch. The personal pizzas for lunch only take 15 minutes but the big one can take over 30 minutes. I am definitely going to try them again."}
{"text":"We went on the weekend and they were really busy in the restaurant and with people grabbing takeout. Located right by creamistry and flower child, this place always seems to be bustling. My husband and I got wings and a deep dish pizza. Now, THAT's a pizza pie! Wings were good, meaty and came out quickly and were the perfect amount to hold us off for the 45 minutes it takes to make that massive cheeses deep dish pizza. So much cheese you get filled up realllll quick. Also tiramisu wasn't the best I've had, but since it's my favorite dessert it's nice to know somewhere always has it available! Want a slice of deep dish Chicago type pizza? This is the place."}
{"text":"OMG! So happy to have my favorite Chicago pizzeria right here in phoenix! We were having them shipped here when we were really craving them, now we can have them in person. So good, just like in Chicago. The Lou Special is a veggy pizza with a little cheddar in the mix, I was skeptical and I usually stick with just the cheese pizza but WOW, I am a big fan of the Lou special now. This is super indulgent, tasty, just like Chicago, pizza. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The thin-crust is child's play, but the deep dish is good. We've always had accurate wait-times and picking up your food is a breeze. I'd recommend this location to anyone in the area looking to try a new pizzeria."}
{"text":"If you are from the east coast, this is nothing like what you are used to. This is more like a pizza dinner. Everything here tastes fresh and enjoyable. We had the deep dish and appetizers and enjoyed our visit. Would have been nicer if the sauce had more of a spice kick, while it was fresh it was not a unique sauce that you would find in New York. Takes a long trip to get there from Maricopa. If they were closer would try the thin crust pizza. Comparing it to scillian pizza back east not as much flavor and softer crust. Nice for a change of pace. Though very good, but I've had much better where you couldn't stop eating the pizza. This is a totally fresh enjoyable pizza that is worth trying for yourself!"}
{"text":"Lou's is wonderful. We were visiting from Vegas and in the mood for Pizza, and what do we find? Our favorite Chicago Pizza place. The buttercrust is to die for with the sausage. And new to me this time, the Salad with the sweet vinaigrette dressing. So good i brought home a bottle of the dressing. The atmosphere is wonderful, we sat out side, and our server was attentive and provided stellar service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place finally in July 2017.  Not thrilled with the location.  It was kinda hard to find. Went here on a Saturday for a to go deep dish at 530pm. The place was crowded! The pizza was ready on time. It was recommended to get it uncut, which we did. I think that was a good call. We got the medium deep dish with cheese.  The sauce is how I remember it tasting in IL. However, the last time I had it in IL it seemed there was too much crust. It wasn't always like that before.  So maybe it's how they make it now because the AZ deep-dish is the same, more crust. I'll still go back because I love my pizza! Don't think I'd want to eat in house. Just way too crowded for me."}
{"text":"Finally checking out Lou's! The pizza was as great as expected and our server Danny is the best!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  The butter crust is da' bomb!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm yes. I'll definitely be back to this joint and excited that it's so close to me! A girlfriend and I decided to grab a quick dinner before an event we were going to. We sat at the bar and stuck up a conversation with one of the bartenders and he told us about the restaurant, based out of Chicago and all of their pizzas are made fresh to order. 

We didn't feel like sharing a pizza so we each got our own personal deep dish. The crust was with the right amount of crunch and flakiness that has me wanting more. My mouth is watering right now! I got the pepperoni and my friend got the cheese. Fresh mozzarella and the crust made me swoon. The personal pizza is the perfect size for one person. I think I might pre-order and pick one up tonight!!!

The ambiance was very cool, just look at the pictures. Next time I want to sit outside and just grab a beer, pizza, and watch a game."}
{"text":"Darn good pizza. Good thick crusty pie.
Chicken wings were pretty amazing too. Great salad.
Service is pretty slow though. At least they're nice, so that helps. 
I haven't been to Chicago myself, but I went with someone who is from Chicago and said it's authentic. Either way, it's really good. I'm not one to get too into semantics. Good pizza is good pizza"}
{"text":"One word.....WOW!!!


Best Pizza in town. I never had pizza like this , living in Arizona. Incredible.

I highly recommend this place. It will knock your socks off!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to Love this Pizzeria on the first try. My best friend is having a birthday this week and thought I'd stop in to get her a gift card. This is her FAVE FAVE place -- she lived in Chicago and has been looking forward to this pizzeria to open in Phoenix. --- We were seated at a high table up front. Ro asked about about the gift cards at the front counter and were told that the credit card machine was down and could only accept cash.  We thought that was OK since we had enough cash on hand. After waiting 12 minutes without a server coming to our table, I decided to purchase a gift card and leave. I explained to the manager what happened and she offer a weak apology. We'll try again after the sour taste from this visit wears off."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times in Chicago, and love their food. But, when I went here in Phoenix on a Saturday night they expected me to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes to be seated for a party of 2. Also, no reservations are allowed on Saturdays. I think this wait time speaks poorly to how this location is managed, and that they either need to expand to meet the demand or make certain nights reservation only with higher prices. I know they have good pizza, but it is not worth that extremely long wait time."}
{"text":"This is my first time here at this location. This place is in a vary trendy part of town. It has indoor as well as outdoor seating. It's quiet with a classy vibe. All the staff is super friendly and the ambience is very casual. They have a great place to have a drink in their open bar."}
{"text":"Well last week we drove one hour to get our pizza that we ordered on line and we took it home to share it with our family, and it was the first time to have this pizza. we ordered the deep dish large pizza with 4 vegetable toppings, we got home after almost one hour driving back home but the pizza surprisingly was still very hot. The sad part is that we can taste that the dough was not cooked all the way and i got sick to my stomach, it tasted horrible. We were very very disappointed specially that was our first time. i hope you look into this because we paid $33 for something we could not eat, the order was on December 31st 2016. thank you."}
{"text":"Yes! An automatic 5 stars!!  And if I could give them 10 stars, I would!!  You can probably tell I'm a Chicagoan, now living in Phoenix. I love it here, but Chicago will always be home. BUT now that Lou's is opening here, other than family, there is no reason to move back to Chicago!!  This pizza is out of this world. It is delicious. The crust is flaky and buttery. The topping all fresh and yummy. My family and I are so excited for this opening!!!  Yay Lou's!!!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I lived in Chicago for a year and tried all of the deep dish establishments several times (Giordano's, Lou's, Gino's east, pizanos, pequods etc)

Maybe it's something in the water in the Midwest that can't be replicated here even though I'm in Arizona native, but the pizza is better in the Midwest I have to say.

However it's a solid pizza (the one that I ordered from Lou's in Phoenix) but I ordered a medium deep dish pizza and the cheese just clumped together and was pretty rubbery almost after it sat for 10 minutes.  The crust is kind of bland especially if you compare it to Gino's East corn bread crust.  Maybe I'll try the butter crust next time.


Overall decent but not necessarily crazy to go back and order again.  Not thrilled with the cheese, pepperonis and mushrooms were good on the pizza."}
{"text":"This is by far and beyond the best pizza in the valley! This is true Chicago style pizza that reminds me of home. I love their deep dish pizza that is actually a deep dish pizza. Prices for the deep dish can be a little bit higher but you have to think about how thick the pizza is, you don't need to eat nearly as much to become full. The wait time can be quite some time so make sure you plan accordingly but I promise you that the wait is worth the taste explosion in your mouth."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see an average of only 4 stars. My family has visited this location 3 times and we have had a great experience each time.  I grew up going to the Buffalo Grove location and was thrilled when I heard Lou's was coming.  I even waited in line for 2 hours when it opened!  They handled the line great, handed out water and samples and the manager came around chatting.  It was like a big Chicago reunion!  The pizza is perfect, exact replica of what I grew up with.  That layer of sausage is so delicious!  And make sure to get butter crust!  Service was friendly each time and pizza took reasonable amount of time.  I recently visited a competitor and was reminded that Lou's really is the best!  If you want to try amazing Chicago style pizza, go to Lou's!"}
{"text":"We had heard the buzz, and we knew a high schooler who began working as a hostess, so we tried Malnati's soon after it opened. The setting was lovely, service was excellent, and the ingredients were high-quality. Unfortunately, the sauce was extraordinarily bland. It appeared to be plain tomato sauce without any salt or other flavoring. Had the sauce been halfway decent, the pizza would have been phenomenal. However, lacking that crucial building block, the pizza only rated \"ok\"."}
{"text":"I went to the one in Chicago a year ago and it was great, so a friend and I were excited when the one in Phoenix opened up.  Unfortunately, the excitement didn't last beyond the first bite of the personal sized pizza I had.  The crust was extremely hard and not flavorful at all.  My friend ended up getting a frozen pizza to take home for dinner that night and she and her husband said that crust was also really hard and tasted stale.  Obviously frozen isn't fresh, but it shouldn't be stale if they're still selling it."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Lou Malnati's pizza since the early 70's and hated not having one around the corner when we moved to the greater Phoenix area.  A few other Chicago pizza joints have tried and totally failed when it came to recreating what us Chicagoans are used to enjoying.  

After going to the opening last Saturday night, I was more than pleasantly surprised that they absolutely nailed it.  They must of spent a ton of money on a water filtration system.  I have to use bottled water when I make homemade pizza for the family because AZ water is so bad in most neighborhoods.  Bad water effects so many things in a restaurant from the ice in your drink to the soups, pasta, rice, dough or anything else that needs it.

While I refused to waste space in my tummy with a soup, salad or appetizer, I did taste some of the pass around apps my friends ordered.  All of them were very tasty and my favorite was the Cheddar Cubes.

The pizza with the butter crust is my favorite.  Nobody was able to talk to me the first 5 minutes after the pizza arrived.  I disappeared and went to heaven for a moment.

It was a pleasure seeing Marc Malnati there with his wife.  His staff (mostly from Chicago) did a great job.  Kudos to the executive who talked Marc into expanding outside of the Chicago area.  All of us in the valley that love great deep dish pizza owe you a drink!  Marc is a very hands on operator, similar to Dick Portillo.  I know his biggest concern was not having one of his operations just down the street.  I guess It's like sending your first born to college.  You know it's the right thing to do, but it hurts inside that you can't be close to your baby.  

Thank you Lou's.  We're thrilled you came to the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few friends, there was a tiny wait of 10 mins (go figure this place is poppin all day every day) 

The hostess was awesome though, she asked if we wanted to look at a menu while we waited and if we decided what pizza we wanted should could put it Into the computer for us already to speed things up Which we did! 

Got to our table, our server was so nice! She already knew we had a pizza going and asked if we wanted anything else. We tried the combination platter... AMAZING! Best cheese curds I've ever had! I would come back for those! Pepperoni deep dish pizza was also amazing! I'm a cheese fan and it didn't disappoint. We all only could eat one slice, it's that filling! Took the rest home. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I tried Lou Malnati's recently for the express lunch now that they are open for lunch. I entered and inquired if the express lunch was available for carryout, and informed that it was dine in only. I proceeded to the next employee commenting I was there for the express lunch and would dine in but disappointed I could not do it for carryout. She informed me I could do the express lunch for carryout, and took my order of a sausage pizza, then asked if I wanted to add a drink. The drink apparently is only included with the dine in express lunch but not carryout. I wasn't thrilled but decided to purchase a drink. Then I ordered the minestrone soup and paid. After paying I inquired roughly how long it would take, the staff were unaware but checked and informed me it would be around 10 minutes. A very workable time for an express pizza. After a 10 minute wait I was approached and asked what salad dressing I wanted as the soup was unavailable. This express lunch which is a full price pizza with free drink and soup or salad now has become a full price pizza, full price can of soda, and no soup. I comment I have no interest in eating a salad, so the employee walked away without comment, returning roughly five minutes later letting me know the soup was now available and would be included. Having waited now about 15 minutes I asked her how much longer as I was initially informed it would be a 10 minute wait. My total time waiting was just under 30 minutes to receive a bag containing the pizza and soup. 

When i opened up the bag to enjoy the food I found I did not receive any napkins or utensils, and the soup was unappealing. The sausage pizza was tasty, but having consumed my entire lunch break waiting for the express lunch, and paying for the included drink I didn't the experience worthwhile. I was hoping Lou Malnati's would become a regular lunch location but I doubt I'll return for lunch in the future based on both this experience and the general practice of how carryout is handled with the express lunch order."}
{"text":"Very good quality pizza, tasty appetizers (tried wings and calamari), very nice ambiance to the restaurant, and pleasant service.  We got a large deep dish pizza and medium  thin crust with no butter on the thin crust. Everyone like their pizza order but I particularly liked the deep dish. 1.5 slices packs a punch, 2 full slices requires a two hour siesta!"}
{"text":"The hype was not real. But then again the last time I had a deep dish pizza it was from pizza hut  10 years ago and it was the best thing ever. Ordered a small pepperoni & mushroom which was a bit smaller than I realized (8inches?) And it was almost 20$. Super cheesy saucy but it just didn't do it for me. Still can't find a good pizza in Phoenix but then again, y'all don't make pizza like the Italians in Federal Hill, RI. 4 stars because they already have excellent reviews, a huge following, & they had like 8 people waiting for pickup orders at around 4pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The real deal Chicago pizza. 
Crazy busy and long wait times but worth the wait. 
Seems like everything in Phoenix is a long wait. 
The sauce has that flavor that makes the difference. The sausage covers the pie and is perfect in every bite. 
Pro tip: take some of the frozen ones home!"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat at the newly open Chicago classic now in Phoenix. Knowing there would be long lines we waited until after 9pm last night. Even then it was still at least another hour before we could get seated. The hostess let us preorder the deep dish to save time, but as it turned out they didn't put the order in until we were seated which meant another 30 minute wait. Shortly following that we were informed they messed up the order and we're not going to have enough food because they had made the wrong size pizza.  That's the bad news!

The good news is we had a great server who did his best with the situation to take care of us. The manager eventually stopped by to advise us (the corrected) dinner was on her and we even got comped a free appetizer and desserts for all on top of a free dinner!   The friendly President of Lou Malnati's, Mark Agnew, was there for the store opening and checked in on us as well apologizing, and offering interesting bits of information about the restaurant and future Phoenix expansion.  No worries on our end.  Understanding there are always kinks to work out in a new place, we left stuffed and happy.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'M IN LOVE!!!!!
I'd have to say this is probably the best pizza I've ever had.
I'm not a deep dish pizza girl, but ohhhhh, the garlic deep dish is to die for.

Will go back again one day!!
So far away from where I live."}
{"text":"Being a Chicagoan in Arizona, it is near impossible to find the great pizza that I was accustomed to eating.  PROBLEM SOLVED!  I cannot say enough about Lou Malnati's.  The deep dish pie is simply mouth watering.  In fact, everything on the menu is great.  The staff is welcoming and attentive.  They also have a great system if you have to wait for your table by texting you.  we will be back....again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and you MUST purchase their salad dressing, it's LIQUID gold!!! Just left with 4 bottles for family and friends. Great atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"The deep dish is amazing! Seriously, the best pizza I've ever had -hands down. Completely worth the wait! I'm a pile on the toppings girl, but here a simple cheese and sausage is the way to go it's so good. The only complaint I have is the service is the worst!!!! My family drives from Gilbert at least once every two weeks and almost every time the Manager has to remove something from the bill because they forgot it or it never makes it to the table at the right time. Please, please, please fix the service! We love you, but you're too far for delivery and we're sick of our dining experience being a comedy of errors."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen I introduce you to a new staple in uptown PHX!

Lou Malnatis will NOT disappoint. Classic Chicago style pizza. They do a crust called the buttercrust that is amazing. They manage to keep the bottom a lovely crisp and the rest of the pizza solid not too soggy. 

The sausage has some of the most amazing seasoning!  My boyfriend wanted to bring some home to add to other recipes!  

The owner even took the time to stop by. So sweet. All of the employees were so kind, attentive and quick!  

Enjoy your visit to Lou's!"}
{"text":"I had never had Chicago style pizza until now- ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!! CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!!! The amount of tv's that show sports is an awesome perk as well. The dessert they give for a birthday is mouth watering. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, friendly employees and great ambiance. 
-Can be quite a wait, plan accordingly.
-Plenty of parking.
-Good central location.
-We sat at the bar rather than wait even longer for a table.
-Excellent beer selection.
-Pizza is decent, a little greasy for my tastes but good.
Five stars, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have a Lous in the neighborhood!!! Everytime I go to Chicago, we HAVE to go to Lou Malnati's, so to have one so close by is so exciting. The sauce is always perfect and so is the buttery crust. The pizzas are huge so they are worth every penny. I really don't get how people have anything negative to say about this place. They must not be used to real deep dish! Always a 10 out of 10. Friendly staff. Both delivery and take out. You also have to try the tiramisu! Sooooo delicious."}
{"text":"Now your talking Pizza!!! I've lived in New York for many years and I'm spoiled rotten when it comes to pizza. Living in the west coast is painful when you are craving a good slice. Now don't get me Wong, this isn't New York pizza but it is dead on Chicago pizza and I will take it. Whether you choose the deep dish, which is spectacular or the thin crust (beyond words) you will be in heaven.  I love both but I have to say the thin crust Lou is my favorite. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. You will never think of any other place for your pizza fix once you try Lou's."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Seated immediately and pizza was fabulous. This location holds up to original in Chicago."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Tuesday afternoon, our group of 5 were greeted & seated promptly. In about 25-30 min we had our pizza. It was very fresh, tasty and oozed hot melty cheese! Definitely a go to place when craving Chicago style pizza in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quite a drive for me, but a nice occasional treat. The cheese is amazing and it's truly made to order."}
{"text":"You know that old adage , 'It's not you, it's me...' ? That's the case with Lou Malnati's Pizza I have decided after this past weekend. Following my last review of Lou Malnati's, the company reached out to me and followed with a nice 'try us again' gift. I am usually on the fence about mentioning such things in a review , as who's to say someone looking for something for gratis won't write a crappy review for that, after reading that in my review. I do believe, THOSE people exist.. sadly. I am not one of those people. I work in an industry where customer service and keeping people happy is key to return business and the success of a company in the long haul. Often, when a place reaches out , ( like the one place who ignored my food allergies and served me nuts anyway ! ), I don't give a second chance.. especially if it's truly bad, (or as I just mentioned, me or my families health is involved). Lou's was not that way. I truly believed the first time, they were maybe having an off night. I decided to take them up on their offer of 'trying them again'. Maybe my taste buds were off that first time and we did order late into the evening, last time, as well. This time, I decided to give Lou Malnati's my entire, FULL, attention. I decided to dine in their full service restaurant and experience the full Monty, if you will. My review is not going up, in stars though, as there were things that I feel were better and some that I think, were not where they should be. A 4 star is on point with most things and a 5 star is near perfection service to taste to experience overall. That is my own Yelp grading scale. FWIW. This night, we were sat immediately by a super friendly hostess. The restaurant was not busy... yet. That changed in about forty minutes! We started with wine , but my husband knowing the Chicago area asked for an Old Style. He opted to switch to that off hand. It was not on the menu, and they had it. Not something I would drink , but okay! I decided to ask for a sparkling wine.. also, NOT on the menu, but they had a La Marca Prosecco. Interesting. I had to wonder what else wasn't listed on the wine/beer/drink menu. We were famished and ordered the Calamari Fritti. To me, it had no taste. Just bland. The marinara sauce for dipping was served cold too and I have a thing about that. The sauce should be hot for the hot calamari. We also ordered two pizzas: one small Lou's , we added sausage to this ; and one medium thin crust sausage / pepperoni to which we added roma tomatoes; olives and mushrooms. The pizzas showed up hot and looking amazing. They are cut right at your table. I think I've decided it's the crust that turns me off to this place. I don't like it's taste and it doesn't seem fresh, because of the lack of crisp to it. I will say that the deep dish pizza, The Lou's pizza, was a lot better over all than last time. It's definitely a filling pizza, as we were full off of a slice of it.. the thin crust was just , blah. I should have not attempted a thin crust pizza in a Chicago pizza eatery, because I do have my favorite 'thin' crust pizza places in the valley. This pizza left me unimpressed. As far as service went, I felt our wait staff, a girl who was training a guy, was very good at the beginning and then... faltered. We still had pizza on our plates and wine in our glass and we were being asked if we wanted dessert or boxes. That will ALWAYS give the feeling of wanting a guest to be done ( because it was now very busy), and get out! Soon, the check arrived and her asking if I had my coupon that I mentioned upon ordering. That was it. Again, I think Lou Malnati's is located in a great area.. has a great vibe.. could probably still work on service, as the end of our meal seemed rushed and like a 'churn and burn' situation on a busy night, which lead to us feeling like we had taken too long. The taste is not likely so much the fault of any thing else, than my own dislike and taste buds. Like I said, Lou, it's not really you .. it's me. I do love that HR or management reached out to attempt to make things right last time.. but, a company can do that a million times and if the core players , (i.e. wait staff , etc), aren't on the service game, it won't do much good .. especially with someone like me who's on the wire about the taste already. I truly wanted to love you ... but this is mere 'sort of , not really feeling it ' zone for me ."}
{"text":"It was ok. But not for the price!! Under cooked, crust was weird & sauce was not liked by anyone! No one in house liked it! We won't be back & too bad ..,it's in the hood!"}
{"text":"Awesome spinach pie and bruschetta another awesome place my neighborhood has to offer. I totally recommend this place. I don't eat meat so my review is limited but my son says the meat pizza are awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"It was OK...nothing too special. I don't see why Chicago people lose their minds over Lou's.

Calamari appetizer was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I order mine well done and usually take it \"to go\". It is a little pricey but worth the splurge on occasion."}
{"text":"The crustless pizza is perfect for a Keto diet. The \"crust\" is made of sausage. It was well worth the drive from Surprise."}
{"text":"Man was this the best I've eaten in AZ so far!!!!"}
{"text":"Just short of amazing. The waiter forgot to have pepperoni put on my Lous classic, but, it was still terrific. I liked it because it's not dry. I am from MN. We used to have a place called My Pie that had almost the same pizza. If any Minnesotans remember that, you have to try Lou Malnatis pizzeria. It is as close to My Pie as you're gonna get."}
{"text":"Great staff with wonderful food.  The lunch special for less than $10 is a great deal; includes slice of pizza, salad or soup, and a drink.  Quick service for the lunch special.  Wonderful cheesy pizza with a delightful crust."}
{"text":"Corporate saw my review and made things right. At least they care about their customers"}
{"text":"Update: Carl the manager called and wants another chance to make amends... will update again.

Can't tell you about the pizza. The cashier is a very nice lady. The place is cute and clean- even decorated for the holidays. They have my money but I'm still sitting here waiting to pick up this \"amazing\" pizza and my salad. So far they are 15-30 minutes late. It's Friday night, get your restaurant staffed Lou. I've watched several other people come and go and others stand around with me. I'm tired. If I hadn't paid I would go home. More money in staff to handle business on time or readjust your promise times.
Update ended up waiting 35 minutes. Only after asking how much longer did someone disappear to the back for 10 minutes and come out with my order. I really hope this is the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Dang.

Big, hefty, tasty pizza. We ordered takeout, so I cant really speak for the service, but dayummm the pizza was good. We ordered a medium \"Lou's Pizza\" (spinach, mushroom, tomato, add pepperoni) for two very hungry people, and could barely finish 2/3 of it. The deep dish crust had such a good, buttery flavor, too. We used the online ordering system and it was exactly on time. If we lived in town, I could definitely see us coming back when we had a hankerin' for crazy delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Not that impressed by Chicago pizzas I guess? The pizza was pretty flavorless. The service was alright. Wouldnt right home about this place."}
{"text":"A favorite among friends and family in Chicago, the Phoenix location did not disappoint! So thankful to have Lou Malnati's in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends from Chicago came to town and decided we MUST eat at Lou Malnatis. Our visit was far less than they expected. Our first impression was the hostess, who seemed to busy talking to a server to acknowledge us or take our name. After a short wait, longer than quoted, we were sat at a table that was crumb laden as was the floor. Our server was nice, she got the order right but apparently the kitchen felt we wanted our pizza over cooked. I'll not make another visit there. Overcooking  the pizza was one thing, the lack of sanitation was another. My guests from Chicago say they really prefer Giordanos.... why didn't we just go there ?"}
{"text":"Shout out for the best Chicago pizza in Arizona and awesome creamy garlic dressing. No restaurants serve creamy garlic dressing in Arizona but most all Italian restaurants in Illinois have it.  Picked up our order to go yesterday and was in heaven eating my food.  Wish you were closer in the East Valley Queen Creek you would do well."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup on Super Bowl Sunday, and they said my order would be ready for pickup in 20 minutes. Arrived 20 minutes later, paid and they said order would be right out. After waiting another 10 minutes they said made an error cooking and almost ready. 5 customers came in and received food and I'm still waiting. Purchased a salad to help with wait. Finally came out after 40 minutes with no apology or discounts or anything!! Terrible service!!!"}
{"text":"With all the people waiting to get in here you say to yourself it's gotta be good. How can this many people be wrong? And that's a question I keep asking myself.

We went as a party of four and ordered a deep dish classic, a thin crust classic, and two salads and because of the wait time we ordered a combination appetizer plate.

The restaurant is very noisy making speaking at a table for four difficult and after realizing that we'd been sitting there for 30 minutes and still hadn't gotten our appetizers we flagged down our server and cancelled that part of the order.

When our dinners came out a bit later the ladies agreed that their salads were pretty good and we all decided that the pizzas were mediocre at best. Even before they came we had decided that next time we'd order the pizza to go rather than sit in this restaurant ever again and after tasting it we'd skip the takeout too.

To recap; noisy, friendly inefficient service and mediocre food. Not really a winning combination."}
{"text":"First time at Lou Malnatis outside of Chicago, great place. The food was awesome, I miss deep dish pizza so much, so when I had some here, brought back memories from Sweet Home Chicago. Also service was good, the pizza took a long time but got free appetizers because of the wait. Thank you again Lou Malnatis"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had. Any other reviews saying otherwise, their tastebuds are not working right. The amount of freshness and effort to perfect each ingredient shows! The sauce is mind blowing. My mouth is watering just writing this review. Best pizza you can get in Arizona hands down. I'm from Chicago so I might be a little bias but if you haven't tried Lous your missing out!!"}
{"text":"Are people giving bad reviews for free pizza? I never thought of this approach!  I HATE  being sold a time an idea and then having to wait longer, but pizza like this is worth the wait!

Gino, I won't complain, I'll just say thanks and keep crushin it!"}
{"text":"I am from schaumburg Ill and we had a Lou's there and as a youth My parents took me there once a month but been in phoenix to long tried the deep dish was good but the thin was great please try this place if you haven't wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Cheese-us Crust is this place great!!!

Finally I made My return visit after some opening month glitches. It was worth the wait apparently.

Today Lou's was firing on all cylinders, and the Restaurant was Smooth as silk.

Service was top notch, patient and attentive, and my favorite quality's, welcoming and kind!!!

We had a big salad The Lou, This is one of The Cities greatest salads and has all of my favorite things. This is a cant miss item. Great Cheesy garlic bread set the tone for the starring attraction The Pizza.

I brought my favorite Chicago sons with me to share and it was unanimous and rousing 11 thumbs up (on a 1-10 scale). We all talked about \"The String\" that all great deep dish pizzas should have. and then...wait for it... there it was, a foot long string of cheese as the first slice was lifted from the well seasoned pan.

The crust was better then I remember and the sauce was great, a little puddling of water was a surprise since we had meat pizzas, but that didn't distract from these excellent Pizza's

Crowds have subsided and that's a relief, no wait at all. Lou's in my opinion is finally poised to grow around the valley. let me give you my address because we traveled 15 miles for lunch today."}
{"text":"Yummmm! I am pizza picky and the Chicago Style is the bomb! This transplanted Midwest girl just found her favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Wonderful! Awesome! Heaven..

NUFF said."}
{"text":"Oh, yeah baby.... Better then sex. As good as it gets. Best chicago style pizza, period."}
{"text":"I'm really glad they came to AZ. I really think the quality holds up too. Salads are great. Deep dish is great. Recently tried thin crust and thought it was amazing. Service is normally really good. Great piece of Chicago here in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious - but unfortunately I don't think there is any pizza in this world that is worth a two-hour wait. If we were initially told two-hours, we probably would have left and came back another day - but we were told that it would only be an hour and fifteen minutes. If I go back, it won't be on a weekend."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot for deep dish! You need to get the butter crust. Wait could get long but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Yes it is THAT good! The line to get in is MASSIVE  we ordered take out and it was ready right when they opened. I happily skipped to my car with my hot deep dish as all the people in line stared me down with with their evil stares. Definitely try this pizza"}
{"text":"Went during the second week of the grand opening. I honestly must say that I wasn't blown away. 
The pizza was overly hyped, but like any pizza, it was still enjoyable."}
{"text":"A cool place! Pizza is a very thick, pan pizza that isn't too greasy. Crust is nice and crispy. Service is slow and the employees act kind of snobby that they are busy. Like when you come in and they tell you the wait time it's as if they want you to leave... Other than that it's worth coming to."}
{"text":"We want to hank JOY for making our visit that much better. Great food Great employees!"}
{"text":"We met a friend here for lunch during the week when we had a craving for some good pizza. Our friend had been here before and recommended it. We were very glad we tried it. The atmosphere was great and I loved all the fun decor. Our service was great and very friendly. The salad was delicious and we enjoyed our pizza. I give it four stars instead of five because the pizza was good, but the sauce definitely left me a little wanting. I also love pineapple on my pizza and they do not offer that, not a deal breaker but definitely disappointing. The portions were huge and we had plenty of leftovers. There is also a decent beer draft list which is a huge plus. We would definitely go back here. It was also a great place to take our kids."}
{"text":"2nd time having lou' s. Would have given 5 stars but don't like being cheated $$.  Love the deep dish pizza but here is the problem: 1st time ordered medium \"the lou\" $21.75 very small 2 people ate had 2 pieces left over. Last Sunday ordered another medium deep dish \"malinati Chicago style\" $20.50. Noticed much larger then the first one we ordered. I measured this one 12\". 3 people ate 1 piece each and had 3 pieces left over. REALLY!!!"}
{"text":"I really thought the pizza was going to impress me. But it didn't. For a Chicago joint, Oregano's deep dish is much much better.

Even getting the garlic butter crust, it did no justice. Sticking with Oregano's for Chicago style pizza"}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in town.  Beats all Chicago Pizzeria's.  Highly recommend and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm on a perpetually low carb diet and this is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Why? Two words: Sausage Crust. Oh that's right - they have a pizza that utilizes SAUSAGE as a crust. Is it better than regular pizza? Of course not - pizza is perfection. Does it allow annoying people like me to pretend like she has appropriate food habits by getting \"pizza\" like a regular person who isn't afraid of bread? Yes.

Another great option if you want to look especially sociopathic and actually forego pizza ALL TOGETHER at a pizza place is the Manalti Salad. Guys, this salad is the best salad I've ever eaten. My boyfriend and I have split the family style order, which I believe is meant for 6-8 people, in one sitting and we have no regrets.  Once we were eating it in the bar and no less than 3 complete strangers complimented us on our salad. I've never been more proud of something I had so little to do with.

To summarize: Great pizza, great salad, no bread required. Five stars."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to this place because I love Chicago style pizza. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. I started out with the bruschetta which was very very good. I order \"the Lou\" and thought it was very very mediocre. I can't put my finger on why exactly I didn't like it, but it just didn't impress me. On top of that, it took a very long time to get the bruschetta out which isn't good since the pizzas take 30+ minutes to prepare. Prices were fair and the service was friendly albeit very slow. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Loved it! Just had the whole family together for a great night of pizza and baseball! If malnatis is from Chicago they helped the cubs that note! Go dodgers!"}
{"text":"Great food. I love the buttery crust of the deep dish, best I have ever had. Being able to order it while you are waiting is a great advantage. The service was excellent and attentive. All of the food was cooked perfectly. Only complaint is that the bathroom capacity is a little lacking. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend this place  to anyone. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I drove a long way to be let down by both slow service and pizza that was a big let down and disappointment. After we were seated it took a very long time to even get acknowledged we have our drink order to the waiter and it took over 10 minutes to get are drinks. when I got mine it was diet. had to ask someone else to fix it because once again he disappeared still waiting to place our meal now almost 25 minutes passed and he come back. He seemed very annoyed because we never been here and has a few questions. We placed our order LG Pan extra cheese extra pepperoni easy sauce. our pizza came out and it was awful the bottom was very soggy and doughy could never find our waiter to let him know. we ate 2 slices out of it. Check was brought and we told him the issue and he said want me to box it up. we both laughed and said no it not eatable. no sorry let me get the manager nothing left our check paid no tip and left. hungry and went out to get a real pizza we could eat. waited a lot of money and a lot of time for nothing."}
{"text":"Yum! I'm officially a believer! It took us a while to make it to Lou Malnati's after their new Phoenix location opened (so much food, so little room left in our waistlines), but we had a wonderful time visiting them for dinner this Sunday. 

We got the buffalou (cute) chicken wings, which were wonderful. Just the right amount of tangy spiciness from the sauce, and the wings were big, thick and juicy. The chicken meat literally melted in your mouth! 

The pizza: The Chicago Malnati Classic. Fabulously done with pepperoni thrown on. I think next time I'd just order a regular sausage and pepperoni -- the classic has extra cheese, not totally necessary. Delicious, but let's be real, this pizza is all about the crust. Crunchy, buttery, light, YES.

The two of us ordered a small, each ate one piece, then took the other two home for a midnight snack. Gotta plan ahead for greatness."}
{"text":"Another terrible dine-in experience. That's 2x now.

So let me get this right. Standard on take-out is to cut the pizza in squares...but NOT dine-in??? And I guess standard is to serve it undercooked and doughee...hope I don't get sick - gross! Didn't realize I needed to order it not only cut in squares, but cooked!

And the waitress is completely rude.

The worst part is...I touted this as the best pizza, and convinced a friend to come. So embarrassing; guess I'll be buying, can't expect him to actually pay for this crap.

Ugh."}
{"text":"In order to tell you just how amazingly great this pizza is, I'd have to use a bunch of words that are not appropriate on Yelp.  Stunningly great.  Service was good too.  Do keep in mind that their super-thick pizzas take about half an hour to cook, and the wait is well worth it.

I had them put hot giardinara on my pizza, first time I've tried that.  It was awesome."}
{"text":"We have Chicago roots and this place came highly recommended so we wanted to like it so badly but were disappointed. The place is nice, their wait system is hip, they gave out samples. and the staff was all nice but the pizza just isn't good. The \"sauce\" is nothing but stewed whole tomatoes. It had no other flavors or spices, just huge stewed tomatoes. The other parts of the pizza didn't have much flavor either. DH is a pizza addict but couldn't even eat the leftovers from Lou's, first time I've seen that. We were actually sad that the pizza was so bad. On the flip side, DD had a kid's plate and loved hers."}
{"text":"When the pizza was delivered (shared for two) the Malnati Chicago classic - \"Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust\"... 

I was skeptical.  I often am disappointed in the end product when someplace has been hyped so much.  I expected that here.  I prepped myself for the \"Ok, it's ok - but I don't get the hype\" feeling as I paid the check.

We took our first bites, looked at each other ... and each of us mouthed the word \"WOW\" ... I relished every. single. bite. EVERY. ONE. I was sad there wasn't more to take home with me to relive the experience the next day.  I think next time I'll insist to order a large JUST FOR ME ... so I can make sure I have leftovers the next day.  (Provided they're not devoured during the ride home...)

Other things on the menu?  We did do the three cheese bread.  Perfect.  Were there other things on the menu?  I dunno... why would I look for more?  I may have to figure that out in the future.  But - know this.

I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Crowded! Busy! The pizza is fair (I would recommend baking cheese and butter into crust so it is more flaky and less hard...still missing a Zachary's Chicago pizza in Northern California). It makes up for the poor salad (the lettuce was old and browning). Best part of the visit was the smiling and enthusiastic waitress."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Worth the wait, and the butter crust is a must! 

The parking can be tricky but the staff is really helpful. Cynthia not only took my order over the phone but remembered me when I walked in. (I have a complicated relationship with toppings). 

The lobby was full when I pulled up, which made me worry, but Cynthia was running pizzas and giving customers updates like a champ! Even though some people had to wait a little longer than they liked, cynthia made sure they left happy. She even  got my grumpy husband to crack a smile.

Plus, our pizza was perfect and she was right about not adding too many toppings! Less is more. So happy to have Lou's in the neighborhood, but if you hate small parking lots, do the delivery."}
{"text":"We love this pizza. Went with the thin crust and was not disappointed. The sauce and toppings are the best. The crust is butter delicious and very rich. Loved it in Chicago and taste the same in Phoenix. Hoping they open another location closer to the east valley. The Phoenix location is a good 45 minutes from our house and there are many great pizza places in the east valley. Will go back if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We lived in Chicago for years and the best pizza EVER was Lou Malnati's.  When we moved to Florida, then Texas, and now Arizona we ordered pizza from Lou's and had it shipped in.  When they opened a restaurant in Phoenix we were there on opening day and have returned frequently since even though it's an hour across town. Their deep dish pizza is the benchmark for all others.  We have another Chicago-based pizza restaurant closer to home and tried it--no comparison.  Lou Malnati's is absolutely the best. We get a large pepperoni and mushroom with extra cheese.  Two pieces and we are toast! We take the rest home and enjoy it again. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure why others have rated this so highly. We had the \"Malnati Chicago Classic\". It was underwhelming. The crust was hard and bland.  The service was marginal, not great and not terrible.  Won't come back."}
{"text":"This pizza makes me very, very, happy. Most pizza makes me pretty happy, but this shizz takes the proverbial taco."}
{"text":"Great service!
Great food!
Great atmosphere!

The manager came over told is the appetizer came out wrong and that they are putting in a new one for us. We aren't unhappy with our life so we would have taken it anyway, just nice to see a place holding themselves to a standard. We had both the manager was very apologetic the server was attentive even when she had a large table that was cashing out. Everything came out great just a little late on our beer but it happens."}
{"text":"Pretty damn expensive for pizza
 Don't think I would return 
Pizza very day get extra sauce 
Rather go to mom and pop pizza place"}
{"text":"Finally was able to try the pizza. I was not impressed. No flavor and was not that hot even though the pan was.

Give me thin crust, New York style anytime!"}
{"text":"We tried the thin crust with spinach mix and their homemade sausage.  Pie was delicious.  I already love the deep dish with butter crust , but this was a great option, i didnt have enough blood sugar to wait for the deep dish. My father says it one of the best pizzas he's ever eaten so there's that!"}
{"text":"I was going to give 1 star but maybe it was what I ordered. I've eaten here in Chicago before and at the other Phoenix location many times and was always great. Always got a full size deep dish before because I was with other people. Got a personal size sausage and it wasn't even close. It wasn't thick or deep. It was like a thin crust pizza with a pan crust on the edge. The sausage was thicker than the sauce or crust and barely any cheese on it. $10 for that which is the size of a red baron deep dish from the freezer section was hardly worth it as well. I'm hoping it was just because of the size but for that price it should still be the same. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Really I have nothing bad to say about this place. Apps are good. Salad is good. Pizza is amazing. Service has always been great for us, atmosphere is fantastic. If you go into it knowing you're going to wait awhile, it helps. This is the long, drawn out date night type place. Not the \"omg we have to catch a movie in 40 minutes\" type. You can't rush perfection."}
{"text":"Let me be the first to say, being a native to the Midwest, when I heard this place was finally opening up in Phoenix I was one of the first to order. I did enjoy the food, but it really was not as good as I was hoping. Maybe it's just my expectation was too high, but for the weight and hype I really expected a grand slam. What I got was a ground rule double."}
{"text":"I went for the pizza and was not disappointed. The Chicago Style pie is not very big I ate the one suggested for two people but I thought it was delicious. I probably shouldn't have eaten the whole thing but I did. When I have the opportunity I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"One of my favorite deep dish pizza places. Coming from Chicago, I was definitely not expecting to be pleasantly surprised by deep dish chains existing in Phoenix. Lou's unbroken sausage pizza is the highlight of their pizzas."}
{"text":"\"This is pizza heaven!\" Those words actually came out of my mouth during my first meal at the infamous Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. I finally had a chance to sample their deep dish offerings, thanks to my friend who chose the Uptown location to celebrate his birthday. I was more than a little excited when he chose this destination.

There are probably a fair number of Phoenicians who are irritated with the influx of all things Chicago. What can I say? Either you recognize a blessing or you don't, and you can go back to New York... I kid. Let me just say, this is the kind of pizza I knew existed, and I've been waiting all my life to enjoy.

Perhaps you are familiar with the mostly defunct chain Pizzeria Uno (also out of Chicago). That was my previous favorite pizzeria. I was saddened by their bankruptcy and retreat from Arizona. With Lou Malnati's in the valley, I am no longer sad.

We started our meal by ordering \"The Lou\" (which is their \"vegetarian\" option) before our appetizer. Cook times vary depending on how busy they are. Our pizza featured spinach, garlic, mushrooms, sliced tomatoes and three cheeses. Daniel our server, made a great suggestion to cook it an extra five minutes to get a crispier crust. The crust was unforgettable!

The fried calamari was one of the better versions of this classic appetizer that I've enjoyed. But I cannot stop talking about the pizza! The cheese was gooey, the fillings were delicious! The mushrooms were plump and fresh, and the chunky tomato sauce was awesome. But that crust... I've never eaten a slice of pizza before, where after I ate the crust, that I went looking for more \"pizza bones\".

Not only was the pizza outstanding, but desert was equally impressive! What better way to wrap up a rich meal than with something refreshing, like a slice of Key Lime pie? And Daniel's service was spot on. In summary, I've eaten other deep dish pizzas that finished like a brick. There is something special about Lou Malnati's. Chicago knows pizza!"}
{"text":"My review is based on one lunch time visit and I note I've never been to Chicago and am not the most familiar with Chicago style pizza.

Lou Malnati's is a full service Restaurant and Bar with Carry Out. They are famous for the Chicago Deep Crust Pizza but also offer thin crust pizza, pasta, soup, salad, sandwiches and more. 

They offer patio seating and in-door seating in a fun retro kind of atmosphere with interesting fixtures and bright lights that spell out \"Cheese\".

We got seated quickly but it took a while to get waited on. My waiter apologies and told us nobody told him that he was seated. We ordered our lunch time pizzas and they took about forty minutes to arrive.

While I was waiting I grabbed a plate thinking I'd need a plate for the pizza. I thought at first my plate had soap residue but at closer inspection I noticed the finish has worn off in spots. Not sure how hygienic that might be........I also did notice the condiments seemed all well filled and clean.

I tried an individual all vegetable pizza called \"The Lou.\" It was made with grey spinach mix, fresh mushrooms, unripe roma tomatoes on the top, Lou's vine ripe tomatoes sauce, cheese blend on a very small deep dish garlic butter crust. I liked the cheese blend and the vine ripe tomatoes sauce, fresh mushrooms were very good. The crust was unlike any pizza crust I tasted before. The sides were very thin and very crisp and reminded me of crostata dough. The bottom was slightly thicker and seemed closer to a pizza dough. If I tried to make this dough at home I'd mix crostata dough with pizza dough together. I didn't get much of a butter flavor but the crust almost seemed like it was fried. To me the individual size was unusually small and is possibly the smallest size pizza I ever had out anywhere. I was actually able to finish a whole pizza...I never done that before and usually bring home half of an individual.

My husband had the Malnati Chicago Classic - that is Lou's lean sausage with vine ripened tomato sauce, cheese blend on the butter crust and one piece of pepperoni...(pepperoni might have been an accidental add on by kitchen?) The lean sausage was kind of dry without much flavor. My husband was still hungry after the tiny pizza and could have used an appetizer or salad with the pizza.

A different kind of pizza that is well loved by Chicago and makes Phoenix a little more interesting.

Worth a try!

{"text":"Every time is better than the last.... We love our Chicago classic with the butter crust and well done which is just five minutes extra but it makes the difference of the little crisp on the crust. The thin crust we get is amazing as well. Great service. great bar. great food, great people...."}
{"text":"Went to this joint after going to Huss brewery.  They had a wait time but allow one to preorder pizza. Grabbed a pitcher of beer at Huss then about 30 minutes later table was ready. Sat ordered a salad and some drinks salad came ate it up then pizza was ready promptly. Service was hella dope kept the refills coming and boxed up all leftovers promptly for us. Pizza was solid salad was hella good . Get your ass here and experience delicious."}
{"text":"Great location, cute decor and the BEST pizza - just like Chicago. Staff are friendly, helpful and it couldn't be better!!  Can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to be snobby being from Chicago, I knew it wasn't going to taste as good. I got the Lou with sausage and was extremely disappointed. It was chewy and the crust was soggy. I was hoping for a decent pizza but this was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better. I had the Malnaties deep dish and a pepperoni thin sliced pizza. We had the spinach stuffed cheese bread as an appetizer.  We had our 3 kids with us and sat outside. Great environment! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait. The deep dish and wings are amazing. Staff is very friendly. When wait is long the staff hands out bottled water and samples. 
Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.  We love Chicago-style pizza...Enough said..."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday at 3, a party of 4. We waited for about 45 minutes to be seated. Unfortunately the waiting area is not very big and does not have much seating, so we stood for the entire time. Also, they had garage-style doors by the bar that were open letting in the 108 degree heat, so we were hot and uncomfortable the whole wait. We ordered our pizza ahead of time and we're finally seated. We started with the Malnati's salad, which was very good. The dressing was sweet, it had crispy salami bits, gorgonzola cheese, mushrooms, olives and tomatoes. Definitely try this salad!!! We also tried the spinach stuffed bread, which was good but not really a very large portion for four people to share. We had the Malnati's Chicago classic pizza, medium size, and we all had enough. The sauce is very simple, tomato and garlic, probably salt. It's delicious and rich. I could eat it plain. The crust was thinner than I expected, but so good! Almost pastry-like. The service was good. We enjoyed our food, but the wait was uncomfortable and unorganized. I don't mind waiting, but at least provide a comfortable place for your customers to wait."}
{"text":"We've been to Lou's in Chicagoland numerous times over the years. We order the same thing every time. This AZ location has the exact same delicious food we have come to expect. Great salad. Have to have their thousand island dressing. With your pizza have low fat cheese with the butter crust. The location and decor is quite different from Lincolnwood, IL and Buffalo Grove, IL but the food is identical! Hallelujah!!! Great service too. Thank you Malika!"}
{"text":"Our first pie. OMG. Heaven. Sauce on top was garlicky and delicious. Crust was buttery and beyond amazing mmmmmm. We are in love!!! Thanks for delivering to Medlock Place! Yay hooray"}
{"text":"Lou's in the valley!! 
Since I am in Chicago about five times a year, I have gotten to know Lou pretty good. Daughter recommended them when I am in the area. Now I live in the west valley, been trying to find a good pizza joint since we moved here from SoCal about six years ago. We have a couple of places that are good, however nothing to brag about.
Since I work in Phoenix, Lou's is pretty close to me. So it works out! I decided to order carry out. Place looks awesome, they have a huge outdoor area. And the pizza? Taste as good if I bought it from Chicago! Love their deep dish butter crust! The ripen tomatoes add a great flavor. Glad they chose to have their water filtered the way it is in Chicago. Don't think the Phoenix water would have worked out. They went the distance to make this work here, and I hope it works out."}
{"text":"Really liked Lou's. Great spot to enjoy a great Chicago style pizza. Really nice décor, great patio seating, and good service. You can order your food ahead of time if you want to speed things up or wait and enjoy some time with friends and family. 

We got Lou's classic deep dish. This was an excellent pizza. 

I just love the greater Phoenix area for food. So many good choices, this adds to it."}
{"text":"It's just as good as the ones from Chicago. I eat here almost every week and I'm thankful they moved out here. Sam and everyone at the bar always take good care of us and I appreciate it."}
{"text":"went back today for a 2nd try. this time i had pene marsala recommended by our really fine wait-staff tim. my friend had bowtie pasta and that too was super

then we had the small chocolate chip pizza - perfect!
pleased this time

all around i saw people sawing away at their pizza's - the crust really looks as tho it is not twice baked but 3 times baked.

again i can't speak highly enough of tim, our waiter

{"text":"About 10 years ago, I had the privilege of eating some deep dish pizza from one of the Chicago locations of this famous pizza establishment. At that time, it was some of the best pizza I had ever eaten, if not THE best. Since I live in the greater Los Angeles area of southern California, there really aren't any choices for authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza (there are a couple but nothing that even compare to this). While on a trip to Arizona last October, I saw an advertisement for a Lou Malnati's Pizzeria that had opened in Phoenix and knew the next time visited Arizona we would make it a point to go there. So, back visiting here again, we went there last night for dinner and, the pizza was amazing! From now on, whenever we're in Phoenix for a family visit, we will be sure to dine at this there for their awesome pizza."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at this restaurant four times. The experiences have been so varied that it is hard to review the restaurant. The things that have been consistent are long wait, bland pizza, and some sort of mistake made by the staff that is rectified by free appetizers.

There are a number of stories I could tell about this restaurant and are different experiences. I've been there by myself, I went with my family twice, and I went with a big group once. I would not recommend ever going to this restaurant with a big group. Yes they are busy and that's a good thing. But they have yet to figure out how to manage large groups. For the most part they should simply say they don't seat groups of that size. For instance, we were a group of 14 and waited two hours for a table.  Again, not a problem if they tell you up front and ultimately seat you at an appropriate table but that has not been my experience.  

The pizza seems like it is going to be great but in a town with Pizzeria Bianco you gotta bring your A game.  I've been to Chicago a number of times and these pizzas are a far cry from the wonderful flavors of that City.  

The staff always tries to make up for shortcomings.  They are attentive and pretty friendly.  They seem to be trying hard to make up for bad situations but at some point only so much can be done."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix on the way to LA. The Pizza and Meatball Sandwich are delicious. Cristina, our Server, was excellent waiting on us. I will order another \"Lou's Classic\" online and get it shipped. 

Please give it a try when in Phoenix. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place and I'm glad I did. We waited for about an hour, but they let you order before you get your table so it's ready faster. We had a large group and ordered the Lou, the malnati Chicago classic, and a pepperoni. We also ordered the spinach salad and a house salad with the creamy lemon garlic dressing. The spinach salad was pretty good but tenge house salad with that dressing was so good! It was creamy and flavorful and a nice change from ranch. I would order the house with the lemon dressing again for sure. The pizza came out fairly quickly and I was really impressed. The Lou was my favorite with all of the vegetables, but the malnati was also really good. The sausage was flavorful and fresh and the sauce was nice and chunky and not too acidic. Everything tasted really fresh. The crust was awesome too. The pepperoni pizza was good, but not as great as the other two. The pizza was thick and hearty like deep dish, but it wasn't greasy or heavy like some deep dish pizzas can be. The prices were also reasonable. It was about $24 for a large pizza which would easily feed four people."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is highly raved about. I would say our experience was nothing special. I like the way the bar is set up and the outside patio looked comfortable. We sat at the bar, the bartender was nice, he seemed busy. We decided on the classic Lou with pepperoni and sausage, he said it would take 35 minutes which makes sense for a deep dish. When we got to eating, it was just an average pizza. The only \"deep dish\" part of it was the crust which was too hard to even bite into. They gave us a good portion of sausage but barely any pepperoni. For the price you pay, I would try somewhere else.

Side note: our phone died and we needed a charger for just a minute so we could order an uber to our hotel :( we asked the hostesses and they said \"oh, i think everyone has iphones\" and didn't care at all. I understand it's totally not their problem but I worked in the restaurant industry for years and if someone had asked me that I would have asked the servers or cooks if someone could help them out real quick. We walked next door to creamistry and they were more than happy to charge it for us. Oh well."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious but the service is always awful. The servers are understaffed. Everything is so slow. 20+ minutes for a drink to get delivered to the table. 50+ minutes for Pizza to come. Don't ever come here if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!!! One slice of the deep dish will fill you up, and it's delicious!! Even the salads are good!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"So thrilled for Lou Malnatis to join us in Uptown Phoenix. Having ate here in Chicago many many times, I can honestly say the quality is the exact same. So delicious! Only reason I give them 4 stars is I feel like the timeliness between entrees and appetizers can be a little better. I understand that the pizza can take about 30 minutes to make, but we have had instances when our appetizers came out with the pizza and we couldn't take time to enjoy both."}
{"text":"Looking it moved here from the chi five months ago these was the first place I ordered from loyal customer"}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing Chicago pizza to Arizona.  Best pizza ever. My life is now complete!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to Lou's opening. Granted I'm not from Chicago and wasn't terribly familiar with the purported \"Chicago style\", but was hoping it would be a good substitute for Zachary's Pizza from Berkeley where we are from. We picked it up to go last night and got a deep dish with some veggie toppings and butter crust. The gal taking my order by phone sounded like a ditzy teenager and was not knowledgeable about the menu or particularly helpful. Every question I asked was relayed back to someone else before replying. We also ordered the Malnati salad. When we got the pizza home I found it pretty under cooked, pale, anemic and soggy on the bottom. It didn't really seem very \"deep\" for a deep dish - kind of sad actually. A thin layer of cheese and sauce - more of the crust than anything else. It had a strange metallic taste - canned tomatoes?  And really needed salt. Overall very blah. The salad was generous and fresh - the medium was more than enough for two people to share and I liked the dressing. My two stars is based mostly on the salad and cutting them a bit of slack because maybe I just \"don't get it\". I'll stick with my wood fired pizzas from Bianco and Parlor. Oh well..."}
{"text":"This deep dish Lou Malnati pizza really really is very very good.  The salad vinaigrette is vinegar base with sweet deliciousness over the freshest bowl of veggies ever.  Service is friendly and courteous.   Amazing, Sport tv's,  children and family atmosphere works very well together.  Great place to bring family, especially on Sunday after church."}
{"text":"Was so excited for the opening in Arizona. I have been craving their pizza since my trip to Chicago when I was 12.  I have not had the time to go to the location to eat so decided to order for my birthday dinner,  and I have to say that I'm glad I did. Delivery was quick, food was hot and very well protected. Pizza was steaming when I opening the box. Couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner.  Have order a couple times since and always great service. If you are looking for an authentic Chicago style dinning this is the place for you. 
Thank you for finally coming to Arizona!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience original Chicago deep dish go to Lou malnatis I found this place while traveling for work and they deliver I got a pepperoni deep dish butter crust for 33$ worth every penny I've been to Rance's in Costa Mesa and I must say Lou Malnati's Pizzeria is the definition of Chicago style"}
{"text":"Been to Lou Malnati's in Chicago. I can say the deep dish pizza at this pizzeria tastes exactly the same as in Chicago (great job matching the ingredients and pH of water). Pepperoni and sausage go really well with the buttered crusted pizza. My only complaint is the very sweet tomato they use for the sauce. That has an overwhelming flavor compared to others. But ya it keeps them apart from other joints.
Sidenote be ready to wait a good one hour if you are looking for tables. I always do take out; still the pizza is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Nice, authentic Chicago deep dish pizza here in the heart of Phoenix.  It was crowded when we went (well - when isn't it actually crowded) - so we sat at the bar.  The bartender/server was great - the pizza tasted like I remember from the few trips I've made to Chicago."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive.
I loved the bruschetta! We got the Lou, and it was good, but not great. This was my first experience with a deep dish pizza, and I'm not a fan. We got the butter crust, and it tasted kind of cakey. I won't be ordering a deep dish again. Perhaps the thin crust is better?"}
{"text":"We did carry-out of 3 large butter crust pizzas (cheese, sausage,  and pepperoni).  All exactly the same as back home.  Years ago we found that heating up the slices in a medium heat fry pan brings the pizza back to life.  It takes a little bit of extra time but well worth it. 

Last night we all simply couldn't wait and ate the first piece right out of the box.  Delicious but the crust had softened and cheese cooled in transit to the East Valley (no surprise). Reheated the second and 3rd slice in the frying pan and it was spot on.

Welcome to Phoenix and thanks for the slice of heaven from our homeland!

The carry-out process was very efficient. Order online and select a pickup time.  We were in and out in approximately 5 minutes."}
{"text":"HOLY @?$!& this place is the real deal. I pride myself on being a pizza connoisseur (I even have a pizza sweater that makes me look like a walking slice) and this place does NOT disappoint. It's a must try. This is definitely a pizza pie by the very definition and it leaves you feeling more satisfied than your regular hand tossed slice. You will find yourself day dreaming about wanting more days after. The quality of the cheese and sauce is an indulgence but the best part is the magical yeasty crust (like the way homemade bread tastes right out of the oven.) I have yet to have had a better deep dish experience. Pizza lovers rejoice!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here and now it's my favorite place to get pizza . I've had deep dish from many places and the pizza is usually soggy or doughy. Not this place. It's beautifully crispy at the bottom and perfect in the middle.  And I love that once you're full but still dying for dessert , they have these tiny but perfectly sized portion cookies with ice cream on top. Once you go here for deep dish pizza, no place will hold up."}
{"text":"Really tired of the \"Chicago Water\" talk..could not care less. The Pizza is the same as in Chicago. Staff is fantastic..had a great meal for two for $26.00."}
{"text":"Delicious and many GF opinions to choose from. 
I had the sausage and pepperoni. The size was perfect, the sauce was perfect and the guess what the service was perfect. We always had ice tea refills without a single mention. 
Lou Malnati, two thumbs up. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Simply the best.  Get deep dish buttercrust with extra cheese.  You can get it well done or gooey.  The Malnatis salad is the best salad I've ever had.  Get the cookie and ice cream dessert.  

That's all you need to know.  Stop reading reviews and go get the best deep dish pizza on earth.  Just like Chicago."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn't busy and we were seated right away and received prompt and courteous service. We got the thin crust (butter crust) with green peppers and it was delicious. The pizza was cooked to perfection and the sampler tray (had mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms, fried cheddar cheese, etc) was delicious, too. It wasn't quite as good as in Chicago, but close. I would definitely recommend Lou's in Phoenix to anyone looking for a good pizza."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time, I had heard good things and they were open later then most pizza places. Till 11pm on a Friday night. It was myself and a friend, we ordered \"The Classic\" deep dish pizza. Figure any deep dish pizza takes about 30 to 45 minutes to cook so plan on being there for a minute. The pizza is definitely worth the wait. The service was a bit lacking, the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars. I had asked for 40 minutes if they could change the channel on the TV closest to me to the game, I asked multiple times. It did not happen, apparently only the manager has control of this via an i-phone app. To touch on service when the waiter came by and refilled my already melted water tea mix with more luke warm tea. No Ice. It's called Iced tea for a reason, you would think the waiter or busboy would have a bit more common sense. I had to ask for a whole new glass, then when I asked for some ice tea later toward the end of the evening they told me they were out. At this point I asked to speak to a manager. And they start to clean up and refill the parm shakers and before they are even closed. Which I think is a horrible practice. Like, hey I am eating here, I don't want you reaching over my food to refill the sugar container and other items. I never did see the manager, just some women who said she was out from Chicago and was the server trainer from corporate and they still had some kinks to work out. She was pretty friendly. I would say this is more of family oriented restaurant. Pizza is good. But I can't see it being a regular spot to go to. Would definitely do pick up thou."}
{"text":"Caleb was our server and he was excellent.
My one and only reason to want to dine here is because I saw in other reviews that they have a crustless pizza (suitable for keto/low carb diet).
So this pizza, instead of having a bread crust, it is make on a big sausage patty. The only down side is that it needs to be eaten with fork and knife... at least for the large version. Maybe the individual version can be eaten holding the slice.
We were lucky and arrived here before the lines started to form. We were seated right away (Saturday, 4pm ish).
The place is big, but did not get very loud. It was nice level of noise to keep a conversation going.
Overall a good experience. It is awesome that they have a low carb option."}
{"text":"WOW. I do not understand the hype here. We ate here around 2-2:30 on a friday afternoon. Everything started off great! The host was super nice, we expected to have to wait in a long line and we were pleased at being seated right away, and our server was also very sweet and helpful. We were told that pizzas were taking 45 minutes so we might want to order a starter. We went with the combination platter, which was a mess of fried stuff: mozzarella sticks, cheddar bites, mushrooms and zucchini. This tasted like something dumped out of a freezer bag, fried, and then heated under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. Both cheese varieties were hard as a rock on the outside and strangely dry and flavorless on the inside. The mushrooms were unpleasant and the zucchini was about what you might expect from maybe a Tastee Freez. (Oh, who am I kidding, Tastee Freez zucchini is delicious.) We sent it away without eating much of any of it. Then the pizza came. It smelled great, but that was about it. The bottom crust was not quite cooked all the way and was nearly indistinguishable from the cheese, which was chewy and lacked flavor. My first piece had almost NO sauce, and some flabby pepperoni. I ate part of once slice and then tried a second slice that looked like it actually had some sauce. The sauce was good, but that was about it. All in all I ate about a half a slice of a small pizza. We spent almost $40 on some over-friend junk you could get at a fast food place and pizza that we barely ate. It was quite a disappointment. Obviously, we won't be back."}
{"text":"OMG, all my pizza prayers have been answered!!  I got a medium, butter crust, with sausage and onions for the toppings.  DELICIOUS! The flavor was outstanding, seasoned to perfection...total party in my mouth!!! The only thing that about killed me was the almost 3 hr wait I had to endure once I ordered my pizza on line.  That is okay though!!  I am so pleased that you all are here in Phoenix! Incredible customer service once I arrived, and even more incredible flavor!! I give you guys a BIG W for the win!! I think I love you, lol!! Until next time!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to prephrase this review by letting everyone know that we live in San Diego and drove to Arizona to fufill my husband's Chicago-hometown-pizza-craving (yeah, we're crazy, don't judge us). 
I love Malnati's in Chicago and this place was no different. Half the staff and managers (Like the wonderful Rodney that served us) are actually transplants - talk about authentic!! 
The service was wonderful and the ambience was casual and very cozy.
I got the gluten free pizza while my husband got the classic deep dish and we both were so happy and full. The gluten free pizza was bigger than I usually get at most places so that was a nice surprise- yay left overs!"}
{"text":"Thank you people of Chicago for bringing my favorite deep dish to AZ. Gino's East can suck it! Anyways, this is what you order: Spinach Bread, Malnati Salad, The Malnati Deep Dish, The Lou Deep Dish, and the cookie. It's a hell of a lot of food to take down but the leftovers are great and the price is just as cheap as it's in Chicago, so there's nothing to worry about. I will say that the decor is stepped up a bunch of notches from the original locations in Chicago. I like it, but also enjoy the old school feel of the Chicago locations. To each his own? The staff was super friendly. We ran a few issues (water spilled on our pizza), but they rushed us a new pizza and comped our entire meal (totally not expected). Because my sister doesn't like deep dish she opted to order a thin crust...not my favorite but hey they specialize in Deep Dish here so that was expected. However, my mom and her enjoyed it quite a lot. Also, I know I said get the salad. If you're not a salad person, trust me, this will make you a salad person. My friend who is a self-proclaimed salad dodger absolutely loved it. The bacon and the dressing really make it shine."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it five stars. I've eaten at the restaurants in the Chicago area a couple of times, and don't think this one compares. Stuffed into a corner of a strip mall, it's not exactly easy to find. I got a lunch plate which consisted of a side salad, a personal pizza, and a soft drink. I asked that the salad not come with onions, but it did anyway, and the server never noticed. The salad was also drowning in dressing, way too much, and way too strong. More or stronger doesn't equate to better. The personal pizza was pretty small, but for the price for the whole combination it was OK. With the meal and a 20% tip my lunch came to about $12.00. Seems a bit high to me for a pretty minimal meal.

As far as the ambience of the dining room, it's lit by some funky colored lighting that just didn't seem to compliment the space. There were 3 or 4 large screen TV's in there and they all had the same football game on. Guess the manager likes football.

I say go, and hopefully you'll get lucky and be more impressed than I was. It could have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Decided to get out of our comfort zone and try a new place for dinner. We decided to go on a Saturday night and was well aware that we would have a wait but they do have a great system down for sure. You put your name on the list and then go order your deep dish pizza since it took about 50 minutes to make/bake! We got sat on the patio which was fine because of the outdoor heaters and we ordered the zuchinni appetizers to start. Soon after our pizza arrived. We ordered the large knowing we wanted leftovers. It was very good and so was the service."}
{"text":"I don't need to say that this is great Chicago pizza! There were no surprises here, just great food. We had the Malnati's family salad with 2 classic pizzas. There were five of us, so of course, we had plenty of leftovers. This was not a hardship because we wanted to bring home lots of pizza. We also bought 2 frozen ones. We live about 45 min away, so we needed to stock up!"}
{"text":"Love Lou's. Sat on the patio with friends and had another great meal and time. Thanks team LM's. See you again soon."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they are here...so good and just like home. I am glad they aren't right around the corner from me or else I would get pretty hefty. I always have the best experience and most delicious food."}
{"text":"YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes yes yes yes. Yes to everything! This place is busy & popular for a reason!!!!

The wait for dinner on a Sunday was about 25-30 minutes which was totally okay for us. They're fairly new & popular.

The classic Chicago pizza was delicious. It says on the menu the large deep dish (comes with 6 slices) can feed 3-4 people. This wasn't true for us. We ended up getting chicken wing appetizers & ordered one each of their two most popular pastas thinking the pizza wouldn't be enough. To our surprise, a slice of the deep dish was actually filling. It's like lasagna thick. Super filling. I struggled to finish one slice after appetizers. We literally didn't touch the pasta. We ended up taking it home (which by the way, was deeeeelicious!!!! Even after refrigerating & throwing it in the microwave the following day).

Overall: this place is a MUST try in Uptown Phoenix. Delicious food. Great service. Very nice location. I'm in love. Los Angeles needs a Lou Malnati's!!!!"}
{"text":"I will start the review by saying in more of a thin crust, Neapolitan pizza guy. With this being said, this deep dish pizza truly did take me by surprise. We ordered the Chicago classic deep dish with butter crust and added pepperoni. There is a ton of cheese on their pizza but I'm never gonna complain about too much cheese. Sausage and pepperonis were flavorful. Crust was buttery and crispy. Just a heads up, don't come here if you are in a rush. These deep dish pizzas take some time in the oven. I would say that it took at least 35-40 minutes to get our pizza. Mozzarella sticks were awesome too! Their ranch dressing is fantastic on them and on the pizza too. They have a nice outdoor patio with misters as well. I would definitely return for some authentic deep dish!"}
{"text":"Tasty Pizza but still so so very busy. Look forward to less waiting. I like the fact they have pizza to go (you cook).. They also have a wonderful vinaigrette dressing that they sell for take home."}
{"text":"Omg!!! So I was mad hungry and wanted something good. Never been to this place until now. Might I say the food BOMB! ASF! Like this is my new fav spot to get a drink and some delicious food for a cool price (Under 30 with a drink, apps an entree). Also it's really cute and love the look of the place. Yes I will be back!"}
{"text":"DELISH! Come hungry and be prepared to wait! We went Sat @5:15 thinking it would be easy to get a table. We waited almost an hour! Got some drinks and put in our pizza order at the counter ( great concept so you don't wait as long at the table!). The sat us and we ordered the wings (both delicious) and the family size Malnati salad. Both were really good, salad dressing on the sweet side but really good! There were 6 of us and we hade one large deep dish pep with buttercrust and a med. thin crust cheese. We brought home one piece of deep dish so it was the perfect amount for 6. Sauce was tangy and very flavorful and the crust was SOOO good. VERY good food and excellent service! We will return soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for some late lunch with my family and food and customer service was fantastic!  However, after we had our appetizer( house salad;it was ok not the best, I'll order a different one next time;))the pizza we also ordered took a while to come out but that's ok, it ended up tasting really delicious and super cheesy!! I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"This is delicious Chicago Deep Dish!  

We got the The Malnati Chicago Classic.  Which is typically made with a \"full layer\" of Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  I asked for chunks of sausage instead and they said that would be no problem.  It came out perfect and our server said she orders it exactly the same as we did.

The sauce is perfect, not overly seasoned and extremely fresh!  Cheese is also excellent (fresh hand shredded and melted to perfection!).  The crust is awesome as well with a great yeast / butter flavor.

If you haven't tried Lou's, do yourself a favor and get there asap!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday night,waited and hour no big deal. Ordered an iced tea and a house salad to go with our pizza. I wasn't told the iced tea had some floral flavor couldn't drink it. Waitress called me honey,dear and even dude.forgot my salad .we old I stop in again maybe,at best will stick with my neighborhood pizza joint"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and the amount of cheese they put on it (I'm a cheese lover) makes it amazing!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Best Damn Pizza Place Period. No debate on this. This place has the best pie in the valley. They have effectively brought the Windy City to the desert. If you want a taste of Chi-town, you want to eat here. Their classic take on Chicago style pizza is one of the best Chicago style pizzas I've ever eaten. This place is in another stratosphere  in awesomeness when discussing the best pizza restaurants in the valley, all of Arizona for that matter. Had to wait an hour for a table but it's okay, just head over to AJ's and browse around for a lil bit. Plus they allow you to preorder your pizza so it can be ready when your table is ready. It's a lengthy wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best of the best from its great location, charming decor, impeccable order, phenomenal staff, fabulous service, professional and hospitable atmosphere, and of course amazing taste!!!

Thank you CHICAGO!  You came here and brought all this with you.  Thank you.  Class act."}
{"text":"We ordered a Small Deep Dish Chicago Classic with fresh basil and garlic. While we waited we enjoyed the Lou's Bruschetta which was the best I've ever had. Pizza came out looked awesome however had an over kill of onion instead of garlic and barely any fresh basil. Had the pizza came out how we ordered my review would have probably been better because it was a good pizza. When the mistake was brought up to the waiter all he did for us is remove the fee for onion. We left dissapointed. His excuse was he could not find a manager. On a Monday evening? Really? This place did not leave a good first impression."}
{"text":"I've been to Malnati's twice for lunch with my hard-to-please grandmother. Both she and I agree that their salads are excellent. I've had their personal deep dish cheese pizza and wow, it was tasty for sure! We have also shared their lasagna and again, very tasty! The food is great quality and you won't be disappointed. Although the ambiance is not very tasteful. You can practically hear what the couple across the dining room are talking about. Grandma, who is already hard of hearing, would have preferred a quieter atmosphere. All in all, it's a great place to bring some rowdy, hungry friends."}
{"text":"Great food, even better service!! Pizza tastes EXACTLY like Lou's in Chicago. Tatiana Z. was our server-a group of 8 hungry girls-and she handled us with an amazing friendly attitude and fantastic service. Every time she came to our table she had a smile on her face and literally didn't forget anything we ordered. Will definitely be back and I hope we get Tatiana to help us again!!"}
{"text":"Food was good! However, hostess Diana couldn't have been more rude. Rolled her eyes several time for basic requests. Server Sanait was ok but wasn't of much assistance. Kitchen messed up every order we put in though. Put onions on salad even when asked no onions. Put whip cream and cherry on pizza cookie dessert even when asked not to. Gave us no discount or dessert or anything after they screwed up our order several times. Idk if I will give this place one more chance."}
{"text":"Seriously the best deep dish pizza I've had in my life. I was soo happy when I found out they were coming to AZ and it did not disappoint. i love the deep dish sausage with the butter crust...delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place....Just moved here and had a couple of eh experiences with Chicago Deep Dish. Was very excited when it opened and the pizza was PERFECT!!! It's worth the 40min drive but open one in Scottsdale please :)"}
{"text":"Just got back from Mulnati's and thought I would write about the experience. First, let me say I don't often give 5-star reviews because I'm afraid it can actually hurt the business, as it may set impossible expectations. However, in this case, a 5-star review is deserved for the reasons explained below.

First, let's talk about location. This is the first Mulnati's opened outside of Illinois. I appreciate they selected a central Phoenix location. I would have expected a Scottsdale location, or Chandler or Gilbert. Choosing an east side or west side location as their first Arizona location would have been a mistake, as it would be discouraging for someone living on the opposite side of town to make the drive. Being in central Phoenix means its about equally distant from everyone, regardless of what side of town you're on. So they get a star for that.

Knowing Mulnati's has only been open for a week, we knew it was going to be crowded and very busy. There was no way my wife and I were going to endure the experience on a Friday or Saturday night. Instead, we went on a Sunday. Knowing they would open at 4pm, we got there by 3:15 and about 40-60 people were already lined up. The weather wasn't too hot and we were in the shade. Surprisingly, they started seating people at 3:30pm. So, the line started to move. About 15 minutes later, the line moved again. That's when I noticed owner, Marc Mulnati, talking to people waiting in line. That's a real treat to see the owner there. Definitely worth a star!

They have outdoor seating, and if anyone was willing, they were more than happy to seat you outside, regardless of your place in line. We waited. It was our turn right at 4pm. We were then let into the restaurant where they took our name and our cellphone number and were told it would be about a 10 minute wait for a table for two. About 10 minutes later, they called our name. They asked if the high-top table in the lobby would be okay. I didn't want to sit there because there is a lot of foot traffic and people waiting for their names to be called to be seated. I said I'd prefer to sit in the dining area, as I don't want all these people standing around watching us eat. I was assured this was not a problem, and we were finally seated in the dining area.

I know from eating at Mulnati's in Chicago that these pizzas take about 40 minutes to cook AFTER you order them, so we ordered right away. My wife ordered the 'individual' house salad, and we ordered drinks and a small deep dish pizza with pepperoni and mushroom with the buttercrust, of course!

The 'individual' salad is huge and could feed 3-4 people. My wife is very particular about her salad dressing and was very skeptical that their vinaigrette dressing would be as good as they claim.  She was mistaken - and admitted it was awesome! (I don't eat salad so I can't say.)

My concern about the pizza was that it wouldn't be the same as I remember from Chicago. After all, the water in Phoenix is horrible, and while the recipe might be exactly the same, the difference in the water could make it taste completely different. 

I'm happy to report they actually filter the water and when the pizza did arrive, it tasted exactly like it should! I also learned they have 28 pizza ovens in the back! And just like in Chicago, they serve Coke products (not Pepsi!) all of which earns them another star!

They had a lot of employees working! This was another concern I had, that employees would be stressed out dealing with the crowd and the service and quality of the pizza would suffer. All of the employees seemed calm and happy to be there and not stressed out or over-worked at all. I've never seen so many employees and upper-management asking if everything is okay. They really DO seem to care that you are having your expectations met and WANT to fix it if not. That's another star!

I don't feel this is an honest review unless I have some suggestions for improvement. I wish the pizza was served piping hot. It was served hot, but not like my experience in Chicago where you'd burn the roof of your mouth if you didn't wait. This tells me the pizza must have sat at the pass for a few minutes before it was served. Secondly, I'm sorry I ordered the mushrooms in the pizza, as they didn't cook at all. If the mushrooms were sauteed first, that would have made a difference or if they placed the mushrooms on top of the pizza. 

But for the good news, the sauce is amazing. The crust is amazing. The cheese is amazing! And combined, it's better than sex! Seriously, they should install mirrors over the dining room tables! That's two stars on its own! Even the pans they cook the pizza in looked used and seasoned! 

Total cost was less than $40 and we had to take home 3/4's of the salad and half a slice of pizza. (My mouth wanted to eat it, but my belly was full!)

Arrived at 3:15pm. seated by 4pm, paid the check and left at 5:05pm.

Dinner: $40 
Meeting Marc Mulnati: Priceless!"}
{"text":"Completely overrated!!

We waited for 40 mins to be seated and then got a table in the waiting areas as the wait for inside table was another 30mins. Tried their signature butter crust deep dish pizza and honestly it was a let down. Having lived in NY for many years I do have preference for thin crust pizzas but usually I do try local food whenever I travel. I definitely have had better deep dish pizza when I have travelled to Chicago. The original Pizzaria Uno & even the Lou Malnatis in Chicago tastes way better than this pizza. 

Was a total let down esp. due to the long wait. I don't think I have had to wait so long in any other restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I got an pepperoni mushroom and sausage deep dish with butter crust. I ordered an sausage and mushroom deep dish disappointing Lou's I know you can do better."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Just like Lou's in Chicago. What a great find. If you're into Chicago pizza this is the place to go. You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh man when I heard that they were opening a Lous in PHX I was all in. I typically visit Lous once a year during baseball spring training. If you're a fan of REAL Chicago deep dish then this is the place. 

I've eaten at the original Lous in Chicago and it tastes the same which was surprising and delightful. The best pizza ever!

I believe they even import the water from Chicago!"}
{"text":"First experience of the deep dish pizza was disappointing . However I went back for a redo with my friends and this time the pizza was on point. One of my friends is from Chicago and knows what a deep dish pizza should look and taste like. She was even impressed with the taste of the pizza.
The crust was crispy and the cheese was melted just right."}
{"text":"It's become an okay place to eat.... It's not all crack out what is said to be. I been here several times since it's open & the pizza quality seems to have dropped little by little every time that I have come here.."}
{"text":"A beatifully located pizzeria on central and camelback. A mid century modern decor and a nice outdoor seating area with heaters and a long fireplace outside. Also misters for the hit summer months.
 was greeted emediatly by a nice receptionist. sat in the outdoor area.
  water was brought to the table without asking very nice touch. Menus were legible and a wide selection available to choose from .
  Fair pricing and affordable.
we order a deep dish sausage for 2 took about 30 minutes very fast for a deep dish. 
Had cheese sticks and marinara were generuc nothing to brag about.
 pizza was like i ate it in chicago.great job."}
{"text":"I am very familiar with Malnati's having eaten at the original in Lincolnwood many times.Pizzeria Due and Malnati were always my favorite. 
I have not tried the one here in Phoenix because I was waiting for the pizza pans to get seasons. 
Well today was the day. It was as great as it always was. What a treat.
Deep dish only with sausage."}
{"text":"This place is so busy but the food was fabulous. My sister and I ordered some hot wings and oh my, the wings are made so perfect. Just enough amount of sauce and cooked just right. We had the \"lou\" and that one had three different types of cheese, some people would love that but I just preferred less. My fault for not reading the details more carefully. The Malnati salad is so so so delicious. It's so tasty and the greens are super crunchy. I just didn't like the blue cheese, but once again my fault for not reading it more carefully. The prices are reasonable, love the decor because it just feels so cozy. They bring all their supplies and ingredients straight from Chicago!!! Even the water!!! They have a cute little bar and also a great outdoors seating with a mist system for the hot weather. Come check out this place if u want to enjoy some great pizza straight from Chicago."}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place 5 stars mostly because of the food. The deep dish pizza is soooo good. But the server was training and she came off really rude to the trainee.  I felt kinda bad for him.  I asked for no ice im my bevs and got a bunch of ice and My table didn't get any refills of our drinks and it took forever to get the bill. But the food was too good tho make it a bad experience."}
{"text":"Danny (not Donny) is the BEST! Great food, incredible service and a lot of fun. Get the cookie first and work your way back. Yum!"}
{"text":"Did I just pay $30 for a reheated frozen pizza???  I didn't check Yelp before ordering, but the crust was soggy and the sausage was a weird texture, so I decided to see how other people were faring and I see other people mentioning frozen pizza.  If that's the case, I feel duped.  Either way, the pizza was bland, the crust added nothing to it and the sauce created a watery mess on top.  It wasn't frozen though, was it??  There's no way.  It can't be.  Right?!  If so, I'm going to open a restaurant serving Lean Cuisines and charge $20 a plate."}

So what's the rave about this place!?  Well as I entered this restaurant the place was popping! We had to wait for about 30 minutes since I came with a friend.  The layout was really opened I thought with a large patio and the center bar connecting it to the \"waiting room\"; since there was a main dining room to the North.  

We decided to start with a bottle of wine as we sat; which I had to educate the server how to uncork, but also explained how to pour.  No big whoops!  We proceeded to order the Malnati Salad to start and the The Malnati Chicago Classic for our entree.  The salad came with romaine, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami, romano and gorgonzola cheese and tossed with a sweet vinaigrette.  Overall, a good start to our dinner since it wasn't too heavy, but also I would say very basic salad.  I would have loved an element of crunch like caramelized walnuts or some seeds.  Our Malnati's pizza came with sausage, some extra cheese and tomato sauce on a buttercrust.  The mozzarella cheese was definitely stringy and cheesy to the bite and the sausage was salty and chewy as expected.  What really popped for me was the tomato sauce, which they claim is vine-ripened tomatoes, but it had an aromatic punch with a slight hint of marinara taste.  The crust was different since it reminded me of biting into a cookie, but a different taste of course.  However, I would attribute this texture that is so alluring about Lou Malnati's pizza.  Somewhere in the psyche of our mind, I'm sure this bite triggers something in our heads that makes eating this Chicago style deep dish delectable! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"WOOOOHOOOOO. I went to Chicago last year and went to Lou Malnati's and left wishing they were in Arizona.  Well the day finally came, I went there today for lunch.  The BEST PIZZA.  Great service and nice atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious, what's with everyone liking stuff because it's from Chicago? We get it, you fly the W. You're on the Blackhawks Bandwagon. You relocated for economic reasons but may or may not even be from there. 

But I can forgive all these when you bring your delicious pizza. Let me tell you, deep dish is *amazing*, so when everyone *swore* Lou's was he end-all-be-all, I set my expectations high and made it a priority to try this out. 

What's awesome about this place is that despite being thousands of miles from its other locations, it still manages to run like a well-oiled machine. You can order for pickup in advance ONLINE, which for some reason is too difficult for a lot of their competition. You can also swing by and pick up an uncooked one on a whim and bake it yourself. That's totally choice. 

Service and atmosphere are spectacular! Everyone here is a pleasure. So why do I give it just 3 stars? 

Well, I've just got some reservations about the pie, is all. Here's a list. 

-Sorry, the crust is rock hard, and that's not really a good thing. Yes, I get that it's unique, and I don't mind a bit of crunchiness, but this is like a brick! It was much more enjoyable after spending a night in my fridge. =)

-The crust is flavorless. Yes, even the buttercrust, and I'm far from the first person to have this critique. I have no idea why people rave about what an upgrade it is, it is the most tasteless crust I've ever had from a premium pizza parlor. Are there consistency issues or something? 

-I don't think there's much diversity in toppings here, at least not compared to other Chicago-style spots. The pepperoni is lame, so don't bother. The Lou was marginally better, but I guess the only one that matters is the Malnati Classic, which I should give a try. Really though, there are like four options here, which is lame considering so many other places can have a solid dozen premium toppings. 

-They're pretty small for what you get. Everyone at the table needs to agree to one kind of pizza so you can go big, otherwise you might feel a bit shortchanged. 

Overall, I know I'll be back because pizza is pizza. They are doing plenty of things right. But is it this legendary pie you should go out of your way for? Not really, our deep dish scene would continue to do just fine without it."}
{"text":"I love Lou Malnatis. Had some delivered today. I live a few mins away from the restaurant but was too lazy to drive. Pizza arrived after an hour and 30 mins.. We ordered sausage and pepperoni deep dish pizza which is my favorite. Wish pizza didn't arrive late"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had!! I ordered takeout for me and my team while working late one evening. Sadly, my work was 1 mile outside of their delivery radius, so I had to go pick it up. I even offered to pay extra to get them to bring it to my building, but no luck! It made me sad to pick it up because after I saw how busy the bar and the restaurant were (Friday night), I really wanted to eat in!! Talk about FOMO. 

We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza, thin crust. Lou Malnati's is known for their high-quality ingredients and I can tell you that the sausage was very fresh and worth every penny. The slices were cut skinny enough that I didn't feel guilty about eating 4 of them. My coworkers got buffalo wings on the side. The wings came with bleu cheese dressing and they said the dressing was SO GOOD! They wouldn't shut up about that dressing for the rest of our shift at work.

Don't miss Lou Malnati's for their deep dish pizza (great in the restaurant, but not so great as take-out). But, definitely order thin crust if ordering to go. Enjoy the pie!"}
{"text":"I need to make this disclosure, I'm from NYC.  Not sure if my family and friends will disown me, but damn great pizza!!  It takes all I have to fit another slice of their signature pizza in my mouth because one slice is enough, but the flavor beckoned me for another.  WIth the pizza aside, you MUST have their house salad glazed with their homemade dressing.  Ok, I've gone there just for the salad....it that good!  Bottom line, they do pizza great and accent it with a fantastic salad."}
{"text":"We were visiting Chicago and someone recommended Lou Malnati's. The deep dish pizza is one of the best I have ever tried if not THE best. While there, we found out the had just opened in AZ. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to visit Lou's for some time and finally had the chance.  I must say I am not a big chain kind of guy but really was pretty impressed with our dining experience.  The wait which I heard could take forever was only about 15 minutes and when ready, staff sends text notifying you it is your time to dine. Nice technology. Staff were all helpful. Our waiter served my party of 12 each of their slices. Nice touch. As for the grub, our appetizers were great.  The signature \"Malnati\" salad was awesome and house salad very good. The spinach filled bread loaf was good as were the wings. As for the pizzas, we tried three deep dish. The two signature pies and a cheese were good. Not amazing but good. Overall, had a nice meal and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"They delivered to my house several times. Now they say they won't deliver to my house anymore. I'll get Geno's from now on instead."}
{"text":"The staff was very kind, but our pizza was disappointing. We got the thin crust and the toppings were sliding off the pizza because our dough was so undercooked. We even saw another customer who came back to complain about his pizza and they gave him a remake. The location on central is 10 times better and we will be making the drive to go to that one from now on."}
{"text":"the food: 
amazingly delightful deep dish pizza. i drove down from flagstaff to treat my dad to some pizza. we ordered a deep dish with pepperoni, sausage crumbles, onions, and tons of cheese. every ingredient on the pizza was delightful. i am usually not a big fan of onions but the ones here are sweet a juicy. the pizza comes with plenty of toppings, meaning one slice is enough to satisfy you, and a second slice means you need to avoid any sharp corners and be rolled out to the door. 

the setting: 
tucked back into a busy and hip parking lot, the space is huge. with an enormous outside seating area and a huge indoor dining room, it feels like an authentic pizza parlor.  

the staff: 
super friendly but very direct. no extra fluff. we were initially seated behind a table of very loud guys, so i asked if we could move. the waitress immediately prepared a different spot for us and escorted us over. 

overall: 
amazing place!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to score tix to their soft opening tonight and I cannot tell you much I have been anticipating this. I've been a Lou's fan since I was a kid eating pizza at their original Lincolnwood, IL location. When it comes to pan pizza, it has to be Lou's buttercrust.

I normally go for cheese only, but opted for the Chicago Classic this time - buttercrust pan pizza with sausage. Just as good as it is in Chicago, maybe even better because I can get it in Phoenix! Had the small Malnati's salad, enough to share for 2 or even 3 or 4, it's huge! They have their own house dressing, on the sweet side and delicious!

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Would have given you 5 stars and that would be for the Pizza. The 2 Lou's were spot on but the house salad family size was maybe 2 stars. What about all the topping red cabbage, carrots, roma tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions and croutons that was slim to none. This is the first time I ever had a bad experience at a Lou's.  We drove over an hour  with friends and that was a bit of a let down after I have been bragging about Lou's to them for a while."}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza in AZ period. I got the most basic...plain old cheese with regular crust (not butter crust) and it was ridiculous good. Very happy they finally came here from Chicago where I used to eat it whenever I was there."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it!!! The service was great!!! We started off with the wings and garlic cheese bread. The wings were delicious! The bread was good, but not great. The pizza was wonderful!!! I wish they were closer to where we live so we could go more often."}
{"text":"I was a Giordano's guy when I was growing up in Chicago, but Lou Malnati's may have just won me over. First off, if you go for lunch and get the lunch special deep dish pizza it's not going to be as good because they have them pre-made and ready to go for people who need a quick lunch on their lunch break. If you have the time order a fresh one, pay the extra dollar for the buttercrust(it's worth it) and get extra sauce if you're a \"sauce guy\" like I am. Add whatever toppings you want, I just keep it basic with pepperoni but you can't go wrong with anything. The apps are pretty good too, and I believe their ranch is made in house, delicious!"}
{"text":"Lou Malnati's seems to carry much hype.  Sadly, undeserved hype. Would love to say this place was a great place to get some good Chicago style pie, I just can't. Having spent a part of my life in Chicago I don't remember Chicago Deep Dish with such little character.

What's up:
The decor is awesome if you get to the back of the restaurant. An impressive lit up marquee sign that says \"Say Cheese\" warms up the room and is inviting.  The pies... sadly don't deliver. The dough is of course deep dish, but the sauce is simply the biggest shortcoming of the place. We ordered three massive pizzas, all under seasoned and had no character. The toppings were not impressive nor did they work with the cheese to help that 70/30 dough-to-everything else ratio. The mozz sticks app was no different from direct from a grocer's freezer.  Everything else is simply typical, side salads, drinks, silverware, service etc... just feels no different from Chili's or a TGIF... 

Verdict:
The deep dish aspect of Chicago style pizza in the valley is simply a good gimmick to get folks in the door. For those who like the Italian that Olive Garden delivers... you might find the Chicago that Lou Malnati's delivers. It's sadly not a place people who know Chicago-Style pizza would keep on their go-to list. Pass if you are expecting great Chicago-style pie, great for large groups where you're just gonna find yourself nibbling."}
{"text":"Over 20 years since I have eaten a Malnati's deep dish pizza... Still sets the bar pretty high! Where to start?! Our appetizer was the spinach bread and it was extraordinary. Hot melty goodness in a bread that is uniquely Lou's recipe very similar to the butter crust that sets this place apart from all others.  The marinara dipping sauce was also exceptional. We had the Chicago butter crust pie and it was delicious! The extra cheese makes all the difference, God bless America's Dairy Land (Wisconsin for those unaware). The restaurant is still very busy at all times, but totally worth the wait. Keep in mind this is NOT a New York style pizza, if you like thin, soggy, cardboard flavored crust, I suggest you go elsewhere.  Deep dish is uniquely Chicago and it is thick and hearty. One slice is very satisfying, two will have you sated for hours! 

This week I tried a delivery thin crust pizza and was not disappointed. I ordered online and it arrived quicker then promised and was piping hot. I will probably order well done in  the future (an extra five minutes in the oven) the \"just right\"  really was just that,  but I'm a crispy edge guy and I'd like to have the middle pieces stay crispier longer! The toppings and sauce were fresh tasting and plentiful, the crust was tasty and again the unique texture I have grown to know as Lou Malnati's. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and could not wait for Malnati's to open in Arizona. Love the sauce and the butter crust. Great pizza at a great price. There still seems to be confusion and to many employees congregating at the front host stand."}
{"text":"Great deep dish! The wings were perfect. I like how they let you choose the way you want the crust on the deep dish. Sitting at the bar is weird though because the TV is super hi... and I'm not short."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people who loves Chicago style pizza and haven't found anything authentic outside of the city. I was so happy to see Lou's come to Phoenix. There are a couple things that people need to know. This isn't your typical pizza. It's thick, layered, cheesy and there is a layer of tomatoes on top- not cheese. Don't worry- there's plenty of cheese on the inside!  These pizzas take a while to cook- so expect a wait time. But they are so good- and authentic. I don't like sausage, but Lou's has a thick sausage layer in their signature pizza and that flavor certainly adds to the experience. Plus- the butter crust. Need I say more?  Butter crust!  It's the closest thing to Chicago that I've found so I appreciate that they are here!"}
{"text":"We came here after checking out the ice cream place next door. The combo appetizer was amazing. We split the Lou special pizza - deep dish and it reminded me of true Chicago pizza. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try Lou's out, being a wanna-be pizza connoisseur.  Made the pilgrimage from Chandler on a Saturday night, and had the expected 45 minutes wait.  Really wanted to be impressed, but just wasn't worth the drive or the cost.  Deep dish is my thing, but the crust was disappointing, kinda flavorless and a bit dry.  Toppings were good, but it was just alright.  Might go again if I lived close, but I think I'll just stick to Oregano's and Jet's when I get that thick crust craving."}
{"text":"The Malnati Chicago Classic (Deep Dish) is the most amazing pizza.  Pure perfection!!!"}
{"text":"A 30 minute takeout order took approximately 1 hour. I had to wait at the small pick up location without anywhere to sit. A lot of other people were waiting too, so it was really cramped. Once I got home, I realized that my order was messed up. I don't eat meat and my pizza was loaded with sausage. Total bummer. The thin crust pizza is very good though. I prefer it over their deep dish."}
{"text":"We have been here like 3 times. We actually really enjoy the pizza. The deep dish (Chicago-Style) pizza has to be one of my favorite kind. Love the place and definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"A few years back I had the opportunity to try Lou Malnati's in Chicago I was so glad when they finally arrived here in Phoenix my experience was equally as fabulous. We ordered the classic deep dish and the sausage ratio to Pizza is incredible the butter crust is nice and crunchy just a wonderful pizza in my honest opinion, for dessert the deep dish cookie was a nice finish."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! We love having a taste of Chicago here in Phoenix, and it is just as good as back home. Don't forget the buttercrust!

The bruchetta is also worth a try. Great flavors with the garlic bread, olive oil, and tomatoes."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza ! The staff is pleasant , helpful with ordering, wait time and checking back to ask if everything is OK. We need a Lou's in the east valley."}
{"text":"Giant pie, giant line-up.  Great ingredients and a terrific crust.  Make sure to order the deep dish done right."}
{"text":"Busy on a Monday evening - many larger parties having a good time.  Food was served warm, not hot.  Server was rather involved with other tables.  All in?  AN ok experience.  Would I go back?  Yes, but I recommend sitting at the bar v. a server."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.
Salad, wings and pizza were all phenomenal.
I always enjoy going."}
{"text":"After eating here, you will forever be hooked on their flakey buttery crust!  This pizza is way more than delightful-it's freaking incredible.  You know a pizza is good when you dream about having it.  Here is a suggestion:  try the wings with the sauce on the side!  They are crispy and delicious and you can't stop eating them so don't order a bunch or you will never make it to the pizza.  You must try this place.  It is worth it and the food will make your tummy love you!"}
{"text":"It so funny to visit this spot after having been to one in Chicago. This one is so hipster and the Chi one was so chill and nothing spesh. But the food is the same and thats what matters! We were accustomed to ordered a box of 6 Lou's every few months and while the frozen ones are good, nothing beats hot and fresh, made to order. We did the Lou's special pizza and the Lou's salad. Way too much food for two people. As per usual, the husband's eyes were much larger than his belly so he ordered an enormous pizza (and for newbies, this pizza is like two pizza's on top of each other) and really could have been happy with one slice but just had to muscle down that good slice for good measure. The good news is is that the pizza heats up really well for leftovers. Fun spot, cool vibe, bomb pizza!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Lou's! Really beautiful casual restaurant with a large patio. They have a nice bar when you walk in. Happy hour was from 3pm-6pm. We came in with 11 of us. They do not take reservations but luckily we got seated quickly. Pizza takes 30-45 minutes so make sure to get your order in as soon as you can. Our server was excellent so she was continuously checking in on us and answering questions. I think her name was Kiara. 

We started with the buffalo wings. They come breaded/fried but we had the option to bake them instead(take a little longer). Both were extremely good! The wings were big and the sauce was very tasty. My family got a large Italian salad that they said was delicious and huge. It looked yummy. 

Hubby and I have been doing a low carb Keto diet so we went with a \"Crustless pizza\". This is not on the menu but  the server said it wasn't a problem. They make the bottom crust with a large sausage patty and then add the cheese, marinara sauce, and your choice of topping which we did pepperoni. It was actually really good and super filling. Only need about 2 slices to fill you up so 2 people could share a small crustless pizza. It reminded me of mozzarella and marinara meatballs. Everyone else split a deep dish pizza and it all looked super delicious. 

If you love Chicago style pizza, this is a great place to go! They have a ton of options on the menu for everyone to enjoy. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"First time here trying this place out. First off, it was a 40 minutes wait to get in here at 4pm on a Monday. If that is any Indication of how good they are, then it must be worth the wait.  They cool thing is that once your table is reserved, then you can order. We did that and ran over to AJ's and grabbed iced tea to wait it out. Wait wasn't bad. Staff was great and customer service was excellent. 
On to the food. I'm from California, so I am not schooled on proper deep dish. That being said, it was delicious. Great mix of ingredients and a great cook. 

We will come back again for sure"}
{"text":"The pizza is fairly good here. But it is not worth the wait. The wait was not unpleasant due to the fact that we were able to grab drinks sit outside and enjoy ourselves but there are so many other places I'd rather wait an hour and a half for pizza."}
{"text":"Hello, the pizza was ordered well done, it it did arrive that way. Ordered two pizzas and it tasted like it they were previouly frozen and reheated. Not impressed, service okay. Buffalo chicken salad interesting and calamari  again not great. I will keep searching wish, I picked a different resturant. FOR two people bill was 65.00"}
{"text":"Nothing makes your day like being away from Chicago and having someone ask you to go to Lou's!

A- Chicago pizza is always better
B- having a destination location be nearly as good as the original is a rare and should be cherished
C- how could you not!?


Drinks:
Tried the Valley Negroni & it was amaze. Strong, but refreshing.

Food:
This Lou's ACTUALLY resembles Lou's! Got the classic bc who messes with a good thing! It was as good as ever. A lovely morsel of the Midwest in the SW.

Service: 
Someone had to flag down our server after we sat at the table for 15 mins. After that, however, he was super attentive, had a great sense of humor, and created an enjoyable dining experience.

Ambience:
This location had a suburban or college town feel. Great for catching a bite with friends or perhaps a family dinner."}
{"text":"My husband has gone here a few times and raved about how great it was! We finally had it ordered in for pick up so I can try it. The pizza was delicious how everyone describes.. However I want to rave about their customer service. There was an issue with the oven so when my husband was there to pick up he had to wait an extra 20 minutes. Before he even asked what was going on, the manger came out and told him how sorry she was for the wait and mishap. Not only was she apologetic, they comped our pizza and gave us a free one for next time. What a great establishment and they definitely know how to keep loyal customers."}
{"text":"Having been to one in Chicago, we were super excited to give this a try a couple weeks ago. We knew it was going to be super busy so we went a little later than we wanted to try and avoid some of the dinner rush. When we got there it was about a 30-minute wait. Their app for seeing your wait time was awesome but it was longer than they quoted, by about 15-minutes. We know how long the pizza takes so we preordered when we put our names in. So we waited 45-minutes to be seated and it still took about 45-minutes to get our pizza once we sat down. I am pretty sure they forgot to start the order so we were starving by the time the food arrived but it was as delicious as we remembered and we will still go back."}
{"text":"Not a big pizza eater. I don't dislike it enough to go hungry if that is what is there. When I am eating pizza and I get to choose it will be a thin crust New York style. My friends, one from Chicago, said I had to try Malnati's deep dish pizza and it would change my whole outlook on pizza. It really didn't. I got to try the deep dish and the thin crust. I preferred the thin crust but, to me, still no wow factor. 

I did get to order my favorite Italian dishes. A green salad and a bowl of pasta. Now we're talking! I got the small house salad and the Chicken Louie.The salad was fresh and the house house Red Wine Vinaigrette was good. The pasta was delicious. The 5 of us also shared a pizza cookie for desert. Speaking of sharing, people must eat more in Chicago.  I gave away 1/3 of my salad and still had plenty. I also gave up some samples of the pasta and still had enough for a really big lunch. Also nobody with the small deep dish pizzas were able to finish one. Suffice it to say you either bring a friend to share or plan on a carry out box.

You want to bring a friend or friends anyway. With a party of 5 we waited about 20 minutes for a table and then another 30-40 for the entrees. We got our drinks and salads/appetizers fairly quick. And dessert came about 10 minutes after we ordered it because it is baked as ordered too. All in all we were in the restaurant over 2-1/2 hours.  Service was really good."}
{"text":"OMG the Classic deep dish is the best! The salads are pretty good too!

Definitely my favorite place to have pizza!"}
{"text":"Went back with an oth pizza bc of out last experience. This time it was cooked perfectly. Apps were delicious and I usually get ranch or Caesar but we opted for their house vinnegrette which was bomb. Over all great experience this time around."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Not only was the food delicious but it is so pretty inside! You have to try the Bruschetta! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I heard all the hype about this place and decided to check it out.  There were 4 of us in the party. We got there around 12:30 on Saturday and the place didn't look overly packed.  We had to pre-order our pizza and put our name on the waiting list.  There was a 45 minute wait.  We finally got seated and the waitress confirmed our order:2 pizzas and a salad.  It took another 45 minutes to get our pizza even after we had pre-ordered it.  I was beginning to wonder if they only cooked one pizza at a time.  Once we got the pizza, I didn't care for the crust.  It was deep dish but not what I was expecting. Wasn't doughy at all.  Also didn't care for the sauce. It was big stewed tomatoes in liquid-was very bland.  My cousins ordered the pizza cookie for dessert and they enjoyed that.  Despite the yummy pizza cookie, I Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I had never been a huge deep dish fan... then I tried out Lou's. Great staff and ambiance, INCREDIBLE pizza. I'm not sure what is unique about their sauce but it is the best I have ever had. Highly recommend the sausage( with pepperoni added on). 
In my experience they overestimate the wait-time by A LOT. (Each time I've been told it's a 50-90 minute wait, but have never ended up waiting longer than 10-20). Really appreciate being able to pre-order while waiting for a table. Thank you for branching out to Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Lou! Where have you been all my life?! Chicago! Thank you for FINALLY coming to Arizona and exceeding my expectations. I thought there is no way you could be as good as home, but everything was perfect. The sausage was delicious and the buttercrust melted in my mouth. Cheddar cubes were even on the menu! Mark Malnati was greeting everyone and the staff was passing pizza slices and bottled water to all the people waiting for tables! Now that's service. I have my Portillos and Lous. All I need is Superdawg and the only reason I'll have to go back home is to visit Wrigley! This Chicago girl is one happy camper. My waistline won't be happy, but I'll be back again and again and again!! Thank you Lou!! I love you!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite! I cannot live without it now! I crave it all of time. My favorite is the sauce it is amazing and best flavor. The cheese and sausage is on point! Can't say enough good things about the flavors and ingredients. We love sitting outside it's just such a nice place to enjoy a meal. Service is always great! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Damn good deep dish pizza.  Crust is buttery but not greasy.  We did the sausage and could only eat a couple of slices before we were stuffed.  Wait staff is ok.  Guy who was our waiter was a little odd, but we ignored it and got our reward which was pure deliciousness. 

Pizza was about 30 minutes to cook which was about what the waiter told us.  Cheese bread was really good.  Only negative I found here was it was super loud.  It was busy but a couple of times I thought wow this restaurant is loud.  I can't wait to come back and try their thin crust varieties."}
{"text":"Pizza is to die for (especially the deep dish) and pasta is a solid option as well. I wish they had a Caesar salad option, would definitely make a traditional and classic addition to a truly amazing restaurant. Way to truly represent Chicago."}
{"text":"Ok, so I lived in Chicago for 10 yrs and treated myself to a personal pizza once a month, so when I heard they were coming to Az, I flipped! I waited until the craziness died down and finally ordered a large deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms for the office. I had been telling them about it for months. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed. Way more bread than cheese. It might be hard to see more than the little string, but it was mostly bread, a layer of sausage and pepperoni and sauce. For $33....sorry guys....wasnt worth it. Better luck next time I hope!"}
{"text":"So glad we had the chance to finally try this place out. We tried once before at dinnertime, but the lines were insane, so we bailed. Today we came when they opened at 11 a.m. and were seated immediately. My entire family loved our deep dish pizzas, and this is why:

*Our server (Daniel) was from Chicago, and he gave us excellent advice. He recommended that we order the pizzas well-done, which meant the crust was crispy instead of soggy. He also recommended the garlic butter crust, as well as adding pepperoni to the not-too-spiced sausage. 
*We learned that Lou's recreates that special Lake Michigan water, instead of using Phoenix water in the crust. They also use tomatoes and mozzarella from the same special providers they have used for 40+ years. Obviously, Lou's cares that their finished product tastes just as good as what you would find in Chicago.
*The pizzas were simply delicious. We also tried the three cheese garlic bread, since the pizzas take about 30 minutes to bake and we wanted an appetizer. (Yeah, we're kinda stupid. Cheesy garlic bread before deep dish pizza is carb overload, but I have to say - it was terrific!)

Since we live out in Mesa, I guess I should say I'm sad that this place is so far from our house. But maybe it's for the best, as we might want to come here too often!"}
{"text":"My first ever Malnatis pizza after years of living in IL and countless trips to Chicago, shame on me.  Only pizzas that rival in my book are Pi in St. Louis and Papa Dells in Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding ... Our server was Donnie and he was amazing ... We had a party of 11 including 3 young children and Donnie was amazing... The service was flawless....will definetly return every time we visit Phoenix ... We are from Tucson!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from Lou's twice now. The food is delivered on time and piping hot! The delivery fee is only $3.00, which is the best deal in town compared to those food delivery apps that gouge you. I had never had Chicago style Deep Dish pizza before and was truly glad I did. The Buttercrust is the best and the sauce is so fresh! Love their Salads too. You have to try it! We are hooked now. The new store opening in Arcadia can't open soon enough for those that are not in the Central delivery zone."}
{"text":"This girl loves her some pizza.  It's difficult to find pizza I don't like.  There are different types of pizza.. you have the thin greasy NY style pizza which I looove, but then you also have the thick Chicago style that is full of cheese. Both are fabulous. Lou Malnati's is Chicago style. Thick, full of cheese, sauce, toppings and flavor.  All of the pizzas we ordered were tasty. 

I was expecting this to be the case. However I was not expecting to be absolutely blown away by the best salad EVER.  We all kept passing the salad around in amazement. I found myself actually eye balling the salad even after the pizza came. Haha.. how often does that happen?  

The staff was very kind and we had a wonderful waiter. This was overall a pleasant experience and we will be back. I liked the decor and feel of this place. You will have a good time here."}
{"text":"I came across this place with a friend when we found ourselves needing to pass some time and grab some sunshine. I noticed the hip patio with misters which seemed super relaxing especially with their plush seat cushions, booth style, my favorite. I brought my little pup Stella to relax under the table accompanied by some fresh water the lovely waitress brought us. Attracted by the happy hour options (menu pic below) we found ourselves ordering 'House Chardonnay' ($5) which was exactly as expected. Drinking up an appetite, we then ordered the 'Trio of Dips' ($8) which was amazing. It comes with pizza chips, which grew on us after a couple of bites since they are not your usual dipping option, and three delicious dips all ranging in flavor to touch on every taste bud. After realizing we were a still a bit hungry we ordered the Small Deep Chicago Classic ($15.50) for 4 deep dish slices, keep in mind these do take about 30 minutes or so, so if you know you're going to get one & time is of the essence, let the waitress know ahead of time, or don't, and wait it out and relax in the chill ambience of the patio! All was delicious, I can admit I did have higher expectations for the pizza. It is a butter crust classic which to be quite frank I'm not sure I noticed a difference, and the crust is actually quite thin, taking away from the deep dish concept. I even added some crushed red peppers to spice it up a bit and add some flavor since I thought it was lacking a tad.. In all, I would return, the service was great, the patio was amazing, I probably would just choose a different entree option, the food looked delicious it was just lacking flavor, in other words something with more pizazz."}
{"text":"I got to try Lou's delivery and dine at the Uptown Plaza restaurant twice before it officially opened and the pizza is every bit as good as the hype builds it up to be.

The crust is like the best savory pie crust you've ever tasted- it's flaky but firm, and buttery. It has to be strong to hold up to the volume of cheese, sausage and tomatoes on the Classic, because it's a lot of goodness heaped into this 'za! The flavors are not overwhelming, not spicy, not full of mysterious herbs. The sausage is mild, but like the tomatoes and the cheese, it's absurdly high quality and left alone to shine without much more than some fresh garlic, salt and pepper. You can, of course, add parm or red pepper flakes to your desired tastes.

Lou's cheese bread appetizer is enough for 6 people, with marinara for dipping. Salads are really good- the dressings are outstanding. Lou's tiramisu- not the typical trifle- pulls the cocoa, coffee and mascarpone confection's flavors together nicely and it's enough for two people or maybe four.

The portions are generous here, noticing that theme?

Decor has a lot of mid century modern look to it and it's a really cool and groovy space that fits right into this part of Phoenix. I'd like to steal stuff for my place, if I'm honest. Bar stools and light fixtures, then the tables. 

I got a tour of the kitchen during one of my visits- four dozen pizza ovens, all expected to be going at once to keep up with demand from diners and to-go orders. They've brought in experienced crews from their Chicago stores and plan to expand aggressively in the Valley Of The Sun. Gotta wish them well on that because I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. I felt like our server did not want to serve us. Food was not very good also. Definitely will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now and have been very satisfied with the food.  Three drawbacks:  1.  The wait time no matter what you order.  They try to alleviate this issue by having you order before sitting down at your table.  The food is excellent.  2.  The prices are a little high for pizza, especially if you get the thin crust.  3.  The last thing is the noise.  Very difficult to hold a conversation at your table."}
{"text":"Culinary catastrophe. Ordered pasta in cream and ground beef sauce. Literally no flavor. When the server asked how it was, I said it was boring. She was so sweet and offered to bring me something else, so I gave her the dish and ordered the buffalo chicken salad. It was the grossest salad I've ever tried to eat. Old lettuce in the bottom (slimy, rotting) blue cheese on watermelon, and chicken drenched in chicken wing sauce. I don't know who thought of this one, but my opinion is, they shouldn't be in a commercial kitchen. The server again took it back and graciously took it off the bill. I just said forget it, I'm striking out. She didn't need to, but she then brought a small take out pizza for us to take home. What a nice young woman. She saved the day and is the reason I gave any stars at all. Service was outstanding and she tried to make it all better. But seriously, I'm sticking to the pizza."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I can't say that I have seen any Improvement in the food. While the decor is spectacular, and I enjoy the raised booths, there is something missing from the food I order.

The last time we had a chicken alfredo and it was super Bland and the chicken was rubbery so I didn't order it this time.

Due to some scrumptious pictures of the calamari on Yelp I order that tonight and while the calamari was nicely cooked  the breading itself lacked any seasoning or flavor.

We are not fans of deep dish though our companions are , so we ordered a thin crust, and found that the cheese got cold easily and hardened faster than we could eat it, probably because it was cut into so many pieces.

We also asked for the lou Malnati salad without dressing on it and it came with dressing anyways. 

The experience was worth it because of the company we were meeting with but I don't think that we would return on our own accord because of these reasons."}
{"text":"This is the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. It's crazy how good it is! Everything about the pizza is amazing. The sauce, the cheese they use, the crust....I'm craving it right now as I'm writing this review. 

Now I've only gotten take out online so far but it's been great every time. The staff has always been nice and pleasant even though they're dealing with a constant rush of people, lining up to get the amazing wonderment that is their pizza sent down from some kind of pizza god."}
{"text":"Some of the best deep dish pizza !  The wings are great too.  Tip. Go early they open at 11"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Though I've never been to Chicago, I heard this place is the real deal from a guy that lived in Chicago.

All I can say is, \"best pizza ever!\" My wife thought so to, and she is not a pizza lover, but she absolutely loved it.

Since they just opened last week, the wait time is quite awhile. We opted to sit at the bar, as it is open seating and got a seat in a minute. Much better then an hour wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great service, got seated quickly, and our pizza came out fast (we ordered ahead, as usual)

Pizza was just as good as Chicago! Which is a great thing!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday lunch with a group of 5. Luckily, we live close and I thought it would be a great idea to get here right as they open to avoid the lines. When we got here, we were seated right away. The restaurant didn't start getting busy until noon so we got lucky. I was reading reviews of lines and wait times and I hate waiting. 

Our party decided to order family style: large bbq chicken salad and a large pepperoni deep dish buttercrust. The salad came first and it was full of flavor. Everyone enjoyed it. The pizza usually takes thirty minutes from the time you order so we waited a few minutes after we were done eating the salad. Once we got our pizza, our waiter served each of us a slice which I thought was nice.

The pizza was heavenly and so filling!!! One slice was enough for me. We ended up still having 2 slices left that we boxed up to take home. Prices are extremely reasonable. Everyone in our party loved the experience: the concept, ambiance, service and definitely the food!!

As we were leaving, I noticed you can purchase pre made pizzas to bake at home."}
{"text":"The three of us all originally from Chicago had to have Lous while in town from San Diego.  We had deep dish we wanted the one with sausage but there was a mixup on our part and got the veggie instead because the names of the pizza were mixed up and got confused.  Our waitress Cynthia was great and made us the sausage deep dish and took the veggie off our check.  She was on top of it this past busy Friday night and gave some of the best service I've had in the industry.  The manager Alexis was very nice and even made us 3 individual sausage pizza pieces to go with our leftovers.  The food and service here were top notch!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Okay ordering was hard because of all the internet stuff and not the easiest location..
But the taste it was like being in Chicago 14 years ago well worth it if I was in the area I would be an addict... the crust, The Taste. the texture ...everything was exactly as I remembered it and better cuz it was for real.. and I didn't have to wait till I get to Chicago to have it..
If I wasn't traveling and I were going to be in the area I would come back because I know that the lasagna and everything has got to be just as great...
Other places try to do deep dish pizza but I got to tell you....Lou malnati is still the best.... I've been trying every deep dish pizza I can find for the last 14 years"}
{"text":"I don't think you can ever go wrong with pizza especially not here! The only deep dish pizza I've ever had and will continue to have! I also enjoy their wings very much the only down side is that they never have enough sauce I always have to ask for additional sauce on the side or else they're just way too dry. Skip out on the cheese sticks too which is sad to say because I love cheese sticks but they just had an old taste to them. But the pizza and the service is always spectacular!"}
{"text":"Lou's is fantastic!  We went on a Thursday at 5:00PM with a friend and still waited about 15 minutes as every table inside was full.  We were offered immediate seating outside on what looks like a beautiful patio, but it was just too hot to enjoy.
We left at 7:00 and the place was packed, every table inside and out was full and it was about an hour wait at that point.  I recommend getting there early!

We were seated at a comfortable booth big enough for four people.  It is a trendy modern decor but still warm an inviting.  They did a really nice job.  The only downfall for me was the restroom situation.  They have one single bathroom in the lobby.  With a packed house, its slightly awkward to ask people if they are waiting for the restroom or a table.  It is also very subtle with just a M/W on the door, so imagine the weird looks I got when asking because people didn't even know they were standing right next to it.  (Perhaps there are hidden restrooms behind the closed doors to the kitchen, but I was directed to the one in the lobby.)

Moving on to the good stuff...
We started with the regular size Malnati Salad.  Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits and gorgonzola cheese with our Sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese. $8.75  |  Family size $12.95
This salad was excellent. Crisp lettuce, fresh ingredients, delicious! I couldn't stop eating it.  This size was perfect for two people.  

For the main event we ordered the medium Malnati Chicago Classic.  
Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  It's authentic Chicago!

Personal (serves 1) $9.35
Small (serves 2) $14.95
Medium (serves 3) $19.95
Large (serves 4) $23.95

We added pepperoni to our pizza, but truthfully it didn't need it.  The pizza would have been plenty flavorful as is.  I would imagine this is why pepperoni isn't on it to begin with.  This deep dish favorite is fabulous!  Loaded with cheese!  Highly recommended!  The medium easily serves three people as shown.  It is cut into six slices, we each had two and took two home.  Perfect!  

They do offer other things like pastas and sandwiches, but why would you not have pizza?  Especially deep dish pizza!  They do offer thin crust, but I wouldn't do it!  

Sorry I can't report on dessert, just didn't have room!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza person by any means! I'm the type that can only eat pizza once a month and never crave it, ever. I'm more of a pasta person but Chicagos deep dish pizza came to Arizona, and being from Chicago my friend and I decided to come try this place out. I grew up in Chicago but never tried this pizza joint because pizza wasn't my thing. 

My overdue Chicago deep dish pizza experience: it was amazing! We ordered some bruschetta for appetizer and a 2 person 'The Lou' pizza. It comes with spinach, mushrooms, and a ton of cheese and tomatoes and extra deliciousness! 

I was honestly surprised I enjoyed every bite of that pizza and I believe I over indulged as I needed to unbutton my pants afterwards. It's not your ordinary pizza and it will blow away those of you that don't normally go for pizza either. 

The service here is 5 star worthy! Our server was very friendly and explained that he is from Chicago and moved here 6 years ago. Once he heard Lou Malnatis was opening up, he quit his job and decided to work here. 

I accidentally spilled my beer as soon as I got it and EVERY worker was rushing to our table to help and ask if we were okay and asked if they could get me a refill. I can't say enough how they all worked together to get everything tidied up! One guy came to mop, another came to clean and dry the table, someone brung new plates and utensils, and two ladies at different times came and asked if they could bring me another beer. Excellent service! 

I'm curious to try their pasta next! Way to represent!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! I love the classic Lou so much- butter crust, gooey cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and slices of juicy tomatoes. It's so good! 

The Eat24 delivery option is great, too. Super prompt, and with the low minimum and delivery fee you don't have to spend a ton of money to get a great pizza delivered!! Thanks, Lou's!"}
{"text":"I might have had very high expectations of this place so when I actually had the opportunity to try this place out I was a bit underwhelmed. Is the pizza good, yes it is. Is it amazing? Uhhh not really amazing. It's just a standard pizza. There's nothing about it that stands out to me. I did enjoy the service. Our server was new but he was doing a fantastic job making sure we were taken care of. It was a bit loud in there but otherwise a nice experience."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is phenomenal!! I am originally from Wisconsin and would often times take trips to chicago just for this pizza. My husband and I moved to AZ a year and a half ago and we have probably been here a half dozen times. Needless to say, I was STOKED to learn they had a location in Phoenix.

We get the same thing every time...the deep dish with butter crust. It's so good I can't imagine ordering anything else. I have tried their soups and appetizers and those are always great.

My only recommendation is to get there early as there can sometimes be a wait. Also, be prepared to give yourself about 45 minutes before the pizza comes out. They take a while to cook but I promise you they are well worth it! 

I am excited to see another location has opened up and would love to visit there also!"}
{"text":"Not quite as good as the Chicago OG one my gripe was the pizza was a little cold and the Calamari was a bit soggy and cold also."}
{"text":"3/5 Stars.

When you first walk in, it's unclear to as where to be seated. We waited at the hostess stand for several minutes, to be informed there was ANOTHER hostess stand further into the dining area where we would need to check in to be seated. (Which now several people had passed us, and another line had formed) There are no clear signs informing of where to check in.

Pizza: We ordered the classic deep dish, their signature dish with added pepperoni. The crust is a buttered crust, which was my favorite part of the whole pizza! The sauce was a simple basic marinara, but overall dry. I wish they had more sauce on top, or layered in the pizza. A decent pizza, but nothing overly special or crazy!

The wait time once we had sat down was about 30 minutes, keep that in mind if you plan on ordering a deep dish- as they do have an order ahead option we did not know of, which will save you loads of time! 

Overall, cute interior and VERY family oriented. The atmosphere was loud and slightly cramped, as it seems a hot spot for families to come and enjoy and watch football in the background. I won't be craving the pizza, but would still come back!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly people. Excellent pizza. I was expecting some greasy pan pizza, but it was actually a nice crust. The service was really good and I would go back again.  The beer choices were good, but I woukd have liked a few more choices. Parking was easy, and I didn't feel like I would be murdered in the parking lot, so that was nice."}
{"text":"A great lunch party for my wife. We've been fans and customers since our Illinois days some 30 million plus years ago. Christina was  very helpful in getting us set up and our server was always right there. Great service and wonderful food as usual!"}
{"text":"Have been to many of there locations over the years with the Buffalo Grove location being the last and the pizza was always consistent. I ordered carry out and was given an 8pm pick up time. Not bad since they are new here in Phoenix. 

Walked into the store and was directed to the pick up window and paid for the order. Waited a few minutes and the store looks nice. Got my pizza and went home. 

Opened up the pizza and it looked fantastic. Smelled just like a pie from Chicago and looked like what I usually would get. The only issue with the pizza was the crust. The flavor was there but it just wasn't cooked right. I don't know if they have so many pizzas coming out of the ovens that the temperatures are not right, but this pizza had a very light and chewy crust. Nothing like I have ever had in 40 years at eating at their stores. I was deeply disappointed. 

I ordered the Chicago Classic deep dish with the crust to be cooked \"just right\" as they offer on the order screen on line. I have never been given a choice in the store of how I wanted my crust cooked, but they are the experts and the \"just right\" was nothing I have ever experienced before. 

I know they are new and I will chalk that up as a growing pains experience. I hope it improves. Sorry Lou's, I travel a long way for this and was sadly let down."}
{"text":"Best PIZZA SALAD and SERVICE EVERRRRR!! Our new favorite spot!! Place was recommended by a friend, greatful we followed through"}
{"text":"We had heard great reviews and thought we would check the place out prior to a D'Backs game. The décor was nice, staff friendly, and the bruschetta was probably the best I've ever had. The pizza, though, was underwhelming and not in line with the reviews we read and heard about. I don't think the reviews set us up unrealistically, I think the reviews were unrealistic themselves especially because we have eaten multiple times at Buddyz: A Chicago Pizzeria in Queen Creek. Their crust is more buttery, the sauce tastes better, and the sausage is tastier so all-in-all Buddyz tops Lou Malnatis. We will go back to Buddyz but not Lou's."}
{"text":"I have waited for this day to come for as long as I can remember. 

I was able to attend a soft opening for Charity last night 5.10.16 and was EXTREMELY happy to participate in this event 1. for the pizza 2. for the charity (sorry but if you have not had the pizza you would not understand! LOL). 

When I sat down there were only three things that made me instantly sad; 1. No pink lemonade - WHY? 2. No Calamari - Lou's is my FAVE place to get Calamari. 3. The Menu is not the same as back home.

We were a party of 6 and Tisa was our server (She was FABULOUS! Even dealt with my sadness of the above very well). We got the Cheddar Cubes, and two House Salad's with ranch and Creamy Lemon Dressing, then for dinner we had a medium Malnati Chicago Classic, a small Malnati Chicago Classic with pepperoni (not my choice, but it was his first time here), the bowtie pasta, and the Malnati salad. Then for dessert we had the Trio - Cookie with ice cream, Tiramisu and Key Lime Pie, the Key Lime Pie needed to be more tart for me. 

I cannot wait to go back on Friday for the soft opening and hopefully this time Mark will stop by our table!"}
{"text":"Lou Malnati's has always been a Chicago favorite and now a Phoenix favorite! They opened in Phoenix with a bang. The building design is amazing and the staff handled the crowds with the best possible customer service. The pizza is amazing and tastes just like the pizza served in Chicago! Great addition to Phoenix."}
{"text":"got the lou deep dish to go. I baked it the next day and it cooked up perfectly. Buttercrust is fantastic, A+++ for cheese amount yet....something was missing. it had no spices and tasted more like a casserole than a pizza. Now there is nothing wrong with a gooey cheese casserole, but when you are expecting an Italian explosion of deliciousness its a little dissapointing.  Since they just opened, I will be happy to give it another go. Also, this was the second night they were open so they were very busy."}
{"text":"The pizza was damn good. 

I have been to Chicago but don't really remember how the pizza was, so I can't say \"it's as good as pizza in Chicago\". However I have friends who grew up in the windy city who say this place is just like back home.

My only gripe was that I felt like the hostesses and managers were staring my group down, waiting for us to leave. We were there for over an hour but we hadn't seen each other in a while and were trying to catch up over pizza and dessert. Leave your patrons alone and don't stare them down!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss was about with this place honestly. I couldn't wait for it to open in our area and wasn't very happy.  It's not pizza to me. It's runny and doughy and the sauce is so sweet, they must add lots of sugar or I'm not sure. Not the pizza I'm used to maybe. Coming from a pizza background and living in New York City and traveling the world trying diff pizza, i wasn't impressed. But you decide for yourself. Maybe you like this sort of thing."}
{"text":"Sometimes the wait is long. But the pizza is great. Get the thin crust. It's worth the wait. Deep dish is good also"}
{"text":"I order a pizza at 7:45pm, it is now 9:30pm and they have not delivered the pizza and did not even bother to call. They did charge my credit card however. I would not trust them even though pick up is Okay. I am calling corporate tomorrow to get a refund because there is no phone for the place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. Best Chicago deep dish pizza around, hands down. Slightly better when in Chicago. But everything is better (food-wise) there. Get the Chicago classic! Dine-in. I've ordered take-out and the pizza wasn't as good."}
{"text":"I've only had Lou's in the past via frozen shipped across the country pizza (and it was still really good!) so when we heard they were opening in Phoenix we had to check it out. We got there at about 4:45 on a Thursday to a bunch of people standing outside being told it was an hour plus wait. We drove from Queen Creek so we were staying regardless of the wait time. When we checked in we were told the wait for a party of 2 was only 30-35 minutes, score!! We added our name to the list and then they suggested that we preorder our food so we don't have to wait an additional 45 minutes once seated. 32 minutes later, our table was ready and we were seated. Here's the only downside about our experience, we were seated at 5:20 and for some reason our preordered pizza was never started because we waiting until 6:10 to get our pizza. We both loved what we had (The Malnati Chicago Classic and the Cheese Deep Dish with Buttercrust) but didn't really understand why we would preorder if we still were going to wait 50 minutes for food- they dropped the ball in that aspect. We still bought 2 frozen pizzas to go and took our leftovers- would we come back? Maybe- it is a bit of a drive from Queen Creek (an hour each way), but it was really good."}
{"text":"Thank you for coming to AZ. The best deep dish ever. Had the Chicago Classic several times, always great!! Now put one on Westside!!!"}
{"text":"So, I'll start saying the decor is awesome.  Love it!  I'm a lover of pizza thru and thru and I was dying to try this place out.  I've been to Lou's Chicago rivals, Gino's East and Giordano's, so I had high hopes for this place.  When we arrived they quoted us a super long wait even though it was early (5:30pm) and hardly anyone in the place.  It almost felt like they wanted to feed the \"hype\" (just my opinion) or maybe they wanted us to cave and sit outside \"immediately\" even though it was a billion degrees outside.....but we ended up waiting about half the time they quoted us and got to sit indoors.  Here's when things went downhill.  Our waiter never showed.  For like 10 minutes!  That's a long time to wait to even place a drink order.  My husband had to go and find a random waiter to say we hadn't been waited on.  Finally our waitress showed up.  Things got a little better, but when you are going to wait 40 min for pizza after you've waited 10+ minutes for someone to simply greet you......your patience starts to run out.  So the service was about a 2-star service.  The Lou's salad was really good and the pizza was definitely just ok.  The crust was hard as a rock.  We ordered butter crust and expected it to be a little flaky...like crispy out outside with a little chewiness inside.....but it was just hard and crumbly.  I don't know if that's the way it's suppose to be or if that's typical for their deep dish pizza?!?  Kind of hesitant to even go back and give it a second try after the service we received though."}
{"text":"Ok. So I don't even know how to start....I am truly blown away by this place. Went to Restraunt tonight with a group of 20 people for a work gathering. The manager Alexis went above and beyond to ensure that we had a table that fit our needs. The hostess staff was incredible and attentive to our group, and our waiter FRITZ....UNREAL! That guy is truly amazing. I appreciated most that the wait staff seemed to all work together to ensure that all 20 of us enjoyed our experience. The attentiveness of this team was incredible. I was delighted by the experience here. It was my first visit and I am sure it will not be my last. Fritz and Alexis stood out to us most but everyone was great! Thank you for a great dining experience. 

The dining space is small, be prepared to wait , but you can order ahead of time while you wait which makes your wait time for food significantly less when you sit down. This was a great tip by the hostess team. Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Had knee surgery and hadn't eaten anything all day. The old lady and myself had a hankering for some good grub. We had gotten the pizza cookie there before and they were excellent so we decided to try the pizza. 

Since going to the restaurant and sitting wasn't in my scope of abilities at the given time we chose to order carry-out. I called once and asked some questions and the lady was knowledgeable about the food and answered my questions swiftly. 

So we went to pick up our order (The Lou and cheese deep dish). When we got there someone held the door open since I was on crutches, which is rarity at most restaurants anymore. Our order wasn't quite read so we waited about another 5 minutes. In that time a lady came out to check on us make sure that we were being helped. I believe CiCi was her name. Super nice and courteous. They gave us free desert because our order wasn't on time.

Pizza was excellent. I would recommend The Lou with sausage added!! The cheese pizza was also great. Definitely will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Ok...so I'll admit I love pizza.  Sadly though back home in Hawaii I can probably count on one hand really good pizza joints (well ok...maybe just two fingers on one hand).  This place has got to be the best when it comes to ambiance, staff, and of course the food.  I would highly recommend this place if you live in the Phoenix area and as a visitor to your great city...I can assure you that I'll be coming here again to enjoy it as well!"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago, this was a good place to go... or so I thought....  it's not as good as back home and obviously has become very chain/ franchised oriented... The servers were nice... but it was uneventful."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Over hyped, expensive, and mediocre pizza.  Barro's wins again.  The pizza is flavorless and boring.  It was an under cooked biscuit."}
{"text":"Wasn't aware that it takes 30-45 minutes to make a deep dish so we decided to get wings while we waited. The waiter was clearly having a bad night since the place was very busy but once we sat and ordered, we didnt see him again until our food came, then he disappeared again until we had to hunt him down to ask for a to-go box.

The wings were great, plenty of sauce and a bit crispy just how we like, got a few beers as well since we had a long wait ahead of us, even after finishing the wings.

The atmosphere was great and since the weather was perfect we sat outside, which was spacious though very crouded since it was a Saturday night and the table next to us were celebrating a birthday. Still very nice and would definitely suggest it for anyone looking for causal but large place to celebrate. 

Food was expensive and took quite a while and the service left a whole lot to be desired but the food was good and the atmosphere was fun so they definitely earned their 3 stars."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the deep dish.  Actually found a pizza with plenty of sausage and pepperoni on it.  Rare these days.  We ordered standard tomato sauce and found it to be too much for our taste."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!  I was a little hesitant about getting too excited for Lou's to finally be in Phoenix, I was anticipating it being good but probably not as good as the real deal in the windy city.  I have never been happier to be so wrong.  The pizza was DELICIOUS and exactly what you get in Chicago.  For being a soft opening the service was fantastic and a real life Malnati served us himself, proof that this family run business is a labor of love. 

On a side note, 100% of the proceeds from last night's soft opening went to the Phoenix Children's Foundation, what a great way to give back to the community!"}
{"text":"Ahh, The greeting was ok but not too friendly, the pizza was fair, dont know if thats even real cheese and i had ordered a deep dish pepperoni, i could have counted the pepperoni on one hand!!
Not worth the price in my opinion!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the highly anticipated pizza. My friend from Chicago had great things to say about it (he had them in Chicago). The line was insane. With it being the 2nd day of business, I expected this. 

The food was great. It was a bit of a drive though...so I don't know if I'll be this dedicated to come back again so soon! Staff was nice. We had 4 total people in our group. The waiter told us that he could split our bill evenly 4 ways, but it would be hard to split it with what we actually got. He actually said that it would be easier for him this way.

I thought it was odd, that he put himself first. Not to go on about a rant. Maybe I'm a picky person, who knows. Everything else was great though. I can understand why there was a big wait now. If I'm back in the area one evening, I shall give it another shot."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Everything was great.   The pizza,was the best I ever had and I love pizza!  Service was great as well.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yeees!  The best version of chi town Dd in the valley. 25x now thanks for finally coming. Wren house brewing is an added bonus"}
{"text":"As good as home in Chicago. I had take out and it was the same quality of food I would get back home, crispy crust, excellent toppings and tasty as ever."}
{"text":"I don't like the illuminati but I sure do like Lou Malnati's. The Deep Dish Pizza is masterpiece from the cheesy cheese to the tasty pepperoni and sausage. The wings are the best in town and the service is first class."}
{"text":"Well I have never had Chicago style pizza before so maybe Im just not understanding. Don't get me wrong it is a tasty and beautiful pizza but I found it lacking in salt. Is the delicious butter crust supposed to not have salt? It is a very plain crust only tasting of butter literally no flavor just like unsalted butter. Like I said I've never had Chicago style so Im not sure maybe someone can tell me LOL. Im a salt person. ANYWAY! It was good. Started to get very busy around 5. Arrived at 330pm and was seated right away. P.S HAPPY HOUR PLEASE LOL"}
{"text":"This was my first time EVER trying Malnati's and I'll for sure be coming back. We were here today for a social media event, so we got a chance to sample quite a bit. We had their amazing deep dish pizza and tried half cheese and half classic and it was amazing. It was served super hot and we LOVED our butter crust!! 

Our starter was the bruschetta which came highly recommended by our server. A delicious medley of tomatoes, parmesan, fresh basil, garlic and olive oil. 

For dessert we sampled their tiramisu and the chocolate chip cookie pizza. We LOVED the cookie pizza and highly recommend it. A warm cookie prepared in a deep dish and served with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. 

We are SO thrilled that Malnati's is joining the Phoenix food scene and look forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Love the Chicago Style Deep Dish. Have never eaten-in so I couldn't tell you about service. 5 stars"}
{"text":"My friends and coworkers rave about Lou Malnati's, and so I had to give it a try. This was my first experience with deep dish pizza (aside from a little order at the O'Hare airport food court, which was dry and disgusting, as expected). I had a busy night, so my s/o got us some frozen pizzas and the combination platter.

Pros:
- The crust was flaky and yummy, and the crust-to-sauce-to-\"topping\" (Is it still called a topping if it's on the bottom?) ratio was simply fantastic. Usually, when I eat pizza, I feel the need to alternate between the saucy, flavorful tip of the slice and the crust. Not with Lou Malnati's! 

- I. Love. Breaded. Mushrooms. and theirs were one of the best, with a nice crisp (even though it sat in the container for 30 minutes before I got to eat them), and juicy inside. In general, the combination platter was yumyumyummy.  

Cons:
-  The website didn't make it clear that the offerings for frozen pizza were not the same as the ones for in-house. I was SO excited to try the Lou and to experience spinach + mushroom + garlic crust, and was so sad that I couldn't. IIRC the options available are cheese, spinach, veggie (green peppers, onions, and mushrooms, I believe), sausage, and pepperoni).
- The spinach pizza I ended up getting was good, but there was a little too much cheese for my liking. My s/o's sausage pizza had a better cheese ratio, but it was a little bit too wet and drippy for my liking.

I will definitely be back to try Lou's in person though!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the original locations in Chicago. So glad they brought a piece of Chitown to the desert."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying Lou Malnati's ever since I heard it was opening in my favorite 'hood: uptown Phoenix! 

First, I like the location: tucked back in a corner of Uptown Plaza, with a big lawn area and fountain out front. The inside is cute - industrial 50s-ish style.

We planned ahead and got there right at opening (11:00) on a Saturday. It was no problem seating our big group, although we would definitely have had to wait if we were there at 11:20 or later. FYI, the deep dish pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook (you can order while you wait for your table!). We tried the stuffed spinach loaf and the cheese bread while we waited - both were delicious. We also enjoyed a couple local brews from Wren House and Phoenix Ale Co. 

And seriously, the pizza is really good. We tried both sausage (the special) and pepperoni and enjoyed both. The toppings cover an entire layer of the pizza, so you never have to get even one bite without, and I think the special comes with extra cheese, which is also delicious. The waitress recommended the butter crust, and I'm glad she did because it really made the pie. I don't think it would be great for takeout because the toppings really start sliding off the crust after just a few minutes - no wonder the waitress serves every piece for you. She's a pro.

Be warned, these slices are very filling. They say a large will feed 3-4 people on the menu, but I think it's more like 6.

It takes some planning to avoid the long lines, but I wouldn't mind returning to Lou Malnati's next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, patio. Friendly service. Great location. FlavorLESS deep dish pizza. I found salad dressing too sweet so I recommend getting it on the side to make sure it's to your liking. So many other places in the 'hood that I much prefer. Not making plans for a return visit."}
{"text":"I know literally nothing about \"authentic\" (or even good) deep dish pizza. In fact, I'm was a deep dish virgin before going to Lou's. Just gonna throw that out there before I get to reviewing.

The property is adorbs. Lots of great spaces for larger groups, a wrap around bar, a nice patio and plenty of booths for annoying people like me who insist on one. Oh! While we're on the booth subject, I love that the two-top booth has a slightly extended table so you're not super squished and you can comfortably gorge on all the foods.

Our service was different, but overall good. Being in the industry, I was a total judgmental asshole when Donny seemed a little scatterbrained at first and said he was having an off night. He ended up hitting every step of service perfectly and we enjoyed the experience with him. 

So where are we? Atmosphere... Check! Service.. Check!! Ahh but the food. No checks from me Lou! The wings were for sure overpriced- $9ish for 6. Their sauce was good but the texture was off- limp skin like the fat underneath wasn't rendered out in the fryer enough. The pizza (remember I'm no expert) was different than I'm used to as a native Phoenician, but not something I'd ever get again. The deep dish butter crust on the Classic was a cross between French bread and actual pie crust- not much flavor and too dense for my taste. I did like how they mix it up with sauce on top, a thin layer of sausage across the whole 'za and cheese closest to the crust. Also had the pizza cookie (could only eat one slice of pizza & I'm 39 weeks pregnant & why the hell am I explaining myself to you?) Anyway- it was fine but I'll stick to the OG in these parts and head to Oreganos."}
{"text":"Delicious deep dish pizza and extraordinary service. You can tell they go above and beyond to make sure you leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about his place but decided to wait until the hype died down to avoid the hours of wait time I heard about. So I came here during the week on a date and loved everything about this place! It has a very cute retro feel to it, all of the servers are very nice and since we went just about after the lunch rush we got a table right away. I will say that the wait time for our food was a lot longer than I expected. We went through 2 glasses before our food finally arrived.  We ordered the signature pizza which is The Malnati Chicago Classic, it was amazing!!!! It's so thick that you have to eat this slice with a knife and fork but every bite has the flavor of everything packed into it. We ordered the medium which serves 3 but we both ended up being full after just 1 slice so we could have just stuck with a small. The plus side to the leftovers is that I took them home and the next day popping them into the oven, they came out tasting just as great! Very pleased with the service and food at this place. I can't wait to go back and try a different pizza on the menu"}
{"text":"We made our 4th or 5th trip to Lou's today (since they opened this Phoenix location. Once again, we can't find a thing to complain about. We sat outside on the patio - the misters are great. Our salad came quickly and the pizza was cooked to perfection. My Lou's \"pro tip\" is to be sure to ask for your sausage crumbled - the sausage in patty form is a bit overpowering. 

For those who are concerned about the 30-45 min pizza cook time, you can call ahead and have your pizza started before you come (if you're in a rush and don't want to sit and enjoy an iced tea or an ice cold beer). :)"}
{"text":"After giving myself a few days to finally complete and digest the large pizza, Lou Malnati's is as good as people say it is.  The ingredients are fresh, although I do think the tomatoes are from a can, and the toppings are plentiful.  The cheese is wonderfully melted, and everything blends together like peanut butter and jelly.  Of course, the big selling point for the pizza is the crust.  The deep dish style of Lou Malnati's tastes very good, and has a nice crisp texture with every bite.  The best part of the crust is that the crust is not oily or greasy in comparison to other pizza joints.  The atmosphere is fun, but due to the name, it is very packed.  I went in at 8:00 p.m., and didn't get a bar seat until 8:35.  If you're coming here with any sort of party, make reservations.  My biggest problem with Lou Malnati's is that the place opens at 4:00 p.m.  There is NO lunch available here.  Which is really odd since the restaurant menu has lunch specials.  And that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Excellent deep dish Chicago Style Pizza.
Been here twice now, first time was a quick lunch. My wife and I shared Lou's Bruschetta, Stuffed Spinach Bread and Calamari appetizers. All very tasty. Second visit afforded us some more time so we opted for \"The Lou\" deep dish, it was Delicious! They do it right, so give yourself enough time(30mins). A Tip: Lou's will allow you to call ahead to minimize your wait."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the service is even better! I've been waiting for 10 years for a REAL Chicago pizza place to open here in the Valley, and the wait is FINALLY over!! Thank you! Thank You! Thank you for bringing a taste of home to AZ! Now, if y'all would open one up in Chandler I'd be forever in your debt!!! #EastValleyLikesDeepDishToo"}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite neighbourhood spots. Great pizza and the subs are delicious. Check out the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza, So glad they opened up a location here in the valley. The service is amazing and venue is well decorated. A great environment overall couldn't be anymore pleased. I ordered a deep dish pizza and had a nice ice cold beer!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza...have a hard time eating any other. Downfall, the floors make me dizzy"}
{"text":"My family is originally from the Chicago area, so when the news that Lou's was making its way to Phoenix was very happy news. We ordered take out because we heard the dine in lines have been long, and when we went to pick up the pizza it was for sure long. The deep dish did not let down. It was everything that we remembered from the Lou's in Chicago, and we will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great service and the deep dish Chicago style was very good and so were the wings, big TVs and BEER make it even better.This place will not disappoint a must if you're in the mood for Chicago style deep dish pizza,"}
{"text":"Came highly recommended, but we found it very over-rated. We ordered a pizza for delivery. For a $30 large deep-dish pepperoni-mushroom pizza, the taste of the fillings was good, but I counted only 5 pepperoni and 5 mushroom slices on 1/3 of the pizza. I've had pizza hut pizzas with more toppings. The toppings are hidden well in the tomato slices. And sadly, the crust had no taste. No salt, bland, not at all the \"buttery\" experience I expected. What a shame........."}
{"text":"Well, I made it over to this new place that folks have been talking about for months leading up to this day and when they opened, the frenzy grew even more.  We opted to arrive early to avoid the dinner rush; needless to say, when we arrived at 4:15 PM, they already had a slight wait, but not as bad as a weekend probably.  Once we were seated, our waitress (Malika G) greeted us and took the time to give us a quick run down, which was nice since we had never experienced Malnati's.  We opted to try House salad each, Bruschetta, personal size - Chicago Original and a small size - Lou's.  All I can say, is that I am so glad that Lou's has finally arrived.  The food was so good and the pizza met all of my expectations based on folks from Chicago and the food shows that showed it off.  Our server, Malika was the sweetest person that gave a great smile, checked back often and made us feel so welcome.  The only complaint that I could have was the size of our table, standard bar type seating.  It was too cramp for the food we ordered, thank goodness we order smaller dishes.  However, at least we got seated and were able to dine in a short timeframe and this not a showstopper.  Will definitely come back for dine in when possible, but may exercise the take out option to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal. Ordered a personal deep dish and calamari for carry out. The calamari was soggy, maybe to be expected when it steams in a plastic container but it was also bland and definitely under cooked. The pizza was very unimpressive as well.  With so many really good pizza options available around you should pass on this place."}
{"text":"Can you say Keto pizza! Well, it certainly was good especially if you like quality sausage which the crust was made out of and was a good compromise. 

A friend who accompanied me on this adventure is gluten free, there was no way I was doing gluten free crust...been there done that and no way.

I would say that the price tag for the Keto was a bit much and had I known before hand I would've thought twice before ordering this speciality pizza, @ nearly $27 for a medium 6 piece 3 topping pizza is a bit expensive. Perhaps this is the price you pay for this Keto eating trend but I'm thinking  a little expensive for a few pieces and the slices were definitely on the smaller side. Not the pizza pie large slice where it takes two hands to slide the gooey goodness down the trap. They were short and squatty. 

Nevertheless we tried Bruchetta. Yup, my friend who is \"gluten free\" snarfed it down like it was his last meal and quite truthfully it was really good! A must try and at happy hour prices being 50%.

Lastly, I must say the signature drink was to die for and for the life of me I can not remember the name. It was like a cosmo with a bit of heat...so if you like a little heat with the sweet this is your drink!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh do crave this Pizza from this Chicago institution the butter crust and deep dish is the best. I get it once a month at least on my home movie night as a treat when I don't want to cook. Ivan also take it to work the next day and heat it on the oven and it's still fantastic. When visiting Chicago this is one of the best if not the best. Oh their salads are awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Chicago style deep dish pizza at its best! I traveled 45 minutes to eat here from the east valley and it was absolutely worth it. I like the pre-order option, after we sat down our pizza was ready within about 15 minutes. Reasonable wait time as well for a Friday late lunch. 

They also have good local draft beers. I had the biltmore blond, which was great as well! 

All around a good experience!"}
{"text":"A Chicago native I had high hopes for Lou's in Phoenix!
I was not disappointed. Knowing it would be crowded as they just opened we decided to order online and pick up on a Saturday night. 
I arrived 5 minutes before the time our pie was supposed to be ready at 7:30PM.
I was happy that there was a crowd but NO LINES! :)
A very organized restaurant. Great decor also!
After driving back to Mesa (25 minutes) I am happy to say the pie was still hot, and it was great!
I do not know if Chicago Deep Dish is genetic, but it was sooooo good.
The crust is the best pizza crust (Buttercrust deep dish.) 
We got the Lou Malnati's Classic large and it was incredible. 
If you LOVE Chicago deep dish this is the place in Phoenix.
Go and bring a BIG appetite!!
We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend took a few high school students here after a choir concert and they loved the food! Everyone raved about the delicious quality. I ordered Lou's pasta, which is fettuccini and chicken with a cream sauce. The chicken was dry but the rest was delicious! We went next door to Creamistry for ice cream, so it was a win-win night and the kids loved the experience!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon so thought I would see what they hype was about.  Well I'm not impressed.  For me, the sauce is boss! and all that crust is just.....bread.  For $26 for a large, I was expecting more than 8 lbs of bread.  Thanks Lou, but I'll stick to my fave, Red Devil.  Or even at $10 for a large so big it won't fit my fridge, COSTCO is a better option than this over priced pie."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly staff.  The pizza takes a long time to cook, so if you don't like waiting, call ahead."}
{"text":"Other here have claimed to be Chicago Deep Dish Pizza.  This is. Being from the D we frequent the city of Chicago and pizza is always a priority. So far the best Chicago style in the Valley."}
{"text":"Easy review here. I'm originally a Chicagoan (born and raised) so going to Lou Malnati's on Lincoln Ave in Lincolnwood while growing up was something my family did every couple of months. But it's been a long while since I've eaten deep dish pizza, and on our recent visit over Labor Day weekend, all my memories of that crust and that sauce came flooding back. 

We sat outside, nice mist-ers and cool night breeze. Service was attentive and friendly, wait times weren't so bad (time for one IPA and a glass of wine for my wife), and our Lou's classic pizza was great. I was a bit surprised at the amount of sausage on the pie - A LOT of sausage. But you know what? I scraped the sausage off the leftover pieces to add to a sauce for an Italian meal at home a night later. Voila! 

Thanks, Lou Malnati's - glad you're here when I need a deep dish fix!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had it before you have to go twice. It's a little different then the average deep dish you have been eating your whole life and so it just seems \"not what you expected\" the first time.   

It's all about the ingredients on these pies. GREAT sausage, the tomatoes are amazing and the cheese is great too. It's all sourced from a few small farms and to me the quality of the ingredients make it a top pizza place in a city with great pizza.

Lou's is a must for any pizza lover"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The quality of the ingredients namely the sausage, the cheese and the tomatoes are all great. Lou's one of the top pizza places in the Valley without a doubt. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago my husband and I decided to give this place another try. What a difference it was. The waitress was super friendly and explained how everything was going to be. The food was delicious and most definitely worth the wait it takes to cook. Thank you for making us forget our first bad experience."}
{"text":"Pizza done Chicago, it was so good. We only finished two slices each cause it was so rich and filling. Did the classic so now will have to try something else next time. That collie is screaming my name. Well worth the drive and the wait. It takes a bit for a pizza so expect that I'm Advance!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with my complaint.  We had pretty shitty service.  I had to get up and ask the host if I could pay my bill.  I had called it when we sat down.  The waitress came over not particularly interested in volunteering any suggestions after telling her it was out first time.  But I was watching her with her other tables.  No sense of urgency.  She would fill ice tea but pass her other tables empty ice tea glass until a few minutes later the customer flagged her down.  Not only did she leave them drinkless but she walked right past them with the tea and didn't care enough to check in.  I will say in her defence she did come back and check on us.  But that was it.  Take drink order,  take order.  bring out food.  check on us.  then take check.  No refills nothing else.  Let's be honest she probably didn't deserve a tip.  I hope this isn't typical for this place because I liked the place.

I thought the pizza was pretty good.  Crispy taste flavor.  I wouldn't drive 30 minutes to eat there but if I lived close I would go there frequently.  It is probably one of the top Pizza places in the metro area.  Certainly much much better than Pizza Bianca. I had the sausage which is the classic.  I don't particularly love Sausage and I didn't sausage was so special.  It just sounded good because Chicago pizza is known to have great sausage.  It would have been nice if the waitress said we make our sausage homemade all natural fresh every morning.  I just imagined that was the case.  But who knows.  If it is made there I wasn't impressed with it.  I did however really love the pepperoni pizza my fiance got. My mistake was not getting the Lou because I liked vegi pizza and I would recommend if you go to pile on a bunch of toppings.

A good server might have even caught that and swapped it out for me.  

Very nice restaurant.  I am guessing the area is a new trendy area.  We sat on the patio on a nice spring training night.  I would highly recommend that.  It's a cool spot. With very good food.  With that being said I wouldn't wait an hour for a table and then 35 minutes for pizza.  Which is what I hear is normal.  Monday night at 8pm it wasn't extremely busy."}
{"text":"Tastes exactly the one in Chicago! It's family owned, not a franchise! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Oh ya! Good Ol Chicago DeepDish!!! Did an on-line order in the AM and had it scheduled for pickup in the afternoon.Pick up was quick and pies were HOT!!!
Delicious double pep DeepDish and a thin crust Veggie.
So good, I went back a week later w/ lunch buddy( because the Flower child was so crowed and loud!)..We ordered Lasagna& Fettuccini lunch specials.YUM 
Service was excellent.Our server (Nancy?)  was the best, brought boxes, sippy cups,was patient with our long lunch..we will be back."}
{"text":"Went to the new location in Arcadia.Its not as it down restaurant like the one on Camelback.
Walked in ordered a personal pan and purchased a frozen to go.30 min wait, & I had a delicious pie for lunch 
Not a lot of parking. But they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying this is a pretty darn good deep dish pizza. My wife and I ordered a small deep dish pizza with sausage and it was able to fill both of us up. My only real complaint about this place is that it's so far away from where I live. Definitely worth the drive though. And a little hint for anyone who hasn't gone here yet, order for pickup. The line was huge when I got to Lou Malnati's to pick up my pizza. So save yourself some time and order pickup, but definitely go get some of this pizza."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar this afternoon, and enjoyed my stay. The gentleman who work the bar are great guys from Chicago.....they bust their butts, and are 110% polite and friendly. The pizza was excellent, I had the personal size, Lou's. I couldnt have asked for a better experience. Keep up the great work, I will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Pizza here is pretty amazing the prices are a little bit much but the pizza is good I will definitely be going back this is my second time ordering from there I've never sat there and ate I always order takeout because I live quite a ways away but it's really good pizza no complaints"}
{"text":"It's a huge problem for my scale that this place is less than 10 min away from me  
But oh am I sooooo excited! 
Hands down the best deep dish pizza EVER. Best pizza period! 
I'm a girl that loves ranch on my pizza, no need here. The taste is perfect! Right amount of cheese. (Lots of cheese!) 
This location is a delivery or carry out only. They just opened yesterday 9/26/17. 
They have a freezer full of frozen pizza so you can stock up. They have many options in the freezer, from cheese, pepperoni and sausage. It took only 45 min to cook. 

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Phoenix!  Loved the spinach bread appetizer and deep dish Lou's special!  Great food good service and good prices!"}
{"text":"First timer on deep dish pizza's so excuse my ignorance. After reading reviews and even recommendations from magazines for the best Chicago deep dish pizza's in Arizona. I took my chances and tries it out. The services was fast (took awhile to seated all 8 of us down in one area; but still fast), the deep dish pizza's and thin crust was superb, and the server were attentive so that was a plus."}
{"text":"Since roughly 80% of Phoenix seems to be from Chicago (and will remind you of this regularly), I'm not surprised that yet another popular Chicago-based chain would target Phoenix as part of an expansion plan. 
  
Initially, I knew that during the first few weeks, this place would be a complete zoo. My girlfriend and I decided to wait a couple weeks for the buzz to die down. Even so, despite the fact that we dine out in Phoenix quite regularly, I don't think I've ever experienced a crowd like this without visiting a theme park. Total madness!

You're allowed to pre-order your pizza while you're waiting, which will allegedly cut down on your wait time. They also use a clever little app, which allows you to frequently check your place in the queue. I must say, this is a very good approach to have. Although since the front portion of the restaurant is basically a bar, it's kind of hard to distinguish between those people standing in line versus those who are just standing around.

Lou's has often been said to be the \"gold standard\" of deep dish pizza, so obviously expectations were pretty high going in. They have both patio and indoor seating, but it becomes fairly obvious that they need much more dining space than they currently offer. The whole bar area is wasted space and I feel they underestimated the amount of people in Phoenix that would dine here.

Our wait time was exactly two hours on an early Saturday evening. Our server, who was friendly, confirmed our pre-order of a large pepperoni deep dish. In the meantime, we ordered their three cheese bread. The bread was actually decent. A big, long slice served with a generous portion of sauce. We were both pleased by its taste and the quality of the sauce, bread, and cheeses.

The pizza, which we timed, took exactly sixty minutes. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that pre-ordering makes minimal difference in wait time. When it was finally brought out to us, it didn't take us very long to conjure up a solid opinion. The cheese, sauce, and pepperoni were all great quality. The crust, however, which I consider to be the heart of a great pizza, was extremely lackluster. It was very crunchy, had zero flavor, and offered absolutely no moisture or flakiness that I've come to expect from a well made deep dish. Both of us were kind of in utter shock. I mean, if this is what the people of Chicago consider to be an ideal version of deep dish pizza, then their standards are much lower than I originally thought. If there was, in fact, butter flavor in the crust, it was virtually undetectable.    

The question is, was our pizza simply a botched pie or is this standard procedure?  Unfortunately, that's something we'd have to return for in order to determine.

For dessert, we split a pizza cookie. We've had some pretty decent pizza cookies at other local establishments, so we assumed this one would be on par. Most restaurants only partially bake the cookie, giving it a lovely gooey texture. Our cookie was literally stuck to the pan, which you had to dig to even find due to the excessive amounts of ice and whipped cream they use on top. In the end, we were disappointed - which rarely happens when it comes to anything related to cookies.

I'll give them an extra star due to their food prices being reasonable, the portions being generous, and the server being polite. And if the pizza were amazing, I'd easily forgive the long wait times. But this is one situation where I simply can't give out a high rating for a pizza joint that can't get their crust right. We might come back at some point, but with so many great options for pizza in Central Phoenix, I doubt it'll be anytime soon.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Okay... yes I'm giving this place 3 stars. Was it good? Of course. It was A-OK. But with all the hype, long waits, and high prices my expectations were very high.

We went on a Tuesday at 8pm hoping the wait wouldn't be too ridiculous. It was still 20 minutes. I do like how you can order your pizza ahead of time to save time. However, my experience with the girl at the pizza ordering counter was a bit awkward. I walk up with the menu, she is looking down and writing stuff down. About two very long minutes passed. No \"Hi, I'll be right with you\" or even a smile to acknowledge my presence. Another employee was standing next to her and she didn't even seem to care I was there. She eventually took my order, somewhat unenthusiastically. 

We were seated and our server was great and made up for the pizza counter girl. Bubbly and very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a house salad to split. The salad itself was basic but the dressing was unbelievably good! Lemon garlic dressing. I could have drank it, it was that good.

Our pizza finally arrived. The moment we were waiting for. We ordered The Lou. The good news is the texture of the crust is amazing. What a nice crunch! The not so great is that I found the sauce and toppings to be a bit bland. I was putting tons of Parmesan and red pepper on my pizza. We felt a bit letdown, especially considering the heavy price tag."}
{"text":"Clean, bright & spacious.  The server was friendly & helpful.  It was a totally pleasant experience.
The food was good but did not meet my expectations given the hype we heard from our server.
No complaints but I would not go far out of my way for a return visit.  It was good but not great imho."}
{"text":"As good as in Chicago.  Way to go.  Loved the pizza.  Have been to the one in Chicago they both taste the same."}
{"text":"WOW, what an amazing experience all around. We had dinner here this past Wednesday. The food, atmosphere, and service was AMAZING!  The pizza was AWESOME! We had the Classic, and added pepperoni. This by far was the best pizza we ever had. No need to travel all the way to Chicago. Our server Erica had the best smile, and her level of service was OVER the top. Her recommendations were appreciated. Yes, the pizza takes 30-35 mins, but she prepared us for that, and we had shared some appetizers. Highly recommend this place! We are excited to return very soon. Very family friendly!"}
{"text":"Way over rated. Pizza dough was too much like white bread. Tomatoes were fresh but not enough on the pizza. The pizza was OK, I just had much higher expectations from all of the hype I guess. To add insult they charged my credit card twice. I'll stick with NYPD deep dish. 
UPDATE
To their credit, they contacted me right away and refunded my credit card. Excellent customer service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening last night,other then being a little slow, it was perfect! I grew up in Chicago off Lou's and this was just like back home! I recommend The Chicago Classic and the Bruschetta for a starter!"}
{"text":"Our server Tristan was awesome. Great customer service and fun to talk to. Would come back just for her even if the food wasn't excellent. The food was also awesome though, so thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"Not normally a fan of deep dish pizza, but this place changed the game for me. Absolutely going to go again when I want deep dish. Staff was helpful and seated a group of 20 without issue. Great family atmosphere as well as a place for dates. Outdoor seating is available and would be perfect for the cooler times of the year. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Since we are from Chicago we couldn't wait to get up to Phoenix to visit Lou Malnati's.  It is tucked away into a shopping center and they did not disappoint!  Food was as delicious as it is in Chicago.  Totally worth the wait.  Great service, and great food."}
{"text":"very good service     Pizza was good I am just more of a fan of thin crust Pizza. The combo app was just to much fried food for me. If you like deep dish its a winner"}
{"text":"Crazy delicious food! Love the ambiance as well. Bartenders did a great job tending to everyone at the bar when it was ridiculously packed the first month they opened."}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza pie?  This is for you. 

Went with a friend based on a recommendation, that we had to try the deep dish. Took us a second to find the spot in Uptown Plaza but once acquired we were set. 

Sat outside on the patio. Nicely set up and very comfortable. Our waitress (wish I could remember her name because she was awesome) was just perfect and we never wanted for anything or felt like she was there too much. 

We started with the calamari which I found chewy. But my friend loved them. 

We had the deep dish pie with sausage (amazing), peppers, mushrooms and pepperoni. OMG!  This possibility is the best deep dish I've ever had.  The veggies tasted like veggies. The amount of ingredients and how it held its shape. Wow. 

Wasn't greasy at all. The crust (a butter crust) was crisp without being dense. I have to let you know that we ordered a large and it fed 7 eaters. It reheats wonderfully. Try this place."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was great appetizer.! Chianti with a Lou pizza (deep dish veggie): Very enjoyable. Heaters on the patio allowed us to sit in the patio on and Az February. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food and service, and decent prices too. Their portions are huge! I really like the ambiance and decorations. Family friendly. Fun place."}
{"text":"As a transplant from Chicago, I was so excited when this location opened in Phoenix! It is as delicious as I remember. A few of the servers/order takers didn't know all the details of the crustless pizza since it is not officially on the menu (my favorite pizza since I'm gluten intolerant), but luckily Tyler was there 2 out of the 4 times I ordered to save the day! He helped me place my order juuuuust right. He was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and fun! I enjoy my trips when Tyler is working."}
{"text":"You may want to save your money and time by avoiding this place. Very over hyped Chicago style pizza. If you like hard buttered crust under a very thick pan full of cheese and small bit of marinara, that is what you get. It was very basic. Salad was mostly lettuce. Had to wait one hour. Crowded. Staff were not pleasant, especially the bartender. If you want fantastic pizza head to Forno 301 on Roosevelt. It is fabulous! Lou's place was way over priced. Atmosphere extremely loud. Crowded and staff were everywhere bumping into all. Olive Garden crowd! . Disappointing"}
{"text":"I want to first of all say that the customer service given by Alexis was amazing. She went above and beyond expectations and this place should thank their lucky stars they have her. Just moved her from Chicago a year ago and I was so happy Lous opened up. And they now deliver!!!! 

When getting a Lous pizza for the first time, I would recommend getting butter crust if they don't ask you, which is a standard in the chi. I personally prefer sausage pieces to the layer of sausage but that's my preference. And of coarse mushroom and onion. 

Thank you guys for correcting an error on my part and making all of my guests so happy. 

If you haven't tried this pizza yet...... you haven't had a taste of heaven."}
{"text":"We have been to Lou's in Phoenix twice. The first time was terrible because it was packed and the pizza was not like the pizza in Chicago. But, we have it another shot today and the pizza was delicious! We ordered the cheesy bread which was tasty and ever so cheesy, and the deep dish pepperoni with the butter crust (get the butter crust, you will thank me later). The server was very nice and kept our drinks filled. I am so glad that we stopped in tonight, it reminded me of home and gave Lou's a chance to redeem itself, which it did."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time last Sunday for a birthday celebration. The retro ambience was wonderful, the service good and food delicious. We ordered a family size Bbq salad which was delicious and plenty for 5 of us.  The pepperoni pizza came out and it was outstanding. I don't usually like thick crust but thus was sumptuous--cooked just right so it wasn't too doughy. Crispy on the bottom and just right for the remainder of the crust. Great flavor and the tomato sauce topping tasted fresh and yummy as well.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing another solid Chicago establishment to the Valley. Would be nice to get something out west in Buckeye, but for now I'll make the commute ."}
{"text":"Loved the \"Lou\" personal pan pizza!  Great atmosphere too. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I went to this pizza restaurant they call \"Chicago style pizza.\"
It's like any other pizza place. Way overrated. The crust isn't thick, not much cheese,not much sauce. You can see the ingredients through the sauce. 
This was my second visit. I wasn't impressed the first time, so I thought I'd give them a second chance. 
Now. If you want the \"Real deal\", go to Tony's little Italy, in PLACENTIA, California. They have the REAL CHICAGO PIZZA. 
Sorry Lou!"}
{"text":"It was just alright, my server was absolutely great and so was the cheese bread, the pizza was very mediocre and kind of soggy. Loved the decorations around the place it's a very cute restaurant but seems over hyped."}
{"text":"The worst service from the host staff. I walked out. Their pizza may be good but I wasn't going to stick around to find out. I was so disgusted by the disorganization and general rudeness."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. The entrance process is a little confusing, even with the staff wondering about to try to guide you. But once you figure it out, place your order early!!!!

Chicken wings are amazing and the pizza was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is a review for Take Out.

I would give this place a 5 because of the quality of the pizza, chicken wings, and salad...but because of the lobby area being so packed and disorganized, it was kind of a hectic, chaotic experience.

You get people coming in for dinner, you get people coming in to pick up take out, and everyone's a little confused of where to go or who's in line for what. If they could figure that part out, this place would be a 5 star location for me.

The people who work there are very customer oriented and when they realized that they forgot to give me my order after waiting there for over 20 minutes past my pickup time, the manager came out and talked to me, shook my hand, apologized, and refunded my money for the meal. I  really appreciated that because I have experienced similar things at other places and they just apologized and that's it."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Best deep dish pizza in Phoenix! All the staff there have been very friendly and professional! The food is beyond delicious."}
{"text":"Got a small deep dish of The Lou. This is what folks are raving about? Hmm. Was not impressed, sorry to say. Maybe it's better in Chicago? Crust was super hard, cheese and sauce didn't have much flavor. Not yummy.

The Malnati salad was good - had to remove the crown of black olives, though. Tasted like tin can. Eesh. Best part was the sweet vinaigrette, that was the star of the show, as was the attentive service."}
{"text":"Good Chicago style pizza.  I expected more due to all the hype, but it was good.  The thing crust seems to be better than the deep dish, just as a suggestion."}
{"text":"We ordered a half baked deep dish pizza and it was not what i expected. The crust/breading lacked flavor and it was entirely too much bread for my taste. Maybe i should've opted for the thin crust, either way i had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Just *one* slice of pizza, salad, and two beers later - I'm STUFFED! The food was great, service was good."}
{"text":"Faithful to the pizza in the original Lincolnwood store. First time we went to the new Phoenix store the pizza was a more greasy than the original, but I think we can attribute that to start-up issues.  The last two times we went it was back to normal.  I used to travel to Chicago just to eat the pizza."}
{"text":"Was really excited to check this place out so we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. There was an hour wait so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks. No problem! Had the combination platter at the bar while we waited, nothing special. When we got to our table we ordered a Large original. Sadly I didn't think it lived up to the hype. The sausage and sauce were very good but I didn't like the crust at all. To me it was very flat and hard. Idk if this is how it is suppose to be or what but it wasn't what I thought it would be."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, we ordered the large deep dish pepperoni pizza with buttercrust which was delicious and it was more than enough to feed all four of us.  They have a very central location with lots of good places to go afterwards also for dessert."}
{"text":"Great first time!! Lone wait but awesome ambiance! Tatiana, our waitress was amazing... gave us our first time recombinations....

Wings extra crispy!! AMAZING!!!!
The \"Lou Pizza\"- AMAZING!!

Thank you Tatiana for all your help 
Along our first time amazing!!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite Chicago style pizza place to date. Got the medium and it was way too much for the gf and I.... and I eat too much at times lol. Prices are good and the food is good. Would definitely come back and this qualifies as a place I would go out of my way to visit again. We kept it simple - sausage and mushroom deep dish."}
{"text":"I went to Phoenix to visit some friends last week and I was looking for 
a pizza place to eat and was surprised that there was a Lou Malnati's in Phoenix. I was always wanting to go visit Chicago just for the deep dish and heard that LM is big up there. The week before I was about to order
their pizza online to be shipped. Glad I didn't. I just bought a cheapy ice chest and bought a couple of frozen pizza to take back to CA. 
Now about the pizza. Pizza is pretty good but a little pricey. I can tell the ingredients are fresh. It is the butter crust that makes this pizza a winner.
Went to dinner their a couple of times. I don't  know if LM is the real deal since their are probably a few better ones out in Chicago but this is good enough for me since Deep Dish pizza is not something you eat all the time."}
{"text":"My whole family is from Chicago, so it was nice to have a place like Lou's upon up in Phoenix.  I sat at the bar to order dinner, and they older guy who served me was fantastic!  Very attentive to my needs. I ordered the appetizer the had the cheese bites, breaded zucchini, etc & a personal deep dish pizza with the buttery crust. Tasted just like Chicago. Of course I had to take home some extra pizzas for my family. Well done, I will definitely be returning!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok think it's time for a review after dining at Lou's for 4 times. Yes 4 times because I loved the pizza so much!  Heck even went two times in a week. Why do I keep coming back, well the pizza of course. I find myself craving Chicago deep dish pizza more than any other pizzas. I'm so glad that we are finally getting real Chicago pizza here in the valley. I just read that more authentic Chicago pizza joints are coming here. I really think they waited to see how much success Lou's is having and by the packed house every night they having much success!

Now on to my experiences. First I was leery of the long waits I've read about. But it's really not that bad. You can check in at the host stand then you can put your pizza order. So if the wait is long, by the time you actually sit down the wait for the pizza is not long at all. This is a great idea! I've been to a local pizza restaurant here in the valley and had to wait an hour for a seat..the. 45 mins for pizza. This way of ordering is much more efficient and enjoyable. 

Now for the pizza, we seem to order the classic with extra sauce each time. Recently we ordered a pepperoni with the butter crust and that was amazing! So much pepperoni! Probably not the most healthy but wow who cares. I'll just spend an extra hour at the gym the next day. 

Overall it's a great restaurant. I've even been here with my \"Chicago Friend\" and he gives it a thumbs up.lol."}
{"text":"Finally Tried Lou's. Tried the classic Deep dish and a pepperoni & sausage Thin crust.
We did a carryout. I wasn't impressed with the taste of either. Nothing specific or bad, they both just seemed bland and highly overpriced. $62 for 2 pizzas. 
The staff was super friendly and nice. The online ordering was simple and everything was correct."}
{"text":"First time to eat at this place!! Great service from big Tim and the pizza was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 and ordered an XL thin crust and an appetizer combo. Before the thin crust could come out the manager let us know that it had over cooked it so they had to put in another for us. She gave us whatever appetizers we wanted and really took care of us to ensure that we were happy. Very great and thoughtful customer service, we will be back again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome Chicago style pizza. The butter crust was one of a kind. The atmosphere was lively and fun. We are coming back for sure!!  It's tough to find authentic Chicago pizza in the desert. Rock on!!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on the foodnetwork a few yrs back, Best Pizza's .. When my husband a Chicago Guy mentioned that Lou's opened here in the Valley we ventured out to give it a try. The place is tucked away in the back of the AJ's Shopping center, we used our gps to find it.
We arrived for a late lunch, Nice decor seats are very comfortable. The server was great very attentive. Having never tried their pizza, we ordered the Classic for two and a Thin Crust w/ Sausage, Mushroom and Onion.  The menu says the Classic is deep dish w/ extra cheese and sausage.. 

The food arrived and the presentation was disappointing. The \" deep dish \" was in a deep pan, but I wouldnt call it deep dish the pizza barely came to halfway to top of the pan. I think they forgot to drain the tomato's from the can because the topping was a watery mess, the sausage was bland. The best part was the cheese. I do not know what the hype is about this pizza. When I lived in Chicago, I ate Gino's, and Nancy's this place does not come close in the deep dish department. 

If you like Chicago thin crust pizza, this place is not for you. The pizza crust was bland no flavor, three was little or no sauce, again the sausage was bland no flavor so the mushrooms over powered the pizza, very sparse with the Cheese. Not a fan. If you want thin crust Chicago Pizza Vito's in Mesa is the best we have found.

After lunch we were not offered dessert, and handed the check. I asked about the key lime pie and I am glad we ordered that. The key lime pie was EXCELLENT ! I would return just for the dessert, for Pizza we will stick with Vito's for thin crust and Gino's for deep dish. 

Sadly I wanted to love this place.. food network has let me down again."}
{"text":"Waiting over an hour to be seated was SO worth it! I'm a huge pizza lover and when I heard this place was opening I became so excited. The pizza was so...saucy, with just the right amount of crisp. We ordered a side of wings while we waited for our pizza and even those they were really delicious! The place looks awesome and its design truly makes me feel like I'm in Chicago again. Also, the staff was super friendly and welcoming. On our way out they made sure to ask about our experience, a gentleman was kind enough to ask where they purchased their furniture when I told him how much I loved it. I can't wait to go back! 

P.s.
If you're also wondering where their awesome dinning tables and chairs came from, they're from Grand Rapids Furniture, in Michigan"}
{"text":"We had a positive experience here. We started out with the spinach stuffed bread which was very flavorful and did not disappoint. We shared a deep dish with pepperoni and sausage and although the crust was not nearly as deep as we expected it to be we both very much enjoyed it. The couple we went with ordered a cheese and a pepperoni deep dish and both enjoyed theirs. Great bar to enjoy if you have to wait and if you go during the weekend or busy time during the week you will be waiting. TV's available to watch the big game and frozen pizzas available to take home. We had great service and felt that the prices were very reasonable. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"This is follow-up regarding my ordering experience. I have to say that Lou's went above and beyond to make things right. Not only did they fulfill my order, the pizzas were delicious! For anyone doubting the authentic Lou's taste, go in and see for yourself. The pizza was just as good as I remember. I fed a large group of Chicago transplants and we all agreed it was just like home. Special thanks to Mike Sterner for taking the time to personally address the issue."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I'm a butter crust bitch.
Service was actually pretty impressive considering how ridiculously busy they are."}
{"text":"Just like the ones back in Chicago. They're doing it right. They've got the flavors down, the pH of the water matched. Service was typically terrific, attentive, professional but casual, like it should be. The family behind this growing pizza empire truly cares about quality. You will not find a better Chicago pizza anywhere else. 

This place is gonna be mighty popular once it opens to the public. Expect a long wait during popular times and a moderate wait at all other times, though there is a lot of seating so it might not be terrible during off peak times. No reservations, but you can order your pizza when you show up so your wait for the food at the table is not as long. 

They offer carryout, delivery (within certain boundaries), and frozen pies to cook at home (so very good, almost as good as in the restaurant, but not quite). 

Only open for dinner, but I expect them to eventually open for lunch too."}
{"text":"Not much to be excited about here.   Tried their classic deep dish and it looked great when it came to the table.   The issue is the lack of flavor.   Actually had to sprinkle a little salt on it to give it any taste.   The layered,  pale sausage is plentiful but tastes like a bland breakfast patty.   The sauce was virtually flavorless.   Plenty of cheese but that is not what makes a great pie.   Plenty of better local deep dish pies in town.   Very disappointing for all the buildup to this joint coming to town."}
{"text":"I loved, loved, loved the deep dish pizza, the crust was just delicious! We sat out on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere. Staff was attentive and pleasant. I don't lilve nearby, but will certainly make the trip again."}
{"text":"Just dropped 128.00 including tip... let me say the service was so slow but the staff was polite. The food was so bad! We waited an hour to be seated and preordered.  The pizza came almost two hours after we preordered! The thick pizza was good but the thin pizza was like chewing on a cardboard disk it was so dry the crust was not edible and the top of the pizza  was brown rubber not cheese . We had calamari which was okay and Lou's salad which was the best part of meal. This place was humming and extremely understaffed. The waiter was awesome and friendly.  Ir was my son in laws birthday and they did sing to him. I have mixed emotions because the fact that it took 2 and 1/2 hours to eat mediocre food stunk. I could've eaten better at TraderJoes!  Thank god we have great food  in LA. I would NEVER eat here again:/"}
{"text":"Pretty busy at night but the lunch specials are pretty good. You can sneak in if you go just before the lunch rush and get seated pretty fast. The pizza is delicious, their mushrooms on the appetizer menu are okay, not my fav. Ambiance is fun and can get pretty loud."}
{"text":"Lou's pizza. That's all that's necessary to express my review. This place reminds me of Chicago every time I visit."}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage pizza. It's so good!! The crust is so buttery and the whole thing is covered in a giant sausage patty. Tastes just like the pizza I used to get in Chicago! Maybe even better.. The house salad with the gorgonzola dressing is to die for. I'm not even a huge fan of salad, but that salad is delicious. The only down side is the wait, but that is understandable since they cook every pizza fresh after you order and deep dish takes a while. I'd rather wait than have a pizza that was sitting under a heater for hours. The servers are usually really nice as well!"}
{"text":"I have no interest in deep dish pizza and not a whole lot of love for Chicago, having had its wonderfulness shoved down my throat during the 36+ years that I have lived here. 

Still, I do love pizza and was a bit curious when I heard that they also served a thin crust pizza. When I found out that they deliver, I could not resist. I live a little more than two miles from the place, don't know how far their delivery area extends. Using their website, I ordered a thin crust pizza with pepperoni. There were options for extra tomato sauce and extra cheese but no options for less of either. You can order it gooey, regular, crispy and \"half baked\". You could also specify cut or uncut, they recommended uncut but the radio button for cut was preset. I specified regular and cut. I was ordering around 5:35, they said the delivery would come 6:30-6:45.

The pie arrived at 6:38 as promised. It was a little less warm than I would have liked it but not bad for a 2+ mile delivery. The cheese was on the top. The pizza was cut in squares. I was impressed with the crust, the edge pieces in particular. There was more cheese than I would have wanted and maybe a little more sauce. The sauce was pretty good, I'd give it a B. The crust, particularly on the middle pieces, was a little softer than optimal. I might try crispy the next time, if there is a next time.

Overall it was not a bad experience. Might just order again, but then again there are tons of pizza options in this part of town, some that I haven't tried yet like Federal Pizza. I definitely wouldn't go to Lou Malnati's nor would I partake of their signature deep dish offerings, but for delivery it wasn't half bad."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere.  Went on a date with my husband of 19 years and we had a blast.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally. Real Chicago pizza in Phoenix. Tastes like home. If you're impatient or a complainer, go early during the week. If you know what to expect when you go to a specialty one of a kind in the market restaurant, come in when it's busy, enjoy the bar and the company of your friends, and eat some awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Having lived in Chicago my whole life, I grew up with amazing deep dish pizza.  And Lou's has never disappointed. 

Here's my theory.  When you take top-shelf ingredients and wed them with great preparation and execution, you end up with a perfect pie.   That means you don't need to pile on 10 different toppings in hopes of adding some flavor to your pizza. 

To prove my point, on one of those nights when you're on the fence about what to eat, simply order a cheese pizza from Lou's.  You will be amazed."}
{"text":"Let's start out that I am From Chicago and 
know pizza! Do not I repeat do not come here and less you are a deep dish pizza fan!
We got the thin crust and it was a $20 cracker no toppings no cheese no sauce!
And to be honest if you are going to do deep dish pizza you might as well go to Gino's!"}

Lou-boo-tons: That feeling you get in your gut when you've eaten a ton of Lou Malnati's (I doubt you'll feel sexy and stylish).

My last review for 2017!

I had been wanting to try out the Phoenix locations of Lou Malnati's since they had opened. It had been a while since I had dined at Lou's in Chicago so I wanted to try out their deep dish again. The Arcadia location was closest to where we were so we headed out, fully expecting a sit down restaurant. When we got here, we were surprised to see only one car in the parking lot and a tiny building with dark paneled windows. It looked so deserted I had thought that the business was actually closed for the day. 

We entered and were even more surprised to see that there was just one single counter, with a fridge and freezer selling frozen pizzas, salads and sides. I didn't see any kitchen (Although now I know there's probably one in the back) and the employee at the counter was on the phone with another customer for quite some time so I didn't even know that you could place a hot pizza order for pick up or delivery. Once she was done taking the phone order she did mention that a lot of people make the same mistake by coming here, thinking it's a second sit-down location. Hey Lou's, perhaps you need to rename this location Lou's To Go so there isn't any further confusion with customers!

Since we were already here we got 2 one topping pizzas from the frozen section. Our total was $30+. Over $15 for a 9 inch pizza? I mean sure it's deep dish and filling and whatnot, but we only had one topping for each pizza and we had to heat it up ourselves in our own oven! Well... it better be worth it and taste like a pizza you can get at one of their restaurants!

The pizzas themselves are well packaged and were easy to transport back. Opening them up, they did look a bit disappointing. I don't think the crust is as thick as the pizzas they serve at the restaurant (Or maybe the recipe changed since I ate at the Chicago location years ago?). I was hoping maybe the crust would rise a little after heating it in the oven, but it looked the same. As for the \"deep dish\" aspect, it was more of a \"medium dish\" amount of filling and topping for me.

We had a sausage and a spinach pizza and heated both up at the same time. Out of the two I preferred the spinach because it had a better balance of sauce, topping, and cheese. The sausage pizza needed more sauce, but then also suffered from having a crust that was too rock hard along the edges but too doughy in the top layer. We cut each pizza into 4 slices and I was able to eat a slice of each before getting full.

I wasn't very satisfied with the frozen pizzas, but I might be back to try out their hot carryout pizzas and I'll definitely check out the dine-in location for next time!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. I was hoping that would be the case while sitting in line for almost two hours. Thank god that ended up being the case. I didn't appreciate being told it would be 45 minutes and actually end up being an hour and a half. It didn't help I was dying of starvation from not eating all day and it being 10:30pm. I am not about judging a restaurant based on the wait times. They can't help they are this in demand. Once we sat down our waitress was very nice and thanked us for waiting so long. Luckily they give you an option while waiting in line to preorder your pizza so that they have it to your table within 15 minutes of sitting down. Normally deep dish pizza can be up to a 45 minute wait. We ordered an appetizer (3 cheese bread). It was delicious. It comes with some marinara which was good too. By the time we finish the appetizer the pizza arrives. One bite in and I am overcome with relief that the pizza was by far and away worth the wait. The ingredients are amazing. The crust was probably one of the best parts. Some deep dish crust gets a little soggy. Not here. There crust was like a pie crust in how in was dry and how it broke apart as you bite into it. The tomatoes are big standouts when you take a bite. You can tell they use the best ingredients. I got sausage, pepperoni and onions. I love their sausage. My mouth is just bursting with flavor from every direction with all these delectable ingredients. I love the way the restaurant is set up. It is pretty cool looking with a bar in a separate room, the check in in a separate room and the dining room in a separate room as well. The dining room is filling with multiple huge TVs playing all Chicago games that may be on TV at the time. The whole dining room set up looks really nice. Everyone was friendly, especially our server. Food comes out fast. When you come to a restaurant like this you shouldn't really consider the cost. You are about to devour an American treasure. Luckily the cost was very fair and comparable, despite the demand. They have a gorgeous patio too if you don't want to dine inside. I am glad I made the drive from Chandler to come here. No regrets. Maybe just wait a few weeks for it to hopefully die down a little bit. Everyone wants to come now so unless you like a wait maybe hold off a bit."}
{"text":"Lou Malnati's is absolutely fantastic. Since they opened in Phoenix in 2016, they've been one of my favorite restaurants. I believe they have the most authentic Chicago deep dish pizza in the Valley. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So, I LOVE deep dish pizza.  I thought Oreganos was ok, Geno's pretty good. Then Lou Malnati's opened a take out location in Arcadia. And now.... \"Hi, my name is Leslie and I'm a Lou Malnati's  pizzaholic...\" Don't like deep dish? Try their thin crust... There is something about their crust, either one thin or thick. You're either going to LOVE it or hate it. ME? It has me salivating all the way home. The smell... yummmmm! They use FRESH mozzarella and PLENTY of it. Fresh chunky tomato sauce, fresh ingredients. I want to try their bruschetta, but crave the pizza too much. Their tiramisu is fresh and tasty also.  The salads? Dont know, dont care its PIZZZZZZAAAAA!
The only bummer? They don't have a dining room. Their staff is friendly and professional as well."}

{"text":"Let's just say it will take some serious convincing to go back here. Checked in for a table and was old it would be 35 minutes. I was fine with that. Gave me a chance to look at the menu. They have an option to preorder food so when you sit down it will be ready. I wouldn't do that based of the fact that your wait Tim could increase like mine did by an additional 45 minutes. Now let's talk about the food I ordered the chicken with mushrooms and spinach. That was awful. There was no flavor or taste to my food. My daughters pizza was dry and no flavor as well. I hate salt in my food and I was salting my food. The waiter was amazing and kind and the manager gave us a discount for the wait, which was nice but that food though. I've had better . My friends lasagna was good from what he says . The best part of the dinner was the honey bbq chicken wings."}
{"text":"I was expecting more of the crust.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled by Uno's deep dish pizza crust that had a lot of flavor to it.  I felt Lou's was a tad on the bland side.  I'll be back to try the gluten free and regular pizza though.  Glad to have it in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza in valley with super awesome service. Bruschetta are to die for with crispy bread on sides and soft at center. Calamari is another amazing appetizer we tried. I tried \"the Lou\" veggie deep dish and my beau tried his classic pepperoni deep - pizza was perfectly made with great sauce, you can actually taste fresh tomatoes in it. And best way to end is with combo dessert with piece of tiramisu , cookie ice cream topped with cherry and key lime pie. We enjoyed it so much we wanted to go there the next day but controlled ourselves not longer than 6 days. It was as perfect the second time like we experienced the first time . It is one of our spots now."}
{"text":"I've gotta give it to em, the food here is right on par with the Chicago restaurants.  We did forget to order extra cheese, the way we always ordered in Chicago, but other than that, it tasted great. There are few good New York style pizza joints here, but We've missed good Chicago pizza. 

We did have to send some glass and silverware back, lipstick and dried food crusties, so they need to work on paying attention to that.  They loose one star for this. The food, the atmosphere, and employees attitudes were 5 star worthy. 

It was a great pleasure to meet Marc. Being a Chicago celebrity, he's as down to earth and genuine as it gets."}
{"text":"Ah a little slice of Chicago in the desert. Located in a little shopping market plaza next to a nitro ice cream shop Lou Malnati's has found its Arizona home. The service here is top notch, the nicest servers and hosts. The red sauce pizza with sausage deep dish was their signature and so filling I don't know why we ordered a second pizza, which was a thin crust with our choice of veggies mine were mushrooms, my friend got jalapeños."}
{"text":"Malnati's stays true to its Chicago roots, with comedically thick slices of \"pizza,\" loaded with cheese, cheese, veggies, meats, sauce, and cheese.  My partner grew up near Chicago, and to him this is--of course--what pizza looks, tastes, and eats like.  

But I struggle.  

To order this pizza in Italy, you'd be better off ordering a pasta dish, sneaking in a brick of mozzarella, and combining both with a basic piece of bread.  Okay, that had nothing to do with anything.  Just a random thought. 

Back to my gripe with Malnati's.  I like it plenty in Chicago where it feels right at home in the biting winter, preceded by and chased down with a pitcher of Old Style and another crappy Bears team, but in Phoenix it just feels forced.  It's far from the first Chicago retread, and it's bound to be similarly successful (regardless of Yelp review).  I guess it's not completely fair to punish Malnati's for any of that, so I'll move on to the food.

The pizza, a term used liberally, is more akin to a giant mozzarella stick with pizza toppings.  It is mostly Mozzarella, a thin breading at the bottom and thicker crust at the end, a hearty helping of admittedly tasty tomato sauce, and generous toppings.  But it simply lacks the cohesion of a great pizza.  It's practically impossible to eat by hand, the bottom breading is soggy because of the heaps of cheese and sauce on top of it, and by the time you've finished a slice, you're not exactly craving the next one.  You might have another to overkill your appetite, but it doesn't have you yearning for more like a well-balanced Neopolitan or wood-fire oven. Or a (gasp) Brooklyn style slice.  

I've committed enough Chicago sacrilege for one review.  I'll close by recommending this place (or soon, Gino's East's desert location) to anyone that hasn't tried Chicago style pizza before.  I suppose you should try it simply because it might be for you.  But as far as pizza--perhaps one of America's favorite repeat meals--this brand simply doesn't command much repeating."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of deep dish pizza this place does a great job of it. We got seated within 10 minutes of arriving. The waitress was very sweet and on top of our table needs and helpful as far as suggestions. We loved the Malnati salad, fresh and the dressing was a perfect compliment. We ordered the Lou pizza and that definitely delivers for the meat lovers. The butter crust was on point both on the bottom and the outer crust itself. Each of us could only eat one slice though, pretty heavy stuff with the sausage and mozzarella, still worth trying though."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday and we're seated immediately. Our server was attentive but not overbearing. The food came out quick, we got two personal 9\" deep dish pizzas. I got the Lou and added pepperoni and it was fantastic. One thing that really was great...my wife dropped her fork as a busser was nearby. Hearing that, he came right over to ask if we needed a new one. In a lot of places, that person would have just kept on doing their thing. Kudos, Lou's!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Thank you Alex for going out of your way for us. A friend suggested this restaurant and swore that this was the best Chicago style pizza around. So much so that he used to have pizzas FedExed to him from the restaurant in Chicago. We drove downtown and got stuck in traffic for the electric lights parade. We literally drove around in circles for almost 3 hours. Apparently the restaurant was right inside of the parade area and nearly impossible to get to, but we didn't know that and kept trying to take different side streets to get there, finding that every route we tried was closed down. After so much work, we didn't want to give up. We called the restaurant and Alex stayed on the phone with us for 20 minutes and directed us into the restaurant. He also put in our pizza order while we were driving. After getting to the restaurant everyone was very accommodating. Alex came out and greeted us several times. They sat us at the best spot on the patio next to the fireplace. He also comped our appetizer. Our pizza was ready within 20 minutes of arriving. My friend was right about the pizza. We ordered the stuffed spinach pizza. It was amazing and incredibly filling. I will definitely go back and tell my friends about this place. (And I'm from St Louis, so making a Chicago style pizza fan out of me isn't an easy task). Thank you Alex."}
{"text":"Very good deep dish pizza with butter crust! Definitely will be back! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great service I highly recommend this location to bad they do not have one in the Los Angeles area would go frequently"}
{"text":"So happy they are in Phx now! Last time I had Lou's, It was in Chicago in 2001. Still tasted awesome. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tasty thick crust Chicago style pizza...good selection of toppings.  Good selection of beers.   Nice decor in Camelback location."}
{"text":"First we hated the lack of service. We were seated and waited at least five minutes before giving up on the server. When I went to the hostess station to ask if our server knew where we were the hostess seem surprised that I was even concerned. They sent a substitute server because our server was chatting with other customers. The substitute server at first refused to take our pizza order, because she wanted to wait for a real server. Since the pizza takes a half an hour to cook, we were rather perturbed by this. She finally did place the pizza order. About five more minutes later our real server came and gave a very lame apology for the delay.

But I understand people have off days on service. So normally I would only knock off one star for terrible service. The real problem was the pizza was not good. The crust was very hard, perhaps over cooked? And the crust seem to be missing something. I wondered if perhaps they had forgotten to salt it? We ordered the recommended pizza, the one with sausage. The sausage was dry and rather tasteless. Overall the place is a big disappointment. We will never go again. Given that there is an excellent deep dish pizza place just down the road, we have no reason to patronize this horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Hope you have a lot of time, like 3+ hours to get average pizza in a crowded din of noise. Other than that it was fine. No mas for me"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. The interior of the place is really nice and it has a nice patio area as well. This is a well known Chicago deep dish pizza place and is in such a great up and coming location. For anyone who wants a good, authentic, deep dish pizza, you need to try this place. It is a great place and just opened less than a year ago! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Am I the only person that thinks that Lou Malnatis is overrated? Their pizza crust has no flavor and they hardly put any tomato sauce on the their pizza. Not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Okay, I have been wanting to go to Lou's, ever since I heard they were coming to Phoenix.  I heard all about the special care that was being taken to make sure the pizza ordered in Phoenix would be exactly the same as one ordered in Chicagoland.

We have been to Lou's twice now, and I just don't get it.  The pizza was good, but not great.  I will confess that while having been to Chicago several times on business and family matters, I have never eaten at a Lou Malnatis before.  I have eaten at Gino's East (meh) one time, and Uno's (5 stars, far and away my favorite Chicago pizza) about a half dozen times.

I am glad that Lou decided to come to the desert, and I wanted to not just like it, but love it and crave it, but it's just not so.

Our first visit was between Christmas and New Years.  We wanted the restaurant to be open for a while and for the newness to wear off.  Sorry, I just don't like to go to new restaurants and wait an hour or two for a table just so I can say \"yeah, I've been there\".  I would rather let a restaurant open, get into it's groove, and let the crowds die down a bit.

For Christmas, we received a gift card for Lou's from my brother and sis-in-law.  I was thinking that this was a truly Divine Direction from Above that it was not only time to try Lou's, but that Pizza Nirvana was waiting for me at Central and Camelback. 

So...while everyone was off from work/school we made the trek to central Phoenix for a late lunch early dinner.  We walked in, were greeted and promptly seated in the booth right across from the kitchen door.  I liked it, I could window shop all the food coming out and wait in anticipation for Pizza Nirvana to show up on our table.

We ordered a large Malnati Chicago Classic, a bruschetta appetizer, and for junior, a meatball sandwich with french fries. 

The bruschetta appeared pretty fast, was a large serving (I think it was 6 or 8 slices of bread with the toppings), and looked so good, even junior had one.  I couldn't wait to bite into a piece; but when I did, something was missing...flavor, there was none.  Pass the salt shaker...

Our pizza and Jr.'s sandwich appeared about the same time.  Our server brought out our pan of goodness and served our first slices to us.  The pizza looked wonderful, the crust was golden, and the sauce was perfectly red.  Once again, I couldn't wait to dig in.  Alas, as with the bruschetta, the flavor was lacking.  Pass the salt shaker please...  :(  The crust was buttery, but not flavorful, the sauce looked great and tasted okay, but flat.  The pizza was loaded with Italian sausage; but once again, was lacking the flavor that good Italian sausage has (think garlic, fennel, maybe some red pepper flakes, etc...).  Not a bad pizza, just disappointing.

Junior's meatball sandwich looked good, big and covered with a nice slice of mozzarella cheese, a side of sauce, and a bunch of thin curly fries.  I did sample a small piece of meatball, and a couple of fries.  The meatballs were plump and juicy, but...you guessed it, lacked flavor.
Junior said his sandwich was okay, but he thought at the time he liked Oregano's meatball sandwich better.

So, we left Lou's that fateful December day, with leftovers and a willingness to return and try it again.

Fast forward to mid-March (last Wednesday to be exact).  Junior is off on Spring Break, and my wife and I are off also.  We decide that this would be a perfect time to try Lou's again and give it another shot.  So, we arrived around 2:45 and were promptly greeted and seated.  There were only a few other tables occupied in the dining room, and we actually got the same table we had the first time.  Our server took our order (we ordered exactly the same as last time, so we could compare each visit with the same food) and we waited and hoped for the best.  Once again, the bruschetta came out fast and large.  Once again, no flavor...

Junior's sandwich and our pizza came out and we were hopeful, the pizza looked great, but alas, flavor was not to be found.  Same for Junior's meatball sandwich...second time around, same experiment, same result.

I don't want fellow Yelpers to think this is a hit piece on Lou Malnati's, because it's not.  I want to give an honest review and share our thoughts and experience with others.

About the bruschetta, I would kindly suggest to the management at Lou's to drive north up the I-17 and try the bruschetta at Times Square on Deer Valley road.  Times Square knows bruschetta.

Lou's pizza was good, but not great.  More of a \"meh...\" than a \"Wow!\".  The crust, sauce, and other ingredients all appear to be top notch.  The flavor is just not there, and I don't understand why.

I gave Lou Malnatti's 3 stars, because I don't think they deserve any less.  The staff was efficient, the place was clean, and the food was okay, but not great.  I would love to try a Lou Malnati's back in Chicagoland and see if it's the same.  Maybe it's time for a road trip..."}
{"text":"FINALLY !!! Oregano's can go ahead and close Malnati's is here!

Went on Saturday night, knew it was going to be a zoo and fully expected it, they are high tech in the sense that you tell them your name and phone number, they text you your position in line and update it as you move up. You can also check your position on the webpage anytime you want. We were 16th and had about an hour wait, we also ordered our food when we checked in (DO THIS!!!) so when we finally sat down it was 10 minutes and we were eating!

If you've ever been in Chicago then you know that it's either Malnati's or Gino's and Malnati's is usually the best so welcome to Phoenix!!! 

The restaurant is trendy / hipster to some extent, nice outdoor area with misters for the summer, modern inside, take out service available as well as pre-made pies in the fridge you can grab and go and cook at home. 

Pricing for 2 with a couple of drinks was 48 before the tip so I would say, really exceptional considering we often spend 80 or more on a night out. 

Manager was also running around outside talking to people in line and serving them small samples of a thin crust, really nice gesture. 

Overall AWESOME"}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't my favorite. Too tomatoey for my taste. Maybe I'm just not a deep dish person? ...but I also wasn't impressed with the wings or the combination platter. For all the hype it gets I expected a lot more out of this place. Seemed just mediocre to me. Salad looked good though, might try that next time."}
{"text":"How I missed Chicago pizza! I mean real Chicago pizza! There will be of course a wait here but it'll be worth it!

They do not take reservations so make sure not to walk in hangry. We had an hour and 10 minute wait. They took my info and text me (with a chicago number!) when my table was ready. I love that they text you with a link to see the status of where you are in line. I also love that you can preorder your food so when you finally get to your table you don't have to wait another half hour or so for your food (so you won't get hangrier). The wait for us ended up being about an hour and the food was out an ready within about 10 lonutes after sitting down.
As a Chicagoan, I know that a deep dish pizza will take about 45 minutes to make.  Also some advice, if you've never had a deep dish, for two people get a small pizza. You just need a slice maaaybe two and then you are full. Oh and also make sure you get buttercrust. Tastes amazing! 
Wish I could've made it to dessert...maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Last night I experienced Lou Malnati's for the first time and it will likely be my last.
After being good and not eating pasta for more than a month (I am a pasta addict!) I went against my better judgement and decided last night would be a \"cheat night\" and I would treat myself.
I ordered the bowtie pasta with vodka sauce and sausage. I LOVE everything this dish has to offer and was really excited. 
The flavor was great - which is always a plus. But overall, I was pretty disappointed and completely regret getting this dish. The flavor was literally the only thing it had in its favor.
The pasta was WAY over cooked. I understand this place is known for its pizza, but that doesn't mean the pasta should be put on the back burner. I couldn't even get my bowtie pasta on my fork without it falling apart and slipping back into the bowl. The texture was just mush. It didn't help that the sauce was soupy. So it wouldn't even stick to the already mushy pasta. I was basically eating soup.
My boyfriend got the fettuccini Alfredo and it had ZERO taste. He had to load it with cheese, salt and pepper to finally get some substance to it. At least his noodles were cooked correctly, though.
What a disappointment for a day I would finally eat pasta again, not to mention a waste of money."}
{"text":"4:30PM - We placed our order online. Their site was easy to navigate but it really bugged me that they didn't put the actual size of the pizza online (ie. 7'' diameter, etc). Instead, there were suggested serving sizes. A small serves 2-3, it said. Well, I guess a small will do. Deep dish? Yes. The Malnati Chicago Classic, please. Uncut is better for take out, you say? Uncut it is, then.
6:15PM - Scheduled pick up.

I personally didn't pick up the pizza, so I can't speak for the ambience of the restaurant. However, the hubby did tell me the line for dining in was ree-di-cu-lous. At least an hour's wait, he guessed. The pick up line was a tad shorter but still fairly long, from what I hear.

Now fast forward to where I finally get to see the pizza in person. 30 minutes after the hubby picked it up. It wasn't as deep as I had expected and strangely, the tomato sauce didn't cover our entire pizza (Maybe the toppings shifted on the drive home?). But it was delicious nonetheless. We cut up the pizza ourselves and the cheese was fantastic. I'm no cheese connoisseur, but I eat enough pizzas to say this was some damn good mozzarella. Unlike your usual pizza, the cheese comes into direct contact with the crust, with the sausage and tomato sauce sitting above the cheese. The small was perfect for the two of us too. It was just filling enough and a medium probably would have put my stomach's capacity to the test. Did I mention that the crust had enough of a crisp but with some chewiness to remind you that this was indeed a deep dish and not a thin crust.

I most definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, we drove 2 hours round trip just to try the Chicago Sausage Classic and all I can say is I'm NOT impressed at all. The Chicago style from Buddyz is SO MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"Great Classic Deep Dish! Love the crust!  Looking forward to coming back and trying some different things. Had appetizer combo and it was good. Servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"So good! We got 3 kinds of deep dish pizza and each one was perfect. The wait wasn't too bad since we pre-ordered and the waiter was a cool dude. I'm usually very picky about sauce but I have literally no complaints. Would return again and again."}
{"text":"mediocre at best!  Quality of sauce, cheese and crust does not stand to their reputation. We tried it once and gave it another chance. Two stars."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. My daughter and her boyfriend loved the pizza. I was ok with it. The bruschetta was awesome as was the home made ranch dressing. They will most likely go back.  Not sure if I will. Came from N Scottsdale. Bit of a drive."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. This is the 2nd time I've eaten here and the last for sure. Ordered the deep dish pizza (bisquick Dough) and a stewed tomato pizza sauce? Flavorless and over priced for what we got. We even told the server we didn't like the food and she agreed that the deep dish \"wasn't very good\" 65$ lunch with 3 drinks between us and a personal pizza and a small thin crust. Don't waste your time, if you aren't from Chicago you probably won't understand paying for crappy food."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Over pizza... But, not just over a pizza but, a deep dish pizza Chicago style. I've never been to Chicago nor have anything to compare this too other than Pizza Hut or CPK! 
That's the only pizza I've been around and in San Diego! But, this pizza was aaammmmaaazzziinnngg!

Upon our arrival it was super crowded, people outside with their family members waiting outside at least there are chairs and a nice grassy area for kids to run around. The crowd well it's too be expected since I heard this is the first Chicago deep dish pizza in the desert/valley area and they recently opened last week, so it's a new hype place! 

Well, as we were entering and placing our name on the one hour wait list. There were two seats opening up at the bar and we gracefully went over to grab it and crossed our name off the wait list and decided to have beers and our dinner there with Nikki, Holly, and the rest of the gang! This was sooo nice if you don't have kids go straight to the bar much faster beats the wait list. 

Nikki and Holly were sooo very nice, upbeat, super friendly, courteous, having fun, and very conversational! Don't you hate it when sometimes you go to the bar and the bartenders are such duds with no personality... Well, not here total opposite and loved every minute I was sitting at the bar! 

Nikki had suggested we try the buffalo green salad and I'm so very thankful we did! Gosh, what a interesting mix of greens. It had buffalo (which normally I don't care to eat), gorgonzola cheese, their delicious house dressing mixed, and watermelon. It was the best tasting salad I've had in Phoenix & the first time to try it with all these different Flavors. It was sooo yummy!!!

On to the pizza, we had to stick to the original deep dish pizza with the butter crust. We figure we ordered the medium pizza (serves about 3ppl) I told my husband get the small size because I'm not a big eater, literally one slice is normally my limit! Lol and sure enough the taste and my first bite into the sauce, cheese, and crust was just yummy! Flavors of all sorts was dancing around and it was almost melting in my mouth as I devoured one piece! It was sooo huge and plenty! I also think having a few beers didn't help the process of me wanting to have another piece! I was a happy camper! 

I really enjoyed last nights dinner, I enjoyed being out, and trying something sooo new! Can't wait for my kids to come up and take them over here to try some Chicago pizza! 

Mahalo Nikki and Holly (I hope I'm saying your names correctly) for making our night fun!"}
{"text":"Well well well....what kind of pizza do we have here!? Family was raving about the place so we had to try. It was a very long wait, and we couldn't make a reservation as it wasn't allowed even with a large party. Inside/outside seating was a great option specially with the weather in Phoenix in September. My wife is pregnant and was starving so immediately after being seated we ordered the combo platter, and a minestrone soup for her. The soup serving size was literally a tea cup.  Unfortunately, I have nothing to say about it besides don't disappoint yourself and order it. Flavorless. The combo platter had a deep fried assortment of cheese sticks, squares, zucchini and mushrooms with ranch and marinara. The cheese squares were over cooked and not melted. The rest, well was just deep fried lol. We created our own pizza, pepperoni, mushrooms, tomato, sausage, and spinach. Upon arrival it smelled amazing but looked rather watery on the top. I'm not sure what caused that. Our waiter was nice and served the slices, very large. The pizza was so so, it seemed to have less flavor than what the smell gave off. I ate one slice and was full. It was a decent pizza, but if I go again I'll definitely switch it up to see if the result is better. I say go try the place because it's cool, and hopefully your choices come out better than mine did."}
{"text":"K. So I've been to their establishment in Chicago and was dying to try this place. Very happy I did!

They were able to replicate the taste of their pie to perfection. Our waitress told us they bring in the water for their dough straight from Chicago to make sure the dough is exactly the same as home. That's what I call dedication.

I love love love their salad too. My kids were hesitant to eat the salad but once they dove in, there wasn't any left!

Service was great. I loved the ambience of the place. It's actually better than Chicago :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza, hands down no competition! Second time at this location, great vibe, friendly service. They don't take reservations so it's first come first serve so you might have to wait a while for a table. We got one straight away though. Pizza was delicious, we got the large Chicago classic , that buttercrust! It just makes the pizza so much better than the any others. Best deep dish around, don't know if can go back to thin base pizza. Save space for desert too, the warm cookie skillet is the perfect way to finish off the meal!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Chicago style pizza - this is the place. Being from Chicago this restaurant makes me feel a little less homesick. I'm a fan of the \"Malnati Chicago Classic\" deep dish. Even though I usually don't order sausage on pizza, I highly suggest going with the Malnati Classic."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try this place because she found out about the keto pizza (no crust/bread, just sausage patty sauce, cheese and toppings), which apparently had very good reviews. This pizza place is tucked in by the corner of the shopping center. The location is quite big and they have a bar near the entrance.
Parking was busy, service was very good.
We ordered just the crustless pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos. It was very tasty and filling.
We arrived around 4pm on a Saturday and we did not have to wait to be seated. By the time we left there was a line already."}
{"text":"I've been to at least 4 or 5 different Lou Malnati's in Chicago and this one was likely built much more recently so has a very nice modern look but I would eat this pizza in solitary confinement its that good. To have this pizza again was one of the main reasons we drove from Tucson.

Still waiting to hear when Lou Malnati's will open in Tucson..."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was good. I sat at the bar for quick service. Food came fast. Beer selection ok. Beers were poured with no head. Need to learn how to pour a beer."}
{"text":"I am always excited to eat Chicago style deep dish in Phoenix, especially when it's a company that's actually FROM Chicago!! I stopped in one day and ordered a sausage deep dish. De-li-cious!! I sat in the bar area and, even though the bartender was busy working the full bar and other tables, he was still nice and gave great service! I would love to get back there soon!"}
{"text":"Carry out customer service girl completely rude. Ignored me. Pick up was for 2 not even ready. Wanted cooked pizza somehow they advised my friend to get half baked. Not what I wanted. She was totally rude when I said I wanted cooked. Major disappointment for this Chicago girl."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza pizza! This was my first experience here. Make sure you are hungry and have some extra time to spare as it takes 30-40 minutes for your pizza to bake (waiter does inform you of the wait time!). Pizza was good but would have preferred it to be hotter."}
{"text":"I've been composing this review in my head ever since it was first announced that Lou Malnati's was coming to Phoenix. Being from Chicago I've eaten Lou's from several locations: River North on Wells Street, Gold Coast on State Street, Naperville, IL, Carol Stream, IL and the Bucktown location. I am thrilled to say that the Phoenix pizza is JUST AS GOOD AS THE CHICAGO locations!!!!! 

I recently discovered that I have an intolerance to gluten. I was prepared to suffer week long stomach pain for this pizza when my sister suggested I check the website to see if GF options are available. THANK YOU GOD!!!!! For that simple fact alone you deserve 10 stars. I no longer eat meat and found my onion and garlic pizza just as delicious as a sausage or pepperoni. The tomatoes and cheese were top notch as usual.

Moving to Phoenix several years ago I've been homesick for many types of food, pizza just one of them. Every year since moving here my husband and I would ship Lou Malnati's pizza for our Christmas dinner. For me it's not just about the pizza, it actually feels like a part of home is in Central Phoenix and I can't thank you enough."}
{"text":"We came in on a Wednesday, there was no wait. We ordered our pizza and appetizers right away because the pizza takes a while! Nancy our server was very attentive and knowledgeable! Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza, we each got what we wanted and they all exceeded our expectations. Great wings and impeccable service."}
{"text":"Wishes do come true! I wished and wished for a Lou Malnati's to open in Phoenix and fast forward 4 years, here we are!! 

My first visit was about a month after opening. The wait was not that bad around 6:00 PM on a Monday. We pre-ordered just our pizza at the register; the rest of the order is taken at the table. We got a small extra cheese, extra sauce, basil, garlic, and tomatoes with the butter crust pizza. It was EXTRA delicious!! We also got an order of wings. The wings were good, but they do not taste the same as they do in Chicago. Our server was very friendly. My friend wanted pink lemonade, which they did not have. But to our surprise, he went and made it personally for her. So sweet!

My second visit with some of my favorite people was also great! We did not have to wait too long (or it could have been that I was late, of course). We had a pretty big order and separate checks. Our waitress handled it like a champ and took great care of us. 

Lou Malnati's in Phoenix gave me exactly what I expected: Phenomenal food and customer service! I will be back...over and over!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Lou Malnati's since I left Chicago three years ago. I wasn't sure if a Lou Malnati's in Phoenix would taste the same and this location did not disappoint! 

I ordered a large deep dish with sausage and several veggies and it was excellent! I'm ecstatic that my favorite deep dish Chicago pizzeria is in Phoenix and putting out pizza of the same quality as they do in the Windy City!

I've been eating at Lou's since the early 1980's at their original location in Lincolnwood, IL and will always return as long as they taste as good as this last pizza!"}
{"text":"Similar to Peter Piper Pizza, but worse. I wish their service made up for it but we got our pizza before we ever got our drink order..which is saying something because the pizza arrives in 45 minutes. The waiter only came back once to bring back one glass of water while the other 4 were still empty."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza so good, so filling and so worth it. Bruschetta is hands down the best perfect toast perfect flavor. Everything is fresh and made exactly the way Pizza should be. The service was far far from the best but the food is so good it compensates for the empty drinks, and extended time not being attended to. So go for the food and expect a great meal."}
{"text":"This is as close to home pizza that I can get in Arizona. It's Chicago pizza in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"My friend and I went today for lunch. Had the lunch special of the deep dish cheese pizza, salad, and a drink (I chose the green tea which was great). The salad come after just a couple of minutes and it blew my mind away. Nice size and very fresh crisp vegetables. I had the Balsamic vinegar and olive oil separate from my salad so I could control just the amount I wanted.
Our pizza came about 30 minutes later. Our waiter, Andrew, who was from the Chicago restaurant was superb. He will only be here for a short time as he was brought in to train the staff.
It really rated 5 stars but I wanted to just deduct 1/2 star due to the flooring. Just don't look down when walking as the pattern makes one quite dizzy. I wish they had done the large tiles or even laminate. It is too large of an area for such a pattern. Maybe just a touch of it here and there would have been better.
Parking is very difficult at this strip mall but that is nothing new as it has always been difficult to park there. Handicap spots are also very few and far between."}
{"text":"I love Chicago, the city , the nightlife and the pizza! I was so thrilled when I heard Lou's is coming to PHX. Went to the opening last night and it was everything I hoped for. Service was excellent and so was the pizza. I'm glad they had about 25 of their employees relocate from Chicago to run this shop- keeps it authentic!"}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza in Phoenix - yum! I had high expectations since I've had the original deep dish pizza in Chicago. My friends and I ordered the medium pepperoni deep dish pizza with butter crust (serves 3). As in most cases, deep dish pizza takes a while to cook, and the server warned us that it'd take about 30 mins for our pizza to come out.

The pizza itself tasted great, but I did expect it to be thicker, hence the \"deep\" in deep dish. It was smaller/thinner than other deep dish pizzas I've had. However, the food itself was yummy. The pepperoni, tomato sauce, crust, and most importantly, cheese came together all so perfectly.
I would come back again and try other pizzas here! 

Parking is free & shared with a bunch of other dining and shopping in the area."}
{"text":"I really like the decor, great place if you want to take a date or if you need to conduct a business meeting. Very upbeat design. I had the lunch special the service was amazing but the pizza left me looking for a bit more, nothing really stuck out to give it more than 4 stars at this point in time."}
{"text":"Below average. I had the chicken Alfredo and it was so excessively saucy it was like eating soup. And the flavor was very 1 note, needs something else. Kids had personal pizzas and I didn't think they were very good at all, the sauce had little flavor. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Perfect deep dish every time....
This is like black tar H for the Chicago pizza lover.

No frills....all thrills....

Oh yeah and they sell frozen pies so you can grub munch while binge watching whatever show you like (MLB for me)...."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful pizza place... Great Chicago style here just like the when I would visit Chicago. Nice and thick, tasty ingredients, amazing wait staff they were ontop of all our needs."}
{"text":"I had Lou Malnati's in Chicago on a business trip, and started ordering the pies frozen online.  That is how much I love it.  So you can imagine how crazy I went when they said they were opening a Phoenix location!  

I'm a native New Yorker, I love my NY style pizza.  But Lou Malnati's is just too good to pass up.  The buttery flaky crust, the cheese and sweet chunk tomatoes is the most flavorful pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Found this to be some tasty pizza.  Love the sauce and the Chicago deep dish style was great.  Definitely will be a place I return to!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, really good. I like the atmosphere as well. 

Only 4 stars because the wine list is lacking and it's not worth waiting over an hour for a table. 

Otherwise, pretty decent little spot."}
{"text":"Phew!  That was close!  The very astute server could tell (maybe from the angry scowl and the banging on my mobile device) that I was not a happy camper.  The first thing she said was, \"would you guys like to move to a bigger table?\"  Not only did that result in a bigger tip for her, but it saved what could have potentially been a nasty review.

I've been wanting to try the local Lou's ever since it opened, but the long lines/wait times coupled with Arizona heat has kept me away.  That all changed recently, when the kids were in town and said, \"we want Lou's\".  So, at rush hour on a Tuesday afternoon, we piled into the car to head to Uptown Plaza.  Traffic was horrible, but we finally arrived and found a spot near the courtyard that hosts Lou's.  Incredibly, it almost looked as though they were not open.

The hostess greeted us and we requested a table in the patio area.  She walked our party of five through the mostly empty patio to a corner away from the misters, right next to the door to the kitchen where the staff were congregating and sat us at a table hardly big enough for two.  I asked for a different table.  She offered to bring another chair.  I glared at her and we sat as she scurried away back to her podium.  Note to Lou's - training. Your hostess needs training in how to interpret clues and adapt to a situation to provide a quick solution.  The patio seats what, 60 or so people?  When it is practically empty, allow customers some flexibility as to where they can sit.  (rant over)

Our server-in-training was eager to please, polite and very smart.  She immediately recognized that there was a problem and solved it.  Moving us to a table that actually fit five people, we ordered beverages and some wings while we scanned the menu.  We ordered a Classic, a Lou's personal, a Gluten-Free and had the Biltmore Blonde microbrew.  After a bit, the wings came around and we devoured them.  Nicely crisped, meaty and coated with a mild hot sauce, they were quite tasty.  For me, a hotter sauce option would have been nice.  They offer a mild hot and a barbecue.  Wings come with celery sticks and your choice of dipping dressing.

The pizza's took a long time.  Not surprised though, I've been to the original Lou's in downtown Chicago on a night when it was -25f, and the place was packed, wall to wall people.  It took a long time there too, so we were expecting a wait.  Despite that, the manager came around, apologized for the long wait and offered us a free dessert.  Okay, the kids love pizooki, and she sent over two of them.  They were the typical baked choco-chip cookie with a pile of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream topped with a cherry.  Kids loved them.

The pizza's were perfect, as expected.  The Chicago classic is a deep-dish, baked with their butter crust, filled with savory sausage and a layer of mozzarella, topped with a fresh tomato sauce.  This is the pizza I dream about.  My wife, a vegetarian, had the \"Lou\", spinach, mushrooms, and roma tomatoes with their deep-dish buttercrust delivery mechanism.  She loved it.  Older daughter had the gluten-free, which is a thin-crust cheese pizza, again, a winner.

Service was exceptional, food was outstanding.  Hostess sucks.  Lou's is a five-star pizza."}
{"text":"We didn't feel like going out so we ordered on-line.  It was so easy.  Delivered 30 minutes later.  $3 delivery charge + tip.  The classic large was definitely LARGE and it was just the two of us.  Also ordered a salad as well.  Love the pizza and salad.  We're having leftovers tonight."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, outstanding pizza and appetizers. Six of us had two medium deep dish pizzas and a medium thin crust pizza. First came the combination appetizer platter. 

Hint: although you can't make reservations, you can order while you wait so once you're seated the pizzas come out fairly soon. 

Bonus: they use a great system, texting a website URL to your mobile phone. The link sends you to a page that shows where you are on the waitlist. 

They are known for their deep dish pizza, but I also wanted to try the thin crust. It was okay, but the whole family agreed that Spinato's is still our favorite Chicago style thin crust pizza in Phoenix. Next visit we will just get the deep dish. 

Value: 6 of us having soft drinks, appetizer, pizza and the chocolate chip cookie desert, brought home almost a whole pizza, and the bill was $87, with tip an even $100. Really a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I'm so excited for some new not chained  restaurants opening here in Arizona! And none other than my favorite city Chicago! Did I mention it's Chicago style pizza?! 

Lous doesn't open till 4pm but it's changing to lunch soon. I showed up 10 mins before and the line was out the door. I only waited 10 mins and was told to go straight to the dining room hostess. I was seated and greeted with a smile from both the hostess and the waiter Donald who happens to be from Chicago!

With great company with my friend who is from the city and the waiter who is from there as well my service was off to great start. 

The decor was pretty neat, bright signs and a very cool divey sorta feel, really sets the environment up for you. They got misters going outside for the patio seating which is really nice as well, lot of room. You walk in and right away you notice who is a fan of Chicago or from Chicago. A lot of people sporting the Windy City gear. 

 My friend and I ordered a beer and when it arrived my friend accidentally spilled her beer all over the table, floor and seat. Automatically we had two managers, two waiters and two bussers cleaning up our table, mopping the floor, wiping the seats. One manager brought my friend a fresh beer, another manager came up asked if she could replace it. I mean the service was excellent right off despite our mess. 
Our table was cleaned, new plates, new silverware, new beer less than 3 minutes! Talk about WOWing your customer with service. I felt like royalty, even though we messed up :) 

We order fresh bruschetta( my favorite) and it was simple and delicious. The bread wasn't hard to the bite and was crisp to perfection.  While eating our appetizer and sipping on our beer we were asked multiple times (not overwhelming) how our food was and if we needed anything.

Deep dish pizza takes time depending on size. We ordered a small ( feeds 2 about 4 slices) which was perfect for us. It took about 35 minutes, we ordered the The famous  Lou pizza  which is spinach, layers of mozzarella, mushrooms, fresh sweet Roma tomatoes with tomato sauce and  cheddar cheese! Delicious! The manager brought out our deep dish pizza, cut it up and even placed it on our individual plates! 

Overall I was WOWED with the decor, the customer service and the food! Definitely worth your time and money and ask to be seated with Donald!"}
{"text":"Got seated rather quick....then we waited and waited. Finally a waitress who was helping a nearby table said has anyone helped you yet? She said ours wasnt her table but she'd help us out.  She was great.  Salad was so so.  I had to ask for extra dressing since it tasted like plain lettuce.  Pizza was pretty good but I'd advise against getting it with the hot giardana on it since it makes it too greasy but besides that unfortunate addition that we added it was good deep dish pie.  Go early or expect a long wait."}
{"text":"On January 9th my family and I went to Lou Malnati's for our first time.  Upfront we were told pizza would take a good 30 minutes.  We weren't really paying attention to the time, but the manager (Joyce I believe) came out and apologized for the wait and that they had to remake couple of our pizzas.  She send out what they had and within minutes the rest came along.  She went above and beyond taking care of us.  The pizza was awesome as well.  We will definitely be back in the future.  A+ for service and A+ for the pizza.  Thanks again Joyce"}
{"text":"Been here before second visit. Right off the Bat the service alone deserves 5 stars. GREAT EXPERIENCE! The pizza is delicious it's a literal pizza pie. We had the deep dish half cheese and half pepperoni. We had a 25 min wait so we were suggested that we pre order the pizza, it takes about 30 mins to cook. We did just that and pre ordered. By the time we were seated our pizza was just about done. We had a very little wait compared to the first visit. We also ordered a salad and a pasta dish. Both good, but nothing too special. We will be revisiting again soon. We Love Pizza!"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, so I was ecstatic when I learned that a Lou's would be opening up near by. I was able to go to the soft opening, and was pleased to see that the menu is the same as it is back home. We got the Malnati salad, combination platter, and a deep dish pizza. Everything was delicious! We have been back a dozen of times, and order delivery often."}
{"text":"This place is seriously AMAZING. Literally had to put my fork down in the middle of finishing my leftovers to write a review. Even re-heated the day after this pizza is hands down the best I've had in AZ--and I'm typically more of a NY thin slice kind of guy. I ordered the Lou, and while I'm not usually a fan of vegetarian pizza this pie still blew my mind. The ingredients are fresh and quality, but the best part is the flaky, buttery crust. I haven't visited Chicago since I was a kid but this is truly a spot I would travel to get to, good thing we have one here in Phoenix. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Simply some of the best pizza you can find anywhere. We tried both the deep dish and thin crust.  Each has its own qualities.  The thin crust is crispy and lets you really enjoy the fresh tomatoes and toppings. The original deep dish with butter cans garlic crust is where it's at though.  Get the original and enjoy.  You can also order mail order frozen."}
{"text":"I'm sorry 1 star* is the best I can do. I may not be from Chicago,  but I do know a good pizza and this was not one of them. The crust of the pizza was crunchy and crispy but the toppings or mushy and no flavor, very bland. I will not be purchasing another pizza from this place."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Chicago pizza I have ever had in my life. The servers took time to explained the store history, the process of making a Chicago pizza in Phoenix with the water being hard. and took time to make recommendations for next time. The pizza takes long to come out which is expected. When the pizza does come out it is soooo amazing. The sausage isn't salty, the cheese is melted perfectly, the crust isn't tough or burnt. All in all I'll be a return customer. 


I love the option to order to other states! It comes frozen in a box & although it is pricey, it is worth it! It comes out very similar to the in restaurant pizza!"}
{"text":"What a surprise from a Chicago boy to find a Malnati's in Phoenix while on business. Zero difference between the ChiTown locations & this one. I remember the very 1st one of Mark's fathers!"}
{"text":"This is delicious! Was partial to Giordano's, but this crust is rockin'! Bruschetta so fresh and delivery driver Caleb was so awesome! Rock on Caleb! Rock on Lou!"}
{"text":"It's worth the wait! I'm from Chicago and I took some friends last night and the pizza was amazing just like back home.  The staff was super friendly, attentive to our needs and our kids. The waitress and Mark Malnati himself were both over the top with engaging with us and the kids. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was ok but the hostess station really needs to get it together. Waited 45 min and get the text our table was ready only to have to stand at the hostess desk another 15 min since the table WASN'T ready. Food was good but it didn't taste as good reheated at home. I'll be willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Pizza is on point, front cashier was rude.  Asked her for water while I was waiting on my order and she directed me outside to the water spot which was empty.  I let her know and there was no hurry to fill it.  I got my order and asked for water again and the cashier told me they don't have to-go cups and that I could purchase a bottle of water from the cooler.  Needless to say I spoke with management and received bottled waters on the house.  Bad experience corrected by management.  Not sure when we will return."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried it I suggest you do. I had a lunch special sized pizza and it was perfect size. I love thin crust pizza and think of thick crust as a totally different meal. This is my favorite think crust pizza place. Real Chicago deep dish and much better than any others I have tried."}
{"text":"The customer service here is off the charts! Food is incredible! I'm glad that this Chicago establishment decided to build a location in Phoenix. I'm not a transplant from Chicago, and I've never had a pie shipped from the main location, but I love this place!"}
{"text":"Haven't had too many deep dish pizzas that I've enjoyed but have heard a lot about this place so thought I would check it out since I was in the area.  Grabbed a seat at the bar and my order was taken after about 5 minutes.  The server said they make everything fresh. Opted for the classic Chicago personal size deep dish.  After about 35 minutes, the pizza came out.  Initial impressions of the pizza - very tasty.  The crust was nice and flaky, nice and gooey cheese, and the sauce had a nice texture and flavor.  Great value as I only needed only had one slice and I was full.  Will be taking the other three slices home for leftovers throughout the week."}
{"text":"Had this in Chicago last week and it tasted even better than the one in Chicago. If you eat here you will never eat another pizza anywhere else.
Happy employees and a great atmosphere with Tv for the big game."}
{"text":"This place is great authentic pizza chucago style .... Deep dish or thin crust only options but the only real way to eat pizza. Nice ambiance inside and out. Nice selection of desserts. Love the chocolate chip pizza with ice cream... Dlish."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Full disclosure, former Chicagoan.  The location on Rush in River North was my go-to.  This location holds up and after all these years, still rises above the competition.

Waited in line for 2 hours today.  Yes, I'm crazy.  For food.  Lou Mal's in particular.  I'd been waiting for this place to open ever since I heard the news last year.  

Wife and I ordered some beers and a large Classic.  Saw a ton of people leave with to-go orders and leftovers of the thin crust and I wonder what they were thinking.  If you come to Lou Malnati's, you come for Chicago deep dish.  Everything else pales in comparison.

Got to meet Marc Malnati after dinner, which was awesome.  He is, genuinely, one of the nicest guys you will ever meet.  Told him the truth - that Geno's was my first but that ultimately I fell in love with Lou Mal's.  

So in the hierarchy of Chicago deep dish, Lou Malnati's - Geno's East - Pizzeria Uno/Due (the original two).  Stick with the deep dish.  You can do either sausage or pep, but the sausage just works so darn well with the rest of the pizza.  Give in to the carbs, and the calories, and the cholesterol."}
{"text":"Two hour wait in 114. Got here at 4 pm. Don't take reservations. Had infant.  Going to Oregonos instead."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! I had heard about this place from some neighbors, and then a bunch of people who I know who are from Chicago were all surprised that Loy Malnatis was in Phoenix! This was one heck of a pizza. The bread appetizer is amazing too. Carlos was a great server, and my friend and I really enjoyed our time here. Will definitely be back for that pizza!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is/was very hyped. 

On the first night we went there was an hour and a half long wait. We declined.  

The second time we decided to order delivery through PostMates. We ordered stuffed spinach bread and the Malnati Chicago Classic.  The bread came in a brick form that required our own cutting (not a negative), but it was very bland.

What was also bland was the pizza. The only \"Chicago\" pizza I've had has been Spinatos. This  however was: maybe 1 cm of crust, .33 cm of cheese, .33 cm sausage, and .2 of sauce on top. Altogether it was lacking in flavor and I felt overtaken by boring crust, cheese, sausage and marinara sauce. Spinatos at least has a flavorful unique marinara sauce. I felt I could easily have made this Lou Malnati's pizza with generic pre-canned ingredients from the grocery store.

To sum it up: this was a very hyped place that proved to be very basic which lead to disappointment. 

The above explains the 2/5 star rating."}
{"text":"I was disappointed and astonished at how flavorless the Classic Malnati is.  The pizza I had could not possibly be the one that built this restaurant chain.  I find it hard to believe but the waiter explained it to me this way.  Malnati's does not use garlic, onion, oregano, basil or other flavorings in their in their tomato topping. It is just smashed tomatoes.  I pointed out that my pizza was awash in moisture.  The sausage or meat on top was swimming in liquid and tasted like it had been boiled or steamed.  The waiter went on to explain that unlike the pizza sauce I was accustomed to, Malnati's does not cook their tomatoes and boil off excess moisture.  I did like the crust.  The pizza, itself, was so flavorless there is no way this this food has an Italian heritage.  It tasted like English food BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.  This was not my first experience with Chicago pizza.  My dad is from Chicago and we always ate pizza on our visits."}
{"text":"Awful, too noisy. Food not that great at all, will never go here. Servers rude. Food not cooked all the way, and people not wearing gloves."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I had never eaten at Lou Malnati's  there. I prefer thin crust pizza and the thought of eating that thick of pizza did not sound exciting to me. I went with another Chicago white who loves lose pizza and I was extremely surprised how much I enjoyed it. 
You have to be patient when going here. We put in our name and had to wait over a half hour in the bar The good news is they had a nice selection of beers and I had a local IPA from Wren House. The other thing you do while waiting is order your pizza. I thought this was brilliant marketing. That way when you sit down your pizza comes very quickly you will eat and then leave.  What a great way to maximize your table turns.
We started with the Greek salad and it was a very large salad that we all shared and even took some home in a doggy bag
The moment of truth came when they served the pizza and it looked very watery at first to me. But I found the trick was to let your piece of pizza shit on your plate for just a little bit and then begin eating it. It was not soupy at all. The crust has a very interesting buttery flavor in the toppings were generous.
I will remain a thin crust pizza person, but now at least I will be more open-minded about trying deep dish pizza"}
{"text":"Placed an online order around noon for pickup at 5:30, because I KNEW this place was gonna be jam packed... expecially since it was the grand opening! I bypassed the crazy line that wrapped around the building and went straight to the pick up counter. I was worried that it was going to be chaotic (and it was!) but within 3 minutes my piping hot pizzas were in my hands and I was out the door. I was born and raised in Chicago, so I knew how Malnati's is supposed to taste. This did NOT disappoint!! Oh my gosh I didn't know how much I missed that sauce until the salty, savory, tomato-y flavor exploded in my mouth. Soooooo gooooood!! Make sure to ask for more pizza sauce, as it's perfect for dipping that amazing buttercrust in. I'll eventually dine in, but probably not for a couple of months. This place is gonna be poppin' for awhile."}
{"text":"Really excited I really wanted to try this place in like it but the pizza was just way overpriced and Soggy in the middle I ordered takeout the girl in the phone I was pretty nice and the customer service was okay but the quality of the pizza was just off for the price I don't think I'll return"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing pizza. The ambience is also very appealing. Convenient location to get to also."}
{"text":"Man, good pizza compared to the tourist pizza joint I had in Chicago. This place lives up to its hype and I'd be coming back for sure next time I visit from LA"}
{"text":"I've had what's considered \"Chicago\" style pizza from a number of restaurants; and I usually enjoy it. This one, not so much.

I didn't care for the vibe and location, felt really commercial and impersonal.

I ordered a deep dish pizza with spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes. There were little to no mushrooms what so ever. The pizza was soggy as if the veggies were water-logged before placing them on the pizza. I also didn't care for the corn meal crust, which was practically inedible wet.

I paid around $20 for a small pizza. The small is cut into four slices. It seemed a little larger than a personal pan pizza from the chain restaurant. The taste was also comparable.

Certainly didn't find my favorite local pizza place here."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with my experience!  I drove 45 minutes from No. Scottsdale and ended up with one missing pizza, a missing salad. a cold pizza, and no napkins.   The service was horrible!  We ordered an appetizer salad that never came.  We ordered 3 pizzas and only got 2.  We had empty water glasses and only 3 place settings and napkins for 5 people!  The worst was that when the deep dish pizza finally came ... it was cold!  Definitely not worth the hype...."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. We came to eat here around 5:30 and there was no wait! The restaurant is huge and the fact that is was extremely family friendly was a huge plus. They have a great happy hour Mom-Thurs. we started out with 2 appetizers. The stuffed spinach bread and mozzarella sticks, they were phenomenal. Shortly after we finished those, our pizza came and I can honestly say it was the best Chicago style pizza I have ever had. Our drinks stayed full the entire meal, the service was great and the food was flat out fantastic. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Lou Malnati's in Chicago I was so excited to see it make its way to Phoenix. I went here on a Friday night. I expected there to be a long wait and was fine with that. However, once seated the service was not at all what I expected. They are lucky they are Lou Malnati's and that I was a huge fan from the Midwest and ecstatic to eat their pizza or the service would have been unacceptable. After being seated and having already pre-ordered the pizza the server was left with very little to do except to bring our drinks and food when it was ready. We ordered 3 waters and more than 5 minutes had passed and we still did not get our drinks. At this point it was going on 9pm and the crowed was slowing, there were even open tables! I asked the bartender for water and FINALLY almost 10 minutes later a different server brought over our water. Our server was not very present throughout the entire experience. Everything was extremely slow and we had to wait and ask multiple times for everything.  This is not what I expected from Lou Malnati's. The pizza was also subpar. It was not as thick as the pizza in Chicago and there was not nearly enough sauce on the pizza. I really hope things change as this is a place I would eat at every time I visited Chicago. Maybe Lou Malnati's in Phoenix cannot match up to the Chicago reputation. I will definitely wait a while before returning with hopes that the food and especially the service improves."}
{"text":"This place is as amazing as it was when I went to it I  Chicago. Hands down probably some of the best pizza I have ever had. The wings were good as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, and it is always busy no matter what day or time of day. Unless you just gotta have Chicago pizza it's good but not worth the price or wait time it takes 40 min and they tell you up front it takes that long once you order. Like I said it is good not great but if your looking for a busy bar to sit at and chat with people then it's 5 star."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Pizza was pretty good and pipping hot.
The pre-order system helps cut down on food wait time when you get to your table

Cons:
Long wait time.  

Overall, It was a good experience.  The flavors of the pizza were great. I'm typically not a deep dish fan, but I really liked this.  The wait was a little long, over an hour, but there was a bar and places nearby you could go for a drink.  They use a text based buzzer system when your table is ready and you can check in from your phone.  I highly recommend using the pre-order system so that you aren't waiting another half hour at your table for your food once you get seated."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with family. We got right in. Menu looked good, good atmosphere. Took 10 minutes for a server to come to us. She took our drink orders. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks! We ordered the combo appetizer which comes with mozzarella sticks, fried cheese balls, fried zuchini, and fried mushrooms. Appetizers were hot, but were just ok. I can tell they got them delivered frozen. Not much flavor to them. We then got a traditional x large pizza, no mushrooms. We were told it was about a 20 minute wait for it...45 minutes later here comes our thin crust pizza. 45 minutes !!!! Pizza was also just ok. Nothing to write home about, nothing to brag about. I waited so long to try this place since it was apparently very popular when it opened up. First time there, last time I'll be back. Wasn't much flavor to the pizza at all. I like papa johns better."}
{"text":"Ate here a month ago and the deep dish was fantastic!! I've had it in Chicago and I must say I had a better experience at this location in central Phoenix. The vibe and environment was great. Pizza tasted great and I wouldn't change anything about it. If you want great deep dish pizza this is a great place to check out with your friends and enjoy your time. I've visited Giordanos on 83 and bell and this stuff is WAY WAY better!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Today we took our friends to this fabulous restaurant!
It was their Christmas present.
As we have been to Malnati's here and in Chicago many times, this was a great pick to introduce them to.
Our host was Malika, who provided us outstanding service!  Malika doesn't miss a beat!
We all enjoyed thin butterflake pizza, and their new appetizer, pizza chips and dips. Awesome!!
Then for desert, we enjoyed Baked Chocolate Chip Deserts. It was fabulous!
We would like to compliment the two on-duty Managers as well. They made our experience today
great without exception. Our friends are duly impressed with Malnati's, and will be telling their friends accordingly.
Thank you Malnati's.

{"text":"The pizza was great, the pasta was fresh and the salad delicious. The service was excellent"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and amazing service. Robbie was our server and was awesome! Great addition to central Phoenix! Definitely worth the wait! 100% authentic deep dish Chicago pizza!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star I would. I am from Chicago and was excited to have my birthday dinner here. The pizza was Awful! I got the thin crust extra large size. It has literally no seasoning on it.  Just cheese, sauce and tomato sauce. The crust was gummy too! Do not waste your time coming here. You will be completely disappointed if you are familiar with Chicago style pizza! It was a slow night, about half full at 5 pm. So they cannot blame the food for a busy night. The waitress never came to check on us with the pizza. I would have at least asked for oregano or Italian seasoning to doctor it up a little. I will not come back.... ever. Try someone else if you want a decent pizza!"}
{"text":"I reeeeeeally wanted to click 5 stars but I just couldn't do it.  Pizza was really good but I think in all fairness,
my expectations were just too high.

We ordered the classic deep dish with sausage, extra cheese and we added pepperoni.  The ingredients were all really good-but used in a way that threw me off.  I loved the chunky tomatoes, but where was the sauce?  (If I took a bite without a tomato, it was just too dry.)  The sausage tasted great, but having it as a complete layer on the pizza was too much for me.  It should be described as a sausage lover's special because there is so much of it.  Lots of cheese,
which is good.  And the sacred Chicago crust?  Well it was close-but still not close enough that I could eat it by itself like I do in Chicago.  
Bottom line-If you want one of the best deep dish pizzas outside of Chicago-Lou's doesn't disappoint but for me-it was still missing something.   I will definitely be back for another try.  On another, non-food related note:  Having an employee walk directly past your table with rubber gloves on carrying a toilet plunger doesn't help."}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating staff. The interior is modern and very slick. Also, very clean. The prices are decent as is the food. The lunch specials come with a side salad with fresh veggies. The lasagna was made to order and tasted great. The sauce blended well with the pasta. The deep dish with the signature sausage patty and pepperoni was delicious. It filled us up."}
{"text":"First time here. Heard about this place back in Chicago.  The deep dish pizza was amazing. We will totally be back for sure. And it was great service too."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Service was extremely slow. Food just okay. Tasted like any other chain restaurant.  I guess we'll stick to NY style pizza. Sorry Lou's!!"}
{"text":"\"When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie, that's amore.\"

After a night out on the town with my crew, we were feeling a little hungry and we couldn't decide where to go, so we all decided to see what the hype on Lou Malnati's was all about, and trust me, the hype is real! 

After walking in, we were greeted and the staff was extra friendly. They even had samples for you to try out while you were in line! The wait wasn't so bad this time, about 30 minutes. I also absolutely adored the decor, very modern and city, yet still cozy. It was also very packed but it felt extremely roomy and not at all snug. They also allow you to order your pizza ahead of time so that your pizza is closer to being done since it takes longer for your pizza to be made than it does to be seated. FRESH. As for pizza, my sister in law and I ordered \"The Lou\" and I thought it was the grand masterpiece of all vegetarian pizzas. There was 3 cheeses, mushrooms, spinach and fresh tomatoes as toppings. I wouldn't have minded if it was my last meal. It's that stinking good! The cheese was amazing too! That ooey gooey type. As for appetizers, we got the Malnati salad, with ingredients very similar to any antipasto salad, but this salad was definitely on point, crisp, and refreshing. We also got the buffalou wings and they were were gone in a jiffy, I liked them very much because it was the right amount of tart and spice. Lastly we also shared the combination platter with our group and that had batter fried mushrooms, cheddar, mozzarella and zucchini, also none left behind. 

I even asked my friends, \"you know when you go to that great restaurant and you always find that one dish that's eh?\" Or \"it's alright, it's not all great.\" As of now I can say Lou Malnati's does not have \"that\" dish! I enjoyed all of our dishes. 

The pricing was quite alright too! For the price we paid, we definitely got our money's worth since the portions are so large. 

My experience was so great here! It must be something in the water, no literally! Their food is prepared with  Chicago PH altered water, tomatoes and other ingredients shipped here from Chicago for that Chicago styled greatness. Cool huh?! 

I've never been to Chicago, but I can definitely say that I've tried Chicago style pizza, and it won't be the last time!"}
{"text":"Everything about my experience was top notch! Pizza was good, drinks were good, and it reminded me of Chicago! Go early to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"Oreganos is way better! My husband is from Chicago so I was excited to try this place. We did take out with this place being hot and new for phoenix. Our hot deep dish pie came out right on time no waiting. The pizza had no flavor. We got our standard. Sausage, cheese, mushrooms. The mushrooms were fresh and not canned but this pizza had mild to no flavor. Today was Sunday so I did not eat all day thinking I was waiting for something excellent! O boy I wanted to cry! Pizza blew. I will possibly (not go out of my way or suggest) go back for salad and/or drinks but not the pizza... BUMMER

***7/17/16 
Tried again since company reached out to us.-The crust was better. We Learned they have an upgraded crust (garlic or secret sauce) that they charge 1.00 more for- which is kinda humorous. Hilarious.This time our  pizza was pepperoni and it was better than previous. My heart and cravings still belong to oregano's and Spinotos."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on all the hubbub surrounding its opening in the valley. The pizza is good, but it's a bit of a gut bomb. If you haven't had it I wouldn't tell you not to go.  Be prepared for a long wait."}
{"text":"Haven't been there yet. Walked over on Sat. to peek @ Soft opening. Can't wait to try it. Welcome to the neighborhood from a LONG time patron."}
{"text":"Wow. We tried to get in here one night for dinner and the line was INSANE, so we bailed and planned to come back some time when it was less busy.

Saturday at 11am and we happened to be downtown. There was no line and we basically walked right in. The place started to fill up as we finished our pizza and headed out a little after noon, so plan accordingly. Some of the reasons for the lines: the interior is pretty small and a deep dish pizza takes 30+ minutes to cook.

The TL;DR - We are very glad we decided to come back. The kids agreed that it was the best deep dish pizza they have ever had (one said it was the best PIZZA he has ever had). Get the pizza \"well done\" and maybe skip breakfast to prepare. 

For the rest of the story...

We eat a lot of pizza and I have been to Chicago a few times. I have had pizza there, but I never made it to one of Lou's many locations. Unlucky me. Sure, People from Chicago like to brag about their pizza, and much of what I had there was thick and dense (pizza by WEIGHT). I could barely finish one slice, much less two. It has been a while, but the pizza here is different from that. Lou's is is a thick crust pizza without the \"touristification.\" Meaning, the pizza is \"Chicago style\" thick without being obscenely so: its reason for being is not to hold the table down.

Our waiter, Daniel, suggested getting the pies \"well done,\" which means cooking them a bit longer and drying up a bit more of the moisture. I don't know how the regular pizza comes out, but our well-done pies with butter crusts were perfect. I was pleasantly surprised that the crust itself was CRISPY: even the bottom of the pizza came out crispy and not soft or soggy like so many other thick crust offerings. 

The mozzarella has excellent flavor, and so does the pizza dough. The tomatoes and pork sausage provide nice supporting flavor without being overwhelming. Apparently, there are no bold spices in the sausage to distract you from the other subtle flavor combination. I think that is interesting and very nicely done. Daniel suggested we add pepperoni to the sausage to provide some contrast. DO IT.

We had two small pizzas for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. I ate 2 1/2 slices and we took home about a half a pizza. We got the deep dish classic, add pepperoni, and the deep dish cheese with garlic butter crust (WARNING: you must like garlic for this one. They don't mess around or skimp on it!)

I can't speak to the salads, desserts or bar drinks, however, everyone was happy with the food and both Daniel's recommendations and service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm from the city of Chicago so I know my deep dish pizza, and was SO excited to try Lou's out here in Phoenix. 

They did not disappoint! I had the Lou (vegetarian) deep dish and split a large with my two friends and husband. There was enough for two slices per person which really filled us up. If you want leftovers, order more!

The wait was fairly short considering how popular the place is, and we were able to order our pizza ahead of time so we didn't have to wait as long for it after being seated. The inside looked well decorated, but we wanted a seat asap so we opted for the outdoor seating. 

My only qualm was that the server said our food would be ready in 10 minutes and it ended up taking twice as long, after we were seated. But I had great conversation with my group so I didn't mind it."}
{"text":"Picked up 2 pizzas from the Arcadia location for my Daughter in laws birthday.  They were hot and fresh. Ordered a thin crust with our selection of toppings (3) and a glutten free one.  They smelled great and was anxious for our first bite, but that is where we were disappointed.  The thin crust was tasteless and like cardboard.  I didn't taste the glutten free one but DIL said it was just OK compared to other places.  The sauce and rest of the pizza was nothing outstanding and based on the $45 we paid for two pizzas we will not be returning.  There are way better pizzas out there for half the price."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Ordered the Chicago style with mushrooms. Deep dish comes with sausage, sauce, cheese. Etc. very very good!  Clean!  Now BEWARE!  BE PREPARED FOR A LONG ORGANIZED WAIT!  Yes. Organized. You line up order your pizza. You get a text with a link that tells you where you are in line. We were in the mid 20's (think there were about 25 people ahead of us). Took almost an hour. Then you get a text when your table is ready. The theory we were told...upon sitting we would get the pizza. It took another 25 minutes. It was a somewhat ridiculous  wait. But the food was good. Fresh!  Crust was flavorful. Light. Not too thin. Not too thick or overwhelming. Just the right amount of tomato sauce. Not overloaded with just tomato sauce.  The parking lot was pretty full. Would definitely return but would try to find a later or earlier time ( we went around dinner time )."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza you'll find in the Phoenix area. I've loved Lou's since my Chicago days and am happy they've opened a location here. The food was great, obviously and the service was too..."}
{"text":"I am so happy Lou Magnates opened here in Phoenix. I had been waiting to dine here since they announced the new location and I am pleased to say it was worth the wait. It was crazy busy shortly after they opened and I had to wait once they opened for lunch. Glad to report that I had a great dining experience and the Pizza was exactly as I had previously in Chicago. I plan to come here often as my diet allows and I'm happy to hear Lou's is opening more locations here in Arizona. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend who lived in Chicago and said, \"this place has the best deep dish in AZ!\" I took his word and decided to give this place a shot. 

You know when you arrived at this location when you see a bright Lou Malnati's sign. When you walk in your greeted immediately by a cute hostess girl who promptly looks for seating. As your waiting you'll notice that the restaurant has a really nice layout, a full bar, patio seating with fire place and the décor on the walls were neat to look at. 

Here are my list of con's. One, my friend and I requested to be seated by the fire place which seats were available at that time. Our hostess agreed and said, \"she would get the table ready for us\". Sweet! Well due to a lack of communication, another staff member didn't check in and sat a couple before us in the seats we requested first. Our hostess apologized and sat us somewhere else. No biggie but would have been nice. 

Secondly, I don't suggest ordering the Twisted lemonade from their cocktail menu. It just tasted like diluted Gatorade with no liquor. It wasn't worth $8.95. In my opinion this cocktail needed fresh squeezed lemons, a shot of vodka, perhaps a shot of Grand Marnier and mint leafs as a garnish. Boom! I just made that shit up. 

Now last but not least the Pro's. After, not being seated in the requested table. The manager did apologize, offered to take off our appetizer off the bill, and a free desert. Cool! However, the appetizer still remained on the bill and I didn't want to say anything because I'm not at the position to remove it of my check. Whatever! I still paid for the Calamari which was delicious. Also, the deep dish pizza was THE BOMB!!  

Overall, the experience was decent, our waiter was informative and suggested some things on the menu. I really would like to give this place a 4 but a 3 was deserved. I definitely will return hopefully for a better experience because their pizza is truly AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great genuine chicago pizza! I stopped into this take out only location to pick up a pizza I ordered online. They gave away my pizza to the wrong person by accident....however, the manager came out and apologized and gave me a free large pizza credit for next time. Thats great customer service!"}
{"text":"I ate at one of the Chicago locations a few years ago and loved it. When I saw they were opening one in Phoenix, I was excited but apprehensive that it wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Went in this Sunday night and got into a very long line of people waiting to get in. Some people were bailing because of the line, but we decided to stick it out. It probably took 15-20 minutes to get to the front where you put your name in. During that wait, they had people walking through the line handing out little pieces of their thin pizza and it was excellent. It's also a great way to keep people waiting by teasing them with the food they're going to get inside. 

After putting my name in they said it would be an hour to an hour-ten minute wait. They take your phone number and send you a text when you're up and they also have a link in the text message so you can see your place in queue, which is pretty cool. Even better, when you put your name in, you can tell them what pizza you want so you don't have to wait a second time once you're seated. It ended up being about 90 minutes before we were seated and because of the pre-order, our deep dish pizza was at the table less than 10 minutes after we were seated, which is awesome. 

As for the food, we had a deep dish pepperoni pizza, the combination platter appetizer and I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich to go (breakfast!). Everything was really good and a large deep dish is easily enough for 4 people, maybe more. We had a party of three and took home almost half the pizza. The service was also excellent and our server was very friendly and helpful as were the various hosts and staff that greeted and seated everyone. Definitely going to be going back as often as possible and you should too."}
{"text":"Back again! Probably the best pizza restaurant in the valley. I'm so glad it made it to Arizona"}
{"text":"So glad AZ now has a Lou's! Well worth the wait if you're choosing to dine during a busy time!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge deep dish eater, but this place definitely made me think twice about my preference for NY style 'za by the time we were through.

First of all, the location within Uptown Plaza combined with the interior retro feel of the dining area made me instantly happy. I love all things mid-century, so the wood paneling and abundant cone wall sconces made for some great eye candy as we waited for our tasty pizza.

We placed our order (medium classic deep dish) as soon as we checked in and the total time it took for it to arrive at our table was about an hour. We ended up snagging a seat at the bar in lieu of a table and passed the time with conversation, people watching, and a few beers.

The pizza was absolutely amazing - it's just a shame I was only able to eat one piece! Thick cuts of Italian sausage throughout and that buttery crust?! YUM!!! Sauce on top was fantastic and really everything all in all was just a great experience.

5 stars!"}
{"text":"My first visit to the Phoenix location. I was very impressed needless to say! We had a large group of family members. The staff and managers were very accommodating. They took our orders early and by the time we were seated we waited about 5-10 minutes and we were enjoying some great Chicago pizza! My wife and I had individual pizzas. The veggies on hers were fresh. I had the Chicago classic and I wasn't disappointed. Just as I remembered it! Thanks Lou Malnati family for coming to the valley of the sun. I will be returning."}
{"text":"They aren't ready for a Friday or Saturday night.


We are regular diners at Lou Malnatis and this location in Phoenix is just not up to par.

The Bad:

90 min wait

Pizza was totally off and took 30 mins to get even after preordering 90 mins early.

It was uncooked dough in the middle, too hard on the bottom and watery around the sides. Very odd. We also keep it simple because that's all you usually need at Lous. Sausage butter crust. Boom. Done. This was unedible.


The good:

The manager took care of the pizza and gave us a small frozen one to take home. She admitted it wasn't right and couldn't put her finger on why.

The Malnati salad is awesome. Always.

The atmosphere is nice here but the restaurant is much too small for the type of crowd they draw in."}
{"text":"I've been to Lou's in Chicago and was amazed at the quality and quantity of the pizza and salads, but now they are in Phoenix!!!  Of course we had to go, and the line was long, just like it is in Chicago.  However, they have this great gadget that sync's up to your phone and it tells you what number in line you are, and the anticipated wait time.  You can browse around and not stand in a crowded restaurant waiting to be seated.

We did find a place at the bar during our wait and we were served quickly and were not neglected so the 45 minute wait went fast.  We pre-ordered our pizza after check-in so our two deep dish pizzas were ready within minutes after we were seated.  Genius.

Number 1:  The service is great, despite the wait.  The staff are very friendly and efficient.
Number 2:  I love the deep dish pizza and the flavors; my husband could take it or leave it.  Everyone has their own tastes on pizza, and for me, it hits the spot.

I live across town so we won't visit too often, but it's definitely on the list when we want something special."}
{"text":"Update : January 2018
Food was great! Our relatives from Chicago were in town and even said AZ Lou's was better than home!!!



Previous post:  We are from Chicago and LOVE Lou's pizza! This location was great when it first opened. We went there tonight to celebrate our daughter's birthday and pizza was so disappointing.. soggy crust, room temperature cheese that was hardly melted :(.We raved about this location in AZ to our family back in Chicago. However, the quality has definitely changed over the past year and it isn't as good as it use to be."}

Chicago-style pizza"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza but honestly, Oreganos deep dish might be better. I went with the original and it's good but compared to my memories of Oreganos it's less tasty."}
{"text":"I am pretty sure this is the best pizza in Az, from Chicago I think they bring the water here from Chicago and it's traditionally served with the sauce on top of the pie. The line is usually an hour + ++ long but when you arrive at the table the ZA (short for pizza, how the cool kids do it...) is brought to the table usually within 5 minutes of sitting there.
The butter crust is out of this world and quite frankly addicting. Highly recommend this place to anyone who likes an out of this world ZA!"}
{"text":"Sooooo goood! Hands down, my favorite place to eat pizza in the area."}
{"text":"PROS
Very cute atmosphere
Good bar / bartenders
Informative service with good recommendations for first timers
Get the half and half so you can try different pizzas
Good HH on drinks


CONS
Get there early (like we did) to avoid the long wait time
The food is really heavy so don't OVER order
Combo platter app (fried items) was pretty average, could have used more seasoning"}
{"text":"The pizzas are very good and sandwiches are too. We live close by and order a delicious treat from them once a week. The phone people are always courteous and polite and our food is served hot and ready. I saw some other reviews and I have to remind people that this isn't Little Caesar's or Papa John's. Their downtown restaurant is fantastic and to have this little place here close to us is wonderful."}
{"text":"Super bummed with this visit.  First 2 times,  Pizza perfect.   Went this time expecting we'd wait a little for the deliciousness but it took way longer than usual.   The server said 'oh yeah when you add sausage that happens.'  Wish he would've mentioned that since we were there before a meeting and planned time well.   Then, sausage wasn't cooked through, he said they temp'd it, but it wasn't done.  I will definitely go back but I was disappointed this time."}
{"text":"Get here early if you want good service!! Good food!!! I recommend everyone to try this spot out. Can not go wrong ."}
{"text":"Hoping to have some good Chicago style pizza...had a \"Lou\" and a \"Malnati\". Overall pizza was good, only thing we didn't like was the crust by itself was very bland\". Liked thier family style salad, helpful staff (appreciate they tell you upfront that pizzas will take about 30 min)."}
{"text":"Just ok deep dish pizza. Not a lot of flavor.  Needed salt. The wings and meatballs were good!  The temperatures were off as well.  Room temp not hot."}
{"text":"The decor is simple & corporate feeling. The layout has absolutely no flow as the bar creates unnecessary traffic in the center of the restaurant. 

Aside from the pizza, the menu offerings dont create much variety or excitement as its mostly just more cheese, bread, or deep fried items. 
To avoid getting more bread & cheese, we opted for the deep fried combo platter, its an above average platter of cheese sticks, fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, & fried cheese cubes. 

The pizza itself has zero competition in the area, its obviously the best in the area as oregano's deep dish is just awful. Personally i prefer my deep dish a bit thicker, but this is ok as it has good flavor from the sauce, sausage, & butter crust. 

I was very impressed by the service staff, for being so new they worked very well together and delivered our food in a very timely manner. Our server was very friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza expert but I know a good pizza when I eat one. First come prepared. You're gonna have to wait 30-45 mins if you go during rush hours. You have the option to pre order your pizza so you don't have to Wait 30-45 to make the famous deep dish. I Was finally sat down from my text notification and was greeted by Jordan who was awesome and very friendly. Finally the pizza came out and let me tell you. I ate one piece of the \"Lou\" deep dish pizza and I was done. It was so good and fulfilling I couldn't eat anymore. Leftover overs for sure. We had two appetizers before we had the pizza which might of been the reason for the one piece but the wings and mozzarella sticks were great as well.  But I will say...... This has to be the best pizza I've had in AZ, the crust, sauce and cheese were so good. I'm still talking about it 48 hours later. I'll definitely be back! \"It's not a pizza it's a cassarole\" - Jon Stewart"}
{"text":"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Lou malnati's in Phoenix Arizona? Central Phoenix? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I couldn't believe it. I order lou's pizza from Chicago a handful of times. It was amazing!!! But to have it down the street from my house is even more amazing!. Ahhhhhh.

Alright, let's see. Where do I begin, Grand opening was today. The line was ridiculous. An hour wait, waiting outside while the line loops around to the restaurant. Then another 40 minute wait inside... lame I know. We were at the restaurant for 3 1/2 hours. Including the wait and as we dine in. 

The decor was so simple and so family-friendly.  Love the \"say cheese\" sign.The mirror made the room look so much bigger.

We had to order our pizza before sitting down because it would take awhile. My family ordered Penne alla Vodka, honey bbq wings, and butter crust pepperoni pizza. Chicago style of course. They loved it. No complaint there. Had to bring pizza to go of course. It's so full and filling

I ordered the personal vegetarian pizza call \" The lou\" with no parmigiano. I had to educate the girls at the desk why I can't have parmigiano, well, here's why. because it has RENNET in it. They looked at me like I was crazy..... So yeah... they didn't know what it was until I said it was stomach from baby calves. They both were grossed out. Haha. I hope they know next time I come in.

I'LL BE BACK!!!!!  It's not a good thing for a Vietnamese female to be fat and loving pizza... but i do. *smile*"}
{"text":"Yummm!! My new fave pizza joint. Well for those days when I'm feeling a little extra, can splurge on a $25 pizza, and have an extra hour to spare on waiting just to get sat (and no they don't do reservations). 
Maybe it was because it was a Saturday night and we didn't plan accordingly, but we had no clue it would be this crazy busy. Lots of bday celebrations happening here. It was our whole crews first go at this place. My guy and I show up at 6:30pm in hopes of grabbing a table for 10 by 7pm. Nope. We're simply added to a wait list and told the wait is an hour and 45min. 
It's a good thing there is a brewery across the way to sit, chit chat and kill sometime at, with no wait! Yay! The ice cream shop next door was cool too, but the wait for that was an hour long. 
Ok so finally we get in. It's a bit noisy but the atmosphere is fun and our waiter is attentive and gives us the spiel on the history of the place, shared some interesting facts on how the hard AZ water was no bueno for their pizza dough and how they teamed up with Starbucks to make it work. 
We order our appetizers and drinks. A pitcher of Kilt Lifter and an orange blossom beer. Btw happy hour is Mon-Thurs 4-6. House salad with lemon garlic dressing and the pizza chip trio were tasty. Finally the pizza arrives. 1 deep dish pepperoni, 1 deep dish Lou, and a thin crust pepperoni. I had the DD pep. The crust was crisp to perfection. No soggy middle plus oogy-gooey cheese stretching from plate to mouth. Warning: Chew well before swallowing or else you might just choke on the cheese. The menu says that the large pizza only serves 4 but I had 1 slice and was full, mind you I'm a lightweight and can't woof it down like my guy who ate 4 DD slices and most of the pizza chips himself. 
Long story short, the food was great enough to make up for the long wait, good company helps too. I'll definitely be back, maybe for my birthday in April . The best gift a a pizza lover, like me, can ask for! I LOooVe  me some pizza"}
{"text":"Good stuff here. Just like the pies you get in Chicago but since it's not Chicago I am deducting 1 star. I stopped here with a friend and we waited probably an hour for a table. The inside was jammed, literally. There was no where to stand and even walking was a task. As expected the wait for the pizza is 45 minutes which is normal so not much you can do there. Service was good, pie tasted just like the city, and the outdoor ambiance was nice on a somewhat warm Phoenix June evening. Butter crust deep dish Malnati it where it's at; you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I knew nothing about this place, but it was recommended I try it. I called ahead and even at 430, there was an hr and a half wait to be seated. I could never wait that long with a 2 year old and successfully make it through dinner. I ordered carry out and even then the wait was 50 min. When I arrived at the restaurant, the line was wrapped around the building. I was given the option to cut or not cut the pizza. I followed their recommendation and ordered a Chicago classic uncut. Good thing I did. The juices remained in the pizza and the crust was crunchy not soggy. All in all, it was a great meal. Will definitely be going back maybe for an early lunch to beat the rush to try some other stuff. I'll change my review to 5 stars once enjoy the actual dining experience."}
{"text":"Two guys from Brooklyn N.Y. eating Chicago deep dish with our wives in Arizona.Living in N.Y. the majority of my life I was always a big pizza eater.N.Y. Pizza is great.But this Chicago deep dish pizza is the real deal. I Will be back for more for sure."}
{"text":"Always great service & excellent food! Every time I come here I have to get the deep dish, butter crust pizza with sliced tomatoes & basil. It is absolutely amazing!! My kids don't care for the deep dish so they get the thin crust ands love it!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything here that I didn't like. Service is always good and the food is so delicious! I try to keep this as a special occasions kind of place, but it is so hard because I love it so much!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday and ordered two large classics. Took about 90 minutes to come out. Not only that the waitress never checked back on us after we got our waters. Better pizza and service out there."}
{"text":"I'll be generous and update to 2 stars. I do appreciate when a business reaches out and tries to make right. To their credit, Malnati's management did do this.

I'm never interested in freebies or comps. Its not why I write reviews. I'm just trying to provide honest feedback so Yelper's and businesses alike can make good decisions going forward.

Perhaps my experience pointed out a fixable flaw in a Malnati's system. For certain, it has now made me completely aware that I must be certain that any contact information I supply to a host/hostess is verified before I walk away.

I meant what I said: I wish this place all the best!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

A few weeks ago, on my way down to the airport to pick up my mom, I ordered a pizza from here for takeout.  I did it online and it was a very easy process.  I placed an order for a small sausage and onion thin crust pizza, well done and cut.  I drove down, walked inside and picked up my order.  The first thing I noticed was that their \"small\", is really small.  Its barely 10 inches?  The box it came in was the size of the boxes places usually give you for your leftovers.  I took it out to my car to eat.  When I opened the box, it looked good, but the first thing I noticed was that the pizza was not cut.  LAME!  On their website, you have the option to have it cut or uncut (they recommend uncut for takeout pizzas) and I chose cut, but this one was a whole pizza.  Thankfully, since it was so small, I managed my way through sauce on my hands to tear it apart and eat it fairly neatly.  Still.....if you order it cut, cut the damn thing!  Anyways.....flavors were pretty good.  The cheese was nice and browned, there was plenty of sausage on it and the crust was nice and firm/crisp.  Not the best thin crust Chicago style pizza I have had, but it was alright.  

Fast forward to 08/13..............

Decided to come back with my buddies to dine in on Saturday afternoon.  We arrived and were seated immediately which was nice!  We decided to go with a medium Malnati Chicago Classic, and a medium The Lou thin crust.  Took about 40 minutes for the pizzas to cook and come out.  Here is how they were...................

The Malnati Chicago Classic (deep dish)-  We tried this slice first.  I was impressed!  Lots of crushed tomatoes on top, a good creamy dose of cheese, and a bunch of sausage.  All of this was layered on top of their famous butter crust.  This was one rich pizza!  I ate 2 slices of it and was stuffed beyond belief.  As you will see, I wish we hadn't have ordered the thin crust pizza, and just got a larger size of this one.  It is their classic pizza, and rightfully so.  It was very tasty and I would 100% get this one again.

The Lou-  This thin crust pizza came with spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes on top.  When it came out, I knew right away that I wouldn't like it as much as the deep dish one.  For whatever reason, it just didn't look that great.  A bite into it, and it was confirmed.  There was an overpowering mushroom taste.  And not in a good way.  The mushrooms were way too \"earthy\" and overpowered the other flavors of the pizza.  Not sure if they don't cook the mushrooms first and throw them on there raw, or what.  Something about them was \"off\" though.  The thin crust on the pizza was good, but that's about it.  I wasn't a fan of the spinach they used, either.  It almost seemed like it was sheets of spinach, almost like seaweed sheets?  Flat layers of spinach?  Not impressed.  I barely made it through my one slice of this and out of the 6 slices in the pizza, 4 of them were taken home by my buddy.  Would never ever order this one again.  The flavors were whack!

Overall, stick with the deep dish Malnati Chicago Classic and you will be happy.  Service was great, wait time was not too long, and the prices are good for the sheer amount of food you get.  Will I be back?  Probably.  I'm not rushing down Central Ave anytime soon craving this place, but I'm sure I will be back in due time."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive. The staff is incredibly friendly. And that is the nicest thing I can say about this place. That said, how can this place be rated 4 1/2 stars? The pizza dough is somewhat bland. While I can't say for certain, my guess is that it comes to them frozen and they \"cook\" it on the premises.
Plus, $15 for a 12 inch pizza is ridiculous. Two adults and two kids for two pizzas, wings and salad is a $50. That's take out mind you. There are several other amazing pizza places with tableservice a family of four can eat at for under $50. And eat amazing food."}
{"text":"A great pizza! Very authentic, sweet sauce(on too), perfect sausage and quality cheese. The crust was the best surprise."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6 PM on a Saturday.  I walk inside and there are a bunch of people just hanging around.  I asked a person by the frozen pizza to go section where the hostess would be who takes our name down for seating.  They pointed to a women who had a tablet.  There were about 3 families surrounding her.  There was only the one hostess.  After waiting until I could put my name down, that took 15 minutes (6:15 PM).  They take your name and phone number and text you when you will be seated.  I told them I wanted patio seating.  I was told that the wait was 40 minutes.  Ok, that is acceptable.  I was told about how you can pre-order your pizza so after waiting for your seat, your pizza will almost be done, and be brought out to you shortly.  This was great!  Time ticks away and their nifty web link (http://wait.nextmeapp.com/)  lets you know what place you are in line.  Pretty cool.  Well, I made sure I pre-ordered my pizza (large deep dish, butter crust - a must, sausage crumbles,  1/2 pepperoni,  1/2 green pepper, onion, mushroom).  
         At 7 PM, I get a text telling us to check in with the host under red tomato sign right away.  So they were a little off on estimated wait time, but I could live with it.  We go in, the wait staff whom seats you, tells us that it will be just a minute, that they are clearing off our table.  After waiting a while about  10 minutes, the seating hostess tells us a story of this family that paid for their food, got up to leave, but the family sat back down.  That is where they were going to seat us.  But they said there was another family about to leave so it shouldn't take long.  
As I am waiting, I look around inside.  I have to say I am not a fan of their décor.  I found it very busy.  The tiles on the floor made my son feel dizzy.  I told him not to look at the floor.  The restrooms are decorated in a way you would expect to find in a Las Vegas casino.  I went to the washroom to wash my hands.  The bathrooms are even more disorienting then then dining area.  I have to close my eyes while I am in there to prevent me from getting nauseous.  
We wait an additional 10 more minutes there under the red tomato sign.  Ok, we're getting pretty hungry by now.  Finally, we get seated at a patio table.   I have to say the chairs are pretty comfortable.  My children like how the chairs can rock.  The table seems pretty small for a family of four, but at least I have a table.  It is definitely less noisy on the patio.  I can hear our conversation.  That's a plus. 
       We sit and wait.  Nobody came over and offered us water or told us our server would be there in a few minutes.  It takes about 10 minutes for  a server to come over to us.  She tells us that our server is really busy (I interpreted it as \"under staffed\").    This person asks us for our drink order.  I then tell her that I have a \"birthday\" coupon and hand it to her.  She takes off.  Five minutes later a different server comes to our table to take our drink order and asks us if we preordered our pizza.   Well this is confusing, who is our wait staff.  We promptly tell him \"yes\" we pre-ordered our pizza.  He goes off and says he will talk to the other person who was waiting our table.  We get our drinks and still wait.   Our waiter was  not  attentive, probably because there wasn't enough wait staff for the patio section.  He also was absent minded when we repeatedly asked him for refills, etcetera and  he would constantly forget.
WhooHoo! Our pizza finally came, 45 minutes after we were seated at our table.  So much for pre-ordering.  Our pizza was brought out by yet another person.  I was a little frustrated.  I asked why it took so long for us to get our pizza, when we pre-ordered it.  She explains that Lou Malnati's makes sure that the pizzas are put in so that they arrive at your table approximately 10 to 15 minutes after you are seated.  Well, I complained because it wasn't ready until 45 minutes after we sat down.   That's 30 minutes too long to wait.
      I must say the pizza was amazing as I remember it.  My family of four was able to finish two slices a piece.  So tasty!  Afterwards, they brought out a chocolate chip pizza with ice cream and whipped cream for desert (birthday treat coupon).  It was delicious!  I think the lady who brought out the pizza felt bad because she  gave me a free tiramisu for dessert, to go.   Lou Malnati's did remember to remove the cost of the two desserts.   We didn't leave the restaurant until after 8:45 PM.  
        Almost 3 hours experience for pizza is a little too long for my taste. I will probably go back for the pizza, but I probably will not dine in their establishment again.  Next time I am getting it to go."}
{"text":"Just moved from chicago to phoenix two weeks ago. So needless to say i miss chicago food. My boyfriend took me there as a suprise yesterday after work. 


We had the thin crust cheese pizza and it was pretty close to the pizza back home. 

The only thing i didnt like was the decorm it wasnf like the orginal locations back home. I went to depaul and the one near depaul in cbicago is completely different.


Good nevertheless"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, and having ate deep dish pizzas at Lou's back home I can honestly say this is spot on! Expect your pizza to take 45min-1 hour to make. Don't complain about how long it makes, use that time to oh I don't know... socialize with who you came with and get off your phone? If you're going to be spending that much money might as well enjoy the ambience you're in, instead of complaining. 

Outdoor seating, they have misters on for when it's really hot, they have a fireplace outside as well, for when it's too cold. Also, indoor seating. I have gone here 5 times since they opened, even though they're 45min from me I will still drive out there for my pizza. Try calling your order in before you get to the restaurant, so it starts cooking! Then your wait time won't be so long. Doesn't anyone use their brains anymore? Ha! Enjoy folks!"}
{"text":"We had the express deep dish on the lunch menu and it was hard as a rock, had no flavor and I couldn't even eat it it was so terrible. The sausage had a funny taste as well. Very disappointed as we thought we had a new lunch spot. I have heard so many good things but honestly I would not go back. The waitress noticed neither of us ate more than 2 bites if we had We would have a broken tooth. She asked if we wanted a box we said no and she didn't ask another thing it was obvious the food was bad."}
{"text":"Food:  I came in with a friend and we split a small deep dish half cheese and half pepperoni and we got the buttered crust.  In my opinion, a true test of any pizza is a cheese slice.  The quality of ingredients were excellent but the flavor on the cheese only part half was very bland.  The crust had very little flavor and sauce definitely tasted like canned tomatoes lacking any seasoning.  Cheese and pepperoni were good quality but nothing out of the ordinary.  The pepperoni was good quality but nothing special.  We ate the whole pie and left really stuffed.  I did see a salad go by and it looked really good.

Service was good...came in at 2:15pm on Monday...it was not crowded..(note lunch special ends at 2pm) Our server was very helpful with honest suggestions and was going to let us get the lunch special which comes out in 15 minutes instead of the 30 minutes for the regular deep dish even though we were past the cutoff.  

In closing I would come back if someone wanted to go there (I work and live in the area) but I would not seek it out at this point.  It should also be noted that we did not get the sausage pizza which is what they are known for and if I do find myself there again I would like to try the thin crust or one of the salads.  I will update the post if this happens."}
{"text":"I've been to Lou's three times and am reviewing my most recent experience last night.  

The two other times I've visited with my husband, I would rate 4 stars.  Yes - you have to wait for the pizza quite awhile but you have to just expect that here. 

Last night was another story.  We decided to bring my dad here on Superbowl night for his birthday celebration.  The place was pretty empty and we sat on the patio.  There were 5 adults and 2 toddlers. 

The service was very spotty, at best.  I don't know if there wasn't enough staff (although there seemed to be plenty of servers walking around everywhere) or what but it was horrible.  Our girl took FOREVER to do everything.  

We ordered a few appetizers to start.  The calamari was excellent. Then, we had our appetizer plates stacked with used silverware to take away before our pizza came.  Well, our server came over and then asked if we could take the stack of forks back to use for our pizza.  WHAT??? They were used and there was no way we could figure out which one was whose!  We said we were sorry and asked if she could bring us more forks.  She seemed a little annoyed.
 
Then, we proceeded to wait for our pizza.  And wait. And wait.  I think we waited at least an hour.  It finally came.  We ordered (2) - one of the regular sausage special and a pepperoni.  And it was luke-warm.  I really like my food hot but this was not even close to hot.  But, we were all so hungry we just ate it.  I wondered if maybe it was left there for awhile after watching our server during the rest of our visit. 

After the pizza, we had some leftovers - which she offered to box up.  She took the pizza with her and didn't come back for 15 minutes!  At least.  Then, when she did come back into view, with our pizza in hand, she managed to stop at 3 other tables to do various tasks before coming back to ours - all holding our pizza. 

Then, we just wanted to pay the check and get out of here.  She finally dropped the check, and we quickly gave her our card to pay.  Another 15 minutes passed.  She finally returned - again stopping at 2-3 other tables on our way back to ours!

It was quite ridiculous, I have to say.  

I will really think twice before coming back here - or maybe we will just get our pizza to go next time!"}
{"text":"So my favorite pizza is New York style, but I have to say, this pizza was delicious!!  Went there with my hubby, son, and mom- and dad-in-law. Ordered The Malnati Chicago Classic and a classic pepperoni. Both with the butter crust (I mean, if you're going to do deep dish, you may as well go all the way). We added mushrooms to the Malnati, too. 

Crust was wonderful as promised, nicely offsetting the fresh and savory sauce and the perfect amount of cheese and meat. My mouth is watering as I remember it. Great craft beer or wine to go along with it. I tend to be a purest and would order just a pepperoni wherever I go, so I preferred the pepperoni, but I enjoyed both. Waitress was awesome and the balsamic dressing for the salad was great (pizza takes a while, so salad is advised, plus, you know, it's greens). 

Weirdly, my oldest son was visiting Chicago at the time and when my youngest told him he should look for this Chicago original, my oldest sent a picture of his pizza box and said he'd eaten there a few hours earlier. Thumbs up from all six of us!"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. Both couples on each side of us agreed. Waited over 1-1\2 hours. The pre order took more time than the people next to us who just sat down and ordered there pizza. Our pizza was severely under cooked and had to send it back, took the left overs home to my girlfriend's daughter who said \" I've had better card board pizzas\" so 7 people in one night agreed...highly over rated. Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER!  That is if you're from the Chicago area and looking for some true Chicago style pizza.  Great food, great service, and great outdoor patio.  Frozen pizzas from the case on the way out were just as good at home."}
{"text":"As a Midwesterner, I have been waiting since the announcement that Lou's was coming to the Valley.  I even taunted friends who have moved outside of the Chicagoland area that we have the first Lou's outside of IL and was extremely lucky to score a ticket to the soft opening.

First of all, Lou's deserves 10 stars for donating all proceeds of their soft opening to Phoenix Children's Hospital.  All participants of the soft opening paid for their food and Lou's then donated those funds to PCH.  Class Act.

Lou's in the desert is just as good as Lou's back home.  The boy tried the thin crust pizza (which almost seemed sacrilegious) but he said it was one of the best thin crusts he has ever had.  I got the Chicago Classic and it was just as good as I remembered.  

The decor here is fun, they really did a nice job in the PHX mod feeling they added to the ambiance.  My only disappointment were the TV's in the dining room, definitely NOT a PHX norm unless you are a sports bar.

We are really excited about new addition to PHX.  Keep it up, Lou's!"}
{"text":"Pizza is so personal.  It's almost like discussing religion or politics.  If you are from Chicago, I imagine will like it.  I don't get it. The crust / dough is just not that good.  I tried both their regular and butter varieties.  It's a nice clean restaurant with a friendly staff, but give me a New York style pie any day!"}
{"text":"Such a long wait, took us more than 1 hour just to be seated, service is poor, very noisy, pizza just ok, doesn't worth to wait this long, and very expensive, tried once, never be back"}
{"text":"5 stars! Best pizza from Chicago now pulling rank as the best pizza place in AZ! Long wait times, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Update:  we went again last night and again it was so so good!! The service was ON POINT this time. I think our severs name was Jasmine and she was excellent. 

We had the small cheese and a personal pepperoni with buttercrust and a small cookie for dessert because we are ALL the pizza.  This was the perfect amount for two hungry people. 

The wait was about 40 minutes but they have a very nice text/web based \"waiting\" system which was really appreciated, if you aren't going to take reservations a system like this makes waiting much much nicer because you can walk around a bit and get out of the crowd until you get close. Love this place!

Get the buttercrust and save room for the cookie!!!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe because I ordered a personal pizza, but it seemed dry and burnt. I was expecting greatness after all the big fuss from my coworkers who moved here from Chicago. It was just ok."}
{"text":"1-4-17 Back again!  So happy to get into Malnati's again!

First visit at this location: Excellent!  Somewhat overly attentive service staff, #firstworldproblems, but every bit as tasty as the Chicago locations.  Good stuff. Drove up from Tucson, am jealous Phoenix! Cassie was great, (our food server)."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a coworker. Had a small \"The Lou\" it was ehhhh. Had to move seats due to a large party coming in. Which was fine, we got a free dessert. The pizza was literally just ok. The size was pretty good, it had tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms. The sauce was sweet and my kids didn't care too much for it. Said they've had better. Not going to disagree. Service was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Alright I have to give this awesome place a great update. While the new joint in town is STRUGGLING like a mofo over on the west side (Gio's), Lou's is killing it and consistent! I live around the corner from Lou's and order take out about once a week. Every pizza is perfect - legit haven't had a bad pizza yet. 

Again, just have to give a big shout out to these guys. They opened the right way and doing it correct. No 2 hour wait, no water-ness at the bottom of the dish (YUCK!). Seriously go read Gio's reviews and make the route to Lou's instead"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. We're Chicago ex-pats, came to Phoenix for spring training. Read there was an outdoor patio, so we came with our dog. Then were told not dog-friendly...so we couldn't stay. So bummed. Why have an outside eating area then not allow dogs?"}
{"text":"I was very excited for Lou's to open in Phoenix. I have had their pizza once in Chicago, and it was quite the memorable experience. Due to the insanity of their opening week lines, I chose to order a pizza and spinach bread online and pick up. I ordered online early in the morning to pick up at around 7. When we arrived, the order was ready to go, and we happily passed the enormous line of people waiting for tables. The pizza was tasty... super heavy (as expected) but flavorful. We got a butter crust pie with pepperoni and garlic.... tasty business. The cheese/spinach bread was nothing terribly exciting. I would pass on that next time (especially because we couldn't even finish our small pizza and the extra order was unnecessary). If you are a deep dish fan, check out Lou Malnati's, it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this Lou Malnatis! The interior was really cute and well decorated. Our server was sweet and made sure to let us know how long it would take for the pizza ~40 min which is standard. She even gave us a 10 minute update! So sweet of her. 

I'm originally from Chicago and the only pizza place we order at is Lou Malnatis so I wasn't expecting much. My family and I always order the Lou and another specialty pizza dish. I got the personal size pizza of the Lou deep dish and I have to say it was the best I've had. It had a pretty decent garlic flavor which I love and never noticed in Chicago. I could tell the tomatoes and spinach were freshly prepared by the color and texture. I was only going to eat half and take the other to go but so delicious that I finished the whole thing!

Between the pizza and the service, I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness Chicago pizza has finally arrive to the valley!!!!!!!! The real deal!!!!! Since Lou's has only been open for one week, we decided to place our order for carry out. Mmmm good. Did I say good? Meant outrageous. Meant to say it was as good if not better than eating in Highland Park, IL. Met Pete the district mgr from Oak Park. What a gentleman. So calm considering the restaurant was hopping with customers and staff. Eating Lou's makes me realize how much I have missed 'home cooking'. Hoping that they will open a second location in North Scottsdale. Oh, btw....we were advised to not have the pie cut so that it will travel easier in the car. When we got home, followed the heating instructions on the box. So easy. So tasty. So happy that we also purchased another fully baked pizza and an additional 4 frozen pizza's as well."}
{"text":"Well, it's finally been done. Someone messed up pizza. I don't understand how pizza can be so disgusting and after a 35 min wait, such a let down. I guess this is how Chicago likes their pizza. It's not for me! However, if you like hard pizza crust & a soggy pizza, then this place is for you! Gross and a waste of money!

To give credit to where it's due, the service was beyond amazing and the wings were pretty good (however, a little pricey!)"}
{"text":"I am from California and visited Lou Malnati's when I was in chicago. I was so excited when I found out that a location open in Pheonix. I was in town visiting family and took them to this location, it had a fun vibe different from the location I went to in Chicago. Our waitress was the sweetest I wish I remembered her name, she had really short hair and glasses. We sat outside and had a great time. I will definitely be back any chance I am in town! Oh and always go for the Malnati Chicago Classic, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Their pizza and service is amazing in Chicago, however in Phoenix they need to work on meeting their obligations for takeout. I have done take out twice both times have showed up on time or before my order said it was going to be ready only to be held waiting an additional five or 10 minutes from my items to be ready. If you cannot meet your takeout times then you should not put them online as your food to be ready after this time. If you do take out please understand you will be waiting longer than what they had anticipated when you complete your online order. On top of having to wait the staff was not courteous or understanding or helpful and speeding the process along in any way!!! Very disappointed their take out customer service is so poor especially seeing as their food is good."}
{"text":"Not what I remember, although it's been at least 10 years since I visited a Lou Malnati's in Chicagoland. 

The cheese was fresh with great texture and the red sauce is perfectly balanced and bright. The problem was with the crust which is pretty much what makes a Chicago style pizza. The crust had a good snap but was beyond flavorless. Maybe the forgot the salt?  Hope so because this would be an easy correction."}
{"text":"A patron who moved to the Valley before them, but so happy they're in the West Valley area.

Folks you have to go to understand what Pizza should really taste like!"}
{"text":"Thank you for coming to Phoenix. Your success probably is why Gino's is coming too. Now two of the best pizzas I've ever had will be in Phx...but yours is better!

I see some people here comparing you to Spinatos and such, I apologize for those of my fellow Phoenicians, as scientific data has proven excessive summertime exposure has had an affect on some of our populations sense of taste. As well as driving ability, sense of decency and overall intellect but that's another review. They are the same ones who think Outback Steakhouse is the go to for a bone in ribeye. #Mastro's. Side note, did you know there are ZERO Outback Steakhouse's in Australia? What a croc! 

To my fellow Phoenicians, you don't go to Lou's for thin crust or Fettucini Alfredo, you go for the deep dish. They do have some swesome sides and salads, but Chicago is known for a few things better than anywhere else, Chicago does deep dish. And there is none better in AZ than the one you get at Lou's."}
{"text":"Had the deep dish pizza lunch special and it was prepared well, it came out quickly and the price was right.  I guess I'm not a fan of Chicago deep dish (this is my first one) because it really didn't appeal to me.  The menu wasn't very extensive at lunch either, but covered most of the bases."}
{"text":"Thank you, Lou's, I am absolutely addicted. If you're a reader considering going there, stop, and go. Now. That's all."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service was worse. Our deep dish pizza was soggy. We had to ask for napkins and silverware and were given a short amount. We felt like an inconvenience the whole time. There were also fruit flies all over our drinks. Would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Having grown up and lived in Chicago until my mid-thirties, I know a thing or three about pizza. This Lou Malnati's is the real deal - exactly like the place back home. The pizza is hot and is made from quality ingredients. Honestly, it is like a little slice of Chicago was dropped down at the corner of Central and Camelback."}
{"text":"The wings and the \"Lou classic\" pizza were great!  Our server \"Sanait\" was attentive, and made great recommendations.  Always a good time when we visit."}
{"text":"Last 3 times ordering, my pizza looked like it flipped over ten times. All the cheese was pushed over to one side. Was given a voucher for a free pizza and to call when ordering instead of using on line ordering. I then called a month later to order another pizza. I put in my order and was put on hold for 10 minutes. Five different people picked up and asked me if I was preordering for dine in, which I then told them I already ordered and was waiting to pay. The manager then picked up and asked me the same question. She then stated that I had to reorder. By that point I told her that I was not interested anymore. She apologized for \"ruining my evening\", which was her sarcastic reply to me when I said I was not interested in ordering from them. I am not sure what has happened to this place, but there is obvious incompetence issues with the staff. This never happened in Chicago. I am extremely disappointed in the service or lack there of. You'd think it was easier to order online, but then you get delivery drivers who don't hold down the pizza properly. You then get told to call for delivery, but the people answering the phones can't seem to do their job either. I guess Marc Malnati is making enough money not to care about the customers anymore....Federal Pizza is across the street and their service is excellent! Lou's should take notice that there are plenty of other pizza places in that area or their service will start being compared to Pizza Hut! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"First off we are fans of Lou's Pizza in Chicago. 
BIG fans !! But in Arizona?? We happened to be in Arizona for a long Birthday weekend and I thought I would surprise the Hubbs by having our favorite Chicago pizza in Arizona. And to be honest I thought..... well it would probably be ok , but not the same. The salad would taste a little different the pizza wouldn't be quite right you know just a little off.

B O Y was I W r o n g !!! It tasted like I was east of the Mississippi in Chicago eaten Pizza thinking I was at Lou's! Holy wow was it good! 

Now if they would come to Denver, that would be great"}
{"text":"Everything was decent and acceptable I guess, the service was good. I just wasn't super impressed by anything and they had some sort of weird lighting problems outside on the patio that was kinda uncomfortable when the lights kept going off and changing brightness. Good beer selection from bud to the place across the way. It's a family place with kids around everywhere acting well, like kids. If you have kids and like a lot of cheese then this place is for you. I could see how people would really enjoy it, just not for me maybe. I just don't know if what Phoenix really needs is another high end mediocre pizza chain, like I have borderline particular tastes and would take dominos over this place, I never eat dominos. When you have the money to spend opening a restaurant like this, I don't see why you wouldn't spend it on creating something unique and amazing. They did have a really cool sign though. So maybe try it and it might be for you. I will admit after a couple slices of the pizza and a beer or two you are prepared to take a really good nap. This could be a good early Saturday lunch followed by a nap?"}
{"text":"By far the best deep dish pizza. I love the Chicago location and also the one that just opened in Phoenix. Also very friendly customer service. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Chicago.... but plane tickets are ridiculous.... low and behold I end up at a Chicago pizza eatery to drown my broken dreams in cheesy grease and saucy crust..... I walk up to a mall I had been to several times to find a hidden gem in the corner.... the hidden pepperoni on the pizza.... the saucy sauce of all sauces.... my family is waiting for me on the patio and come running up to me in their Italian Chicago embrace so happy to be in a place that feels like a slice of home. We order the deepest of deep dish pizzas- and were greeted with the largest pizza pie of cheesy saucy goodness my eyes have beheld. And boom with one bite upon my fragile taste buds into the endless sauce abyss--- there I was in Chicago- back in the bustling town eating a favorite slice of my Chicago pizza.... so thank you Lou Malnatis for giving me a traditional slice of deep dish pizza- and for being cheaper than a plane ticket.... yummy food, fun environment and atmosphere, and for letting me gorge myself on your cheesy cheesy goodness"}
{"text":"I am not so sure LM's is worth all the hype. We were a party of 2 early on a Saturday evening (arrived at 5PM) and we waited an hour. If we had been a party of 4, we would have had 14 more tables in front of us to contend with (according to their seating / wait list app). By the time we were seated, the bar area was jam packed full of people. I'm talking like a popular Scottsdale night club at midnight packed, no room to move by approximately 6PM. 

Even though it was the middle of the summer in Phoenix, they keep their garage door windows open (presumably because of how many people are jammed in there waiting? opens up more bar seats). So not only was it packed, but it was SO hot. My pregnant self was grateful for the ONE bar seat we managed to secure during our wait.

They are known for their signature sausage pizza. I do not recommend  deterring from the menu and adding extra toppings (specifically extra veggies). Reason #1 being because it is pricey to do so and reason #2 being because they don't precook the veggies before putting them on the pizza (so our pizza came out sort of a watery mess because of the veggies).

I will say that we experienced great service all around. We highly enjoyed their signature salad and the other pizza that we ordered (that we didn't modify). Our leftovers tasted more delicious than at the restaurant, I speculate this was because we popped the pizza back in the oven and it burned up some of the excess moisture from the veggies.

Be prepared for long, hot and uncomfortable wait times and a minimalist menu."}
{"text":"Okay for all the talk, people waiting in 2 hour lines and such I had to see what the hype was about. 

We got in right away which was a pleasant surprise. Yelp pro tip: go at 730 on a Tuesday. 

Inside ambiance is cool, very comfortable, a tad loud, but not enough to be annoying. I will tell you one thing DO NOT sit in the half booth tables on the left side of the room because the tables slide around on the floor during the entire meal if you barely touch them. Nothing a couple felt pads wouldn't fix....

Food was okay. We should have gotten a small pizza instead of a personal size. The personal size is wayyyyy too much crust. I would go back to try that again. 

The pasta leaves a lot to be desired. We got the penne and that was enough to make look elsewhere. Very salty, very very. Dinner salad was iceberg lettuce, cucumbers dices and diced tomatoes. Egh. 

For the price try Oreganos which has better salads, more pasta options and a deep dish pizza that is just as good."}
{"text":"Best pizza joint in Phoenix, in my opinion. But I am a little biased because deep dish is my favorite. Even though every time I come for Pizza it's a 40 minute wait it's completely worth it! The Pizza's are a good size and will fill you up after one or two slices. the sauce and the flavorings are not overpowering the pizza( like oreganos) it's simple delicious pizza. But I will say their pasta selection is very minimal and they focus a lot on a pizza so I wouldn't get anything else. Other than their appetizers which are pretty good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Phoenix area!!!!  This is what Chicago pizza is all about. Ordered delivery and was not disappointed. Delivered within the hour & piping hot. Generous amounts of ingredients, no skimping what so ever. Crust crunchy & light not doughy. Oh & did I mention that they sautee their spinach before putting on the pizza (hate raw spinach just thrown on a pizza) I live close by & I guarantee that I will be a regular weekly customer.  This is as good as it gets!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I actually went here a few weeks ago, but I wanted to share the experience. We got in around dinner time, but the wait for a seat was surprisingly non-existent!  We ordered a light appetizer and, of course, requested a deep dish with the butter crust!  (Quick anecdote, we were transplants from Chicago that now live in Los Angeles who came to visit Phoenix to catch a Cubs Spring Training game in Mesa.  As native Chicagoans, we knew our deep dish!)

Here's where it gets a little rocky, many minutes pass by and our pizza hasn't shown up yet. We knew we've been waiting for awhile, but figured that deep dish takes a bit of time to cook properly. It was a busy night and the servers were dashing around. Alas, we made it this far, we can wait a few more minutes. After a while our server comes out to apologize because one of the ovens was not functioning properly and our pizza was delayed (unsure if that was true or if they just simply forgot our pizza, but whatever). She said it would be out within the half hour, but in the meantime they offered a complimentary appetizer for the wait, to which we obliged.  She brought out the appetizer we requested, and a little under 20 minutes later we received our properly cooked deep dish (yep, we checked!).

Perhaps we were clueless and gave them the benefit of the doubt, but it was pleasing that they acknowledged the situation and sought to make our extend wait a little more comfortable. Kudos to our server and the management!"}
{"text":"First time I had Chicago style deep dish...I think I'll stick with thin NY style.

I got a small pepperoni to go.  It basically tasted like a hunk of cheese strings with bread and a touch of sauce.
I don't think it was cooked quite enough.  It had very little sauce with only 2 pepperonis on each slice.

What makes thin NY style better is the even distribution (typically) of ingredients.   Chicago deep dish, at least at this place is all cheese with barely any tomato sauce.  

Very disappointed and will never waste my money here again."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago. I grew up on this pizza. Marc and the team have done a fantastic job at replicating an icon!  Amazing!!!!  I really like Oregano's but this is so much better!  Oh, and I flew in from San Diego with a suitcase for frozens!   Yummmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza, great mozzarella sticks.  More authentic than the chain dine in pizza places.  I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I eat pizza because you are what you eat --- and I want to be the best damn thing ever!

The squad and I rolled up to Lou Malnati's, sans Kazi H. because she hates having fun [and because she smells like butt], after having some edumacational fun at the Arizona Science Center.  We were quoted an hour and fifteen minute wait which actually ended up being 20-25 minutes at 7:45PM on Sunday.  We did as we were told and pre-ordered our pizzas but when we got to the table, we ordered a bunch of appetizers so we didn't see our delicious pies until much later.

For starters, we had the BuffaLou Wings, $8.45; the regular sized Malnati Salad, $8.75; and a Combination Platter, $8.95 which included mozzarella sticks, cheddar cubes, breaded mushrooms, and fried zucchini.  Everything tasted great!  The sauce on the wings were perfect and had a baby amount of spice so ranch wasn't needed.  The Malnati salad was also super delicious and it surprisingly fed five adults.  It was refreshing and light and I like the sweet vinaigrette they used.  As for the Combination Platter, it was a good size and I was hamming on those cheddar cubes.  I love cheese.  I also took like two Lactaids so YOLO.

As for those pies, oh man, we didn't see those beauties for a good while so the wait time made the excitement level go down a notch.  We were all digesting our amazing appetizers and were getting more full by the minute.  I ended up eating a slice of a small The Malnati Chicago Classic and a few bites off a slice of The \"Lou.\"  I really liked The Malnati Chicago Classic.  It had good flavor and the Lou's lean sausage wasn't greasy at all.  The \"Lou\" was a bit too salty and almost-too-indulgently cheesy.  Cheese drag action left and right, yo.  The Buttercrust held all the deep dish deliciousness and stayed crispy the whole way through while maintaining a flaky texture.

Being in central Phoenix, you know Lou Malnati's is gorgeous.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting and the smell that hits you once you exit your car is bliss.  They have indoor and outdoor seating for those who prefer to dine al fresco and they have a quaint little bar area.

All in all, I'd definitely come back to Lou's for a slice of deep dish!  Not too frequently though.  This rich and decadent pizza will go straight to my ass.  #RealTalk"}
{"text":"Made a four hour road trip just to come here and it was well worth it.  Nobody does Chicago deep dish better than Lou Malnati's.  Arrived around 2:30pm and got a table right away and the pie was at the table within a half hour.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm so confused and pretty bummed out. I read the reviews from others and I hear about flaky crust and rich flavor. I hate negative reviews but I just can't believe the pizza we got was the pizza so many people have loved. We're IL people so my sister and her boyfriend have been to Lou's in Chicago. They raved about it so we were excited when they added Phoenix as their first attempt at branching out. I was going to do one star but I did two because they had great Sprite and the Malnati Salad was really good. My girlfriend and I split a small one and there was some still left over. 

Here's where it all went wrong and was so extremely disappointing. We ordered the small, really small Malnati Chicago Classic. We figured our first time there we had to try the pizza they call their specialty. My sister and her boyfriend got a deep dish pepperoni.  I took a bite so excited to taste this pizza finally! I was shocked that the one time I tried to make a homemade Chicago deep dish Pizza at home and messed it up by over kneading the dough mine was extremely better. We didn't get buttery flaky crust. We got what tasted like frozen white bread dough unseasoned and pressed into a pan. I'm not trying to be mean. I loved the staff and I believe something must have gone wrong because the cheese was almost nonexistent and the sauce was just kind of drizzled on. Another reviewer posted a picture of the exact same Pizza and it looked NOTHING like ours. My sister and her boyfriend were also shocked at how different it was from the Chicago locations. The sausage was lackluster. We expected some kick but it was just a bland sausage texture. I don't understand what happened. I'm so sad. It was the most bland pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever tasted. Their deep dishes is insanely good! I'm a pizzaholic too and had pizza for every Friday night dinner growing up for 16 years, and this is the best pizza I have tasted."}
{"text":"First had Lou's in the last year on a visit to Chicago.  It haunts me.  Why can't I get pizza like this where I live?  Life isn't fair.

I was SO excited to see an ad for Lou's when I visited the area recently.  I had super low expectations.  I didn't figure this would be anything like the dream pie I'd had in Chicago.  I stand corrected.

Not only was the pizza as good as I'd remembered from Chicago, but you don't have to cram in to a small space, wait for an hour, and go through the motions just to eat it.  Even better than the real thing!  It felt like cheating.    I loved it."}
{"text":"I really do not see what all the hype about this place is. I didnt hate it but it really was nothing special. We had the calamari and cheese sticks which were good but the red sauce is the only stand out, absolutely delicious aspect of  these things. We all had the lunch special deep dish, single serving pizza. While they were good, and I liked the crust, it was pretty forgettable. Service was good but not super friendly. I mean, the guy didn't crack a smile once. Dont get me wrong, we had everything we needed so it was no big deal."}
{"text":"Another great concept from chi town! Great pizza & patio! Live in arcadia but worth the drive & can't wait for them to open @ 56th & Indian School! Much better pizza than existing local joints (lgoNo! & fox)..."}
{"text":"Best Chicago-style pizza in the valley, bar none. I used to be a huge Gino's East fan when I lived in Chicago, but this place has them beat. We come here every week!"}
{"text":"Picked up two frozen pizzas for $37 any pizza at any grocery store Frozen would be way better than these 1 Pizza kids maybe two people worst Pizza I have ever bought save your money and go to the grocery store freezer section"}
{"text":"Went to have a beer at the bar on the patio and no one sitting at the bar at all. Female bartender not attentive at all, finally makes her way over after the coaxing of the Manager who noticed I was there. Ordered a draft beer and almost finished it when the black credit card holder with the check is placed in front of me. Bartender never asked if I wanted another drink just assumed I was done after one. Well guess what,  I am done with this place forever. Would be afraid to try the pizza here probably would never have it served after I order it. If it's too hard to serve a second beer then I guess your business will be under soon. Serious staff training needed here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza. Nice and crunchy thin crust, and the deep dish chewy and flavorful. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Well, as much as I'd love to rave about this place I just can't do that. My wife is from Chicago and I have visited there many times but I have never gone to Lou's, she has many times though. So since this place has opened here in Phoenix she has been begging to have dinner here. We finally made the journey and neither of us were very impressed. 

The wait was 50 min at 7pm, which was what we were expecting since this place is so popular. We put our names in and hung out. We found some bar chairs open and figured we would hang out at the bar while our names got called. While my wife was putting in our pizza order **NOTE** you can order ahead of time to cut down on time. As she was placing the order a nice fella at the bar gave us his table since they had already started eating at the bar. My wife had just got done ordering the pizza ahead with the girls up front, but they kindly switched it to the correct new table and were totally helpful. 

We got our table and within 3 min of placing our order with the girls up front, We asked our waiter (frederick) if we can upgrade that to a large. I figured if the pizza is as good as my wife says I'd like some left overs. It would have been nice for him to check, or even pretend to check instead of just saying \"no, it's in the oven\". I said bro, we literally just placed the order... He said \"nope its too late\". That surprised me that he was just shutting me down without even checking. 

We ordered our drinks a water for me and a beer for my wife and a Bruschetta and dude was gone...... He brought our drinks after like 10 min, then he was gone, someone else dropped off our toasted bruschetta Which was wrong  (bruschetta was missing the balsalmic vinaigrette drizzle, but there was no waiter around to complain to, but the toasted bread, veggy, and cheese was bomb). Someone other then Frederick brought out the pizza like 15-20 min later and we still hadn't seen frederick... Since my glass was empty I asked the pizza bro if he could fill it up, which he did. 

*more to come on service- let's Quentin Tarantino this and switch to the pizza*
The pizza was disappointing, under the pizza it was soaked, it was a pool of fluid that can raise the titanic in the amount of fluids under there (not really). The crust was very wattery and soggy. It was like eating wet bread. I just didn't expect that. My wife was disgusted by it also, but after waiting so long for dinner and again no Frederick to complain to we just ate it. On a scale from 1-10 I'd give it a 5, for the reason that I have never had a horrible authentic Chicago pizza. This was my first. 
**back to the service**

Frederick was still no where to be found, and I felt horrible but asked another waiter (michael) if he could fill my water and get me some ranch. He politely and quickly did it. He was so friendly and willing to get us taken care of. Since our waiter again was nowhere to be found, michael came back and boxed up our pizza. As he was boxing it up and asking \"is there anything else I can get for you\", our original waiter frederick made it awkward and stood behind michael. After michael walked away we just asked Frederick for our check. This was the fastest and most I've seen him move since we got there. I wish I could have made my tip go to michael, Michael was the only silver lining to Lou's. I feel at this point this place is popular for the name and the reputation from Chicago. I'd go back and give it another shot but if I get Frederick, I'm leaving."}
{"text":"A friend of mine really loves Lou Malnati's, so I decided to give it a try on a night where I did not mind waiting over 30 minutes for a pizza. I decided to keep things simple and get a medium cheese pizza.

I have had variations of deep dish pizza at places like Nello's and the late, great Zachary's in Tucson. I thought I knew what to expect. Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed when the pizza arrived. It was a very doughy pizza with a load of somewhat cooked tomatoes dumped on top of a surprisingly small amount of cheese with what seemed little to no sauce under the cheese. I found the tomatoes that they put on top of it to be inedible, and I cannot say I cared for what was underneath either. 

I felt obligated to try at least two of the slices, but it was far from an enjoyable experience. There were four slices left, and I contemplated not taking them home. If there had been a homeless person around, I would have happily given the leftovers to them. I ultimately decided to the throw the leftovers away.

I think if I was going to get pizza this thick again, I would go somewhere that served Sicilian style pizza. At least that has plenty of cheese and sauce. Needless to say, I will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Holy crap!!! I went here on a  Saturday afternoon and the line was way out the door.  I heard people being told there was a one hour wait time--in 114 degree heat!!  Good thing I called my order in--an hour ago and it is still not ready.  $26 for a 12  incher!  It was good enough but there was no seasoning thus no real taste.  I DO NOT like the crust which is like a breakfast biscuit--dry with no taste.  Made worse by the fact it was still raw--they pulled it out of the oven too soon--it was a busy day.  I was going to complain to the manager but oh well--there were enough goodies in this deep dish to make me happy.  I might go back but if you do better make sure it is on an off day.  Going  here on  the  weekend is a nightmare!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE Lou Malnati's. ..i enjoyed Giordano but Lou Malnati's wins with their butter crust, their Best out of this world calamari. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is we were seated on patio and it started sprinkling but they couldnt relocate everyone. They should consider fully covering the patio."}
{"text":"It's rare that s business provides an excellent product and also provides excellent service. As a business owner myself, I am always watching how the employees work with their customers. The staff at Lou's is top notch. I ordered a pizza there ( of course the pizza is to die for) and went to pick it up. When I got there the manager came out and told me it would be a few more minutes because the first pizza was overdone . It was not up to her standards. The pizza really looked ok to me but they ended up giving me 2 pizzas and a free salad as well. I was very impressed that they had our best interest at heart by providing us with a top notch product. We will defiantly return. The pizza did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Charlotte from the restaurant sent the attached message to me on Yelp. This was a poor attempt to apologize using a canned message with a offer of a free meal to customers. I'm not trying to get a free meal and did not except the offer. I just wanted to know if I could do something else so I would not have to wait as long if I wanted to order a pizza from here again. She did not respond to my question."}
{"text":"This was a great place for a very late night dinner. The cheese bread is my personal favorite as it is the perfect cheese to bread ratio. The stuffed pizza is tasty with its extra crispy crust. Will definitely go back in the future! The decor is really cute as it makes the perfect ambience."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and two friends on a Friday night at 5:50, waited and was seated at 7:10. The wait wasn't too bad since we expected it and we were able to stand inside and grab a beer by the bar. We ordered the large malnati classic deep dish, hot wings, and the family size malnati salad. The salad was great and had nice big chunks of cheese and bacon and the dressing flavor was really good and well tossed and mixed into the entire salad. The wings weren't anything special but the sauce was pretty good and we enjoyed them. We were all so excited to try this famous maltani classic deep dish pizza and when it came out and we tasted it, it was really disappointing. The pizza wasn't hot with stringy cheese and tons of sauce, but was rather flat and the crust was wet and doughy. We asked our server if the pizza was supposed to be like that and he looked at it and said it did look under cooked and went to grab a manager. The manager came and looked at the pizza and said that's what the pizzas looked like and pointed to the soggy dough and said \"that's all the sauce right there\", but it wasn't saucy, so we weren't sure what exactly she was talking about. The atmosphere is really fun and inviting. The pizza is really nothing to rave over and if all the pizzas tasted like the one we ate, I'm really not sure why people like this place for pizza. Not sure if I would come back because this was a real disappointment. I was hoping for something better than Pizza Hut, but what we got today did not leave a lasting impression"}
{"text":"Do NOT go here. Two stars is very generous after our experience here. We arrived and put our name in and waited for 30 minutes. Fine. No problem. When we were sat at two top in the bar area, the hostess informed us that we should have already put our pizza order in when we arrived as now we would wait 30 minutes more for our food to arrive. We were not told this by the girl who took our order. We ordered two pizzas and waited more than 45 minutes. They definitely are paying th AC bill. I was beyond freezing. The waitress came over one time to refill our drinks. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. I asked for pizza sauce since mine was sauceless and this took an additional 15 minutes. Since it was freezing in there, my pizza was cold by the time the sauce arrived. All in all, this place is over rated. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Chicago pizza IN AZ. I was not disappointed in this place. We started with the Combination platter and Chicken BBQ salad. Both very fresh and tasty. These items came out quick. Next we ordered a butter crust deep dish pizza with sausage and pepperoni. The family loved it. It was perfect for 5 of us and the college kid 2 slices home (ordered large). Our great server was Jordan! Always had drinks and anything we needed. Was very friendly and quick. The family loved interacting with him. We will def be coming back! We had no waiting at 2pm!"}
{"text":"I live out in Surprise and have driven here a few times just for their awesome deep dish pizza!! SO delicious! Isn't theBEST pizza I've ever had but it's really great! 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"Love the service here. The people are very kind. The food is nothing less than delicious. I wish they had a bigger menu because everything that's on it is so good. Would love to just pop them in my mouth without having to pick around the bone!  Gotta go back! Just typing about it is making me crave it!Also, love the location. It's not packed over there yet and it's near my house."}
{"text":"Lou is the last big kahuna that comes to mind that continually puts Phoenix on the U.S. map.  They are one of the legitimate anchors in the Uptown Phoenix Plaza that can easily draw folks from all over the valley.  I've been to Chicago before, but I never had my chance to sink my teeth into Lou's.  But seeing them on television and other medias, it definitely amplifies your desire to try some exceptionally good Chicago Pizza.  As the fanboy I was, I did end up getting a snap with Marc himself.  It was a great pleasure to meet him, he has such a down to earth vibe to him.

Like many others, the wife and I showed up in a long queue that had us waiting for more than an hour.  Luckily, staff members brought out cold water and some pizza samples to try.  So it wasn't too bad.  And at that time, I wish Pokemon Go existed so that waiting would've just flew by.  

Onward to the Pizza.  We opted for the classic dish, of course.  After it arrived on our table, as the Yelp Elites we are, you have to take pictures at a million angles before you decide on the right one to post on Instagram.  Moments later, we weren't hungry anymore and left.  Just kidding.  We finally took our first bite and wow, you can taste that famous butter, flaky crust with those handmade savory sausages.  Yes, it lived up to the hype machine.  The other element about their pizza is in it's fresh tasting tomato sauce.  It's light and not too rich.  Doing so, helps complement the crust and sausage.

If you come in a group of 2 or even 3, I would consider the small size as each slice is very, very filling.  You can have it with a side of salad of your choice.  Next time, I'm definitely going to try some other items.  

If you don't know, now you know.  Midwest meets Southwest."}
{"text":"Eh... Not really impressed.  The place is super cute. The service was...fine.  We ordered the wings, which were good and crispy like we like them. The sauce was... fine but the Blue cheese dressing had no flavor except for a mustardy undertone. The ranch and the wing sauce also had a mustardy undertone as well.  Mustard must be a popular flavor in Chicago.  The pizza was... fine, at first.  Then, as the pizza got cooler and cooler, all I could taste was yeast.  The dough is very yeasty tasting and very thick; and the sauce was bland.  We unfortunately, got a large so we could take the rest home and enjoy it for other meals... I wish we didn't, usually leftover pizza is something to look forward to.... not this pizza, it was bland, way too bready tasting and horrible cold... now I am not a deep dish connoisseur and it is possible deep dish pizzas are only meant to be eaten fresh and hot; so that could just be me.  All in all, it was a...less than fine experience.  Time to try Gino's and Vito's."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Lou's in Chicago, but it's been over a decade. So, comparisons are moot. But I will say this: the pizza here is great!

David took me here for my birthday week/month. We started with the cheese bread, a delicious warm garlic bread. The marinara was scaldingly hot, but still good. Ordered the small original and our server put in for a personal accidentally. It was still one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time.  Meh, these things happen. She fixed the order, let us eat the personal and apparently gave us a decent discount. David said I am a cheap date. How romantical."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but the food was average.  The house salads where terrible and appeared to be poured from a pre-made bag bought at Albertsons.  For $6 I would have expected much better.  
Pizza, both deep dish and thin were average at best, and with so many great pizza places in town, I would not go back.  Service was fine....but very disappointed based on hype."}
{"text":"A friend and I came for the soft opening. We were greeted by friendly hostess. We were a bit early for the reservation, but quickly seated. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the still cool May evening. Unfortunately, we were seated on the orange chairs vs the robin's egg blue ones. They sit too low to eat comfortably. They might be good for having a beer on the patio, but for eating they're about 4 inches too low for the table. I'm also am thinking that they're going to need some more umbrellas for the Arizona sun. Chicago doesn't have 325 sunny days a year so it doesn't look like they're prepared for the shade that Arizonans enjoy. However does have a couple nice misters that'll make up for it. Place is beautiful. They have take out frozen pizzas which I'll definitely put the use. I wonder when they'll get into the supermarkets. Staff has been incredibly friendly as this is their first day of being open and looking forward to a pizza I've missed since moving here and only been able to get close to with our local Oregano's. The Coors Light beer was flat and I am surprised they do not offer a few more Chicago beers on the menu. I will be back and I hope I can improve my experience as their experience increases."}
{"text":"Chicago has made it here. I am a Chicagoan and was a big fan of Gino's East in Chicago. Then I was introduced to Lou Malnatis. Ever since I can't go any where else.

Now with the new hours, we braves it with the kids and had a great time in the early afternoon. Don't expect trendy Scottsdale or the urban uplift of Phoenix...this place feels like home...Chicago. The warmth and simplicity were great. I will say I wished the waiter was a bit more attentive with bringing water to the table as my glass was empty. But, in Chicago they don't drink too much water like Arizonans. 

They'll learn!"}
{"text":"I expected a lot better.  I'm from Chicago and have had the butter crust (thin) pizza before.  My pizza was dry and lacking sauce.  Tasted like a frozen pizza you'd buy in the grocery store and prepare. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am a Chicago guy, through and through. I have eaten at almost every Lou's in Chicagoland at some point in my life...then I followed my parents to the desert and great deep dish became a thing of the past...

I live in Tucson. Today we were passing though Phoenix during rush hour on our way home from up north. So, we decided to stop and give this Lou Malnati's a try. I was skeptical given the other \"Chicago\" chains that seemed to pop up from time to time in Tucson. 

We walked in and the Decor was awesome. We were greeted and everyone was really really friendly. We ordered a sampler of fried goodness which included the fried cheddar cubes if known in my youth. Unfortunately, I have had to stop eating red meat so we could get their sausage (the classic) pizza. I noticed they had \"the Lou\" which is essentially their veggie pizza. It came piping hot and the first slice was served to us, as is tradition. The pizza was just as I remembered it including the wonderful butter crust! We also got a tiramisu to share which was creamy and delicious.

I tip my Cubs World Series hat to you, Lou Malnati's Pizzeria in Phoenix. You have definitely brought a piece of the Windy City our way!"}
{"text":"best to call in order to avoid the wait.
  Pizza was bland and gooey.  Over priced for the small portions"}
{"text":"The wait was sooo long here but our friends came early (while we were still at work) to suffer the wait so by the time we got there, our table would be ready (we had our 7 YO and newborn with us so that was really nice of them.)  Apparently when you check in, you are also able to place your pizza order if you know what you want so by the time you are seated, you don't have to wait much longer for your pizza - it takes about 30-45 min to bake your deep dish.  The service there was phenomenal.  Every person was extremely friendly, attentive and making sure that we were satisfied.

We ordered the french bread as an appetizer and it was sooo good.  I could've eaten more but wanted to save myself for the pizza.

Our pizza came out and we realized after several bites, noticed that it wasn't what we ordered.  Right at that moment, our server came over with our pizza and said they brought us the wrong one. They allowed us to keep that pizza on top of the one that we ordered. We just felt bad for the table that didn't get their pizza and had to wait longer for theirs to be redone.

I would definitely eat here again but would have to time it right to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"What a crazy experience this has been opening a restaurant in Phoenix. So of course I read all the hype and stories over the past year and a half and in regards to last week's grand opening. I was going to wait a while before visiting because let's be honest, everyone who knows me knows how picky I am about good pizza and only the NY style. Besides, who lines up at 11am for a 4pm restaurant opening? Well, I guess Malnati's fans do. Even the staff thought they were nuts-lol! I am not even that much of a Foodie. 

So, I happened to find myself in the same shopping center today, coincidence? I think not! I walked over to investigate the hype and to get a menu. ( I could not find one online) Well, I got there at about 3:15 knowing they do not open until 4pm. I took a peek inside. A young lady walked right out and started talking to me. She handed me a menu and told me that they open at 3:30pm. They really do not open until 4pm. However, if they are ready they have been opening up earlier to let people in due to crowds. That seemed impressive to me so I hung around and waited. They opened at about 3:50. I was first on line. I am kind of proud of that. I am not competitive much, am I? While on line I had a lovely chat with a family friend of the owners who flew out to help and check things out. Also, the staff comes out and offers bottles of water to those waiting online. This place seems more like destination dining but more on service later. 

I was sat quickly after walking in. (Ha, I was first) This place must run on the original 5 second rule because before my behind even hit the seat my server Dave was at my table. Maybe, to make up for the wait outside? He went through his little spiel and we chatted. I could not remember if I had their pizza before on my varied trips to Chi-Town. I believe I might have tried it at Taste of Chicago but could not remember. Dave took my order and was pretty great, and so hilarious to boot. I liked Dave. He is very flexible. He knows the art of compromise! He will make a good husband some day to a lucky young suitor. I say this because after a little back and forth throw down on whose pizza is better, he took the fifth and agreed the customer is always right. ( Maybe he didn't really believe it to be so but I am okay with that) We finally agreed that when I am in Chicago I will eat pizza with a fork and when he is in NY he will eat pizza folded over with his hands. lol. Gotta love Dave! In fact, I have to say the service here was amazing. You are fawned over. For such a busy place they got it down. I like team concept restaurants that share the service. None of that, \"This is not my table.\" baloney.

Okay, so onto the food. It seems my Peeps are divided over this place and their pizza so I was fairly warned. The pizza is different. I was wholly prepared to think of them as two different beast and I agree they are. If I see it this way then I found the food to be very good. ( except i did not care for the lemon garlic salad dressing for some reason) This type of pizza is not the same as NY style pizza. The crust is called \"butter crust\" and it tastes more like a bakery item. Maybe more like a good bakery bread or even cake. The pizza has more sauce on it and less spices and is baked together with the cheese so is a bit blander than the NY style, oily, spicy stuff I love. It seems like it is more like a casserole or pie/Calzone then a slice. I like my pizza with more spices on it. However, I admit I really liked theirs too for what it was. The butter crust is so very good. I could eat just that. I am not saying I did and I am not saying I didn't, okay? However, there might be video of me picking at my pizza and just eating the crust. Okay, who am I? I have come a long way from the Long Island girl who used to hide her crust under her napkin as a kid. Ha!

So great place. The line was out the door when I left and people were vying for my up close parking spot. I think my 1 hour door to exit dining experience was not typical right now so if you are inpatient you might want to wait a bit before you go. Lunch service is suppose to start in June but the menu says it is express pizza. That must mean their pies are Pre-Made. One takes 35 minutes to make. I might drop by for lunch for other menu options when it quiet downs a bit. 

So Zonies and Chi-Town transplants, enjoy but sorry Dave, I still like NY pizza better. Maybe return dining is needed for more taste testing?  ( Insert winky, smiley emoji) Happy eating all. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention all their servings are made for two- four people even their desserts. Single servings are even too large for one person so plan accordingly, or for leftovers at least."}
{"text":"Love \"The Lou\" deep dish pizza.  It is just as good as the ones I used to eat at Malnati's in Chicago.  I usually call ahead so I don't wind up with the 30-35 minute wait.  Folks out front are friendly and get you seated quickly, the servers make you feel welcome.

I'm waiting for the Scottsdale store to open:)"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Weds at 11am, no wait and we beat the lunch rush. Our first time there we didn't know pizzas take 35 minutes so we had to wait. Our waitress was friendly but failed to mention the 35 minute wait and how carry out wasn't an option. They don't take phone orders for air down lunch we were told either. Due to us being in a hurry and not able to eat at our table from the time crunch the manager gave us lunch vouchers. This was nice but we know for next time and I always mention the 35 minute wait to anyone who asks about this pizza place."}
{"text":"Went back to give it another try, this time we ate in and when we arrived was told there was a 30 minute wait, was advised that we could put in our order while waiting and was also given the option to order from the bar.

Decided to wait to sit in the dining room and put in our order of a large deep dish pizza with sausage and mushrooms on on course butter crust dough.

Instead of waiting 30 minutes it turned out to be around 10 minutes. 

Our waitress whom I did not get her name was fantastic and took care of us. In fact the customer service has always been great.

The pizza arrived shortly after we were seated and it was definitely not the same pizza we had for take out, was just like we remember from Chicago. A lot t h icker than the first time, the tomato sauce was much fuller and the sausage was much better, but the major difference was the crust. So much softer and the butter crust that we love. 

When I had my first review, Meghan, from Lou Malnati's responded quickly and asked to make things right. I also received a letter from Marc Malnati which I was totally surprised and impressed that they cared so much about customer care.

Hat's off to Lou Malnati's, they made tremendous corrections to up their quality to what you would expect from the Chicago Pizza Stores.

We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Living in NY for 40 years turned me into a pizza snob.  Thin crust, deep dish, Sicilian, you name it I have gorged on it.
    Moving out to AZ and taking me away from all that pizza has been a nightmare, I tell 'ya.
Until now.
  Crispy, yet airy thick crust - Check
  Fresh and tasty tomato's - Check
  Cheese and lots of it - Check 
  Flavor - Check 
And for a decent price.
I tried the deep dish elsewhere and it always cost over $24 for a large. (And it sucked)
Here, for just a tad over $20 with the tax - the large fed 4 adults and we were stuffed!
  This was my first visit and I ordered online and took it home, so I can not review the restaurant itself, but it sure was PACKED and the bar was as well.  It was real nice that there was a pull out area for those of us waiting to take out. Hubby kept the car running while I ran in.
  I can only remember one restaurant on Long Island with better deep dish, so that's why 4 stars."}
{"text":"I don't really eat pizzas BUT I LOVE THEIR PIZZAS!!!!!! A friend of mine recommended this place and am I glad that I came here. The portion is generous, they really take their time to make it and one huge pizza is enough to feed the 3 of us (and still have leftovers). I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"While living in Chicago I didn't go to Lou's. My place, and everyone in Chicago has \"a place\", was Pizzeria Due. Simply the best and original creator of Chicago pizza. Well, after moving I was relegated to ordering and having it shipped. Due doesn't ship. So I had to settle for Lou's. God da#n it was good. After some investigation I found out that when pizzeria due first opened, they had a chef. After the insane amount of success and pizzeria due becoming a Chicago institution, that chef left and opened his own place. The name of that place............Lou Malnati's!!!!!!!! So that's the back story. The pizza is outstanding and if your not from Chicago and you hear people making a big deal out of deep dish pizza, you tried it and thought......meh. Big deal. Giordanos for example. I don't blame you. But don't decide till you've tried Lou's. To eat a slice, and while eating your looking forward to when you get to the crust!!!!!! That's some good pizza. I'm not exaggerating. If someone got Lou's and ate the whole thing and only left the crust, which would never happen as it's so awesome, but say they did. Anyone would eat up every piece of crust and be happy to have it. Choose Lou's. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What's so great about this place opening in Uptown plaza is the oldest shopping plaza in Phoenix has begun anew!  The entire plaza has been revamped with some upper scale fast eateries that come to Phoenix already with huge followings from other cities like Chicago and New York.

In comes one of the contenders for the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, Lou Malnatis.  Malnatis replaced what used to be a night/jazz club that closed down years ago.    In the Northeast corner of the plaza in front of the cozy grassy knoll is the brightly lit Lou's.

You walk in to the huge lobby and to your left are refrigerators with pre- made pizzas.  I saw several people walk in and pick up pizzas from the coolers and leave.

The service was wonderful.  My first day going, I ate with friends on the patio.  I ordered a personal pan per
Pepperoni with butter crust and the calamari.  A couple of us I. My party thought-out pizzas were far over cooked.  I certainly didn't like the fact that my crust was very airy and crispy.  Almost like a crouton.  Deep dish pizzas I have had in the past have crusts that are dense and thick.  I also had the calamari that I wouldn't try again.  I didn't like the taste and it was slightly n overcooked.

Alas, I came back the next night for New Year's Eve party for the kids.  I ordered a salad, but got a taste of a full size pizza with more toppings and the crust in that pizza was much better.... Nice density, rich buttery taste, absorbed pizza sauce.  I enjoyed the Malnati salad.  It is a sharing size, so be mindful of that. 

Oh yes, on NYE, the restaurant reserved 2 seatings (4 and 7 pm) where kids could come and celebrate NYE in Grand style.  What really worked well for me was pre-ordering!  The food came out on a schedule and it kept things at a nice pace.  Face painting is always a hit.  They could have worked out more activity for the kids like maybe had a dance floor, games, an MC controlling the crowd and getting the kids actively involved.   Way too much quiet time for a party.  

I wanted to like this place so badly.  I'm a huge fan of Giordano's and Pizza Papalolis, so I figured Lou Malnatis would be a similar experience.  It's not as good as those 2 to me.

My recommendation, based on the group's and my reviews of the personal pans, skip the personal pan and go straight to the real pizza.  Share with someone.

I think the prices are reasonable.  It can get pricey with the deep dish.  


Return Factor: 30%"}
{"text":"Our party of six tried Lou Malnati's for the first time a few weeks ago. We were highly impressed. To be sure, the food was delicious. But the way they addressed a small problem we had with our appetizer sealed the deal about what a great restaurant this is. After finding out about our problem, the manager (or chef, not sure which) came out and spoke to us not once, but twice. She was very kind and personable and they more than made up for the problem.  We were heading to a birthday party after dinner and told everyone there what a great place Lou Malnati's is. That kind of exceptional customer service is unfortunately more rare these days and we really appreciated it. We will definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The negative reviews here are from people who are tied to another Chicago pizzeria that I will not name. Hint, recently opened and has plenty if complaints.. Lou M is the real deal."}
