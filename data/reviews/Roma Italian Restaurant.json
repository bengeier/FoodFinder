{"text":"Been here for lunch couple of times. It's our go-to lunch place for Italian food. it's close to the office- has parking- and the food is really good. basic italian food- done right. The hostess (or maybe she is the owner) is very friendly - always has a smile and a cheery greeting. The servers are great and even the kitchen staff is nice. They all stop to say hello- answer any questions about the food. The food itself is above average- nice spread- plenty of veg options- which is a plus for our office crowd. The coffee and dessert are extra- not included in the buffet- but they are worth the money. This place is definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"Not only is Roma's fantastic place to eat lunch is an amazing place to host a cozy event. I have a hosted two events there with great success, fantastic food, wonderful ambience and marvelous customer service! Mary knows her stuff! The food is always fresh with a wide variety and high quality ingredients . I am planning on hosting more events at that location they are fabulous!  I highly recommend them they aim too please!"}
{"text":"Excellent traditional italian cuisine. This place only serves an executive lunch buffet M-F, the rest of the time it's private functions it seems. Too bad because it's a nice restaurant with upscale decor. My friend & I found it from a reco. They are getting wifi soon as we find out. But a good spot for business."}
{"text":"The food was good, but only a small selection of meat dishes for the pricy buffet price. Only open for lunch hours and is usally full with business/company events. Had they'd be open for longer hours or have more MEAT instead of chicken and one fish item, I'd give it a high rating."}
{"text":"It's my first time coming here for s birthday party ,it was amazing the food the sear and music . It's a great place to do a party !"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best: fries are soggy, chicken and meat dishes are tastless and bland. Desserts are ok."}
{"text":"Very nice buffet style lunch. There were pizza's, pasta salads, chicken, penne vodka, bread, etc... there is a lot offered in the buffet. I went on a very cold winter day and the pretty Italian atmosphere with the delicious warm food definitely hit the spot!"}
