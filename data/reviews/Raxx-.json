{"text":"This would be a good place to come and grab a drink and play some pool, but don't expect much more. The food is very mediocre. If you're going to have \"burgers\" in your title, I would expect better. Same thing with the \"brews\"... how are all of your taps down for the day at 6:30 pm? I know this place is new, so I will try it again for pool and beers, but probably won't be eating the food again. Burgers were dry, the fries were clearly just store bought frozen fries, and it took forever. Like i said, the place is new- so hopefully the slow service will improve. At least I hope it gets better, because it seems like it would be a really cool spot, especially in the summer time! Music was also a little weird and inconsistent in style."}
{"text":"Mango habinero wings were really good. The tiki bar was enjoyable. Not sure what the others expected but it's a great local bar with above average food."}
{"text":"Nice pool hall but food was not good.  Burger was tasteless and the tater tot were over cooked. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"We love Raxx... Angie and Rossi are the best!! We always feel at home there. 
Their place is beautiful and the outside deck/bar is great in the summer!! 
Pool tables, great music, great food and of course drinks what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Classless owners and horrible food ruin what could be a great place.  Can't find too many pool halls near Parma, ever since Fox and Hound closed down.  If you want to have sub par food while being served by know-it-all owners, this place is for you.  If not, stay away."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The food is just OK. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. The drinks are tiny. My friends had mixed drinks and the glasses were SO small. Way smaller then regular rocks glasses, ridiculous. 
I tried to have a diet Coke. Nope, they serve knock off brand soft drinks (I asked because it was so nasty). 
If they skimp on soda, what else are they ripping customers off on? 
Don't look to the service as a Saving Grace. The bartenders will pretty blas√© until it was time for us to pay and tip.
Never again. 
Why can't there be a decent place in that spot??? Is it cursed?"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, prices were great, service was awful. If u want to stay in business, you need to get better servers. Your food and tiki bar could go a long way if u got better servers and moved your TV's. U have to look straight up to see the TV from your seat outside. I would love to see this bar succeed."}
{"text":"This place is definitely hard to describe, the food I have had here has not been bad, however I have only ate here twice but both times have been good.

It's mainly a bar/pool hall that's the selling point here, they recently did a remodel which opened up the floor for more space and tables to be occupied. While I have only played pool a couple times here I usually stop in for a couple drinks with buddies since it's so convenient to my buddy's house.  The patio they have is simply awesome! I just wish they actually utilized it properly during the summer."}
