{"text":"Was bored, so I came in here to grab a few beers and watch the Dbacks game. Never been here before so thought I'd give it try. Its a Boston themed sports bar, but I was really impressed with the bartender(Boston) calling me by my name the whole night, as well as everybody else. Great customer service and good prices during happy hour. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I came here today about 5:00 for some food and a drink. Sat at the bar for close to 10 minutes before the bartender came from the kitchen. I ordered turkey on a croissant with fries. Fries were not cooked and sandwich barely had anything on it. Didn't even eat half of it. Bartender was extremely nice.  That is when I found out they scheduled her to tend bar and cook at the same time. I will give it one more try. Hopefully their food will be better, and service quicker."}
{"text":"Ok, real talk time. This is a sports bar, and they also run OTB (off-trck-betting). That's a thing, and that means there are some folks in there just to watch the races and bet, maybe grab a beer and that's all. Does that bug me? Not one bit.   As far as the bar and restaurant portion is concerned, this place is everything I like. The bartenders and servers remember my name, what I drink, always smile when I come in, and have a blast doing what they do. They play all my games (NFL, MLB, NHL and even EUFA Champion's League and MLS). If I want to watch something near where I'm seated, they always do their best to accommodate. Couple that with cheap, cold beers, strong pours, and really decent bar food, and you have a winner.   And let's talk food. I'm a vegan, and it kills me to sit near the kitchen. The wings smell amazing, the sandwiches and burgers are piled high, the fries are hand-cut and awesome, and the things I do eat - the fried zucchini, chips and salsa, etc. - have been great. Mikey, one of the cooks, pulls double duty as a great cook and storyteller. He's one of the things that makes the place fun to spend time at.   I've read some of the other reviews about bad service - I've seriously never had any here, and I have a hunch half of them aren't legit. I've come here when Charity, Amanda, Destiny, Boston, Nick and a few others were serving, and honestly I've never waited more than 2 minutes for a drink - and that was when they were slammed. Food has always been good, and fast, and filling. Charity is freaking awesome, and Boston knows every game's outcome before it happens. He's like Rain Man or something, an absolute riot.   Bottom line: If you're looking for a white-glove one-on-one service experience, go to one of the foofy places nearby. Want an awesome sports bar with good food, drinks, people, music and a fun atmosphere? Get here, and I'll buy your first pint."}
{"text":"Wow, charge 3 bucks just to go in and make a bet on the Derby.  2nd time I've been there.  2nd time is the last time."}
{"text":"I Like this place. I work in Phoenix and stop by to meet my BF there once or twice a week after work before we head home to Gilbert. It's a nice break between freeways. Cat is CRAZY! I have never seen anything she is talking about. Ever! I'm not a huge fan of the food only because it is so fattening, My BF loves the food especially the Jiffy Burger. They do have A great chef salad though. Their happy hour prices are great. A beer is 2 bucks. It is a lot like Cheers and they do know my BF's name."}
{"text":"I came here with the family for Game 1 of the 2013 World Series. We're huge Red Sox fans and live 'round the corner, so it made sense to come here since its a Boston sports bar. The service was pleasant, drinks were reasonably priced, and the food was great. We had buffalo wings to start off and fish and chips and burgers for entrees. Typical bar food, but I thought it tasted great and the pretzel buns on the burgers was an interesting twist. No complaints.  Bottom line: If you like casual sports bars with good deals, this is a great place. Bonus points if you're a fan of Boston sports!"}
{"text":"Nates Third Base is an example of how local businesses can still thrive in the valley. They have absolutely the very best burger and frys in town. The owner Nate Myers always treats his customers and repeat customers like that are members of his own family. Best place to see a Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics or Boston Bruins game outside of New England. If you are ever in the Dobson and Ray area of Chandler its a must you stop in for lunch, dinner or if you ate looking for local nightlife. Especially of you are a native of the New England area and like myself you are sick of the same old \"chain\" bar/restaurants."}
{"text":"The only reason I ever go to Nates is because it's walking distance to my house and they play hockey on some of the TVs. Food is good for bar food, service is usually sub-par, from both the servers and bartenders. The only people that are really treated well are the regulars. Almost every time I go there my drink is empty and I have to wave the server down to get any attention. Better bet is to go down the strip-mall to Valle Luna. Their bar is by far superior, both service and food."}
{"text":"Looks like other yelpers beat me to the punch here...   I came here with just enough cash in my pocket to make some bets on the Belmont Stakes. First of all, the betting windows are right near the entrance, so immediately after entering the whole place was a huge cluster of confusion. I start walking towards the betting line, when some guy stops me rather abruptly and tells me there's a $3 cover. I think I said \"seriously?\" but I can't  completely remember. In hindsight, I should have told him that I was only there to place some bets and didn't have enough cash to pay the cover as well. But the place was packed and I didn't want to hold anyone up by starting an argument, so I paid the dude using money that I was going to use on bets.   I've been to bars several times for the Derby, Preakness, etc, and have never been charged a cover. It's not that I am entirely against cover charges for big events, but this is on NBC for Christ's sake. All the OTB places are going to be packed regardless, and a $3 charge just to place a bet is just greedy and absurd. My advice, head over to O'Kelly's in Mesa. Cheap food and drink specials, friendly service, the betting windows are in the back, and no cover."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are fabulous as is the garbage pizza. The drawback is the service and the drunk horse betting gamblers who yell like they're at an outdoor football game! Totally obnoxious! Service is slow because the crowd is slow. Never been in this place when there were more than 8 customers and only one person waiting on everyone. This is the norm. Been popping in here off and on for many years....it's always the same.....same service....same noisy drunks being obnoxious while they're gambling."}
{"text":"It is what it is.   The bartenders are friendly and they pour a proper pint of guiness. In a proper sized glass.  That alone is worth two stars.   Some of the regulars can get annoying but put this place in context of a dive bar and it gets four stars from me."}
{"text":"I'm here slightly after noon eating a fantastic breakfast after having the nerve to ask if they're still serving. They gladly accommodated even though everyone one else is already enjoying beer & football. The bartender even made me a pot of coffee, bless her heart. The wrong toast came but the cook corrected it immediately and brought the right stuff out with an apology. That just doesn't happen anymore."}
{"text":"Sadly i must give this place one star. I searched in google for places to eat in Chandler zip code 85226 and chose this place from the list I was given to order a company lunch. I called our order in based off the online menu, apparently the menu was changed and they dont have half the items listed online. The only menu with the correct information is inside the bar. Ok cool, we will just pick some other items. I arrive there to pick up my order and learned that the place look quite nice and fun but the employees are below average with personality, attire and communication. I paid for my order with a nice tip and left. When I got back to work everyone was complaining about their food. I myself got the turkey avocado crossaint with onion rings (upcharge of $1) and the turkey was over processed, not even edible, the avocados were quite delightful seemed very fresh and tasted great, the bread/crossaint was soggy and the onion rings that I paid a $1 extra for was 3 very small onion rings...thats it, just 3 of them. A coworker order the Irish nachos which consisted of burnt hamburger meat, cheese, jalapenos and black olives, very disappointing. Another coworker order the 2 hotdogs with the onion rights, he said the hot dogs were subpar at best and he too received 3 small onion rings in his order. The food is definitely not worth the price, the environment could be a lot of fun with the right employees, but definitely not a place I will ever return to. I rarely write reviews but this was just awful. I wish i would have read the reviews prior to ordering because i would have never picked this place for a company lunch. Enter at your own risk.. im sure the alcohol is right as rain though."}
{"text":"Nikol is the best beer just taste better when she serves it.. so is the food had the grilled wings excellent !!! Will be back"}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life!  Full of drunks throwing up on the bar and the bartender continues to serve them?  Totally out of control and nothing was done to stop it.  I know of at least 10 other people that were in there yesterday that won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The drinks are great, the bartenders are wonderful, and the Saturday kareoke is a blast. Lots of regulars - I shall be too."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with a lot of TVs, great food, friendly staff and nice lakefront patio for when the weather cools down. Boston themed, so they have the biggest TVs and sound on the Red Sox or Patriots when they're playing, but otherwise they are very nice about changing a TV to a certain game if you ask. We love to go in, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always have since I first started coming here! All the bartenders are awesome, and very personable. The environment is super casual, and the drinks are cheap! Nikol and Charity during the day are so sweet and on the their game always! Ryan and Boston at night, rock the house and keep everyone in line. I've never waited more than two minutes for a drink, the food is always spot on and Mikey the cook always wants to make sure you're happy with whatever he makes, the owners are very involved in what goes on and always want to make improvements wherever they can. If you want inexpensive drinks, good conversation, and good food, Third Base is definitely the place! Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"Nate's Third Base Pub This place STILL sux. I don't know why I keep giving them a 2nd, 3rd, chance.  Rude, staff, FILTHY bar and restrooms, TERRIBLE food.  Read the other reviews...I'm glad it's not just me...."}
{"text":"Very quaint little bar tucked into a plaza and hard to see, but worth the trip.  They have some random beers on tap, which is always a plus, and a good selection of vodka flavors, which makes every bar better.  The best part of the bar is the bad ass back patio.  There are plenty of tables, room for groups, and it's overlooking a cute man made pond located between the bar and the apartments across the way.  Anytime you can be somewhere in Arizona looking at a body of water, it's a plus.  Perfect place to day drink.   In addition.... the burgers (which are amazing without this fun little detail) all come on the pretzel bun.  Freaking delicious.  My boyfriend is addicted.  As far as the appetizers go, definitely don't leave without trying the buffalo chicken ranch dip.  I went with some friends, and we did some appetizers, and we ordered one and ended up going through three (there were 10 of us).  It is that good.  It's a wonder more places haven't come up with a creation like this.  We also had the wings, naked and extra crispy, with sauce on the side.  They were delicious.  Just remembering them right now sorta makes me wanna stop in and get some... perhaps I will, and you should too!"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can call a bar Third Base when your not playing any baseball especially this time of the year. I went in on Sunday to watch the Baltimore/Toronto game. My boyfriends Canadian and wanted to see his team play. We walked in and no baseball games were on. He got the bartender Terri to turn on the game. I asked her to turn on the Yankee game. She stated the Toronto game was the only one they could get. Really, your bar does not have TBS or the baseball ticket? I guess since they advertise all over the bar as a Boston pub, asking for the Yankees meant I was the enemy. Toronto has the best record and the Yankees are right behind them might I add. Every sports bar should be playing both of those teams hello! She had a complete attitude after that. We were siting at the bar, we decided to move to the other side because I was tired of her glares. It was hard to concentrate on the game with all the old geezers from Boston chatting it up. They kept offering to buy her drinks. I imagine she's probably taken the regulars up on the offer. Since we were newbies and heard she declined. She also was telling customers that a guy working there got a DUI which I thought was unprofessional to talk about an employees personal business. Wonder if she was referring to the owner? As we were moving to the other side she yelled out every TV is the same on that side. Well a college football game was on the other side, plus the Toronto game was coming in clearer. We wanted to sit at a table anyway. I don't know why she cared where the heck we set. Horse racing was on like 8 TV's. I understand they need to cater to the old geezers from Boston but they need to accommodate new people that can be potential regulars. They were all there betting. If other customers come in and ask for a game the bartenders need to do what she can to satisfy all customers. Another guy walked in and asked for NASCAR. Terri gave him attitude and acted like she didn't want to turn in on. She had a sour puss attitude the whole three hours we were there. The bar needs to change its name to a horse racing name instead baseball. We never tried the food. The cook walked out and looked like he was about 18. Just had a few beers each. Prices were reasonable for them. Reason for the one star. Other than the regulars chatting it up, the bar was one of the quietest I've ever been in. Music was down so low, I felt like I had to whisper so that all the regulars wouldn't hear me talking about the bartender. There was an old guy from Boston walking around. He was very friendly with a Patriots scarf on and jacket. 100 degrees out lol. I had a few good laughs."}
{"text":"Came here one Friday night just to check out a new bar. Well, new to us anyway. Actually I take that back - came here for a co-worker's \"I just got fired for doing something stupid but let's all have drinks and wish me luck\" party a number of years back when it was called something else. This time around I came here after work with some co-workers just to have a few drinks and wind down for the weekend. Came about prime dinner time and place was fairly empty except for a few at the bar. We sat out by the water. Very mellow atmosphere with a pinch of divey. Had the wings and if I remember right Shiner Bock on tap? Wings were decent. We hung outside until one of us got cold so we spent the rest of the time indoors and noticed it got quite crowded inside. By midnight, the place was packed. The music was pretty loud and it mostly came from the internet Jukebox (not TouchTunes but something without an app so you had to pick everything right at the machine where everyone can see you - so I wasn't going to troll the jukebox with requests for nausea-inducing songs by either of the two Wills - William Shatner or William Hung). Our server was very attentive and we all had a pretty good time. Whoever mentioned this was a bar for old men betting on the dogs and horsies and no hot chicks ever probably hasn't been here late on a Friday night. Your mileage may of course vary. Lots of parking as it's in a big mall. Actually FINDING parking - you're on your own LOL. Best bet is sometimes in the parking area by the entrance to Sprouts."}
{"text":"Went Saturday, September 13th around lunch time.  Walked in with family and sat.  Restaurant part was empty.  We were the only patrons.  Bar had a few people watching football.  Sat for 10 minutes.  Nobody came over to our table.  I watched the bar tender lady instead talk to another girl.  We left.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Couldn't do zero stars folks. Went on Christmas Day got charged $100 for 4 beers. Please Save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"Walked by Nate's tonight...New Year's Eve and there were around 6 people in the bar, including the staff.  Unfortunately, most of the \"customers\" looked like remnants of the days off track betting \"winners.\"  We kept walking and found another option.  I really had high hopes for this bar but it seems to be in a spiral heading down."}
{"text":"Wow.. Totally impressed... Nate knows his sh*t. Very funny family man kinda guy...  made great drinks for lady friends. Usually places we go the bartender makes it too strong or too sugary... but girls were very happy. Good prices too, FROSTED mugs, good beer selection, great music playlist, nice atmosphere, nice flatscreens, and cool people. I never do these dumb reviews but this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place by the water! Always feel welcome, lots of tv's, good food, good drinks, good times. Can't go wrong, get here!"}
{"text":"Food and service have never been an issue for me.  Staff fall behind everywhere you go.  It doesn't make the place.  It just means they had a rough day. I'll never judge a place solely on one visit. I'll go a couple times before I bad mouth any business. Clientele are great people as well.  Some people just don't like any one but themselves."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and I think they are the same owners that were on Kyrene.  If you are a Red Sox/Pats fan from New England, for which I am, then this is your place.   Great New England food and everyone that works there is from Boston.  If you are a Yankee fan, BEWARE, you might have to sit on the floor and eat your meal.... Great beer choices and HD TV's everywhere you look.  This place has a great atmosphere and is right on the water next to Valle Luna, for which I am a huge fan of too...."}
{"text":"Worst bar ever. Don't waste your time or $. The owner is rude to his staff in front of customers, the food is awful & the bartenders are incompetent. We will never go back. Wish this place wasn't so terrible because it is in a great location."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!  I'll put up  a picture I took yesterday.... one photo says a thousand words.... creepy old guys drinking water/soda totally and obviously eyeballing each woman in the bar. I couldn't even stay for a drink because they were creeping me out. One guy walked up to me and looked straight down my shirt, burped and walked off. WTF? I never write about crude stuff(mostly because there are very few situations like this) but I couldn't believe how violated I felt. I immediately placed a bet on my horse for the Belmont stakes and promptly walked to Valle luna."}
{"text":"Third Base is your last stop before Home. Great karaoke  on Saturdays, OTB and Scratchers Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. Went here on a Sunday to have a drink and eat some wings. It's an OTB, and there's a lot of trash hanging out near the front blocking the entrance to the bar. The wings tasted like they were a frozen purchase from Fry's. The beer was good, but kind of pricey for a Sunday afternoon. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Went for first time n a Friday for happy hour. Waited a long time before seeing a server. Then wait for our drinks,,,then wait for a menu,,,,,then wait for her to den back t take our order not to be the her shift is ending and we need to pay up, aka she wants her tip, for waiting,,,,,,,,,,this could be a god mine, has a beautiful patio, but needs new management."}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill, stopped in for a beer. As I am trying to close out, they begin doing a software update on the computer. Mind you, this is at 5:30 pm. Needless to say, they couldn't read my debit card.  The waitress told me there was an ATM in the corner I could use. It cost me $3 to use the ATM, plus my bank charges me $2.50. It cost me $5.50 to buy a $6 beer. Who runs a business this way. I will never be back and will tell everyone I know never to come here. What a joke."}
{"text":"I moved back to the area about 10 months ago after living elsewhere in the valley for a number of years.  Last time I was in this area this used to be the Waterfront Grill which turned into a Chandler bar pretending to be a Scottsdale bar.  I've been here more than once since I been back as it's easily within walking distance of my home.  The food is okay bar food.  It ain't the best nor the worst.  I think a lot of the food is a bit pricier than I'd expect.  They have decent selections of beer and booze, though I have seen bigger selections and much better drink specials elsewhere.  Business depends on day, time of year, time of day etc.  It can be between pretty dead and pretty busy as has been mentioned before.   The bar staff can be really hit or miss as well.  Finally, Nate's is a Boston themed bar.  Normally it's not a big problem.  I've been to other themed bars around town.  I've seen staff get downright ornery toward customers who happened to be rooting for their home team when they happened to be playing a Boston team.   If the fan starts a fight, that is one thing but that hasn't always been the case which is a big downer for this place.  I've finally decided to stop blowing my money here.  It's really not worth it anymore.  I can get comparative or better food elsewhere and kill brain cells cheaper. There are reasons why this place is getting a lot of 1 or 2 star ratings.  I think I've explained mine."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I Decided to try this place out last night around 5:30-6ish. We were pleased to find we made it for happy hour. One bartender said hello to us and walked away. The other bartender didn't even acknowledge us for about 10 minutes. Keep in mind there were 6 people at the bar including the 2 of us and the bar is not big. We ordered beers and he handed us menus. We looked over the happy hour menu and were thinking of ordering something. While looking over the menu's the bartender was dropping F bombs and extrememly rude to another patron. Don't get me wrong, I drop F bombs quite frequently but never while i'm working, it's just bad taste....I dont care what kind of job you have.  Our beers were dry for a long time before the rude bartender even asked if we wanted another OR order food. My fiancee used the restroom and decieded eating here would be a bad idea as they were dirtier than dirty. Meanwhile a cook came out of the kitchen with food at sat at the bar to eat it. The rude bartender yells across the bar to the cook \"COOKS CANT SIT AT THE BAR, NATES RULE\".  Poor guy got up and sat at an empty table away from the bar. Again bad taste. At this point we decided we had enough of this place and would not be returning. EVER. I am thankful we didn't try the food. There are plenty of other dive bars in Chandler with good service and clean restrooms."}
{"text":"There was a time when I wrote this place off because I got a burned burger.  That was a couple of years ago and I decided to try it again since it is just a half mile from my home.  I've been there twice in the past month and absolutely love the carnitas tacos . . . they were delicious both times.  My favorite server is Rizzo; he is charming, funny, and keeps the food and drinks coming.  The Saturday night karaoke is fun too!"}
{"text":"A dear friend told us about Nate's Third Base Pub. We were so excited to find a \"new to us\" spot in Chandler.  Upon entering the facility we were greeted and welcomed to sit anywhere we would like. That was a great start.  We sat in the patio area, we waited a little more than five minutes to have our order taken. Our server was pleasant and honored my yelp deals offer. We received our drinks a few minutes later.  Unfortunately, that was the last time we saw our server. We waited, and waited, and waited with empty glasses and our server just never returned. We finally decided to leave. We got the attention of another server and requested our check. She brought us our check and slammed it on the table as she carried a conversation on a phone. In fairness to her, she was working several tables. But being on a phone while attending customers is not very professional. In all, the experience here was very disappointing. I'd really like to award this place one and a half stars but because I like to be fair I gave them what you see. Hope you have a better experience than I did. Good luck."}
{"text":"This place COULD BE a gold mine but with current management, bar food choice this place is a waste of space. You're better off going to Valle Luna, Pita Jungle or Sushi place in same atrip mall ( which are always packed)  The place is dirty and the only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because our bartender had a good personality and was attentive.    I would recommend Stadium Club for a local bar within a major city block from here on Alma School and Ray or if sports is and great food is what you desire you can't beat Jolie's Plac on Warner and Arizona Ave"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  This place is in one of the best little strip malls in the SE valley, with a nice patio and a view of the lake, so I was very surprised at how scummy this place was.  Dirty, bad food, sketchy clientele, bad service and mediocre to bad food.  Did I say bad food twice?  The chicken nachos were an black eye on the entire Southwest.  Greasy sparsely distributed chips covered in pump cheese and few toppings.  $10 for something I wouldn't serve to inmates.  The patty melt was a meatball of a patty cooked MR when ordered medium, served on dry toasted bread instead of traditional grilled patty melt, and a chicken sandwich that looked like it was made by a first time cook who had it described to them what a chicken sandwich was but had never actually seen one for themselves.    The bathrooms are dumpy and the service is slow.   This place is a mess.   I give it two stars instead of one because it is a nice location and I didn't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Never waited so long for a beer, took about 20 mins to get a drink after ordering. We got our meal and asked for napkins and ketchup, they never came. Had to go to the bar to ask for them. Slowest service ever for a bar that was not even close to crowded."}
{"text":"This place feels like the typical neighborhood bar (which is my favorite type of scene), but not many neighborhood bars around here have a large patio with a beautiful lake view, so that's a definite bonus! The drink prices are fair, and the food is great! The cook, Mikey, really takes pride in the food he serves and wants to make sure you get the best possible. The weekend nights get surprisingly busy during karaoke, and the days are filled with people enjoying some OTB.  The real reason I keep coming back, though, is Charity. Anytime I go in there, whether it's a slow day or she is slammed with a wrapped bar, she always has a good attitude. She is very efficient and makes sure that everyone not only has a drink in front of them, but that it's served with a smile and a friendly remark. From what I have observed she has a good relationship with the \"regulars\" and even though I am not in there often, she always remembers my name and what I drink. I have never had to wait more than two minutes for a drink, no matter how busy she is.  For years now, my parents and I have met every Friday for Happy Hour to catch up. We have tried out several different places in the vicinity, but Third Base has quickly become our favorite! My son has a little bit of flexibility to run around the patio when it's not busy, and we enjoy the scenery. The service is always good, and the food is yummy. Charity always makes it a point to come out and visit with my son, who loves the extra attention from a pretty girl. Anyone can be a good bartender, but it's little things like that, along with the before mentioned attributes, that make someone a truly exceptional one. As long as Charity is there, we will be, too."}
{"text":"Ryan was a fabulous bartebder.  We stopped in to watch a little football.  We are new to the area and will definitely come back just because of Ryan."}
{"text":"This place is a rip-off.  I stopped in to make a bet on the Preakness and they made me pay $3.  I was in this establishment all of a minute.  At least they could have given me a soda."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Nate's on a Friday night at about 9:00pm. Service was awful. We sat on the patio and waited about ten minutes for a waiter. When we asked another waitress for our bill because our guy  disappeared, she was rude. Not going back."}
{"text":"We came here and it was DEAD. Whatever, that was fine with me. We sat at the bar and my husband ordered a burger with peanut butter. Yes, you read that right. That's all it was - the pretzel bun (which are insanely delicious) with the burger and a hearty slather of peanut butter. Looked disgusting to me but he loved it. I got the burger with avocado, lettuce, tomato and onion. It was really good. The one thing I didn't like was the ketchup. I didn't enjoy my tater tots (they don't serve fries which I was bummed about, but my husband was ecstatic about). My husband didn't see why I was not okay with the ketchup but it tasted like they added beer to it. It was strangely ... sour. Hmmm..."}
{"text":"Stopped in at happy hour for a burger and beer. Bartender was excellent and the burger was what you would expect from a dive bar. Filled with white trash locals at the bar, playing pool and betting on horses. Should be a little classier for the location."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! It's definitely a dive bar. I would've given 4 stars but they only play country music :( the customer service is great and all are friendly. I didn't eat here because the food is your basic bar food, but the drinks were strong. Not too bad!"}
{"text":"These tools want to charge $3 to enter just grab lunch and place a bet on the horses. I would avoid it just on that principal alone."}
{"text":"Bartenders are awesome I have been coming here for years now food is good and the staff are friendly from nicole and charity to Dave at night Prices are decent I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"Love this place! Destiny, Charity & Boston Rock! My food is always awesome and the beer is cold...what more could a girl ask for? Oh yeah Nate's stories are always a good time! Let's not forget 'Handsome Mike' who works otb booth :)"}
{"text":"This place is very divey and full of off track bettors as this establishment has betting there, which is what lead us here on Saturday. The appeal of the Belmont stakes was too much to resist. They have quite a few beers on tap with a good variety. Drinks were reasonably priced and everyone was nice."}
{"text":"It's usually pretty quiet there when I've been in, and kind of a dive.  They have Goose IPA on tap, which I don't see very often, but I definitely appreciate.  The bar food is decent and the bartenders are nice.  They have a couple of pool tables and off track betting, neither of which I've ever used."}
{"text":"Happy that I was introduced to this place, much love for my locals. I feel so much love for my hometown Chandler when I'm here. Cutest name for a baseball bar, too! Drinks are fairly priced, way more affordable than going out to Mill. I walk in and Ryan & Stez remember my favorite drinks. The food here is surprisingly amazing (especially the wraps and sweet potato fries). Saturday karaoke nights are always memorable and there is a great selection of songs, but also a great place to go during the week if you work on the weekends like me. Always something to do like darts, billiards, or watching sports. Patio is the best place to make new friends any day of the week. If you are new to the area stop by and you will become apart of our neighborhood very quickly!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this place, I have had a great experience. I feel like the people complaining are the same people that complain at a McDonald's because the patty is too thin. Yeah, most the people you see here are regulars, so they having that relationship. It's like any place that you visit on a regular basis that you start to chat on a different level. The reason for 4 stars is because it's a 4 star bar, a 4 star bar dammit.   They do Karaoke on some of the nights and it can get rowdy and fun. Happy drinking."}
{"text":"Really great bar with a great atmosphere. The only bad thing was the service was soooooo slow. It wasn't even that busy and it took 30min to get a beer. Other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Casual local sports bar. Drink specials every day. Happy hour is great. We go here to visit the owners (who are very nice & sociable). We like going hear to watch our Boston Red Sox & Patriots. They will always have the sound on for the Patriots game. It is a boston bar. I love it.   Karaoke on sat nights too!   Also have off track betting."}
{"text":"Wow, tough break.. Brutal yelpers. I've been more than a handful of times and I can say that recent improvements have made a difference (at one time I was a regular). When we stopped back in after about a year I was pleasantly surprised, even to find the bathrooms the cleanest they've ever been. Maybe a change in staff is what the place needed.. Drinks are fairly priced and the menu is actually pretty decent. On our last visit particularly I could tell that the bartender was overwhelmed and closed my tab with different prices than I was originally quoted, im sure I got a deal regardless it just made me a little uneasy with the sudden changes.. Try Nates you might be surprised.."}
