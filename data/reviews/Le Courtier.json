{"text":"They had a separate waiter for food and drinks and the drink waiter didn't tell the food waiter that we also wanted food so we sat around waiting for someone to take our order. When the food came there was a pubic hair in the middle of my salad. My friends with me who go there more often than me say the food and service are generally good, so maybe I just have bad luck."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch with a group of 8 people and ordered a burger. When it arrived (after approx. 40 minutes) I was disgusted to see that my bun was mouldy. I pointed it out to a waitress who looked horrified, but then left the plate sitting in front of me. After everyone else had finished their meals, I was presented with a new burger - despite not being asked if I wanted an alternative.   At this point I asked to speak with a manager and a person who quite obviously works on the line there came over. He told me, \"Yeah, the cook grabbed the wrong bag of buns.\" Why there was a bag of mouldy buns in the kitchen anyway was beyond me. He offered to comp my meal (which I had 2 bites of) and offered no apologies. Brutal and unsanitary."}
