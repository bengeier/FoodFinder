{"text":"I used to come frequently until one day the food became inedible. Today, after more than a year, I decided to give it another try. Warm pop, inedible taboule salad and ok shawarma."}
{"text":"Getting a salad is the same price as elsewhere but you can only get 2 toppings -- whereas most other places you get 4-6.  2 vegetables on a plate is not a meal or filling.   The tabbouli had very little flavor too -- more like just parsley then the refreshing, lemony dish you normally get.  Overpriced for the quality of food you get. There are much better options right near by."}
{"text":"This place used to be great.  We used to mainly order the full plates (beef and chicken).  The last three times we've been there, the quality of service, and portion sizes seems to have shrunk.  First time it happened, I thought it might have been one off experience.  However, it has happened couple times since then and feel that this is no longer the place I used to enjoy.  Last time I was there, not only was the serving size small but was given older/colder meat from their trays.  The taste is okay, anything you'd expect from such dishes.  Nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and honestly if I could give this less than one star, I would. I ordered the beef shawerma and it was so chewy and cold plus the entire sandwich was 95% sauce and lettuce, barely any beef. So disappointing tbh"}
{"text":"This place used to be great, but since new ownership has gone downhill. I'm actually writing this review having had their chicken skewer plate yesterday, and ended up getting severe food poisoning an hour or so later after getting home.  I've been up all night vomiting over 6/7 times and have literally had no sleep. This will definitely be the last time I ever eat here, and will definitely advise others of doing the same. I will definitely not be surprised if this place closes down very soon."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and food was garbage.   Workers looked depressed, food was disgusting. I took the food back and told them that it was disgusting and the manager was arguing with me. First of all, Why would anyone waste their time on arguing with someone when the whole purpose of buying food is because they're hungry!  I said I would get something else but he refused so he gave me my money back and I was happy about that because I didn't want to eat anything from that place.   Never eating there again. Pickering town center has shit food period."}
{"text":"Worse service, they didn't even look at me while I was ordering too busy talking to each other so I just walked away in the middle of my order. I doubt they even noticed or cared."}
{"text":"I ordered the falafel pita for lunch and was sooo disappointed with it.  I use to go here all the time as I work in the area, but I think I am going to give up on it.  The falafel was cold, they skimped on all the toppings.  They must be trying to cut costs, but its not working for them."}
{"text":"I come here often one thing I love is the portioning of the food ... The food is good and a good environment to dine... Only concern is the menu only designed for one person, they should incorporate something for the family... This will also yield an increase in traffic for dinner time. I think its reasonably priced and I feel that the portions are quite large and filling. Their salads are usually very fresh and the service is also good."}
{"text":"This place is a travesty of a shawarma/falafel place. Even at lunch, the food tastes stale and old. Servings are small and the food is overpriced and bland. It's a real shame, the location at the Eaton Centre is actually pretty decent as far as mall food court Middle Eastern is concerned. At the Eaton Centre, the food tastes fresh and the supply of salads is plentiful. The Yonge/Eg folks could learn a thing or two by taking a subway ride down to Y/D.  I'm not expecting a lot from a place in the Riocan Centre food court -- but some semblance of quality would be good for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent food and made to order falafel fresh! Very great service and the owner was really friendly and told us that all the food is made fresh daily and nothing is frozen.  The taste of the food is great and the it was really good quality.   I woukd recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I am a frequent customer, but honestly The quality is not always consistent, and sometimes it depends on who prepares your meal !!! but still its value for money compared to other places in downtown."}
{"text":"Rude f**king Asian girl...the first words that came out her mouth \"what do you want!\" I ask for a falafel sandwich she gave me some cold ass old falafel that look like it was sitting there the whole day the I asked sure I want everything on it she friggin shoves the veggies and breaks the friggin sandwich apart and then she warms it up for like 3 secs I get my sandwich and it look like the pic I will attached f*ck that I ain't eating it its f*cking cold and the sandwich is stuck on the f*cking wrap. You guys deserve a fuckin -5 worst service and food!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is good but they work don't sound so friendly and don't listen to you. u have to repeat your orders twice. A quick take out. That's it"}
{"text":"This is a chain with this location in a business park with several food chains and it shares a building/counter with a Thai Express. It's very neat/modern looking with enough seating room.  I have a small appetite but this is probably the smallest shawarma wrap I've had lol and it's $6 for the wrap. Quantity doesn't matter as much for some of us but if you have a bigger appetite or want more value then this isn't the right place...I noticed their platters aren't very big either (the rice on the platters are avg).  The chicken shawarma wrap isn't great but not bad....the chicken itself and the sauces they use have little taste though so it's quite bland. The vegetables seem fairly fresh but not the greatest shawarma I've had. They do have daily specials but pricing isn't that cheap.  Overall, I would recommend the 4-5 shawarma places on nearby Queen Street (Streetsville Mississauga) over this because they all usually have better taste/price/quantity but if you happen to be in this area and need lunch or something then not a bad idea and there are plenty of other places located beside it in case you have multiple people who can't agree on what to eat."}
{"text":"Gross.  The parsley in the tabouleh salad was sandy & therefore, clearly hadn't been washed.   Every piece of chicken had more fat on it than meat.   The tahini when poured over the meat was like water and the potatoes tasted old.... today is Monday and this is primarily a business section of the city, so there should be no reason for old potatoes."}
{"text":"After my disappointment with Villa Mandina I tried Kabul Kabob and Shawarma located at street level (30 Eglinton W.) a couple of days later and discovered my destination for Shwarma!  Their food portions are huge, price is reasonable and service is professional.  With a place like Kabul Kabob and Shawarma just next door why would anyone go to Valla Mandina?"}
{"text":"Good portion size! Meat nicely done, great variety of greens and sides. Downside: TOO SALTY!!! Guys, you can take half of the salt content!!!"}
{"text":"It's just a disaster, my shawarma sawich was destroyed, it messed up every where and now i am hungry. Do not waste your money!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come here its just gonna be the chicken kabobs, or the double shawarma plate, chicken kabobs are nice and have great spices, shawarma is very good, and their potatoes are awesome. A long time ago it wasn't as good, but now its great. Most employees aren't stingy with foods, and new employees learn to get everything right fast. Next time you're in southcentre mall try it, and if you don't think its gonna be great, what other choice do you have? KFC XD"}
{"text":"My mouth waters thinking about the chicken and beef shawarma plate. It's the garlic sauce....whatever's in it (please no one tell me) it is like crack to me. I would take a bath in that stuff if I could. Consequently, you smell like you have after you eat it. Pack a toothbrush for after but dig in. Plus the tabouli they make here is pretty tasty, but most of the sides are pretty great. For quick cheap Mediterranean food, this place is ideal."}
{"text":"I like the food but good food is not a good enough reason to go to this place. there is one brunette girl that works here and idk how she even got the job unless the owner of the place is her relative. She is the rudest person i have ever met. She made mistakes MULTIPLE TIMES with no apologies. I told her no rice, she adds rice. i told her no hot sauce, she put hot sauce. not sure if shes mentally unstable or just high but she was just terrible. i will never go to the madina in this location ever again because she is ALWAYS WORKING THERE."}
{"text":"They must have changed owners! This place is ridiculous, do not give them you business!!! They have reduced their portions and limit your options now. When you used to order a plate, you were given 2 salads and all the relish toppings along with tomatoes and onions. When I asked for the pickled radishes this time, the cashier actually said \"you need to tell the server in advance and said \"you can't have them all\". WOW!!! First of all, when I don't want rice and potatoes - just potatoes alone - does not mean you give me 4 pieces and move on to the next side. Why do I need to say \"excuse me, why are you only giving me half of portion?\".   I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION. Any other Villa Madina is nicer and gives you a proper portion, not try to cut back and rip you off."}
{"text":"Very fresh. Very good. Very consistent.   I typically eat lunch here once a week and am never disappointed. There is always a lineup and the staff is very interactive as you are going down the line with your order.   I've had almost everything on the menu and my favorites are chicken and beef shawarma combo plate. The spicy potatoes are some of my favorite things along with the hummus and pita which is a standard addition to the combo.   Try the grape leaves if you haven't already. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Villa Madina    Category: Mediterranean 3.0 star rating 1/23/2011 Inexpensive,tasty and fast and satisfying Mediterranean food . Best Value for your buck!  $ 5.99 Shishtawouk Plate Special - that's the chicken. The plate is loaded with rice , mixed vegetables, lettuce, coleslaw, chicken, hummus, tahihi, pita bread, hot sauce, beets, pickles  For you Gluten Intolerant make sure you tell them you don't want the Pita or the Tabbouleh"}
{"text":"I've been here three times, the line up gets long during lunch time. A safe bet is to order their chicken shawarma or the combo (beef and chicken) shawarma rice plate. They go lightening quick so you have to be on your toes when ordering, or else you'll get staredowns from people behind you for taking too long. Each time I place my order I get a bit flustered, they expect you to know what they have to offer already. When I ask about the salads, they go thru them so quick I could only remember what the first one was called. With the rice plate you get a pita bread, humus, a choice of salad, rice, potatoes and some meat, for about $9 including taxes. A bit pricey considering other options at the fast food joints right next to them. Their meats can be a bit dry, so make sure you say yes to the sauce.   I ordered their pitas once and was quite disappointed, it was not filling. So go for the rice plates if you have a big appetite."}
{"text":"Omg, what a joke, they were constantly harassing people with free chicken samples, but I was trying to order and they couldn't focus on providing me with my order.  They didn't offer any sauces, over charged me, and gave me a small portion for a platter.  Never again... Can see why no one was eating here."}
{"text":"Portions are incredibly small, It won't fulfill you. I order a mix plate so I can get a decent portion, but it is never enough. Supposed to be Beef shawarma plate, not rice and salad plate with sprinkles of beef on top. Never again"}
{"text":"When I passed by this place there was a man who was offering free chicken samples. I decided to order from this place. I asked the man if there was a special and he told me that the special of the day was the chicken shawarma plate for 7.49 and that it came with chicken, rice, salad and potatoes. I told him I would get the special. The service was great until I got to the cash. I had to pay 11 dollars. I asked if it was the special and the lady turned to the manager and the manager told me no, it's not the special. I explained that I asked for the special and he demanded that I pay. The meat was dry, was not worth my money. This location gets an extra star than what it deserves because of the decor. Everything is nicely laid out and visible so that when you order, it's easier for you to choose what you want. I personally thought the way the salads were presented was beautiful."}
{"text":"Fast food a lot of food for small amount the food very delicious on anther location the test different you can take the day special for only 6.99 $ wow relay I like it"}
{"text":"Would give it a negative if I could. Used to go there all the time and got great service and decent food. However, it appears to have changed ownership. The food is not up to par and now the food portions shrunk significantly. Falafels lacked flavor and seemed like they had been refried several times over. Used to go quite often but will be my last visit. Plenty of other places serving up shawarma and Falafels. No thanks........"}
{"text":"I made this account just to tell people not to eat the falafel.    It was the worst falafel I've ever had in my life, so dry it crumbled like an Oreo cake base and it had crunchy chunks in it that felt like i was chewing on sand.  It had no flavour and the pita was just as dry as the falafel.    The guy took a dirty utensil from the meat and grabbed the falafel.  Gross.  This place is nasty, don't eat here."}
{"text":"I've only had the Shish Taouk sandwich (many, many times) and thus my review is for this item only.  Depending on who is making your sandwich, you may have to ask to get tabouli added, not a deal breaker, just be aware if you ask for 'everything' on your sandwich."}
{"text":"I had the worst chicken shwarma of my life here. It was so skinny/tiny and flavourless. Hardly any toppings inside. I couldn't believe it compared to the shwarmas I've had everywhere else in the city. After reading the reviews I'm glad to know I'm not the only one.  Wish I'd seen the post below about a past insect infestation. Disgusting. I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"I love getting food at Villa madina. But the location at Pickering town is the worst. Food is horrible.  Dry chicken, potatoes and rice. Salads are not fresh. If you want villa madina just get it at a different location."}
{"text":"I am prepared to try out the Mediterranean food.   Here I found it in the food court of Markville Mall.  Attracted by the great variety of choices, I picked the sausages and a potato salad.  The portion is huge in a food court.  The foam holder does not have enough compartments to hold the different food and sauces.  So at the end they are piled up one after another.    The food has a lot of spices in it.  I think that is the Mediterranean food.  Unexpectedly I am a bit allergy to it and feel itchy the whole night.  The strong spice also makes my mouth full of the smell.  When I paid for the combo, the lady charge me separately for the food and a drink.  I tried to explain to her but she don't seem to get it.  At last she take out the price of the drink and the bill is settled."}
{"text":"Very poor service from the staff and the food was disappointing. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had some of the chicken skewers with rice and the food was horrible.  They over charged me and even though no one was really there, they rushed and did a sloppy job of putting my food together. ..... quality here has gone down since the new food court opened. ALL the sauces wrre extremely watered down."}
{"text":"Horrible shawarma, horrible service. The workers are rude and you do not get what you payed for. I payed 15 dollars for the mixed shawarma platter and the woman gave me 2 potatoes, when I kindly asked her for more she gave me a dirty look and proceeded to add 1 extra potato............................. The sauces also taste bad. Overall the food quality seems old and not worth it."}
{"text":"Just grabbed lunch from here for the first and LAST time... grumpiest service, server admitted that my falafel (driest in my life) were made 1.5hrs previously, two salads on my plate were only actually one and three sprigs of parsley, and wasn't asked which salads I wanted... I commented about the food quantity, he huffed and slopped some extra hummus on my falafel plate like I was being given gold for being a pain in his butt, then I had to remind him of the pita that was supposed to be included which he tried to get out of giving me... my friend's shish taouk wasn't even grilled!! he took it out of the fridge and sautéed it for 2 minutes (still pink inside) and we chucked it out when we got back out of suspicion. Perhaps my WORST middle eastern food experience in my life. BE WARNED!! Never ever going to see that place again."}
{"text":"Worst shawarma ever.  The saltiness of the toppings over power the shawarma.  The chicken is flavourless and in the time it took to make my wrap and get to my table it turned in to a soggy train wreck.  The pita became a soggy gluey meas that fell apart two bites in.   Never again."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong their food is amazing. I always order the kefta plate, which includes a beef kefta kebab, roasted potatoes, hummus, and garlic sauce, with your choice of rice and  salad, and the portion sizes  are quite reasonable for $10.60. However this one guy working at the cash (I believe he's the manager) is so rude! He's absolutely impatient. While I was waiting for my receipt to come out, he just grabbed the machine out of my hand and pulled my debit card out with a force, and instead of handing it directly to me, he literally threw it on the counter. I get that it's really busy during lunch time, but that does not mean you should be manner less. So overall the food was great, but the customer service wasn't."}
{"text":"Food poisoning awaits you from the disgusting boiled chicken they use for their shawarama.   Is it really that difficult to make a good shawarama in this day and age? Their ingredients are soggy, the service is rude, and I've never had such a horrible excuse for middle eastern food in my life.   Never going back again."}
{"text":"Out of all the choices in the sq1 food court this is probably among the healthiest. Food is decent. Very nice selection of salads. The cabbage salad is good.The lentil rice is nice. I always get the plate. Decent value. The wrap is small and not worth it. Service could be better. I don't understand why the guys rush to make your order even when there is noone in line behind you. They treat you well once they know you but otherwise no unless you're one of them"}
{"text":"Very grumpy staff to the point where it makes the customer feel like they did something. There's something about good service which makes the food taste better. Can't even remember how the shwarma i bought tasted. This business really needs some friendly front counter staff, you can be grumpy all you want In the kitchen."}
{"text":"Located in the TD Square cafeteria (top floor) is this little place that serves Lebanese/Mediterranean fast food. Chose the Kefta Platter, which was the special of the day for $5.99. It consisted of hummus, garlic sauce, veggies, rice (with lentils), roasted potatoes a large slab of Kefta (an oval-shapped, ground beef patty). Though it was filling and satisfying, I did find the rice too dry. A nice touch was the grilling of the pita bread, it was good to know that they take time for that kind of detailing even when the line up is long and speed is at a premium. Indeed Villa is the best value throughout the TD Square cafeteria. The lines can be long here and sometimes its slower than you think, but if you don't mind that you will definitely get you money's worth."}
{"text":"This location give me \"Burned Meat\" Completely BLACK and DRY! I took it back for an exchange the girl told me \"It's like that!\" Really? I had it many times at Fairview Mall I can tell you  \"It's not like that!\" then she exchange me with another plate of dry meat. I throw the whole plate into the garbage! We'll never return!"}
{"text":"Located in the food court of Yonge and Eglinton Centre, Villa Madina is the place to go for some authentic Mediterranean food!  The staff may be very flirtatious and loud, but they give very generous portions! The chicken shawarma plate is very tasty, you have a variety of salads to choose from as your side. I wasn't able to finish all the food - I think one order is good to share for two people!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible. If there were a star lower than 1, that's what I would give it. Because of my bad experience, I will never eat here again and will advise my friends to do the same. Today, I found a strand of hair in my food not even a minute after I sat down to eat at Bramalea City Centre. The person who took my order was an older man with salt and pepper hair. I even spared him embarrassment by allowing him to finish with the customer he was dealing with first before I showed the box of food with the hair in it. Once I presented it to him, his first response was, \"Where that hair come from?\" I was taken aback by his nonchalant attitude. I explained that I don't know where it came from. The hair clearly wasn't mine because I'm Black with black hair and the strand of hair that was in my food was very long, of a fine texture, and light brown. Here's the kicker. He took the strand of hair out with a napkin then asked if I wanted to just switch out the salad (That's the part the hair was tangled in). Are you kidding me? Then I politely said I would like a whole new order. He asked, \"A new order?! The meat too?!\" That goes to show that this place is unhygienic and does not value customer service. An apology should have been given initially. While redoing my order he was extremely rude. I remained polite the whole time, so his attitude was unwarranted, ESPECIALLY because there was a hair that was obviously not mine found in MY food. I see women working there all the time, so obviously the strand of hair had fallen off of one of their heads into the styrofoam box. I should have just asked for my money back. It's a shame because I always have a good experience at the Yorkdale location, but today I've ruled out all of the restaurants. I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a moment when you were standing in line and instantly regretted going to a takeout food court vendor, but still had to commit to it anyway?  My experience at Villa Madina was like that.  Let me start with the obvious. The staff needs to work on cleanliness. Yes, I understand that the unruly Lebanese family with five people showed up demanding all sorts of extras to their food. Fine, nature of the beast. When the father is sliding his five-year-old daughter along the counter and letting her touch trays - the same trays people are picking up and taking with them, mind you - you need to wipe that down with Lysol or something.  Were I not under the clock and on my way to another destination, I would have easily walked then and there. Unfortunately, I had to commit and once again found myself overpaying for something that underdelivered.  I went for the beef-and-chicken shawarma plate ($10). You can't really screw a dish like that up, and the quality was suitably decent. Like others have said, I seem to recall their portion sizes being bigger in the past, but maybe it was because I was ordering to go. They just ladled some beef and chicken on top and called it a day. The place was a zoo with a lineup quickly forming behind me, so I just told them to put \"everything\" on it. Perhaps that wasn't the right idea, because they seemed to skimp on half the extras.  I would almost contend that there's a bit of favoritism going on, because the aforementioned family in front of me were asking for extra salad, vegetables, everything.  The spicy rice I ordered did have a suitable kick, which was a nice surprise for a chain restaurant. The rest of the food was a bit dry, and I wished they'd thrown in more tzatziki or something to balance it out.  For the price I paid (almost $15 after taxes for the dish and a drink), I doubt I'll be back to Villa Madina again. Lackluster quality, possible sanitary issues and dry food add up to a frustrating and underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"It's just an other fast food chain. The only difference is its halal. The food is middle eastern and a bit salty. The service is fast as it does get busy during weekdays lunch hour due to office around the area.   The food is dry in the evening as mostly it's the leftovers from lunch hour."}
{"text":"Under new managment and they are ruining this once awesome place. The food is now bland -- they don't provide the hummus/garlic sauce unless you ask for it (and even then it is an anemic 1/2 tablespoon). the salad options are mediocre (and bland) and the service sizes have shrunk to the point of no longer being of value.  The new management got rid of the old staff and now surcharge everything... its such a shame -- they even water down the tahini sauce.. seriously?!?!?!!? so sad this place is dieing.. they wont be seeing my $$$ any time soon."}
{"text":"Tuesday evening for reference : everything on the plate had an over powering lemon flavor that ruined the experience.  The Keftka was mushy.  The salads were crisp but once again lemon.  The Tahina sauce was watery and oily.  Not very good.   Fix the lemon issues please!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here twice and it was unbelievable! Maybe it was extra fresh because it was during the lunch rush. Big portion, full flavour, super tender and juicy chicken. On point!"}
{"text":"What a shity place and service !! Never go there I promis you. you are not missing anything special, so slow service and I ordered my food to go I had to put it my self in the bag and I also ordered an extra pita they just put it in a plate and gave it to me . How fucked up is that !!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here once. The food was terrible. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with rice and salad. It was just gross."}
{"text":"Ugh... Where do I begin!?!?  The wraps and potions continue to shrink but the price keeps going up.  The staff are incredibly rude. My order felt like I was interrupting their conversation.  Their once delicious food has turned into a mass produced disappointment.  Totally a waste of $10!!"}
{"text":"You know a Lebanese restaurant is good when actual Lebanese people tell you it's good!   Awesome service - Awesome food - for a quick grab & eat!! Good service! Good price!"}
{"text":"This is easily the worst thing I've eaten all year.   Got a beef shawarma. First of all it was terribly made. Not sure if the bread was ancient but it was literally falling apart. And not because it was stuffed. The bread just couldn't support the stingy contents.   There was very little meat. All I could see really was bread, bread and more bread. When it eventually collapsed I could make out some tomatoes too. This is easily the stingiest made shawarma I've had.   Finally service was pretty bad. They keep trying to pressure you to get the combo which I didn't want"}
{"text":"Who ever owns this franchise has ruined the brand.  I ordered beef kebobs with rice, potatoes, and salad.  The kebobs were reheated and burned.  My husband ordered the chicken skewers.  The meat was reheated and also burned.  There was no flavour to the garlic butter or hummus and the potatoes were over cooked.  There was too much cumin in the bean salad.  It was a horrible experience and no one there to talk to.  If this quality of food continues to be served, this will only turn away customers, and eventually put them out of business.  It's a shame that they didn't care about the quality of the food and focused more on cost cutting measures as they will not have the level of repeat customers as the other vendors in the mall food court."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. The customer service was terrible. Not one person smiled nor acknowledge a friendly welcoming. On top of that there stingy. I ordered a chicken and beef. I got nothing. I could go to a grocery store and get a whole chicken for what I paid for. Don't go here !!! Waste of time and money. The employees need to get laid or something"}
{"text":"This is the best location along with the one at the core.  I always get the chicken shawarma plate so I can't comment on the rest of the menu. The service isn't friendly at any of the locations but the portions and prices make up for it. Would be nice if you didn't have to ask for the pita every time, it's only bread, if you don't want to include it take it off the description."}
{"text":"I bought Shawarma and beef dinner as per all the other comments the guy behind the counter doesn't smile or when greeting customers. I alway get a pita with my meal, this time when I asked I was told a $1 more. Is it like this at all locations or is this guy is just greedy!"}
{"text":"This location seems to have gotten over their growing pains and the food now tastes fresh and delicious! The last time I went in, they made their falafels fresh, and they were delightfully crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I love that they have beets as a salad option.   Service here is incredibly friendly, and I will definitely make this a regular stop from now on, whenever I'm in Southcentre."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service also the salad and meat not fresh  had a tummy ach after eating their food."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Staff is so rude and have no manners how to talk to a customer. We ordered falafal combo( it said 4 falafal with salad, pita and 2 sides), however we were just given 4 falafal with little salad and one tiny side. When I said it says 2 sides, he said rudely salad is considered a side. After I paid, they gave it to us with no pita, so I said it says pita comes in combo, that guy and a lady standing there made weird face, and gave a cold wrapped pita.  I paid $10 for the meal, and the portion was so small. More over falafal was so dry and cold. Never going back to Villa Madina again. Please avoid going here. They don't even deserve 1 star. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"2.5 Villa Madina is a mediocre chain that actually happens to have excellent service at this location. It's a new foodcourt location so it's clean, efficient with excellent service.  They usually fry up falafel fresh although in a rush hour they may have done it in advance- if you want it fresh all you have to do is ask. They have excellent people working behind the counter who are so very friendly, but it doesn't take away that it's a tad overpriced chain- and overpriced BECAUSE it's downtown/financial district.  The food is good, but for a few blocks away and a few dollars less you can get the same thing or even slightly better."}
{"text":"Good overall shawarma. The guy hooked us up with a lot of salads. The shawarma here has authentic taste. Their sauces are really good too. Love tabouli!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the staff seemed like they didn't want to be there. I got a side order of greek salad, and there were no feta cheese at all, and only 3 slices of olives, only after i asked them..."}
{"text":"The shawarma here is pretty good and the salads are OK too; nothing is outstanding, however.    It's irritating that they advertise themselves as \"Mediterranean\", when they serve Middle Eastern food, and adding \"Villa\" to the name only compounds the deception."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the people working at this store is the horrible food and portions they serve. Pathetic customer service, un-eatable food, and expensive prices are what you get. Never will I go to this horrible place again and no one should either."}
{"text":"WOW - I'm stunned! best mediterranean food ever outside of Europe! I found this place in the food court of the Core Shopping Mall. First I was sceptical, since the Thai take away right next to it, was the worst experience ever. However, this place is a real highlight. I had the mediterranean salads with pita. Asked for wholewheat and they even had this option. Perect place, outstanding food and very friendly staff. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very fast-food chain oriented. That being the case, customer service is a plus, you can always call in if you are unsatisfied with your meal. There is absolutely no consistency with their restaurants. Chicken shawarma should be made of chicken breast ONLY, not other parts! At their square one location i found bone in my shawarma!! Prices also differ from location to location. Portion sizes are not so great and chicken along with rice was quite bland compared to other more authentic shawarma joints."}
{"text":"Atrocious service. Got served a plate of shawarma. Didn't even get the peppers onions etc. This particular employee just stood there didn't ask what salad I wanted. Then he said \"choose a drink.\" with the worst attitude possible. Couldn't even say \"Would you like a drink with that?\" As if that wasn't rude enough, this guy throws the drink onto the tray, not once, but TWICE. Because he tried to charge me $2.49 for a CAN of iced tea when the screen said 600ml bottle. I asked why it was $2.49 he said it's the same for everything. Why on earth would I ever pay $2.49 for a can of pop at a food court? These guys think they're running a movie theatre? So I chose a bottle instead and again he tosses it onto the tray. I don't even care what the food tastes like after service like that. NEVER returning to this location again. I will be sure to tell everyone I know not to eat here when at Yorkdale."}
{"text":"This is still one of the better places in the Sherway food court.  Their food is still the same quality in my books and yes I have been going to this place for years as well.  The size of their combo plates is still very generous.    I always get the combo plate which is both beef and chicken shawarma, rice and potatoes, tabouli and all the fixings like radish, pepper, side of pita etc.    This plate makes me full every time and I can eat a lot.  With a drink you're looking at 12 bucks after tax.  It's the most expensive thing on the menu really.  I still get garlic sauce on the potatoes, tahini on the meat and hot sauce on top... they still have the hot sauce....ya they do!  I am a big fan of Lebanese/Mediterranean and this place still is a great amount of good food for a reasonable price.  My plate is ALWAYS loaded and never skimped on ever.    Yes it is a chain but not sure if they're independent or not but the one in Burlington on Appleby line is very similar in consistency so ya things are good all around... still a fan of this place after all this time."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible. The staff are rude when you ask questions about the food. I used to be a regular here but not anymore. The last time i came here I got a chicken and beef shawarma platter. The beef tasted so old and bad. Compared to the villa madina in the sunridge mall, this place is not nearly as good in terms of food and customer service"}
{"text":"I see a lot of mixed reviews for this place, so I'll throw my two cents in.  I've eaten here on my lunch hour.  I typically show up right at noon before they have really dug into their piles of prepped food  I normally have the falafel salad plate which comes with 5-6 pieces of falafel that are a little over-cooked - meaning little moisture.  If you dump them in the hummus and garlic sauce they are fine.  The only thing I would like to see differently if less dressing on the salad.  My salad is often swimming in its container practicing to swim the English Channel  With the new Jimmy the Greek in the same food court having a lot of the same items, I see this as a threat to them and them losing a lot"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Raw meat! Manager was very unkind and not helpful to the situation."}
{"text":"Located in the food court at Scarborough Town Centre.  I appreciate that they offer loads of fresh veggies. Their display is very colorful. Prices are a bit higher compared to some of the surrounding fast food options. I like Villa Madina because it's convenient. When I stay at the apartments right across the mall, this is a nice option to have.   Employees aren't the friendliest, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Villa Madina uses the same space as the Thai express which I eat at frequently. Today I felt like a Greek/Mediterranean salad with chicken and remembered it was there. This place offers up heaping plates of food for the $8-10 mark. Plates consist of rice, salad and potato and your protein as per any prototypical Mediterranean restaurant but all I want is salad and protein (in my mind I think this shouldn't be a problem). Well low and behold if I want a salad and chicken I need to buy the salad package $9 and have to add chicken $3.50. Now I get potato and rice are starches and are much cheaper than fresh greens and their like but why I couldn't have a salad with chicken at the same price point as any of their other dishes was beyond me. They had a 2 skewer meal that was $11. if I had wanted my salad with two skewers I would have had to pay $16. I'm sorry half a salad is not worth the extra $5. When I questioned their logic I am advised  \"in this day and age you always have to pay more\". Thanks but no thanks. I don't know how good/bad their food is but their service sucks"}
{"text":"Been to other Madina's but this one is worst one, in quality of food and service.  I do not recommend to anyone. Big disappointment. This was the closest halal place to my office but I rather travel bit far."}
{"text":"Half of our party had the Thai Express next to this QSR and two of us ordered a couple of dishes from here.   Had a Falafel sandwich and a Falafel plate. The sandwich was ok and the plate a bit better. The sandwich dry and falafels too well done on both the plate and sandwich. One more minute in the fryer and it would have been burned.   The platter came with tabbouleh salad, potatoes and lentil rice. The salad was good, the potatoes well fried but the garlic sauce was a big let down. The potatoes were spiced!  The rice lacked flavour and as mentioned the falafels too well done."}
{"text":"Typical mall food court.  Dried chicken and dry rice waiting to be served beside over cooked potatoes.  Nothing special but weird how the part time workers eye you down as you pass by under the watchful eye if the manager or owner. They must be prompted to call people in"}
{"text":"I've been to many locations and it's probably my favourite mall restaurant franchise but I avoid this location.  Most staff are more interested in yelling out to passing people than serving you. And they're really stingy with their serving size."}
{"text":"When it first opened, I loved this place, the servings were huge, and the staff was nice, but every time I have been, the serving size gets smaller, and the staff ignore you more.  Hopefully someone will buy out the place, it's obvious the current people running it would rather be somewhere else.  New owners might make the serving sizes big again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday, and noticed it was quite busy, so wasn't expecting to be served anytime soon. Others were still waiting for their for about 5-7 minutes later, but of course it is saturday afternoon in the food court at the mall. Close to about 10 minutes, one of the ladies working mentioned they could give me chicken souvlaki since chicken shawarma was not ready. At this point I was pretty hungry and was waiting over 10 minutes, so I said thats fine. Asked for a knife, they don't have any... Alright, shook my head and just took my food to my table. Saw one small piece of chicken, ate it, and it was fine. Tried to cut one big chunk of chicken with my fork, since of course there were no knives..The piece of chicken was raw inside, and I don't mean pink cooked chicken..it was bloody and raw in the middle. I took the food immediately back to them since I was disgusted basically, if I had eaten that piece of chicken without trying to cut it with my fork, I would have probably gotten sick, if not contracted salmonella from ingesting raw chicken. I explain to the ladies that the chicken is pink and raw, and they say oh no chicken is just that colour, its just pink, and I'm like no bring that closer and let me know you, unless you can't see, its RAW..they stop and pause, and I tell them, I basically did not have a knife to even look at the rest, nor did I even want to. The lady then says oh the chicken shawarma is ready..at this point I was furious, they did not even apologize for the error, but then have the audacity to ask if I still want food from their restaurant. I just demanded for a refund, and then left..Was so disappointed and wouldn't want my worst enemy coming here!"}
{"text":"I don't mind stopping by Villa Madina for a quick bite if I'm at the mall. I like to tell myself that their food is healthier than a lot of the other options.  I've gotten the quarter chicken combo and chicken shwarma combo on various occasions. Their combos come with rice, potato, two salads, and a variety of sauces.   I like all the selection Madina offers such as white or brown rice, potato or vegetables, and all the salads such as greek, pasta, tabouli, beet, and broccoli. They also include hummus, a yummy garlic sauce, tahini, and hot sauce in all their meals. I'm kind of a sucker for sauces. I have no complaints about their food. Tastes the way it should. Cooked well.   The girl that usually serves me is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable, which I appreciate. Especially when most people who work at the food court look like they hate their jobs."}
{"text":"I hate to go but halal sign brought me in. The service is horrible, staff is rude and the food is just below average."}
{"text":"i would have given this place maybe 2 stars only if the workers were a bit polite.  no smile no greeting no comments no gesture  NOTHING NADA. how can these people survive in this society?"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the Villa Madina chains at all, they are known for wasting a lot of food, not offering end of day specials when the malls close and resort to dumping food out then jacking up prices for customers. Their food in general is overpriced with small portions that lack flavour, there are local shawarma eateries offering higher quality food for a better price. Local folks are always better to hand your business to than chains."}
{"text":"Really tasty food and friendly service .  I love to  have my  shawarma their specially the chicken one  very  tender  and juicy  , best libanese food I ever eat"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, affordable, and convenient.  Can't beat that combination.  A healthy alternative to fast food and lots of salad options.  Servings are plentiful; personally a fan of the cabbage, couscous, and beans."}
{"text":"I come here to get some good shawarma... And Thats What I get ever time I come here. The food is very fresh and the shawarma is delicious!! Service can sometimes be slow but I don't mind because their very nice people. I think it has the best shawarma in BCC"}
{"text":"It's only good with the hummus, garlic and hot sauce, so always ask for more sauce just for the food to taste marinated and seasoned well."}
{"text":"Very bad place to go eat. Staff is extremely rude and have no respect for customers. Chicken shawarma tasted awful. The worst I ever tried. Very unpleasant experience. Very dry chicken that you will scratch you throat. Portions are very small. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Lots of food for a good price. I usually get the Vegetarian Plate with felafels and I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Villa Madina has a great location but unfortunately their recipes needs improving.  I eat falafels very frequently and the location at Scarborough Town Centre and Eaton Centre have MUCH better recipes than the one here.  I have given them countless chances, but their falafels STILL taste like a hard spicy rock. The salads are alright, but as a vegetarian, falafels are pretty much my ONLY option cause its their only vegetarian dish. They need to get it right.   Sticking with Jimmy the Greek!"}
{"text":"The worst sharwama I've ever had! It doesn't even taste like it. The chicken is super dry like leftover chicken. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Honestly it's a pass on this place. The lentils in the rice were pellets. The chicken was flabby and fatty. The fresh coleslaw was inedible with the over abundance of vinegar. The potatoes were cold and mushy. The falafel being freshly cooked were good. But everything else was garbage. Sorry to say this. But this place is not worth your time"}
{"text":"Let's start with the customer service. I get welcome while the person is faced with their back towards me. Then I go to pay and their tap doesn't work. The chip didn't respond. Then the swipe came back declined. They then accused me of not having money to pay. I told them it was their debt machine. They gave me a look then I insisted to run it again. The chip worked and it went through. No apologies for their behaviour and no thank you. So I go to eat and the beef shawarma is completely burnt (picture will be attached). The rice was over cooked and like mush. I will never eat there again. I usually love this chain but I'll be honest. If the standard is so varied like this I won't rush back to any of these restaurants. In a world filled with Shawarma places I would expect better to keep market share"}
{"text":"Just ordered, potatoes were dry and tasted stale. Chicken shawarma meat was hard, dry, and not up to par."}
{"text":"I generally love Villa Madina anywhere else. But the one in Pickering Town Centre is pathetic. The service is poor, most items are not available and the staff is incompetent and not bothered. I am not going there again. I actually saw other customers turn away as well."}
{"text":"Standard 'mall' fare that you expect from a chain. Food is ok. My gripes are with the portions and the service. Plated portions vary depending on who is serving you at the time. They can be generous or you can get little for your money. Otoh, service is NEVER with a smile.   Food - 3 stars Service - 1 star"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option of putting no stars for this place because, i would. I'm even surprised at the other reviews where people are saying \"this place used to be great/good\". No it has never been good! The employees are horrible, rude & pushy. The food is mediocre. I've grown up with mediterranean & middle eastern food, so i know about the food and how it should taste. The meat is always burnt or overcooked, some of the sides are ok, but they are so pushy with just dumping what the images of the plates look like on the menu board that you don't get a chance to ask about the items or select what you want. The last time i was there i was fed up with the burnt meat and simply asked how long it would take to fire up a fresh skewer (the ones there are swimming in oil and almost black because they've been warmed up so many times on the grill). They said it would take 15 minutes. I ended up waiting almost 40 minutes. The thing that ticked me off the most was, knowing that i had to wait, they plated up the rest of my food and let it sit around and get cold even after i insisted that i wanted to wait until the meat was ready. I have talked to the manager, area supervisor etc., offered free meal and I declined. If you want mediterranean food court food - eat at Jimmy the Greek the food is fresher & tastes better. Save your money and don't eat at this place!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a Shawarma Sandwich with tabouli in it.  And they argued with me.  Couldn't do it.  Had to have the Shawarma plate.  Walked away."}
{"text":"Really tasty food have no complaints.  I love my share of shwarma and this rates right up there."}
{"text":"amazing shawarma sandwich. They offer garlic, humus, tahini n hot sauce. I usually don't get the veggies. But their chicken just tastes soo gooood"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, everything is fresh and tasty! My favorite Villa Medina ! I love their chicken shawarma amd falafel!"}
{"text":"I don't mind them \"harassing people with free chicken samples\" lol. That is what a foodie like me calls heaven when people just come around and offer you free amazing food constantly :)   But I wasn't there for the chicken, oh no no no. I saw the beef shawarma, or shall I say, smelled it from a mile away :) It is a rare luxury to see a fresh..succulent (i feel dirty lol)...beef shawarma grilling...glistening on that hot turning stand lol yeah this is starting to sound a little raunchy, i know! I digress...  I consider this one of the top shawarma joints atleast in North York! I have been to the Yorkdale food court a zillion times and the ingredients & meat are consistently fresh, flavorful, and well-cooked/prepared. Hummus - great! Tahini - yes please :) Garlic...I'm no fan but its better than half the garlic sauces I've tasted in middle eastern joints in Ontario/Quebec. Go get you some beef shawarma soon! You will soon be addicted *evil laugh x 3*  BONUS: That ginormous baklava you see by the cash? Yeah that...it's freeking delicious. Only $2 and some odd change which is a win in my book!"}
{"text":"A new addition to the Fairview food court, this offers up the tired and hungry shopper enough fuel to go back for round 2 shopping.  Their concept is fresh and authentic Mediterranean food.  The meat is literally cooked/carved right in front of you.   A variety of options from salads to rice combos to shawarmas.  All are under $10 and you get a hefty portion.  Today I had the beef schawarma which came with my choice of salads and also potatoes and rice.  The meat was slightly salty but that could have been from the extra tahini and hot sauce that was put on.   The rice was nice and fresh and the salad was overtly dripping in any kind of dressing (personal pet peeve).  Instead of getting Taco Bell or McD's, try this place - you can get healthy and not even know it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Villa Medina, as it looks super busy all the time! I got the Falafel Plate, which included Rice, Potatoes and your choice of salads.   They fry the Falafels on the spot and it was only about a 5 minute wait which was okay. They had a variety of freshly made salads form Chickpea, Pasta Salad as well as Tabuli. I really like their hummus and tahini, and it goes perfect with their crisp Falafels and tasty potatoes! The rice was pretty flavorless but the hummus definitely added a kick! The salads were fresh (Ate one before I could a take a pic). They do get busy so the line does feel a little bit rushed when you are choosing your items but the food is tasty and not bad for the price especially in the food court."}
{"text":"Worst quality of meat goes for Vila Madina!! Worst 17$ I spend EVER!!! Meat does not tase like meat! Chicken shatter in pieces when your fork touch it!"}
{"text":"The statement \"Meh, I've experienced better\" really describes my thoughts on this place. I've been spoiled in that I work across the road from authentic shwarma restaurants and frankly, this place had nothing compared to htem.   It's a fast food restaurant in the basement of Yonge-Eglinton centre so seating etc. really isn't applicable.  I chose to have the chicken shwarma plate and I will give them credit that their shwarma was very moist and the sauce that was added did the trick for flavoring it nicely. The rice was seasoned perfectly and complemented the chicken well. The meal goes down from there. I asked for salad and they had a choice of 5 different options. I opted for a green salad which can be summed up in two words \"plain lettuce\". There was no dressing on the salad (at least none that I could taste) and there was not enough of the sauce on the chicken to move it over to the salad. The other four options did look fancier so I'm thinking I should have tried one of those instead.  The hummus and garlic were very weak tasting and could not overpower the shwarma enough to notice it. Eventually, I did use it to moisten the rice but it didn't really overpower that either. So at this time, I can't tell you how either tasted.  Service was fast and friendly so they do get points for that. They also had a very good selection of drinks.   However, I will not be returning to this place in the near future. I'll stick to authentic shwarma to fulfil my cravings."}
{"text":"Outstanding value. Fresh vegetables. Quick service. Don't worry about the lunch line it moves quickly."}
{"text":"Medina has some great food, however you don't always get it as it is inconsistent.   However you get a great portion for a good price. I almost always get shish touk and it is delicious, and if not that it is at least good.   Remember you get a free pita with every dinner plate you just have to ask!"}
{"text":"Used to go villa madina. But the location at square one gives smaller portions than their other location. The rice was just a quarter of the place. The beef was lightly spread over the rice. But price remains the same. Taste is just ok. Falafel was moist inside. Good crust. Beef shawarma was dry and taste was blend."}
{"text":"I come here once and awhile to get my sharmwa fix. The lady who works there is fabulous. Always gets my order right. Love the food and portions are just right. I wish they had chickpea salad! In the words of Arnold...I will be back! 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I was super impressed by the great service we received, the many many healthy fresh food options at a great price. We decided to split the meat plate (one meat and a choice of 3 or 4 salads). It was more than enough. The young guy who served us could not have been more helpful, friendly or professional! This is my go-toplace at the mall. Can't be beat for fresheness, service or price!"}
{"text":"Xtra $1 for a Falafel, s/w costs $5.79 I guess they prefer to kill the goose that lays the golden egg They prefer it one time, u got it Villa Madina"}
{"text":"Not used to getting good food options in mall food court and this place is one we would go to on a regular basis. We ordered the beef and chicken shawarma but ended up just getting chicken. The chicken was moist and full of flavor, as was everything else it came with - 2 salad selections (we picked Romaine salad and couscous salad), yogurt and hummus dips, rice, and fried potatoes. Food was good, but the service was not. Like I said, we didn't end up getting the mix of meats even after I was asked three times by different people in the process what I ordered."}
{"text":"Wow, the reviews on here are *harsh*. I've gotten food from Villa Madina a few times and while it's never exactly blown me away, I've never been disappointed either.  On this particular visit, I decided to get the Shawarma Plate to go. I was given a lot of different options, but basically I got: potatoes, lentils and rice, coleslaw, pasta salad, hummus, garlic sauce, and beef shawarma.  Though nothing stands out as incredible, every component here was quite tasty. I suppose my one issue would've been with the lentils and rice, as they were heavily spiced with cumin (and I hate cumin) but that's more of a personal thing than a reflection of how it was made.  (And I also suppose that it would've been nice if the shawarma had contained far more of those crispy bits one associates with the dish, as there were only a few mouthfuls that met that criteria.)  It's a little pricey at $12, but then again, I did receive a pretty amazing amount of food."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Sherway in about a year due to all the construction but last Friday my friend and I decided we'd go and check things out.  We had lunch at Villa Madina and, as always, the food does not disappoint.  I had my usual beef shawarma wrap ($5.99) - lots of lean flavourful meat, fresh and generous with the condiments and wrapped nice and tight.  My friend had the falafel wrap and said it was awesome.  The man that served us wasn't too friendly though and he only gave us two really small and thin napkins each.  Like, come on, we're eating shawarmas and falafels - so messy.  Things like that put me off but I guess that's what to be expected from the food court.  I'll write a \"tip\" to BYON (bring your own napkins).  Food = five stars.  Customer service = 2.5 stars.  I'm still giving it four stars though because the food is really good and priced well."}
{"text":"Worse service and food quality even by fast food standards. My shawarma was cold as ice, and they were very stingy with the meat and sauces. My potatoes were barely filled to the rim of the bowl with a tiny dab of sauce on top. Apparently they didn't have any straws, so I had to drink straight out of the paper cup! It was quite a long wait even though we were the only people there. I guess it's becuase the workers spent a lot of the time talking with each rather than actually completing my order."}
{"text":"When a $12 leaves you still feeling hungry then you know you're in a bad spot. That's unfortunate because the one that used to be at the BOW was unreal. These guys are so cheap on their portions. My fault for walking past hungry...Should have kept walking.  The Felafel King and Mazaj never disappoint..."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go at the food court in the CORE shopping mall if you want a shawarma. I got the meal of the day which included rice, salad, hummus, meat and another salad of your choice for $9 dollars. It was a very filling plate for a good price!"}
{"text":"I ordered the #2 entree which comes with beef and chicken shawarma, 2 kinds of salads, pita, rice, hummus and potatoes. All this for $8.99. A little over $10 with taxes.   Now my overall experience is mixed - the food and service is very inconsistent. Tonight's experience is something like this:   First off, the portion was large. My take out box was loaded with meat and both the chicken and the beef were delicious, not dry. However, the potatoes that came with the dish was super dry and lacking in flavour. I took one bite and gave up on the rest.   The hummus was good too -  strong flavour but the pita was non existent (not sure if they missed the pita or if they need to change the menu on the board to).   Then onto the salad - the Greek salad was watery, unfresh / wilted and smelled like socks 0_o while the cabbage salad was crisp and delicious.   Overall I think it's a hit or miss. Today's a miss. Maybe next time my order will come out exactly as I expected and I'll be wowed."}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem to have good reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was my first time eating Villa Madina (Jimmy the Greek and Amaya are my go-to mall foods). I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich. The meat was so tender and delicious, probably the best chicken shawarma meat I've ever had... (and it's from the mall!?!) that's saying something. There seemed to be a lot of options and it was all laid out really nicely in the display.   My only complaints were a) that it was a bit too saucy, and therefore fell apart before I could finish it, b) the service was meh at best, but it's the mall, so what do you expect? and c) the red onions were garnished with the unholy... cilantro."}
{"text":"Villa Madina is in the Yonge Eglinton Centre food court and is what you would expect from a Mediterranean place in a food court - shawarma plate, shawarma pitas, etc.  Like most food court food, it is really not great value.  The shawarma plate for example is $9, but it is actually pretty tasty.  It includes a reasonable amount of chicken, hummus, and garlic sauce, and a small amount each of potatoes, rice, and salad.  Not bad in a pinch."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! I agree with what has been said earlier. There's a guy literally harassing people with his chicken samples. Once I order something, they seem to be annoyed.The girl at the tile seems to hate her life and was acting super rude, throwing napkins at me. They did not offer any sauce at the end and I had to ask for her to add some and she only did it for one box. I just got home and the beef is completely burnt and disgusting ( I can post a picture if anyone is interested). I can't believe you serve that kind of food to your customers!!! It's embarrassing and the manager must not care about his business if he hires people like that. PLUS: they overcharged me!!!  I decided to go to Yorkdale today just for the Lebanese food because I did remember their friendly staff and fresh food in the past. They must have changed owners and I will never ever go there again and  will make sure to spread the word so no one goes there again!"}
{"text":"The food there is okay, but it seems that all the Villa Madinas are hiring the worst staff to work there. My boyfriend went to order the food and was told they only accepted cash... Couldn't they say that before we ordered, or put a sign on? Who doesn't accept debit/credit cards at a business located in a mall? The two stars are only for the food. Rude service!"}
{"text":"We went to the Sherway mall today as a family . We decided to try shaorma and it was our fist and last time to eat at that place . Service was horrible they were inpatient and rude. When it came time to the drinks they didn't have any fountain drinks that they advertised , but noted by $2 each we could get the drinks we wanted in the bottle ."}
{"text":"I've been coming for years to this location. However the quality and size of serving has been decreasing. Upon my visit today I noticed the cashier was so slow and busy doing other things while my food was running cold. The staff needs to be managed by someone or they'll run the place down. The quality which makes the food worth the money is why I give this place 2 stars!"}
{"text":"I ate here once before, years ago, so I tried it again.  Now I remembered why I didn't come back.  I am not sure why they call it chicken shawarma, it was just boiled chicken breast.  No taste at all.  Consider how expensive it is, plus the staff that never smile at all and you have the winning formula for a disappointing meal.  If only there's Osmow's or Lazeez nearby, this fast food will close down in no time at all."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy, fresh, and quick service for shawarma plates and alike at a fair price point in comparison to some of the other fast food service locations around the area. I got the chicken shawarma with two salads which tasted quite delicious! Salad was fresh, chicken had flavour, and topping it with their tahini and hot sauce blended everything together nicely. I'll come back to try out their falafels which look great!"}
{"text":"Good fast lunch spot in the financial district. This location is well lit, clean, with plenty of seating. Cafeteria layout for the toppings, from different rices, vegetables, and salad options. There's no bad combination lol.   I normally get the chicken shawarma plate. Good portion cut straight from the spit. Not overly seasoned, making it edible as a plate option. Get the hot sauce with the tzatziki.   For a Mediterranean chain the food is good, and for the area gets the job done. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Warning warning warning: This place was CLOSED (Red Card) By the City of Toronto July 9 for an insect infestation, then tried to hide the notice!  Avoid."}
{"text":"I really like the owner and manager, he's very friendly and cordial.  I've been coming here for years, and love their dinner plates. It's a big portion and it's absolutely delicious, come with an appetite.   The reason I'm giving this 3 stars, is because on my last visit (yesterday), after almost a year of not eating here, I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap. Huge mistake. First bite and immediately felt the lukewarm almost cold chicken meat. I thought to myself, maybe it's because it's the end of the wrap and the heat didn't really distribute evenly when they put it under the panini metal plates, I'm sure the center will be nice and warm... Wrong again. Second bite, I bit into coldish pieces of gelatinous texture, cold, goosebumpy, pale and fatty chicken skin and pieces of fat. Not good. Trying again to stay positive, I thought it was just an odd piece I got. I tried a third bite. Nope, it was so bad, I couldn't eat it. I decided to empty the contents of my pita wrap (sans chicken fat) onto ny napkin and was left with one small piece of chicken. This was so sad... I basically ate tabbouleh, onions, tatziki, hummus, tomatoes and lettuce, because the chicken pieces were nauseating. I guess I wanted to cheat my diet, the joke was on me because I  skipped the pita and the chicken and fat.   Not sure what happened in that year, the owner is still an awesome person. And if I went back i'll probably stay away from the chicken and just get the dinner platter. I really, really hope this was a one time occurrence and I just really got unlucky."}
{"text":"I personally was not a fan of this place. I ordered the chicken shawarma and was not impressed. It was soggy and thrown together. I also got a side of vegetables and they were tasteless. I understand it is food court food but I had a excellent chicken shawarma in Market Mall last week, I believe it was called Cedar Cafe? I could be wrong, but the price was the same and there quality much better. I would not go to Villa Madina again with so many unique options in this food court."}
{"text":"Their falafels are salty and dry.  Their coleslaw has no dressing to it its just dry you need flavour.  I've tried the chicken skewers and their potatoes not too bad.  They charge a lot for your food too expensive for not so good food.   I've tried the Villa Madina at Square One AMAZING!  That place is a must try.  Their coleslaw has moist to it, dressing is so delicious. Their potatoes are actually better  and so is their chicken skewers more flavour than the ones at Yorkdale.  I give Villa Madina Square One a 5 star!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Food is so delicious their potatoes omg so good their chicken skewers have a bit of a spice to them which makes it taste so good and they are cooked to perfection.  Their coleslaw omg so good. I look forward to eating here!"}
{"text":"I feel extremely ripped off.  I paid for a 2 kaftas combo (#6), paid $10.50 and took it to go back to the office after a dentist appointment at Yonge/Eglinton.  I get back to the office (Yonge/Finch) to have my lunch only to find that the 2 kaftas are missing.  WTF!!! Then I find their phone number (416.544.1212) on the website and it's not in service.  WTF!!! I sent their head office a complaint.  Let's see if they reply. Too bad Yelp doesn't allow zero stars."}
{"text":"I was in a rush to get some food and I wasn't feeling a cold salad for today's rainy day.  I headed over to this plaza and was faced with a few ho-hum choices.  Mr Sub (blah), El Sombrero (should have done this), Thai Express, Villa Madina, and Panago (should have done this as well).  My tasty pita from Pita Nutso made me crave a good shwarma pita and after this experience here at Villa Madina, it made me crave Pita Nutso.  This chain did not excite my taste buds.  If anything, I think they're protesting.  The restaurant is shared with Thai Express and Thai Express is ALWAYS busy.  Their line up is so long (especially on Friday lunch) and I never have the patience for it.  The space itself is quite large.  Since it's ridiculously busy, it's hard to find a clean table during lunch.  Actually, it's hard to find a table during lunch!  It is a modern space and there is a fair number of tables but just not enough for the large amount of corporate centres here.    For a Thursday, the line up was fairly long but not as bad as Thai Express.  It moved at a half decent rate.  I ordered a chicken pita and was hoping for something that was similar to my experience at Pita Nutso.  What I got was far from it... it was filled with tons of filler and the tiniest portions of chicken.  The chicken was dry-ish and not flavoured.  Considering it sat in the rotisserie for a while, it should have developed some nice charred bits but nope... it was chewy, under flavoured, and dry all at the same time.  The hot sauce made it edible.  The lettuce pieces in the pita was dried out as well as you can see the edges looking all white.    Considering the Pita Nutso place is only less than a 10 minute drive, I'm willing to head over there when I'm not in a rush.  If I'm pressed for time, I'm trying Panago or El Sombrero next time as this place was just lacking any taste."}
{"text":"ordered beef & chicken shwarma with yellow rice and everything else i could add. also got the falafel.  everything was decent. but the beef was kinda dry and jerky-like. i think i would've enjoyed it much more if the beef was juicier. also not a fan of the falafel, without the tahini? sauce, i probably would not have been able to finish it."}
{"text":"So much better than Mr Greek and all the other Greek food court type places. Love their generous portions, delicios accompaniments and grilled chicken plates"}
{"text":"Worst place for quick Mediterranean  food. Staff is rude and judgmental. Portions are small. Falafel is dry. Salad is soggy. I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I usually buy food here every time I go to BCC. The staff is great, but sometimes can be a bit slow. The food is delicious though, and the food portions are great!"}
{"text":"This one is located in the Square One Shopping Mall food court. It has been here for quite some time. When I first used to come to this location, the food was exceptional and the portions were just right. Now, it has slid down in service and portions. I don't know why they do this and why they can't be consistent with their services. I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and was so disappointed that when I saw them making it, I wanted to tell them to keep it and forget my order. The way they put the garlic sauce and hummus is with the back part of a teaspoon and spread it on the pita. How much would the back part of a teaspoon be? Nothing! You can barely see it let alone taste it. What's really the point. They count the potatoes when they give them to you on the side to a point where I saw the guy put a potato back when he realized he gave ONE too many. REALLY?? Is that how you run a business? I mean, before, which is a couple years ago, they didn't seem to care like that. Now, it has gone down. And I would not be surprised if they raise their prices. For what you pay and what you end up getting, it is NOT worth the wait in line. This location has lost its service."}
{"text":"You will find all the typical Lebanese dishes at this fast food emporium located in the Les Cours Mont-Royal building in the food court underground. I won't lie this is some of the best Lebanese fare in the city but the sodium content in certain dishes is through the roof even in some of the vegetarian items. It is safer to stick with some of the salads if sodium is a concern but even there you have to watch it carefully. You can go to their website and pull up there nutritional guide and make a more practical health conscious decision when deciding to dine there."}
{"text":"There is a Villa Madina in the Scotia plaza food court which is around 10 mins walk from my office. I usually go there for lunch when I am starving or in other words,very very hungry. The quantity of food is definitely worth the money. I always take the chicken shawarma plate with brown rice. The plate consists of brown rice,potatoes,lots of chicken and variety of salads to choose from.You can even get all types of salad and  it is included in the price. One great thing is that they give a lot of chicken and not just put a little on the top.This plate costs 10 bucks and makes me content. Talking of taste,it is very good too although the potatoes are deep fried ,hence not very healthy. I generally refrain getting a lot of those."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about! tasteless fast food quality, some items are there for days until it's sold or tossed out. The grilled items are pre-cooked already, so the taste and freshness are not there! There are better options at the food court or the mall"}
{"text":"Just went came back from lunch.  The worst food I've had at Yorkdale.  I've been going there since it opened and it was always good.  Today, it tasted like left overs heated up.  Maybe it's a Sunday thing.  The chicken skewers were like shoe leather,  the rice was overly salted and Falafel was god awful (cold and hard).  Too bad.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good fresh food from a food court restaurant. The falafel was cooked fresh and the tabouli and lettuce salad was quite good. I had to ask for the pita,turnips and peppers though."}
{"text":"The place wasn't too bad. Not the best Mediterranean food I've had, but my expectations weren't high neither.  Villa Madina is located in the food court of the Yorkdale Mall in Toronto, Canada. It was a better alternative to the usual pizza, fried chicken or five Asian spots to choose from in mall food courts.    The salad was fresh, and the chicken was tasty.  However, the falafel tasted as it had been left out for a day or two, (too dry) for my liking.   But again, I'm having dinner at a Mall food court. So I am not going to compare this the a classic sit down Mediterranean restaurant I am use to."}
{"text":"Best Villa Madina in Montreal for sure"}
{"text":"Ate here the other day. I used to love Villa Madina, most locations were consistent and this one used to be a weekly staple.  Prices have gone up over the last two years, which is fine because I felt they were underpriced to begin with. Food quality is still fresh and good, although the meat quantity could be better.   The reason I rated them3 stars is the change in some of their staples, mainly the tabouli salad. The recipe or how it's made has been changed. I noticed this at another Madina recently in Milton.  Please go back to the root of what you guys are good at. Fresh, quality, plentiful affordable food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Friday evening and was not impressed - this place seems to have really gone down since Paramount opened close by.  I expect middle eastern food to be fresh - this is what makes it special and very popular.  Instead of cutting some fresh chicken off the rack they serve me little bits and pieces that have been sitting for who knows how long.  This small sad portion of chicken is unacceptable.  Also the porcini peppers were dried out and tasteless along with the turnips.  I'm sorry I chose them for dinner and will avoid the next time I'm at the mall."}
{"text":"Haha my bad! The place I'm talking about in Scotia Centre is called Feta Olives. It's the other one that's in the 4th level of TD Square Mall."}
{"text":"While shopping today at Yorkdale Mall we decided to stop for lunch at the Villa Madina in the food court. We ordered two falafel sandwiches and when asked what we wanted like to drink we asked for two glasses of tap water.   The young man behind the counter told me the water was broken. I asked him if that was so, how did they clean their hands. He told me that his manager, who was standing right beside, him told him to say this. Needless, to say we were a little shocked and surprised. If it was true that the water was broken, then the staff should not be allowed to serve the public, following simple public health rules.  Our guess was that the manager did not want to serve us tap water, encouraging us to buy a bottle of water. We were dismayed and sat down and had our lunch. We were however, given glasses of tap water after we asked by a competitor.   While watching the counter we were surprised a couple of minutes later to see a young woman being served the very tap water we had asked for. When we asked what happened we were told the water had been miraculously fixed in the space of five minutes. The experience left us disappointed not only with the franchise in question but also with the Villa Madina name. I guess the lesson is never to expect even basic customer service from a food court counter."}
{"text":"I decided to give Villa Madina a try at newly-renovated Calgary Eaton Centre food court.  What caught my eye was the $5.99 lunch special.  It was the Shishtawouk Plate Special - that's the chicken.  It was a huge plate consisting of rice with mixed vegetables, lettuce, coleslaw, chicken, hummus, tahihi, pickled plump light green pepper, pita bread, hot sauce, beets, pickles.  It sure was difficult to eat as I had to dig into my food and look for something I recognize.  But I must say, there's a TON of food!  Good deal for a good price.    It was certainly strange as well to see Oriental people serving Middle Eastern food!"}
{"text":"I wanted some healthy and fresh and opted for Villa Madina instead of paramount. Big mistake. The tabbouleh was full of vinegar I could barely eat it. The falafels were so dry, cold and hard that I literally drank a while bottle of water to push down the two falafels I ate (I threw out the other two). The cabbage salad was ok I would not eat here again. The only saving grace is that the staff was friendly and the potatoes were ok"}
{"text":"Really bad, I dont recommend this place. Their chicken shawarma was left over from the day before. Smelled horrible!!"}
{"text":"Homemade Falafel and it's as good as it gets for Pickering!! They are a family operated business and this is why they care so much!   If you are looking for fresh food: I'd suggest giving the people at Villa Madina a try! Falafel Wrap on whole wheat is just $5.00!!   Thanks again guys! This review is the least i can do given how many times you've gotten up in the early morning just to start prepping for us foodies!   Much Love!"}
{"text":"Is it just me, or have the prices gone up and the serving sizes gone down? I'd be ok with one or the other, but both...not so sure about.  Can anyone confirm this?"}
{"text":"Horrible. It WAS amazing when the old girls worked here. Won't be surprised if this place closes down in the next couple months."}
