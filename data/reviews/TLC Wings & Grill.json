{"text":"Love their Garlic Parm wings!! They're my favorite!!We've also ordered the pizza and fries and everything has always been delicious."}
{"text":"I reviewed TLC back in Feb., and you can read that one for yourself. I complained about the attitude and attention given the customers which was so bad I didn't want to go back. If I can speak plainly about their faults, then when they do good, I feel it should be noted as well. I've been several times now here in Sep. and Oct., and the teenagers are gone. There's an adult running the kitchen now, and a mature, helpful person on the register, and I'd like to think my earlier review had something to do with making these changes. The wings are still the best around, and now its a treat to go in and pick up some delicious wings (which are done when promised), and promptly be served, waited on, and out the door in a hurry. I don't try many flavors because the terriaki is just the BOSS, but my wife likes the honey BBQ, and I'm sure the rest are equally good. The problems seem to be worked out on the service, and their wings were always the best, so I can recommend that you even go out of your way to try the wings at TLC, and feel confident in saying you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Service was good and fast! Food is great! So many flavors of wing sauce to chose from... We got Jerk, X Hot & Spicy Parmesan, can't wait to go back and try more flavors! Seasoned fries were on point but I was taken back by the side Greek salad! It was bigger than I expected with the right amount of everything! I loved it.."}
{"text":"We ordered 75 wings for the game, 25 XHot and the rest Hot.  I had a work training and wasn't able to eat the wings until a few hours after they were picked up, but even in that sad and slightly dried up state the XHot wings were delicious!   Definitely hot enough for someone who really likes spiciness. All of our guests raved about them as well.  I would definitely recommend TLC for their awesome wings!"}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to order online and never try. But the pizza and wings are a great combo and very good!!! Delivery is quick and we use them a lot for pizza night!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!! I  referred a group of my co workers to try TLC for our lunch break being from Upstate NY I love TLC wings and I feel like they remind of the part of New York that I am missing... when I called to place a nice sized order for delivery I was instantly greeted with horrible customer service still wanting to place the order.. I was bluntly placed on hold and was under the impression they did not want to take my order for delivery asking questions with  attitudes and frustrations  ... Asking to speaking   with a manger after the conversation with the employee the manger did not show any sympathy and canceled the order... It really is disappointing because I talked so highly of the business and every time my family  comes from New York we eat at TLC... sorry but they will never  get any of my money and those honey hot wings be so good....  I am so disappointed I never write reviews... but I have referred so many people to you guys... treat your loyal  customers the right way ... now  my employees never want to order there as well.... Guess we will try another wing spot.....I am sure the owner does not operate his business like this...."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from this place for years. The wings are always on the spot but the other menu items are not really what you can say getting your money's worth. The salads use to be really good but now you pay around $10.00 for a tray of iceburg lettuce with hardly any toppings, your lucky to get two small slices of tomatoes, two slices of cucumbers, I ordered a chicken salad and it probably has one small tender on top that is sliced thin. Oh and make sure you order extra ranch because it only comes with a 2oz dressing, not even enough to disperse on your salad. The service has really went downhill in the past few years and this use to be our go to spot for lunch. :("}
{"text":"This is my favorite Wing place, whether I go in person or have my food delivered. The owners are nice and so are those they have working with them. Even when they have forgotten something on my order during a delivery, they made sure to bring it back promptly. I think they are very accommodating."}
{"text":"I had the garlic parmesan wings and they were really good. The service was great and quick, I was recommended this place and will recommend to someone else. I'm looking forward to trying their other wing flavors."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte...hands down. Sparky delight sprinkled with a little lemon pepper it's love in your mouth. They're opening one on freedom drive in Charlotte NC as well. Check em' out...great wings and great prices!"}
{"text":"Great food. Got the wings and shrimp. The wings were still crispy even after being doused in sauce, I usually dont eat the skin but I ate most of it. The shrimp had just enough flavoring and the fact that you even get an option at no extra cost was nice. We'll be ordering here again!"}
{"text":"I work close by and come here often. The food is alway fresh. They drop the wings as soon as you order. My food is always burning hot when I get it. They don't skimp on the sauce and ranch. The prices are very reasonable. Nice little hole in the wall"}
{"text":"These wings are simply amazing! I've had about 5 differ t flavors so far and they each are superb! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly! Store is clean!  Service was fast! I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Crispy fries and crispy wings, well done TLC, I will see you again during football season.  Friendly family service and the wings and fries were actually crispy.  Thank you and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Ok so to be honest this was my first time eating from here because from the outside it doesn't look like a place I want to eat. After seeing such a professional website I decided to give it try. I tried to call to place my order at 1:15 and no one answered, so I ordered online at around 1:25pm and it alerted me that the order wouldn't be ready until 2:17 pm. I've worked in a place that served wings and I know they take less than 15 minutes to cook wings, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was a late lunch rush or something. When I arrived at 2:14 pm to pick the food up, the lady who worked there was sweeping and took a while to acknowledge me. It seemed like she was confused as to why someone was inside of this place and then asked why I was there. To which I told her about my online order. Mind you, I am the only person in this place and no one was in the kitchen. Just she and I. It didn't seem like there was a lot going on so it was funny that she had to ask about it and go \"check on it\" which apparently meant she had to go out back and tell the cook to come in and finish my order. So I'm guessing maybe that's why there was almost an hour wait for 10 wings. Didn't see him wash his hands, but who knows. In my combo I also get a drink which I wasn't given. I think they were hoping I would leave, but after asking if I got a drink she replied \"yep.\" I initially didn't see bad reviews of the food which is why I tried it , but after closer inspection I see other people have had similar experiences with service here. Your food is good, your website is great, your staff needs much improvement and help with customer service. The two stars are for the quality of the food only because the wings were delicious."}
{"text":"Someone told my wife to grab some Cajun ranch wings on the way home and let's just say I am one happy husband!! They are sooooo good. The wings are a great size, they are fried to perfection and the Cajun ranch sauce is to die for. Top 3 wings I've had in Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in Charlotte so far! Cajun Ranch is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"It's very simple. These are \"some\" of the best chicken wings around. I said \"some\" since I have not tasted a large number of establishments that serve them. I'm selective when it comes to wing sauce, and favor the vinegar based \" tangy\" sauces. TLC's \"Red Tang\"sauce it my favorite. Just the right amount of heat for me. For those of you who love to show off how hot you can stand it, there is a hotter sauce. I know this because it's called \"X-tra\" hot.  The inside of the restaurant is small and basic. The young lady who runs the register is very congenial and is quick to tell repeat customers how much she appreciates them. I order all \"drummies\" and the amount of meat on each one of those is more than just about any other wing place that I've tried, however \"Sticky Fingers\" (Ballantyne) has the same amount of meat as \"TLC\"."}
{"text":"We ordered the wings which are perfection, the honey teriyaki is great... Well all the wing sauces that we had were good (honey mustard, honey teriyaki, spicy honey mustard, and mild)! Please try the buffalo shrimp! YUM! We also had the bacon cheeseburger it was great wasn't dry at all. The delivery time was the icing on the cake I was told delivery would take a hour when I placed the order however I heard a knock on my door at 25 minutes after my delivery order was placed! I'll definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I love these wings!!!  There are so many flavors here....and I've enjoyed a lot of them...like, Hot, Barbecue, Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Spicy Garlic Parmesan and I have not been disappointed yet!   Each wing is juicy and full of flavor, they are always hot and made to order ..SOOOO amazing!   Yes...they have more than just wings....like pizza, subs and fries...but I've only had the wings AND trust me YOU are going to want to try these wings...again and again!!!  In my opinion, these are the best wings in town!"}
{"text":"The people here are very nice. Took my order quickly. I ordered garlic Parmesan wings and buffalo shrimp. Both were prepared quickly and tasted very good! Shrimp were sizable and the wings had crispy skin. I went on a Sunday and the place was very clean. I will be going back!!"}
{"text":"Favorite wing joint. I had the lemon pepper, honey hot (my fave), and the jerk flavors. I LOVED the jerk, also liked the lemon pepper, and as I previously mentioned, the honey hot flavor is just awesome. I can eat wings from here on a daily basis. The service was much better this time around as well. High praise, TLC!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing wings I took my Grandson and Husband and I didn't want any because I don't like wings but I tasted the wings and ordered some to-go my favorite sauce it buffalo mild at first they did look a little burnt but the weren't at all the were very delicious. The bathrooms are very clean and the place itself is very nice. The service is very quick too. Recommended very highly."}
{"text":"Stopped unexpectedly for dinner. Have driven past this place so many times and even planned to come in. Well I am glad I finally did. Got wings and pizza combo with the red tang (bbq and buffalo combined), lemon pepper, hot ranch, and honey bbq sauces and my goodness definitely some of the best wings in Charlotte nestled in my neighborhood. Super simple and comfy environment for family and quick dinner. Food was hot and fast and the staff was extremely accommodating and kind."}
{"text":"Very nice employees. My wings came out before I could think of what to write in the review. I'd say under three mins. Much better than wild wing cafe (if you can even find a parking spot close to the building)"}
{"text":"Our office recently placed an order from TLC Wings & Grill.  While they have a huge selection of wings and sauces,  I wasn't really in the mood for chicken wings.  Instead, I opted for the Chicken Parmesan sub ($5.29) with a side order of fries ($1.89).  The chicken parm sub wasn't the smartest  choice for a take-out -- by the time the food arrived, the sauce had sort of soaked into the bread and made it a bit squishy.   However, the flavor was very good and the portion size was huge (thankfully it was already cut in 2 - definitely enough for 2 meals!)  The fries were good, and they were very generous with the portion size of that as well.   I would definitely order this again, but probably not for take-out.   I would also recommend giving these guys a try if you are looking for good quality wings & fries at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"TLC has got to be in consideration for the top 3 wing spots in Charlotte. It's a small family run establishment that never disappoints.   I always order the 15 piece combo which comes with a side and a drink. There is a good mix of spicy, sweet, and inventive sauces for your wings and the wings are always the perfect combination of juicy with a firm and slightly crispy exterior. Most wing places that do take out usually leave you with soggy wings by the end of your commute but TLC stays crisp.  It's a little out of the way if you don't live in Pineville, but I'll gladly go out of my way for the quality."}
{"text":"ahhh fantastic place, perfect win, I called in for a to go order for a large cheese pizza and 20 wings. It was good. Pizza was very soft and had lots of cheese on it. My only request is that I wish it had more pizza sauce on it.  Wings were delicious. We got spicy garlic parm and hot buffalo. Garlic parm was crispy and the hot buffalo were spicy but not too spicy. Ranch and blue cheese paired well with it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great little spot for wings in the south side of town. A lot of to go orders ~ the place is nice - bus station like booths and a TV to watch while you munch on their delicious wings. Haven't tried the pizza yet ...  The wings are good and reasonably priced. Lots of flàvors to choose from."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the wings are very good to me. I typically only get lemon pepper but they're always good and extra crispy! HOWEVER the customer service is terrible (front desk blonde girl). So I called and ordered a veggie burger. First off I ask for my tomatoes on the side. She proceeds to say \"well the tomato won't even be touching the bread but okay\" the \"but okay\" is rude and sarcastic and how am I supposed to know how you lay your toppings on the sandwich ?!?! I order the food pick it up go home and try to eat the food. The veggie burger was burnt to a crisp tasted like burnt charcoal. DISGUSTING!! I call in and the lady (blonde chick) is super rude doesn't apologize at all or offer any alternatives. I had something to do afterwards so I couldn't go back to get a new one made and ANYWAYS why did I get a burnt one in the first place?!?! Def not going back get better customer service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the same. Was my favorite wing place. New workers please call the old workers and ask how they did their wings. Please... my boys didn't finish their food"}
{"text":"Wings were overcooked which means dry and had very little sauce on them. They also had a \"fishy\" taste to them so it was probably the same oil they use to cook shrimp in. The buffalo chicken salad was decent and they have good homemade ranch. We ordered a side of french fries with wings and they were also overcooked."}
{"text":"my experience with the tlc establishment was great! i had 2 days to place a large order for my office party this past thursday & from the time i spoke with manager mustafa everything ran so smoothly. i found out they offered over 40 flavors, and this being our first time ordering mustafa took out the time to let us know of their biggest sellers & must have flavors!! even on the morning of our delivery i had to call mustafa on his cell phone early in the morning to place an order for additional wings, although he wasn't at work yet he took my order and assured me everything would still be delivered between 11-1130am and it was!! mustafa has exceptional customer service skills and the wings was a hit at the office party! because of the awesome service we're looking forward to the next event and doing business with tlc chicken!!"}
{"text":"I was craving some wings all Day Wednesday and had missed the all you can eat special at Quaker Steak & Lube by a day.  I relayed my need for wings and a friend of mine told me about this place and since it was close to where I needed to be decided to check them out.  I purchased 20 wings (half honey bbq and half honey teriyaki) and while the honey bbq were good, the honey teriyaki were PHENOMENAL....they were soooo good that I actually went back the next night to get an order of 25 so I'd have some leftover....So glad I found this little spot and will definitely be my go to especially since THEY DELIVERY to my complex....WOOHOO!!!"}
{"text":"This probably my favorite wing spot in Charlotte. The lunch menu is awesome. You get combo with drink and fries. They are very generous with fries, one batch could feed 2. The wing flavors are very flavorful and wings cooked perfect  I've tried almost all the flavors on menu. I still need to try out their pizza. Oh btw The Buffalo chicken salad taste so good !!"}
{"text":"No frills joint with great food. They have quite a few sauces that you can mix and match. Honey hot wings for the win."}
{"text":"saw that this place delivered so I gave it a shot and I'm so glad I did! Will definitely be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"I first ate at TLC when then first opened. They were outstanding with great sauces. And their Onion Ring we're the best. Then they changed owners, twice, and I never went back. Moved and returned. First time back after about 4-5 years. Glad I did. Wings crispy and great flavors. The fries were also good and crispy, as I like. Wait time similar to Chick-fil-A. Which tells me that they precook everything. Still very good and it was lunch hour so they may just prep well. I will be back. And I live in Matthews."}
{"text":"Wings are good, really like the extra hot and the hot ranch. But the pizza, not so much. Ordered a sausage pizza and when we opened it up it looked like cut up beef hot dogs or cut up smoked sausage on top like the went next door and grabbed a pack from the grocery store to put on top. Very disappointed, ended up throwing it away, very doughy as well. Stick to the wings for sure"}
{"text":"The wings are absolutely amazing!  Since moving from Houston almost a year ago; I have been looking for a new wing spot!  I think that I have found it!  Great flavors, fresh wings and good service!  You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Wings themselves were meaty and cooked well, however, they put way too much sauce on the wings. I am a huge sauce person but there was so much that it was overpowering. I dabbed a lot off and they were fine. Next time I'll ask for lighter sauce."}
{"text":"Wow! Came due to high reviews. Don't let outside appearance deter you! These are the best wings I have had in Charlotte. The woman working the register was also very nice."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave no stars... to add onto Netake A comment. I was included in the group of people that ordered the burnt fried pickles and buffalo shrimp. The buffalo shrimp were burnt and the sauce greasy. It was terrible. As stated we spent $50 and couldn't even eat the food. I want a refund...we were so disappointed. This was my first and last time eating and this dump. Negative 15 stars. Calling themselves TLC wings. More like death row wings."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  The staff is about as unprofessional as it gets.  I would recommend ordering to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! They use fresh ingredients, amazing wing sauces and I am very picky about wings and the pizza is equally as delicious. The fact they deliver is also a huge perk. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Solid wings. Solid food. A place to go to that's off the beaten path. Also a decent price as well."}
{"text":"Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime loyal customer of this place (2005). My husband and I just called to order delivery and the girl that answered the phone hung up on him. When I called back she told me \"that wasn't me, it must've somebody else. \" When I spoke to the \"manager\" he said they weren't delivering tonight.  On Super Bowl Sunday.  A wing place.  Not delivering.  Ok. I don't need to spend my money there."}
{"text":"This is a nice little counter joint.  Prices were great and food smells wonderful.  The shopping center looks disgusting but this place was clean and the staff was very friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times I do enjoy the honey hot wings the barbecue wings are also good I love that every time I order wings here they are hot and crispy I'm not crazy about the fries here and the inside could be a little bit cleaner for me personally"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with TLC Wings customer service.   I called Saturday to pre order wings for Father's Day, the person on the phone took the order with my name and phone number and I said I would pick it up at 11:30 am Sunday.   The guy didn't tell me they are not open Sunday at 11:30 am.  I went to the store this morning at 11:33 am.  No one was ever there prepping food. This is simply bad customer service."}
{"text":"Delivery was good for a salad but for everything else I was sadly disappointed. My service from the past like 2 years ago has not been the same I miss how the old workers were nice and friendly with great service ... PLEASE COME BACK !!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite wing place.  The owners are really nice and they are very accomodating if you have any special instructions for your wings.  Lots of flavor combinations.  This is a place where you want to place your order to go.   I suggest the Red Tang flavor.  Yum !!  They are also now doing Pizza although I've never tried it.  http://tlcwingsandgrill.com/"}
{"text":"I've ordered twice and the first time they allowed me to order under $20 and receive delivery. The second time I ordered they said it was a minimum $20 delivery but when my neighbor ordered under $20 right before i called with no problem. Very unsatisfactory seeing as I'm within 5 miles from their location ."}
{"text":"Love the wings, love the buffo shrimp and love the pizza! I haven't been disappointed yet by TLC but the real kicker and reason I am giving them 5 stars is because they deliver! Love to see a smaller restaurant like this deliver and I'm going to be honest they have the BEST buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had. That chicken is soooooo much better than any other pizza chain I have tried before! Highly recommend to anyone if you are craving some pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"I called in for a to go order for a large cheese pizza and 20 wings. It was good. Pizza was very soft and had lots of cheese on it. My only request is that I wish it had more pizza sauce on it.  Wings were delicious. We got spicy garlic parm and hot buffalo. Garlic parm was crispy and the hot buffalo were spicy but not too spicy. Ranch and blue cheese paired well with it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The wings here are fantastic! They are big, juicy and full of flavor. They have the best hot honey wings and the jerk wings are seasoned perfectly. If you're looking for great wings at a great price, you need to check this joint out. Would have given 5 stars if they served cold beer there, but you can't win them all. Pizza here is good too, but I'm all about the wings, and these are top notch."}
{"text":"Super friendly and fast.  I tried the honey hot, medium and spicy Parmesan wings.  My favorite of the three were the honey hot.  The ranch was really good as well.  My pet peeve is when wing places do not make their own so I was happy that this place me their own."}
{"text":"after browsing through yelp in my wing search I came across this place. It's a small restaurant located in a shopping center. I decided to try wings because of all the good reviews. The wings were a very nice size which I loved but the sauces I tried weren't as good as I thought. We got 20 wings with 4 different flavors. Hot, honey BBQ, garlic Parmesan, spicy garlic Parmesan. The number one was honey BBQ off the gate!!! The service was good and it was not a wait. I'll definitely be back to try more flavors and hopefully I'll get better flavors. I'll update my review then. Until next time."}
{"text":"TLC wings is in the cut and most people probably don't even know that they are there.  For starters, I should warn you that I am not a huge wing person.   However, TLC has definitely changed my affiliation with wings.  I normally get their honey bbq wings and the wings are cooked and sauced to perfection.  Any time I have the taste for wings...this is my go to spot.  I've tried other wings in the area, but nothing comes closer."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at TLC Wings! We got the wings combo which is your choice of number of wings and then fries and a drink. The fries were SO good, crispy and seasoned and a big portion! I am always curious about how many sauces you can try on your set of wings and they are not a place where it is simple for example, \"5 wings to one flavor wing sauce\". Here's a small breakdown:  -5 or 7 piece wings get one dipping sauce (ranch or blue cheese) and one sauce on the wings -10 piece wings you get one dipping sauce and choice of two flavors -15 or 20 piece wings you get two dipping sauces and choice of two flavors  -25 piece wings you get two dipping sauces and choice of three wing flavors  -30 piece wings you get three dipping sauces and choice of 3 wing flavors   And it actually goes up to sets of 40,50,75 and 100. If you want an extra ranch, you gotta pay for it, probably because it's that good thick ranch!   Then you can choose how you want your wings cooked we went for Extra Crispy, 15 wings combo with two ranches and hot honey and spicy garlic Parmesan. The food came out FAST and hot! We liked the hot honey a lot more than the spicy garlic parmesan. Both were very crispy as they promised! To sum it up, I would come back to try more flavor of wings and they actually have a whole second menu filled with pizza, tenders, sandwiches and salad."}
{"text":"I had lunch at TLC Wings on a Saturday about 1 pm.  There was only one other person inside when I came in.  I ordered 10 wings, hot, and a basket of fries.  I got my drink and sat down to wait for my food.  They had a football game on the flat screen TV.   It took about 20 minutes to get my food.  The sauce on the wings was very good, typical Buffalo style sauce.  The wings themselves were a little over cooked, but still OK.  The fries were good, but they put a seasoned salt on which I would have them leave off next time.  Overall this is a nice place and I would have given a more stars, but a 20 minute wait for 10 wings and fries is ridiculous.  My recommendation, skip eating in here and order your wings to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food I will give them that, but the customer service on every occasion that I have had it has been horrible. There is a young lady that answers the phone and takes the orders every time I'm there and she is very unpleasant. This is there only downfall as she is the first person you come into contact with when calling or entering to place your order."}
{"text":"I used to love this place for the wins and the staff. But I'm not sure if they sold or just changed staff around, but the wings are still great the service as far customer service and management can be worked on.  Tips:Cajun ranch and calypso are great even on the tenders. And the fried mushrooms are awesome. Don't waste your time not  the pizza though"}
{"text":"We had 10  orders and everything was great!!! It was delivered in 40 mins during lunch time.. All food was accounted for!!! I got the boneless chicken wings, with spicy garlic parm and sweet and sour. It was delicious!!!  Buffalo sauce is a little vinegary, / Buffalo chicken salad would be rated as a 2.  Greek salad didn't have much quantity,  Mozzarella stick are delicious, some orders for the regular wings were a little too crispy and dry. But the flavoring was perfect.  Overall I would defiantly order from here again!!"}
