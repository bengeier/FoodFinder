{"text":"This is the best place to come for authentic Korean food in Montreal. A lot of the places in downtown Montreal is expensive or they have a small menu, but Shabu Shabu is the place to come because it has a larger extensive menu with a huge variety! It is also great with groups with Korean BBQ. They have large booths that seats 4 people comfortably and many tables for bigger groups as well.  Although it is a bit of a drive, it is worth coming for the authenticity for Korean food!"}
{"text":"It was really good!i had a big group family party in the private room. Foods are perfect!!! Real korean food. You will be enjoyed this korean food!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Shabu Shabu on Saturday March 9, 2013. Decor is very nice especially when you know St. Jacques Street  being so industrial.  Nice menu, very nice concept, you get a jug of hot tea as soon as you sit down. Lets get to the food, it looks very good, but the looks can be very deceiving. Seven of us ordered food and not one meal was tasty. Service was very poor, one little waitress running around. I think this is more of a golf sim place with a restaurant added on as an after thought and they completely forgot about taste and Korean food is very tasty. They have chicken,  a) chicken wings the two pieces stuck together and b) Chicken this time the wing is cut into two and they charge you $6.00 more. I had an awful spicy soup, but apparently they forgot to add the spice. I had to squirt in tons of hotish chili sauce to make it palatable. Overall food was dismal and I nor anyone in our party will ever be going back. Go and try it, maybe you will like this less than mediocre Korean joint."}
{"text":"I asked the waitress how this concept came about, she said the boss is Korean, cooks and likes to play golf... simple as that. I mean, it's a great way to work up an appetite with a bunch of friends, or it's a great one-stop activity and meal location that you can make a night out of. I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu as there are a bunch of things I've never tried, let alone seen on other Korean menus before. In other news, I'm still in the process of conceptualizing a Pho-bubble tea-sushi-Playstation 3 and Scrabble party pack activity fun centre... I don't know how well this idea will pan out, but I'm trying to work balloons and pole-dancers into the mix."}
{"text":"Food: One of those places I always come back for comfort Korean food. Extensive menu with something to please everyone, meat lovers or those who are not~ I personally find their strength is definitely in the cooked dishes and different stews, the quality of the meat for the BBQ is really so-so.   Service: Don't get addicted to the service button on the table! :) so convenient so that you don't have to stretch your neck out for the waiter to finally notice you~ Great for big groups~  Value: Decent prices for regular meals, again do not recommend BBQ~  Ambiance: Big for a Korean restaurant in MTL, with private room and virtual mini-golf! Great lighting and big spaces, so you can enjoy your meal comfortably~"}
{"text":"Food is good but service ruins the whole experience. Had a reservation of 10 at 8PM but was seated at a table made up of tables of different sizes. They changed our seats and only took our order at 8:45, then told us that the kitchen was closing at 9:30 although the restaurant closes at 11:PM and kitchen at 10:00 on the website. We got served raw chicken with no utensils or napkins. Every time you needed something, you had to hassle the staff and were never sure if you were getting our order or not.  The restaurant is clearly too big and seats too many people for the waiting staff and kitchen capacity. Either have less seats or hire more personnel."}
{"text":"My first time there and service was very accommodating. Great food for you and numerous guests! 30$ for an all you can eat was worth it! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Okay this is my second time here and will be the last. I was having dinner here last night. Because the floor was too slippery, I slipped and fell, and I hurt my knee seriously. It is swelling since last night and I couldn't sleep due to the pain. None of the waitress nor the manager cared to ask if I were okay after I stood up. My knee was so painful that I couldn't even walk, so I asked for a bag of ice, the Korean waitress literally threw it at me, rolled her eyes at me and walked away even after I said thank you. The respond I got after I told the waitress and manager I fell hard due to the slippery floor was \" That wasn't our fault, what do you want me to do?\" with arrogant attitude and no intention of apologize. My knee is still swelling badly, have to walk with crutches. Now I'm at the hospital waiting  to get a X-ray check....."}
{"text":"Best Korean food out there. Eat there once a week at least.  For Koreans who miss the hone style cooking. This does the trick!"}
{"text":"This place was great, we had ordered fried chicken, bulgogi and yukgaejang. Unfortunately they were both soups, should have ordered one soup so we could have tried different entrees. Service was great, food came to us fairly quickly and waitresses were very friendly. There is korean bbq where you can cook your own meat, it`s at a descent price.  Parking is easy to find since it has its own parking lot, it also has a patio which would be nice during the day."}
{"text":"Not being from Montreal we asked a Korea shop owner where the best Korean BBQ was. She said it was a little out of the way but was the best. She was right. We Loved this place. Took my family here and they all loved it as well. The staff were so friendly and took great care of us. The food was so good. Great meal."}
{"text":"Food was okay; nothing to complaint. Decent price and portion size. Ordered seafood pancake twice, the texture was very different from one time to another. Quality of the hot soup meals is fairly stable."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Montreal; 10/10 would recommend. Place is amazing. Screen golf and Karaoke for afterwards. Staff is on point. Ambience is on point. And a place you and your friends will love"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Only two waitresses during dinner time, and the fancy calling machine is completely useless."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, really good food and the place is very clean.  The decor is great. The service was really prompt. But I must admit I went there on lunch so I would not know if they could keep up on a busy night.   As I went to the (very clean) bathroom, I could have a discrete look in the kitchen, that revealed itself to be squeaky clean, all stainless steel, equip with monster size rice cooker.  The best part: The food of course! Everything was perfectly season and cooked. But here is my only complain... After I finished my plate...I was still hungry. We (table of 4) all took the lunch menu. My plate of bulgogi beef did not come with a side of rice. But with a cupful of miso. Being still hungry when you leave a restaurant is not a great feeling.  However, it's a good sign when you want more of the food rather then better food. The other people of my group swore they were full to the brim.   I definitely want to go back to try the shabu shabu itself and maybe their karaoke. I bet it's fantastic. I will update my review at that time."}
{"text":"This place is dope...I've never tried the screen golf but the food is pretty authentic. I've been a few times and sampled a number of dishes. My two all-time favorites are the fried chicken and a stew called Soondooboo Chigae, which I got with various seafood. The fried chicken is light and not really greasy, it comes with a side of pickled daikon to cut any oiliness. The soondooboo actually refers to the silken tofu in it, the star of the rich, deeply hued, stew with the Korean red pepper base. It contained squid, mussels, clams,  and other things I gobbled up. A tin of rice mixed together, portion by portion, is the best way to eat it. The banchan is good,  I like that their kimchi is not very fermented. Other dishes enjoyed include: the BBQ (beef and pork belly), ttobokki  (spicy rice cakes), bibimbap, teriyaki chicken, sukiyaki, haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), ojingeo bokeum (spicy squid), and tang soo yuk (sweet and sour pork)."}
{"text":"Tant de critiques avec autant d'exercises de paraphrase qui conteste le service. Certains mesurent bien l'effort et pourtant, à proportion approchant une part égale, le déteste.  Mon experience se réjouit d'une interpretation absolument accompli, du service à table jusqu'à la presentation de la note. La caissière nous a tendu, corps flechi, le reçu bien plié. Les serveuses font la ronde des tables assez régulièrement avec bienséeance."}
{"text":"I went to this place 3rd times. The second one was on March, the food was great (I didn't order BBQ), the service was good and big portion. But on my third visited I feel very disappointed. Went there for BBQ dinner with my husband for the first time. The service was terrible, the food was not something that we expected and they didn't serve garlic (we need to pay extra for garlic slices).  I don't recommend for the BBQ and you need manpower specially on the weekend."}
{"text":"I like their bibimbamp very much. I tried both vegetables one and fish eggs one. Awesome! For those spicy soups, I don't like them very much. But I do want to come back again for more choices."}
{"text":"The food is not as good as I expected. The fried chicken does not come with sauce. But what makes me most disappointed is they ask us to leave when we finish. I saw the waiting line there. And my friend and I have other plan to do. We are just waiting a waiter comes and take the resting to go. We rang the bell third time. The fourth time finally a waitress came and took things away. By knowing we are already paid, she said, \"oh then could you guys stand up, we have a line of people waiting there.\" Anyway, we were planning to leave at that moment, but the way she asked makes me not returning to shabu shabu again. And also tell my friends don't go. Sorry, but if making money is your only priority, then you will eventually lose the money, that's the rule."}
{"text":"The portion is too small for each single person. It just does not worth the price. Really do not recommend. Never will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is ok. But I am not a fan of korean bbq fan,  And it is great for a large group of people, it is very spacious."}
{"text":"From the outside it looked like the restaurant was a bit empty, but as we walked in, we realized that it was a really big restaurant, and there were many people eating there.  OM-Gosh so much food! My friend wanted to satisfy all her Korean cravings at once, so we ordered like we were a family of 5 (it was just the two of us) but it gave us the opportunity to try a little bit of everything: Kalbi Beef, Bulgogi Beef, KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) done 2 ways, Seafood Pajeon, Banchan that came with the Korean BBQ (I thought the sprouts, potato, and kim chi were delicious), and two bowls of rice. We also had a bottle of Soju (we did a mix with Apple Juice). We found a coupon online for 10% off and ended taking home an extra meal for both of us.  SO FULL. Everything was homey, tasty, their Kalbi beef was different from other places, (not used to the cut but still tasty).   Honestly, I've driven by this place probably more than a hundred times and have been intrigued by the whole golf and Korean BBQ thing, but never got the chance to try until last night. I do definitely think it was worth the trip.  Oh and ps. they also do an all you can eat version of the Korean BBQ too."}
{"text":"Food here is alright, but service sucks! This is the first time I didn't pay tips! Never been to a restaurant that has service like this! We rang the bell for hundred times but no one ever answers us, finally got someone to ask for water, waited for one hour to get it. When I paid, I told the cashier that I didn't pay tips cuz I didn't really get any service at all, she just said okay, okay, with very bad attitude! I'll never come to this place!"}
{"text":"When my family just wants to eat out but are too lazy to think of a place, we just go to Shabu Shabu.  Their banchan is hit or miss.  Sometimes it's really good and other times, it's just acceptable.  One of my favorite was the marinated eggplant with a nice flavor and the eggplants are cooked but not mushy but I've only had this once.  I've probably been here almost a dozen times.  I always order the large seafood pancake, it's great the day of and even better the day after when you refry it at home :)  I love getting the short rib soup as it's like my comfort food.  You'll get about 5 pieces of meat in the soup with glass noodles, egg and scallions and a bowl of rice on the side.  Simple yet satisfying.  The food isn't glamorous but I like this place because it's relaxed and no fuss.  I can go in my hoodie and chill at home pants and no one would care.  Again, their Korean BBQ meats are not glamorous but they are good enough, like imagine having dinner at your aunt's place and not your grandmother's :)"}
{"text":"I think they changed the owner...not as good as before.  All you can eat korean now for $25.95. Except for the galbi, it is self serve at the counter. You need to go get your own pork belly and marinated pork slices, Vegas and fried chicken. There is not even any chicken to grill. Probably one of the worst I've been recently. We also had 2 bibimpap that was included in our meal and only one came. When we asked for the second one, they said the kitchen was closed...kitchen closes at 9:30pm ?!?  Not going back there for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good and tasty. Surprisingly better than Ganadara, although the price is pretty high."}
{"text":"Food is very satisfying but the service is the opposite. We had seafood pancake, fried chicken, a stone bowl rice, a pan fried starch noodle, spicy beef soup/stew and shabu shabu. They are all very tasty. Average 25 dollars per person l(tax and tip included).  We ordered sake in the first place but only got it after we almost finished our dishes. Even though We asked about it more than three times. One friend came late so we asked for another menu but it never came. We made reservation for the karaoke room but we had to wait for 50mins because other group also booked it, not sure why but we confirmed with them for the birthday party way before.   There is definitely something wrong with their management. Hope they can improve. I will come back for the food. Oh boy such a mixed feeling."}
{"text":"Nuts And Gum        Fan of Korean BBQ? How about screen golf? Then hold on to your lymph nods because someone has created a Utopia for you.      Food is good, reasonably priced and the servers are polite, to a point...and that point is when you and your drunken friends decide to deglaze your pan with your draft beer and A) render your pan useless and B) make really shitty beer rice. Suffice to say, don't do that.     Good for family fun but they do condone lude, drunken behaviour by late twenty/early thirty-somethings, while enjoying the thrill ride that is screen golf. They merely insist that you close your door.     And if that isn't sufficient reasoning to give it a try, most of the people eating there were from the far east.  Ta Daaaaa.  Waka Waka"}
{"text":"looks nice,big and clean,but the food is overpriced and not good."}
{"text":"My family of 5 have been eating here for the past 3 years. I agree with the reviews that the service is a little slow. It still is, especially on weekends. But gradually over the years, this place grew on us.   For one, there is free parking which is helpful. Second, the food is good. We tried many dishes and we have settled on a set of orders that suited our children and us well. We order the Korean pancake, the BBQ pork belly and BBQ beef ribs (so good!), Kimchi stew and fried chicken (also very good). This is enough for the 5 of us and we leave with happy bellies. Lastly, the restaurant is spacious and done up nicely. The spaciousness is helpful when there are children.   The restaurant offers a Korean buffet but we have not tried it. It could be a value deal for large groups or young people who have bigger appetites and the corresponding metabolism. We stick to the a la carte, as the portions are right for us. I think the a la carte orders also taste good because the kitchen makes them fresh. Our food always come piping hot and delicious.   Also, we have had large groups of friends for dinner in their function rooms too. We ordered a la carte as well. For the most recent large group dinner (16 pax birthday celebration), the service was good and the food came fast even though it was a Saturday and they were full house. It was a good dinner experience.   We will keep going back to this restaurant. We used to visit once every couple of months at the start, but now I realize we patronize them almost every fortnight. It's our family's go-to restaurant for a dinner out."}
{"text":"Nice decoration, nice service , free welcome tea , many tables, bbq coreen available, chopsticks on table, nice presentation of dishes ... but the taste of food is bland.."}
