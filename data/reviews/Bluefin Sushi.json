{"text":"Really disappointed. The food was boring and small portion. They really take crispy and use it in everything. When I first got the plate it was dirty which was horrible. The staff so friendly though. If you don't like talking to people this is great as its order by iPad. Just go to one sushi instead as its iPad but way better. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not deserve a visit. I went there with my husband for a buffet dinner. It was about 20 minutes wait for the food. However we've ordered 20 pieces sashimi and they only gave us 9 pieces. When we talked to the waitress, she did not respond but just stared at us and then walked away. While we did not order some sushi but they gave us sushi with too much source. They just gave us cheap food but when we order more expensive items, they just simply won't give us what we ordered. This is cheating!! I've paid full price and did not expect to be cheated on food. The service was not good either, a server just secretly slip in a dish at the edge of the table and it almost fell to the ground, they can't even properly serve."}
{"text":"Normally I won't bother to submit a review if the food is OK but Bluefin's food and service quality is really subpar so I really wonder how previous 3 reviews' 5 stars came from. Using IPad to order AYE is pretty neat but we have to wait nearly 90 minutes to get our sashimi and some sushi!  We ended up ordering the same items second time according to the waiter's instruction and all items ended up showing up doubling what we ordered.   Nearly all dishes especially hot items are not even close to the menu's photos.  The coconut shrimp turns out to be poorly fried tempura shrimp with no coconut at all.  The miso soup did not have green onion and it's bland and so is the seafood udon soup.  The mango salad has two tiny strips of mango and some sauce over lettuce not even close to the menu photo which has many different vegetables. The same goes to the corn scallops salad.   Thai food dishes are also tasteless nowhere close to the real Thai.  We ordered two pieces of mackerels but it looks like somone used his hand tearing one whole piece into two. Our hamachi sushi turned out to be tuna. Finally, the green tea ice cream came melted.  I know the restaurant just opened a week ago so I'm willing to cut it some slack.  However, I really think they need to have their chefs properly trained for the menu items."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate because the food was decent, but the bad outweighed the good. First, when we arrived (around 6:30p), we were told that there were no tables and basically asked to leave. Then we found out that 2 of our party could not make it so we were down to 6 people and they were okay to have us wait.  There wasn't even anyone else waiting in the waiting area, so we weren't sure why we were being turned away at first.   Then, another group of 6 ended up in the waiting area and when they finally said that a table was ready, they called that group of 6 in instead of checking our numbers.  When we spoke up, the other group of 6 was gracious enough to let us go in first as we had arrived before them, but when we brought it up to the host (who seemed like she might have been the owner), she said \"I don't care about the other group, you guys have your number so you can just sit.  Don't worry about them\"  Well, that was a winning attitude.  From there on in, the food and service was good.  We went for the all you can eat and only found 2-3 items to be missing at the end of the night.  The washrooms were disgusting though, and the kitchen didn't look too clean either."}
{"text":"I went here several times mostly for birthday dinners (free birthday meal if you show valid ID). I have to say I'm a fan of this place. The plate decorations are beautiful, the presentation is excellent, the sushi is of above average quality (not excellent unfortunately). The dessert selection, which is mainly ice cream and jello (and the mango pudding!), is average. I enjoyed the AYCE dinner menu compared to the lunch menu, however, the lunch menu is also decent. The wait times after confirming your order on the iPad are somewhat long, however, it is worth the wait as they put in the time and effort into food presentation. The cooked items on the menu are also good and I would recommend ordering some of them while waiting for your sushi and your sashimi. Service is average as most of the waiters and waitresses are of East Asian descent. Overall, I would recommend going once in a while or to try it out if you have not tried this place."}
{"text":"They screwed up on our take-out order then refused to correct it.  The food was average but pricey.  Told them we are never going back there."}
{"text":"Not too bad. The most expensive all you can eat I've tried in the city. The service was pretty bad. We didn't make a reservation but they had tables, but didn't seem to want to seat us, but they reluctantly did. The staff didn't care to serve you and when we asked for tea, we had to ask three times until it showed up. Same with the pop and water. It's like they kept forgetting to bring it for us.  The sushi doesn't look like the pictures posted. Nothing came out on a nice platter with the fancy lights or decorations. Just on plates, very simple. The Sashimi was good, until we got a frozen piece of tuna which turns you off from it.  The rolls were good, too much mango sauce on the mango rolls.   Beef ribs were very good but fatty.  My brothers ordered the mussels and they took almost half an hour to bring two of them out and blamed it on being a warm food item so the kitchen was backed up, but the wings he ordered came out in 10 minutes.  This place is just okay!"}
{"text":"It was good a year ago. But now the price is much higher. My daughter is only 4 and they charge me $20! She can just a little sushi!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to go for all-you-can-eat sushi if all you've ever had sushi-wise from Calgary came from a mall kiosk. BlueFin's iPad ordering concept was really neat, as you can see what you're ordering and often can read the ingredients of the dishes as opposed to asking (and probably irritating) the waiting staff what was in each of them. Service-wise, I didn't see much of the staff, but our orders came pretty quickly. They had a tremendous amount of selection which was nice to see - I recommend the mango rolls, hands down. Presentation was also key here. If you ordered enough sushi, it would come to you in a giant boat!   While BlueFin was a little expensive in my opinion, I did go during dinner hours when it gets a little more pricey and I did get what I paid for, which came with a stomachache from inhaling too many rolls (hopefully wasn't MSG or food poisoning). Would maybe go back, but would definitely go check out other sushi places before returning."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it was okay. Recently my friend and I went here for Dinner and the quality of the sushi has gone downhill.   We ordered some rolls and we didn't end up liking them, the \"Queen Roll\" looked like someone put pink food colored fish into their mouth and spit it out on top on the sushi and it was disgusting tasting. When we went to pay, a waitress asked us if we have been the Blufin before and we answered yes then she continued to yell at us across the restaurant in front of other guests that we shouldn't order more than we can eat. Which I want to add that we only didn't eat that one roll we ordered.  And when we getting our drinks this same waitress answered her phone right in front of us and ignored us for about 10 minutes. Very Rude.  It is all you can eat and not everything you order you are going to like. I will NEVER go back. They treat the customers poorly and you can go to way better places for the same price and get treated with respect."}
{"text":"The lunch meal is a really great deal. The quality isn't the best, but I think it is still great value for the money. You order on an iPad and the food generally comes out very quickly. It was a great experience for our group."}
{"text":"2.5/5 i like the idea of ipad menu.food is decent,last time i was there the crispy california was kinda disappointing,it was mushy and u can tell that avocado is not fresh.most of the staff dont know how to speak english.asked for pickled ginger 4 times with different servers as some them couldnt understand/speak english. I like that the food comes out fast.overall its ok.not really something i would reccomend to my friends that are visiting calgary."}
{"text":"Solely giving this 4 star based on the food. Huge variety of great sushi rolls, appies, different tempuras to try. Everything was very fresh. Orders are put through on an iPad and brought out in a decent time. For water or tea or other beverages, soy sauce or other requests service can be very slow. Will go back for the good priced all you can eat."}
{"text":"Good value sushi for all you can eat! Lots of options and the sashimi cuts are nice a big compared to other \"all you can eat\" if you want to gorge yourself on sushi this is the place to go"}
{"text":"I like this place for the all you can eat sashimi. The rest of the food is ok, nothing special but has lots of options for rolls, appetizers, cones, Thai food and Chinese food. You order everything of the iPad and the servers drop off your orders and do drink refills. I think that most of the rolls are too big and all of them come in 8 pieces so it's too much if you come with only 2 ppl. Can't try too much of a variety. The mango pudding has gone downhill I would not recommend, it's so watery and jello is not set as all. Adults price is $27.99"}
{"text":"For All You Can Eat, it's not too bad.  Service is good.  Quality is better then other 'All You Can Eat'.  I like that sashimi is offered, as many All You Can Eat restaurants only has sushi and they try to fill you up with the rice.  The mango pudding is always one of my favorite."}
{"text":"We dropped in for buffet on a Saturday late afternoon just before the dinner service.  We thought we'd try it as we heard some decent things from other folks.  That was a mistake.    First thing I noticed when we were climbing the stairs was how dirty the place was.  Looked like it needs a good scrubbing.  Once we got upstairs, the floor was slippery.  Not from water, but from how greasy it was.  This was very noticeable during the walk from the front counter to our table.  It was kind of gross.  I've worked in kitchens before and I remember the feeling of greasy floor tiles in back-of-house.  Hard techno/house music was also playing, which kind of degrades the vibe in a restaurant.  It's a restaurant, not a rave.  Play something a bit more mellow, not saying that you have to go full elevator music, but have better taste in music for the right atmosphere.  Another thing, is find a better ipad app for the menu.  The buttons are too small and harder to operate.  I like how the app lets you see the history of your order, but other than that, it looks terrible and feels cheap.  Second, the food.  It wasn't good.  I know the quality suffers when it's an all you can eat sushi place in Calgary.  The tuna sashimi was half frozen and it was still crunchy due to the ice.  The sashimi slices were so thin, the maki rolls had too much mayo, and the portions were skimpy.  I've noticed this trend in a lot of the all-you-can-eat sushi places these days.  I get that seafood is expensive but maybe one shouldn't open a sushi buffet if you can't keep the place clean and serve decent portions.  I would suggest try harder to find a balance so that you may run a better business.  Lastly, the value was not there.  At 28 dollars for a dinner service, the value is just not there.  For 17 dollars let alone for dinner service, when the food is the same.  I wouldn't pay 10 dollars more for dinner service when everything else remains constant.  C'mon..serving mango pudding in a tiny dixie cup no larger than a Toonie is abysmal."}
{"text":"The food was mostly good. Sashimi sizes are a joke.  The way that you order via iPad is pretty cool.  Their servers agent very good, so without them the place would be a bust. Price is OK, but way too much for a 5 year old."}
{"text":"Excellent value for money, when it comes to portion sizes they are all quite generous, they issue is that the food is not necessarily good. some of the sushi rolls were fine and rather tasty but overall the seaweed was not fresh and the Red Tuna Roll tasted awful, just like bad fish.  The ladies serving were all nice enough but we felt rather judged about our eating pace and amount ordered because we were starving and wanted to try a lot of different things. Lacking options of sushi, good variety of sushi rolls though. One roll the golden california roll tastes like corn and does not look like the photo at all, it is covered in spicy mayo, also the gyoza are deep-fried not steamed like the photo suggests.   I would say not to try this place other sushi places are by far better but for the price it is a good deal, but remember just because it is bad doesn't mean it is free so even if you end up disagreeing with the food they do not support you wasting food at all."}
{"text":"We popped in later in the evening around 10pm because we saw online it was close to us and open late. Best decision ever. we were really blown away by the taste in everything we had. Big bowl of miso for 1.99 with tons of seaweed. Amazing selection on the menu. Some great vegetarian rolls for me, and my boyfriend sampled some really creative rolls with great taste and lots of food for the price. Also a rediculiously cute presentation of one of the dishes complete with LED lighting on the plate!   Only 4 stars though because the service was pretty slow and disorganized. I had to flag down the server every time and she seemed overwhelmed. She had us repeat our small order several times before she got it all jotted down.  But eh, we all have our off days and we will totally be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends because they considered it one of their favorite places. Selection and price are pretty comparable to other AYCE sushi places. I found their soy sauce to be quite watered down so I did not enjoy it with the sushi at all. When I ordered the mango pudding, I found a shard of glass in it. Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"We go at least once a week for the lunch buffet   15 CAD per person  Kids older than 3 are 8.99  The buffet menu is not good As the dinner one by far!   There is no shrimp plates at all in the lunch, no muscles and I guess it's fair!   We love the sushi there!  The staff are okay as well!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, we were seated and given an iPad and not told how anything worked, we were new in Calgary and were unfamiliar with the restaurant. It was not busy at all (maybe 4 other tables with several servers working) and we were not interested in the all you can eat menu, so we ordered a la carte. The food took forever to come out, the portion sizes were very awkward, and the food itself was mediocre at best. On top of all of this, the ladies washroom smelled so disgusting, I couldn't eat anything after returning to the table as I was so nauseous."}
{"text":"First of all you gotta know what you're looking for when you go to an all you can eat. I look for a lot of food at a good price with above average quality.  And this is my favorite all you can eat in the city now! So don't go in expecting g 5 star quality or anything. But it's efficient and yummy"}
{"text":"Since receiving a judgmental email from a friend of the owner or the guy who runs this place himself I would highly recommend NEVER going here. I was accused of running a similar business and using this platform to sabotage them. I'll be reporting the note to Yelp for review."}
{"text":"This is the second time we visited this restaurant and nothing has improved. My previous visit was several months ago. The servers there walk around like they just lost their love ones! They all look so sad and lack of energy, I have not seen the slightest smile on their faces. When I pay at the cashier he never even looked at me and at the end he had to force himself to utter the words \"thank you\". Food is not the best either, beef and broccoli looked uninviting and stale. Fish slices on sushi were extremely thin, they must have really sharp knifes. Texture of the fish indicates they are not very fresh.   It is all you can eat therefore you can aim for quantity but definitely not quality. No wow factors for any of the dishes and keep in mind that they don't seem to care whether you enjoy your dinner or not, they never asked during my two visits."}
{"text":"It's a decent sushi buffet with many choices. Their sashimi is quite fresh although quite small. For an additional $10/person, we each had two baked lobster tails and a few extra items such as red tuna and scallops. The lamb skewers were also quite tasty. However, our fried squid legs came out disappointingly black. It looked as if it was forgotten. Overall, the experience was pretty good for the past few times we were here. A few things for improvement: please clean the floor and the washrooms. Dirty areas make your restaurant has a feeling of cheap food. If the overall area was more clean, I would give another star. Second, please expand your dessert section. The ice cream flavors tasted cheap and artificial. The pudding looks as if they've been in the fridge waiting forever to be eaten!"}
{"text":"It has a good atmosphere. The food was great and using ipad to order is just really convenient. I love it. Just wish there is more different types of sashimi available though."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'd tempered my expectations for Bluefin somewhat due to the fact that it is an All-You-Can-Eat joint. With the quantity over quality state of mind I ventured in for the first time for a Family Day lunch with my wife and 4 year old twins. The initial impression was mixed. The entrance stairs leading up to the restaurant were quite honestly disgusting and in serious disrepair. I was thankful that food service was not anywhere near them. Not particularly relevant, but not a great first impression.   Once inside, we waited about 5 minutes to be greeted and seated, which was understandable as it was quite busy. Once we were seated I was handed an iPad and left to figure things out. Thankfully, it's pretty straightforward once you figure out how to navigate around. Although I would have expected some kind of greeting and a primer. We spent the next 10 minutes or so waiting for our order of water. Thankfully, my pre-schoolers figured out the iPad situation and we were ordering food in no time.   The overall selection is good. There is an assortment of sushi/cones/rolls, tempura, asian appies, thai dishes, western Chinese and \"desserts\", which is actually just 4 flavours of ice cream. My wife had been before and we visited on her recommendation, which comes with the disclaimer that she doesn't eat sushi and ate the other dishes.   Unfortunately, I do like quality Sushi, but as mentioned I wasn't expecting the cream of the crop. The next 45 minutes or so were a whirlwind of dishes with some decent stand outs. The Gyoza were fine. The various Tempura dishes were good, although no dipping sauce was provided (aside from the table Soy Sauce). My kids enjoyed some kind of Chinese Noodle Dish and my Wife enjoyed the Spring Rolls. Basically the selection of dishes is what I would equate to western pub food. I would guess that at least 90% is deep fried, but if you've just left the bar or just woke up the day after, it's exactly what you need. Sadly, I haven't been to a bar for a long time.   Now for the rough stuff. I ordered the new \"Ninja Roll\". I've included a picture of the iPad listing. As mentioned in a few other reviews the pictures really don't resemble the actual dishes in the slightest, but it is nice that the portions are quite small as you can just order more. As for the Ninja Roll, it was listed in the \"Special Roll\" section with the Dragon and a few other familiar rolls. When it arrived, I was excited.......until I bit it. This is a Special roll indeed. As far as I can tell, it is a standard Sushi roll with tempura shrimp, deep fried banana, banana mayo sauce and chocolate sauce. Yes, you read that right. After I choked down one piece I scanned the restaurant looking for a camera crew to tell me I was on some kind of hidden camera show. It was that weird. Even now I'm questioning exactly what happened.   I thought I'd try another roll to see if I could have some sort of redemption. I ordered the spicy crispy roll. Basically it was a standard Maki roll in construction, but was filled literally with nothing but crunched up Tempura batter. Just rice, hot sauce, tempura batter. Confused, I grabbed for my grilled Chicken Skewer. I ate the first of 2 and it was actually pretty decent. I was about to devour the next when my wife pointed out the long black hair dangling from it.   Somewhere in between Choco-banana Shrimp Maki and hair chicken we order my kids and wife Ice Cream for dessert. We spent the next 25 minutes asking 4 different servers when we could expect our Ice Cream. Each one acknowledged the question, but never really promised to do anything about it so I can't really fault them for not actually scooping the Ice Cream from the freezer 20 feet behind our table. Finally server number 4 actually did the unthinkable and apologized and walked to the freezer and returned 30 seconds later with 3 bowls of Ice cream. I feel like we probably would have spent the next while waiting for a bill, but decided to skip that step and just walked up to the entrance ourselves. In the end the meal was around $50 for 2 adults and 2 four year old kids. Not terrible value, but I'm pretty confident I wouldn't do it again, unless of course I get back into the bar scene."}
{"text":"Decent sushi for all you can eat. For lunch the price is $16.99 per person and for dinner it's $27.99 I believe. What excited me the most was how I was able to order on the iPad and make changes if I wanted to. It also shows the time i placed the order and all of the sushi I ordered as well as other menu items. The sushi however was a little disappointment because they were extremely big compared to sushi you get at other places. Each sushi order comes with 6 pieces and special sushi comes with 8. Due to the pieces being so large i got sick of it quickly. Sashimi is only served during dinner which was quite the let down. I'm not sure if there is much difference between what'd served on the dinner menu and what's served on the lunch menu. However there was a huge selection on the lunch me I itself already. It's definitely worth the price during lunch. Service on the other hand was good. The food came fast and our server was extremely nice."}
{"text":"The lunch price is a steal but if you want the dinner menu which includes sashimi, you gotta pay extra! Whaaaat, right? An extra $10 to get sashimi alone where if I'm paying the current price I can get salmon sushi and take it off the rice and eat it like that? But what of the extra rice? Extra charge! The rolls are HUGE. Be prepared to get full before you try all you can try but I've been here a handful of times in the last two years. Same menu. No difference! Waiting staff are definitely eager to clear your table, whether you're done with it or not. The service is decent but I can't scream about the food."}
{"text":"Was not overly impressed by this place.  Our server made the experience quite awkward as she seemed rather irritated having to serve us.  The sushi was just OK, the sushi rice didn't seem to be very fresh although on the other hand the tempura sweet potatoes were piping hot when they came out.  I probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"The current king of south side all you can eat sushi. Love the ipad self ordering menus. Not bad for the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant ended up being our plan b for supper as we were quite hungry and still wanted japanese ayce.   The tea is just regular green tea, but all I could smell was the chemicals on my tea cup. At least they're sanitizing them right?  The portion sizes here were perfect. Their nigiri is tiny, the rice for them is okay, overly smushed together; service was fast, well staffed. I liked how you could order the sashimi by piece. Selection wasn't great for sashimi, but it had the basics that we wanted.  DO NOT trust the pictures, most of the food doesn't look like the pictures on the ipad.  Near the end of my meal, I finally got the mussels I ordered. The first one confused my taste buds, as it was covered in some type of plum sauce... I went ahead with the second one and found a not as pleasant surprise. There were two tiny crabs hiding out in it... After some epic googleing it turns out it's a regular occurrence. Still icked me out to the extreme so I totally lost my appetite for the rest of the night. We did manage to ask the waitress to take it away, funny thing was when we told her about it, her reaction was... Why did you ask me over, so you're just showing me?  Therefore I did not partake in their dessert selection. The hubs got dessert though, the mango pudding was vey runny; it was the consistency of egg whites. He also got some ice cream as well. hubs had great difficulty eating the desserts as all they gave us were plastic spoons.  Side notes: What is with restaurants mopping their floors when you're still eating as well... All I could smell was bleach for the longest time while we finished up. No wet floor signs during closing, the hubs almost fell down the stairs because of this.  Washroom doors locked... the door was hanging by two nails and of course... the customary toilet paper stuck in the hole in the door to offer \"privacy\"."}
{"text":"This place is getting so much WORSE ! We used to come here a lot, with friends family's and cowokers? recently it reopened . The service is poor, food quality is getting bad. we missing tempura during lunch, we asked several waiters and waited for 30min even after we finished eating, still no coming, the food is not as clean as before. The is edamame is spilled with sauce and leaves. I don't think we will come back again"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I was looking at pictures from here and they food that we got looked nothing like the pictures that I saw on here so I am going with the quality has dropped. I also found some of the items to be bland. It was worth a shot but will not be going back."}
{"text":"Now I'm not going to lie, I have yet to come across a place that has good all-you-can-eat sushi because most places lure you in with quantity over quality. We came here for lunch and their lunch special is $17 for all you can eat, so it wasn't a terrible price to begin with, but I didn't really have high hopes. Also! The lunch menu doesn't include sashimi :(   You order everything on a iPad which has pictures attached to every item of food and, scanning over the other reviews, it seems like there's a general consensus that the pictures does not equal the actual presentation. The menu includes other Asian dishes such as Pad Thai as well as some other Western Chinese dishes as well. The portions were relatively small, which wasn't bad because you can order and sample a lot of different items. Some dishes (ex. skewers) come actually came individually so you specifically order the number you would like, which also was great! For the rolls themselves, I thought they were pretty basic and just didn't feel like there was much substance to it. They also failed in other dishes: our fried cheese sticks had no cheese, it was just breading (I think it oozed out in the fryer), the beef in one of their Chinese dishes definitely didn't taste like beef and had a soft, mushy texture and the ninja roll. While I'm all about mixing flavours, fried shrimp tempura and fried banana? Rolled up in rice? With banana and chocolate sauce on top? Just no. I don't think we realized what we ordered until we did.   Everything else was just sub-par and there wasn't anything that really jumped out at me.    Overall, just based on the lunch alone, I probably won't go back again. I believe they have other items that are not on the all you can eat menu and I hope they put more work into those dishes if you're going to be paying full price for them."}
{"text":"4 stars here's why:  We went for lunch and the price is pretty decent $16.99  The serving size is pretty good too  The service is fantastic, less than 5 minutes our food came so fast the table was filled.  The only thing I didn't like was beef teriyaki it was a little tough.  It's surprising it's not as busy for a Friday lunchtime. The buffet lunch starts around 11 til 3:30pm which is bonus since most buffet ends at 1:30.  They got small selection for Thai though pretty choked about it..."}
