{"text":"My husband and I just got take out  this evening!.We ordered the green chicken curry and a seafood noodle dish.  The green curry chicken was AMAZING!!! We both agreed it was the best we've had in a while. We will be returning customers.  The owner's were extremely nice and talked to us outside when we arrived on our bikes. We will be coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Only one waitress for the entire restaurant. She did her best, not bad. Food way overpriced.  Full of Ocotillo blue hairs, don't know any better. $15.95  for combination fried rice. Really? Maybe 8 bucks tops. Never going back. Too many good places out there.  Don't bother, you will be better off."}
{"text":"best thai food in chandler. Their fresh rolls are amazing and so if fried rice (basil & pineapple)."}
{"text":"This place is SO lucky their food is great! I've had Silk both dine-in as well as to-go and regardless of where you eat it you will have to wait a good amount of time for your food. When dining in the service is very aggravating.. You have to practically yell across the restaurant in order to get your server for a drink refill.. Also, there are a couple workers who BARELY speak/understand English.. Very frustrating when you have to go over your order 10 times and they bring something else out Besides the lousy service.. Everything else is great! I've yet to have a bad meal !"}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere is relaxed.  nice patio area for outside dinning.  Kevin was very friendly and took good care of us!   Check Silk out if your in the area and want some good eats ;)"}
{"text":"I have never eaten inside the restaurant, so my review is for take-out only since I have never experienced what their wait staff is like. Their food is amazing and I have never had anything I didn't like. My favorite items on the menu are the tom kha gai and the pumpkin curry. Some Thai restaurants are hit or miss when it comes to the spice rating, but my request for \"medium\" is consistently the same every time I order. It's great to have such a wonderful Thai restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"We decided to visit this new restaurant near our home.  It was tastefully decorated, but the real highlight was the food.  We tried three meals, all extraordinarily tasty with the perfect blend of flavor and seasoning.  Service was a little slow, but hopefully this will improve with time.  We'll definitely add Silk to our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for lunch and food and service was excellent.  Had the Drunken noodles on the first visit and the red chicken curry on the second.  Can't wait to try everything on the menu.  My waiter on Thursday was exceptionally nice and knowledgeable about the dishes.  Definitely recommend.  Wish the owners would open another one in south Gilbert."}
{"text":"Get the boat soup!!!! It is amazing with broth more flavorful than most Pho places we've been to in AZ and other states.   The food here is so fresh and sizzling hot when it arrives at your table. Their lunch specials all come with soup or a simple salad bar, with several tasty Asian salad dressings. They have all the usual Thai dishes you'd expect and a nice and large variety of appetizers.  So why the 3 stars? Well, first and foremost the service... we enjoy a nice Thai beer with our food and no matter how many occasions we've been there, we have to get up and go to the bar or wave down the server in this tiny restaurant to try and get a second drink - it's like they're moderating our alcohol intake. The servers and bartender can see our table at all times yet they typically never check back to see if we need anything. We frequent this place often and myself and friends used to laugh at a particular server who would literally hide behind bar and this large pot on bar and text away like the entire restaurant couldn't see her. One time we went there, we were excited thinking she was getting our food from the kitchen window, but it was actually her own lunch she ordered and she then hid behind said obstacle and ate her meal while we patiently waited for ours and a drink refill offer.   So besides service challenges, the atmosphere is fairly sterile too, no music and simply decorated but always very clean. Try and get a front room table as there are several booths in a darker area on way to bathroom which is not as nice of an area to sit in.  But back to the boat soup! Seriously the best and most flavorful soup we've had and it's what keeps us coming back. I definitely recommend going there for the freshness and tastiness of their cuisine. Cheers."}
{"text":"I ordered 1 menu To go, so I can't complain about how I feel about the restaurant itself!!   BUT their food was so terrible both how it looks and how it tastes.   I'm not good in English language but their food was way more terrible than I can explain !!!!"}
{"text":"I've gotten several different dishes via takeout.  The curry dishes have been excellent (yellow curry my current fave).  The noodle / rice options tend to be more so-so.  The pad thai is good, but a little on the dry side for my taste.  Pad ka pow gets a thumbs up, but the drunken noodles I'd pass on now after a couple of tries.  The soups look inviting, but that's an eat-in proposition.  My impression is that you won't go wrong with anything you try here, but a little bit of inconsistency keeps it from 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Silk four times now; twice for dinner (my whole family once and just my wife and I once) and twice for lunch (just me).  Every time the food has been great and my family agrees.  My wife and I are planning to go there again in a week or so.  I'm very happy to have Silk just a couple miles down the road from where we live.  I've only had the red and yellow curry but both were delicious.  I had a bit of a problem with service the first visit but no problems since.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Also, if you like Italian food I recommend Amalfi's which is on the same corner but across the parking lot to the east.  Two local family run businesses!"}
{"text":"I just read the other review and can't believe it's the same restaurant we're talking about.  Our service was excellent and the food was too.  The owner said they had just opened three days before and we were amazed how quickly they had gotten their act together,  I had the pad thai which was great and so generous I had another full meal to take home.  Plus nice presentation and a fresh salad bar included.  We have seen the manager at two other Asian restaurants that we love so she must have learned from them.  Believe me...ignore that negative review."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals this evening.  We ordered three different noodle dishes, pumpkin curry, satay appetizer, and pot sticker appetizers.  Our waiter was knowledgable of items on the menu & was able to recommend dishes based on what we like.  Food came quickly and was served with a smile.  Our drinks were refilled regularly and needs were readily met.  If we lived in the area, this would be a regular place to eat for our family!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Lunch for 2 mid-week. Both ordered eggplant dish with pork.  Service was poor at best and the food? - grey, flavorless, dry meat - almost non-existent sauce; what there was of the sauce had nearly next to no taste.  The eggplant was old (you could see the dried brown areas on the skin of the eggplant - no, it wasn't from browning during cooking.  Other vegetables that were served on the plate were not those listed on the menu's description of the dish.  Not once after our meal was brought to us did anyone come to our table to see if we needed anything or to see how our food was.  At the end of our meal our waitress plopped the bill on the edge of the table and scooted off.  When I paid at the counter (bar) I mentioned all the above - no remediation, no apologies were given, no nothing. I won't be coming back.  One star is for a somewhat decent hot & sour soup - lukewarm."}
{"text":"I was a solo diner, and I  sat in a booth.    I had to wave down the waitress to order my lunch (pad thai) as I had sat there for at least 10 minutes.   I had to wave down the waitress to get the check.   There's nothing special about the food, overly sweet, mushy, and not like any other Thai food I have had in AZ.  No one said good bye and thanked for eating in the restaurant.  I will never return."}
{"text":"Food was good, but my husband didn't get the brown rice he ordered for our take-out order. We usually dine in and the food has always been excellent."}
{"text":"We just moved into a condo close to the shopping center this Thai restaurant is in in October of 2017  Out first visit there was iffy. Service slow. We set outside on the patio. There was another group out there, but they hardly acknowledged us.  We stayed and ordered.  Every time we went there the service was was mediocre. Food was good. But not the wow.   The most recent visit we were there about 7with friends. A man comes in from the patio and yells into the restaurant....You told me to sit where I wanted and you said outside was fine, but no one has been out to take out order or bring water for 20 minutes. We are leaving and never coming back.  To add to that, the waitress or the cook.. Essex up the order. We made it very clear several times to her that we wanted 4 combo plate appetizers. They brought one.  Tonight we try it again...we go in and want to order take out. 30 minutes later we still have no food. So we get up and we are standing by the bar, the kid that waited on us sees us and goes in and tells,them they have waited too long, domthis one now.  As we leave a new guy we had not seen says I am sorry it took so long. We told him, it's this way every time we come in here the order is messed up and it takes forever. What is going on. He offered a free meal and we said no way. We are never c grackles.  It's convenient, but certainly not the best Thai. We talked to the Asian man we we thought owed it in previous visit. Seemed nice....but who is running that kitchen. It appears to be pure Chaos. Not efficient. And all we order were some little appetizers....really and that took 30 minutes.  I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"It was a good lunch place. They had a wide selection of Thai Pho and lunch combos. The size was considerable and my whole team enjoyed the deal. Each dish was delicious: curry, pho, drunken noodle, fried rice.... All excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and ambience! #46 chicken pineapple fried rice, enough for left overs!!! This will be one of my regular stops!!!"}
{"text":"Do not order online from here. We waited 45 minutes to pick up order and they hadn't even started our order after telling us twice that they were working on the order. I have ordered online before without issues but it's not worth doing it again with how disorganized they were with handling our order this time. I would still dine in here but they need to seriously work on the online ordering system. The curries are excellent here and good options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I visited here before I went to Madison Ave Salon & Spa for a haircut. I walked in and there weren't many people inside at about 1p on a Thursday. I thought why not try it. The food was delicious and service was great. I would recommend silk to anyone."}
{"text":"Really good food, went there for lunch. The Silk Eggplant was awesome, also the Pad Tai was great. Lot's of options with fish."}
{"text":"Their soups are amazing. They are like a fusion of Vietnamese pho and Thai hot and sour. Very rich stock, and very generous chunks of meat. Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"I realize this is a new restaurant but when we went, they were completely unorganized. It took forever to get our water and to order. When they brought out the appetizers, the food first went to the wrong table. I can't believe how long we waited for the main courses and when we did get them, they were simply ok.    They were so slow that I saw some people just leave because after 30 minutes, they still had no water and no one had taken their order."}
{"text":"Many people having problems on rated restaurant, this is first time in my life ever post on Yelp(wasting my time). I have to warn people about it just so they won't wasted their money.  First thing i want to mention, PRICE! Saw the menu I thought they probably giving massage after my shitty dinner. Unfortunately, nope!  Service? I will say it was great for only 1 man served and the restaurant full of customers. I had a small conversations with the manager(Tom) he is the server too. I was talking to myself and look at the place \"who the hell own this restaurant?\". You've done the best shitty job\".  Food? It was alright, Panda is more flavorful. Thats the best way i can explain, only the freshly cooked vegetables that hold it up.     FYI readers, its my opinions so dont care if you agree with it or not. Thanks. Sorry for my English, wasn't good at it in case some English Teachers happens to read it."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Tuesday night and were happy to see that it was busy. We were seated promptly on the patio and had excellent service the entire night. The summer rolls, chicken satay, and drunken noodles were all outstanding. Silk is now my husband's favorite place for Asian food."}
{"text":"I decided to give the restaurant another try since it's near my work. The first time I went, their computers weren't working so they had to close temporarily. I love Asian food having spent much of my life in New York and San Francisco so I was very excited about this new spot!   The servers were very friendly and courteous. I found the interior to be very well designed and ornate with real items from Thailand. They have a free salad bar which I found to be just ok. I ordered a Thai noodle soup and found this to be exceptionally delicious and soothing! :)  Service was very fast and I was in and out of there in 30 minutes, perfect for an hour lunch break!"}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant is very misleading. With a name like that we expected a fusion of oriental foods. What we got was straight up Thai served slightly uniquely. I'll be honest, I don't remember exactly what we had, but it wasn't good eats and nothing like the Thai I'm used to eating (I love Thai) and in general the food here was just not tasty.  We ALWAYS take our leftovers home, if there are any, to eat the next day, but not this time. In general my review of the taste of the food here is somewhere between BLECH! and just ok but nothing to write home about. We won't bother going back since there are much better places in this city to get true fusion Asian or straight up Thai. I will say Service was spot on, nice young man, Kevin or something like that. He tried to make things right by bring us 2 diff plates of other food but you just can't make bad tasting food good. Place is very noisy, large empty spaces lead to a lot of background noise. I was there with my 69yr old mother and she had such a hard time hearing me and I got so tired of yelling we eventually stopped talking and just ate. I would suggest investing in some noise reducing tiles or something considering you're sitting in the middle of at least half a dozen retirement communities."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there last night, we had pan fried pot stickers as an appetizer. I was not impressed with the pot stickers. For our meal he had the Pad Ka Prow Chicken and I had the pad Thai noodles. We ordered both with a spice level of 3.  Both dishes were were really good. I thought his dinner was delicious. It was very flavorful. The pad Thai was really good as well. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Fair food.  Aloof service. Had to return water glass twice because of lipstick.  Ladies bathroom filthy. Sever dropped off check and never returned.  I waited at the register for someone to check me out while the cook peered out the pass through and smiled.  I was the only patron in the restaurant.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Always consistent and tasty. Best pineapple curry in town. Only knock is they don't accept their reward card if take out? Why??!"}
{"text":"Meh. Not the best I've had. There was a hair in our rice so we didn't eat that. I won't return however."}
{"text":"Really like the food everything was so good. Tried the papaya salad with shrimp. It only comes out with three shrimp on top, but the salad it so tasty. Hubby ordered the yellow curry also very good. Ordered a mango sticky rice to bring home and also loved that. We will be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while but they are now serving much smaller portions for carry out which seem more like lunch size portions than dinner sized. The rice was either undercooked or way over cooked and dry. I suspect the latter since putting it in the microwave under a wet paper towel did not result in a difference in the hard dry texture. I have always ordered the chicken panang and, in addition to being half the portion size, it didn't have nearly as many vegetables this time and the chicken was a bit over cooked. Other than being able to order and pay ahead through Yelp, this was a disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Lunch portions are filling. My favorites: drunken noodles and Panang curry. Chicken satay is done well too."}
{"text":"This is a cute place, but our experience was horrible tonight.  We were seated within 10 minutes, but it took over 50 minutes to get our food.  After about 40+ minutes my husband stopped one of the hostesses and asked her where our dinner was.  She told us we were 4th in line.  When we told her how long we had been waiting, she put our order at the front of the line.  When our dinners finally came, my husband and I were floored.  His Mongolian beef was tough, watery and tasteless,  There were hardly any veges in the dish.  My Thai pad chicken was NOT good either.  The noodles were way undercooked and the dish was bland.  Hardly any chicken, veges, egg or peanuts--mainly a pile of pasty, hard noodles.  We were never asked if we needed anything until the end of the meal.  By that time, we had had it.  We won't go back.  These guys won't be in business long with such terrible service and food."}
{"text":"A great Thai place with outstanding Thai dishes. The green beans with Kang\" curry is my fav ! Coconut milk is the source of this flavorful curry sauce.   The folks here are so friendly and genuine with their smiles and great service that make this place a true stand  out. I loved it so much I cane back for lunch 2 days later!    Great portions great value and prices for awesome quality!  Can't wait to try other dishes soon! Yum !"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of co-workers for lunch. It was so delicious (and piping hot) that I took my husband there for lunch the very next day.  Service is great, and they had enough spice for my husband, who likes it very, very spicy. I don't love spicy that much, so I had fried rice - best I've ever had.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Had the side salad and duck boat noodle soup. The soup had ALL the right fixin's,  EXCEPT the duck was very tough and dry. Boo! I'll try it again and hopefully I get a chance to change my review."}
{"text":"This food was very delicious. Atmosphere was calm and comfortable. The food was delicious. I had a seafood boat soup. There were flavors that I've never tasted before and I like spicy food.   Don't pass up the opportunity to have a meal here. The service was great. Did I mention that the food was delicious? The price was reasonable as well. My wife and I will return for more gastronomic enjoyment."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. I really like the Drunken Noodle and their Thai tea is great. The service can be slow when they get busy so I try to avoid going when I need to get out in a hurry. I have been going there since they opened and will continue."}
{"text":"Superb costumer service! The food is amazing and delicious. I have tried many things on the menu everything was made with care and perfection.   Great atmosphere as well.  The ambiance is delightful. I recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I live in South East Asia and eat Thai food a few times a week. This restaurant has an authentic chef and the quality of the food reflects in the experience and freshness of the dishes we ordered.  Tom Yum Kong soup was excellent.   Green curry dishes was fresh and tasty, with the coconut and curry tastes perfectly balanced.   Combo fried rice had a great flavor and generous portions of meat and seafood.   Overall the excellent service and tasty food convinces me to give a 5 star review.  My Mom and Dad live nearby and recommended this restaurant and we all went. We will go back home but Mom and Dad will continue to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service if the owner is not there.  We have been 3 times.  First visit was good.  The last two were very disappointing.  We will not go back!  Entrees for our table of four arrived at least 7-10 minutes ahead of  the last two entrees.  It was all one check - no excuse.  Appetizer - we had to remind her after the last entrees arrived that we ordered an app.  She said, 'ok, I will discount it'.   She removed 80 CENTS from our $100+ check.    Seriously?  We were half finished with our entrees when she finally brought the app, way over cooked, and she thinks 80 CENTS will make up for of their blunders?   The attitude of the wait staff was 'we were an inconvenience'.   We waited quite awhile for the server to approach us after we were seated.  She wanted to take our order without first getting drinks for us.  Additional drinks?  A member of our party walked up to the bar himself, at one point, to get 1 drink that was missed in our 'reorder' of 3 drinks.  When we said we did not have enough flatware/napkin rolls, they brought 4 plates and 2 knives. Three different people waited on us and all were apathetic, lacked even the most basic of customer service skills and completely disorganized.    Trip 2 was on marginally better than trip 3. Forgot the app, food overcooked, had to beg for a drink refill and drink order.  Beware!  Food is nothing to brag about.  Don't waste your money - go to Pho instead."}
{"text":"I have only tried the seafood boat noodle soup and all I can say is WOW! The flavor of the broth with all the spices is a party for the tastebuds! If you like pho, you will love this dish! It is like pho that has been kicked up to another level, which I did not know was possible. Very pretty inside with beautiful Thai decor. Service was prompt and friendly even though we showed up with 20 minutes to closing! I have dreams of this soup and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great find as I was going through Arizona to California from Texas. I can't compare to other restuarants around the area since I don't live there but my family and I really enjoyed our meals. The Thai food is good. I was surprised by the meal that I even tried the Thai desserts. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of Chandler Heights you will be met with a friendly staff.  Came over for lunch, lots of specials.  I enjoyed the drunken noodles over the pad Thai.  I recommend the chicken satay over the egg roles."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. The eggplant dish with veggies, \"Thai Hot\" was spot on. It was made with fresh chilis giving it a kick butt hot. Washed down with cold sake and plenty of water..:). This is most definitely a go to, for good Thai. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"So excited to find this nice clean place here in south Chandler! We ordered lunch, yellow curry and shrimp fried rice. Both very good. Nice and not greasy either. Excellent server as well. Great fresh salad with a few dressing options.  We will be back soon! Thank you Silk!"}
{"text":"So nice to finally have a very good Thai restaurant in our neighborhood.  Owners are very nice, and their staff is also very nice.  I have been here now three times, and all three have been good experiences.  Everything that I ordered has been delivered as ordered, and the spice level is true to what they say it will be.  Outdoor patio will be nice when the weather returns to good out here. Wish that they poured something other than just wine and beer."}
{"text":"We've eaten here about six times now and I've enjoyed each experience.  My favorite is the green curry with chicken.   The servers differ so much in their personality and we certainly enjoy some more than others.   I most often see the owner (I think?) during lunch time visits and he's always helpful and seemingly wanting to do a good job.  As a small business owner myself, I really appreciate when another business owner is really trying to do a good job.  The massuman curry is the best we've had in this area."}
{"text":"Wow! This was delicious and such authentic Thai food. Drove out from Phoenix and totally worth it!! My compliments to the chef.  I understand they do uber eats, door dash and Postmates, only wish I lived close enough. East valley you're lucky! A true gem."}
{"text":"Best Thai in South Chandler! Beautiful ambience and great service. Just ate the pad kapow, beef panang, pad Thai, basil fried rice. All flavorful and delicious. Their spice level is 1-5. I love spicy but go with a 1-2 on your first visit. You can always add spice!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in food. Had noodle dish which had a strong fishy smell to it. Potstickers appeared to be frozen and out of a box. Will not be back too many other decent options in Chandler. Service was ok but did not seem to care that the noodles smelled like fish.        Thanks Kevin for your reply, I appreciate your concern. We will try again in the near future."}
{"text":"Ate here at lunch time mid week. There weren't many customers. The green curry chicken was very good. Quality meat and vegetables: perfectly seasoned. However the server was standing at the bar on her lap top. It looked like some kind of business but so is serving your customers. Both myself and a gentlemen were in her line of sight and she never looked up. I called out I was ready to order at the same time he did. Mid way through my meal another of the five people in the place had to come around a corner to get her attention. About this time another server came to work with a look in her face of \"wish I weren't here\". Bummer as the food was good."}
{"text":"Husband and I went out for dinner Friday night dinner. Got there just after happy hour... Darn.   There were about 6 tables seated with the hostess and 1 server. Service was good by both.   Food: we shared the spring rolls to start. Very filling and fresh. (Not store bought).  We then shared Tom yum soup.  Very hearty- a bit on the sweeter side not as sour as I'm used to. Lots of chicken.   Entrees:  my husband loves Pad Thai and always orders it at every restaurant. Great heat at #4 (we like to get the sniffles from our heat factor).  The spice mixture is very good as they make it in house.  I would have never guessed by looking at the dish, it was going to be that spicy.   I ordered #21- Bangkok Cashew Nut- #4 heat-- which our server suggested (not the heat but the dish ;) ). To me, the dish was way to sweet for my liking--- maybe the cashews made it a bit sweeter as  well.   Overall, I would definitely return. Next time for happy hour. ;)"}
{"text":"When I move to Arizona I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get truly spicy Thai food, Silk is definitely filled that need. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in Chandler."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in chandler! Used to live In Southern cal which we had some amazing Thai food, and this place is right up with it!  Tham khai soup is delicious and the drunken noddles are my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I had the basil eggplant with steamed tofu and it was perfectly spiced. The four star rating is from the slow service. I'm not sure if our server was new or not but he seemed rather scatterbrained the whole meal. But I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a whim the other night, and it was pretty darn good. Not great, but then I'm sure they are working out the kinks. It was a Wednesday night and yet took quite a while to be acknowledged and seated and to have our order taken. At one point some busboy delivered water and said that the waiter would be right there to take our order, and he already had. So I think just some internal flow disconnects that like I said will undoubtedly be worked out as they are in business longer. The food was very good, no problems there. It had a neat patio seating area with interesting water and fire features. Classy but comfortable. Check it out and help it stay in business! We need good restaurants in the Ocotillo area of Chandler!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take-out about a half a dozen times using the Yelp24 online app - and it's awesome. The food is consistently good. We love the Pad Kee Mao, Jade wraps (veggie spring rolls) and the Chicken Satay appetizer. We like really spicy food but this is where this place falls a little short, it's never quite hot enough even when we request \"spicy.\" But that's such a personal thing - if you like your food Thai hot, I would suggest very spicy here. My in-laws have ordered the Pad Thai and Chow Mein and loved them both. The green curry was so so on the day we had it. Overall we love how easy it is order online and it's close by for us. We're happy they are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I went back since there is a NEW owner.  It's much better now.  Great peanut dressing for the salad and the drunken noodles were so delicious and full of flavor!  The fried rice was ok, much better when you add more tomato, cilantro, and salt to it.  I Would definitely come back for the noodles again!"}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try on a Friday night.  We were seated right away, but it took about 5 minutes for our server to approach us.  The BF's attempts to order a beer didn't go so well.  Every beer he ordered off the beer list, they didn't have.  Finally settled for a Kirin I think.  We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer.  They came out still cold in the middle which means they're cooked from frozen.  We sent them back, but our food was out before we got another order of spring rolls.  My Pad See Ew was pretty good, but the BF didn't care for his Thai Fried Rice.  He thought it was very bland.  The second set of spring rolls were still barely warm in the middle.  With so many great Thai places around, I doubt we'll be back to this one."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a buy one get one lunch meal. I ordered the Pad Thai and the Drunken Noodles dish for lunch with the family. Both were the tofu versions. The Pad Thai had a good amount of tofu in it and the taste was really good (strong flavor of the wok). The Drunken Noodles also tasted great and had a good texture to the noodles as well (also a strong flavor of the wok). Both ended up being a hit at home and I'll definitely be returning given the price point.  I think the only thing holding back this place from getting the full blown 5 stars was the constrained lunch menu versus the rest of their menu. It would have been great to expand their lunch menu to encapsulate a larger menu selection.  Overall, I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Very good!!! Quality and portion is perfect. I would go back. Please note this place is packed!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night and I was simply impressed!  The decor, the service and of course the food was superb!  A family owned and run authentic Thai food restaurant.  My friend and I both ordered the red and green coconut chicken currie which was too die for awesome!  We chatted up the business owner about his native country Thailand and had fun learning a few phrases in the Thai language.  I give my experience there at Silk True Asian five stars and it is well deserved!"}
{"text":"First visit Saturday at1:45pm Light crowd Good food fresh and flavorful Service quick We will come again"}
{"text":"I took my 15 y/o daughter for a dad/daughter date night.  I want to start off to explain that I typically give a new place two tries, just in case it was a bad experience in which we all have time to time, but this was different...  So the two of us walked in and after a few minutes a lady greeted us and asked if we would like to sit outside.  The waitress pointed through the glass window at a table and asked us to go on ahead of her and have a seat.  When we walked over to the table, it still had dirty dishes and glasses on it from the previous people.  We went ahead and sat down and waited for someone.  After 20 minutes, someone came out and asked if they could take our drink order and then started to clean the table.  As I was about to ask for tea, she stopped me and said they are having free beer and wine.  WOW, this will definitely make up for the dirty table.  She said she would send someone out to talk to us about what they were offering and she quickly left with the dirty dishes.  I stopped her before she could leave to ask if we could please get some water while we waited.  She nodded with a little frustration because she was obviously very busy.  Thirty minutes later she came back with water for us.  We had not seen anyone until now.  She filled our water glasses and asked us what we would like to order.  I went ahead and ordered our food, Pad Thai and Pad SeeEw Noodles, seafood.  When she said took down our order she took our one menu we had to share and started to walk away, but I stopped her and reminded her that we are still waiting on our drink orders.  She apologized and said she would send someone right out.    Twenty minutes later, a waitress carrying a plate came outside and was seeking the table the dish belonged to.  She was too far away to get her attention without yelling across the patio, so I waited to see if it was one of our dishes when she would come over our direction.  She asked the first few tables then went back inside.  I saw her ask another server inside and she pointed to us through the window.  When she arrived, it was our Pad Thai.  She put it down in front of us with 1 chop stick and quickly walked away.  Ater about five minutes, I looked atm y daughter and said we would go ahead and take turns because it was getting cold.  She was starving and so was I.  Not classy of us I know, but I figured it was a new business and wouldn't stop us from turning it into a funny moment to remember.  Another fifteen minutes later, the Pad SeeEw was brought out and the server quickly turned to walk away.  I stopped her and asked if we could get a second pair of chop sticks or silverware please.  She said OK and came right back with some.  We both took a bite and the seafood was not only undercooked, it was completely raw.  I love sushi, but this was beyond inedible.  I told her not to eat anymore of it and we both finished the Pad Thai.    It was a new restaurant, so I figured they need to organize and we would try it again in a couple of months and laughed it off.  After waiting for a check for another twenty minutes, I told my daughter that I would teach her the proper way to complain, without being rude or inconsiderate.  It was a teaching moment.  I got up and sought after a server and asked for a check and told her the problem of the uncooked seafood.  She asked if we would please sit back down at our table and she would send over the manager.  I told her I wanted to pay for the Pad Thai only, and we really wanted to leave, but she insisted that we must talk to the manager.  Reluctantly we went back to our table and waited.  A few minutes later the manger came out and addressed the table next to us asking if they had a problem.  They said no, and I put my arm up and quietly said that was us.  He turned to us and asked what was wrong.  So I told him everything.  Again this was a teaching moment for my daughter on how to be polite, but complain.  After all, constructive criticism is a good way to learn and grow.  We figured we would try it again in a couple of months.  They just needed to work the \"bugs\" out.  He said ok when I told him and I asked him for the check for the Pad Thai.  He said one moment and walked away.  A few minutes later the bartender came out and asked the table next to us if they had a complaint for him.  They said no and looked at us.  Obviously, the manager sent him out.  Now we were embarrassed.  When he turned to us, we said no to him and he went in.  The original server came back out to us and handed us our check and said she had heard what we said and walked away.  We were both mortified and felt like we had acted inappropriately and ashamed.  The check was for $16.00+ for the Pad Thai.  I paid it, but was completely surprised that the manager didn't simply let us go with an apology and hope that we would give them a try again in a couple of months.  Because of how they made us feel, we will not be going back to them again"}
{"text":"Theee WORST Thai food EVER.  I paid 17.00 for soup that 95% went down the garbage disposal!  It had sour smelling chicken, the toughest calamari ever and muscles that were just weird looking!  And the broth was full of sugar!  Just f-in awful!"}
{"text":"eat more Thai food and drink more wine! I still think this place is tasty. So!!! Eat more spicy flavorful Thai food!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and i eat a lot of Thai food! Peanut sauce is a good indicator and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"After reading a couple negative reviews, we decided to give this new restaurant in our neighborhood a fair chance to either earn a return visit or not.  We were delighted to eat on the patio around 8 p.m. on a Friday night, because the noise inside made conversation difficult.  Part of this problem was due to the crowd and an open kitchen with clattering dishes, but mostly it was due to the hard surfaces and lack of acoustical tiles. This might not be a problem for those with perfect hearing, but if one has challenges, eating outside eliminates any problem.    We were greeted by the owner, Pon, who I recognized as having worked previously at Pho Chandler; she also recognized me, which was nice.  Another waitress came by our table frequently, making sure we had water right away and following up to make sure we were served in a timely manner.  We ordered the summer rolls, which came with a delicious peanut sauce, and Tom Ka Coconut Soup with chicken.  Sometimes chicken in this soup is tough, but this was tender and tasty.  The spice level was perfect--unless you accidentally chewed some of the root.  Most of the menu is Thai-inspired, but Mongolian Beef was more Chinese in influence, and it was tasty as well.  I was also happy to see the TV sets were not turned to F(o)aux News, as some other neighborhood restaurants are.  That kind of vitriol and fear-mongering has no place in a restaurant or other public place, imho.  Our bill was brought promptly on request, and I'm happy to enter a good review for the \"new kid in the neighborhood.\""}
{"text":"Silk is a very chill place. I really enjoy the atmosphere. The food  does not taste like authentic asian food. However, for an asian fusion, it is very good. The price is great...similar to many other fusion restaurants. I believe they can better the salad bar though. They do not have ranch dressing. I know that it is an asian place, but ranch dressing is the most basic. During my visit, it was more Caucasian, so i firmly believe that they should cater the salad bar not only to asians. Other than that, the place was clean and the service was fast. Some of the servers were more rude though (i guess what can you expect from an asian restaurant right?)"}
{"text":"I ordered to go from Silk True Asia since one of my favorite thai restaurant was closed. Food was good, not too bad, but not as good as my favorite ones...."}
{"text":"First visit Saturday night .  There were only 2 tables full, but we thought it was because it was early (6:00pm)  We were excited to see a new Thai/Asian restaurant in Chandler and were hopeful that the food would be above the usual mediocre Asian fare in town.  We were served drinks and the  staff was attentive.  (Although there were still only 2 tables full including ours.)  We ordered pad prig king with brown rice, and a noodle and vegetable dish that was recommended by our server as being one of his favorites.  If any of you have eaten at any Pei Wei anywhere, you have eaten rice  that is always cooked perfectly.  At s were served a lump of the starchiest, stickiest, and coldest brown rice I have ever seen.  The Pad Prig King was delivered without any green beans!?!?  When we asked the waiter where the beans were, he said he had placed the wrong order."}
{"text":"Good selection of lunch specials and a variety of great dishes.  Beware, anything above a mild is very spicy and could ruin your meal.  My guests all had mild spice and were struggling to finish their food the last lunch we had here.  I personally like their Tom yum style pho with chicken but will only order it mild."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very good customer service. I went for pickup and dropped my soup by accident in the parking lot. They made me a new one and I was on my way."}
{"text":"The poor reviews i read were stupid. This place is amazing. Amazing food fair prices for portions very attentive kind service. They allowed my small dog on their roomy cute patio. Will be back"}
{"text":"Did lunch, drunken noodles with chicken, nice spice and great flavor, a lot of food couldn't finish be great leftovers.  Will try Dinner soon"}
{"text":"I wish yelp had 1/2 Stars because I would give this place  3 1/2 Stars. I've seen and heard about this place for awhile now. I met some friends here for lunch for the first time. Atmosphere is descent. Service was excellent. I walked in with the expectation of eating Thai/American fast food, but when I was handed the Boat Soup Menu I was very very happy.  I had the Boat Soup #8 (pho with brisket, tripe, tendon, meatballs). My friends had the lunch special, both had Thai Eggplant & Basil with Chicken and one with Pork. The broth in my Boat Soup was fantastic! My only complaint is that they should put much more of the meat and tripe (tiny amount of protein). The Eggplant dishes were very good, good portion size. The lunches came with a choice of Egg Drop Soup which I'm not a fan of OR Salad Bar. I chose the salad bar, which was very weak, they could definitely improve in that area.  Atmosphere descent, Service excellent, Food was good."}
{"text":"Good food. Great ambiance  (sat outside). Great location. Service was slow.  I had a chicken pad thai and a chicken curry dish.Took home mango sticky rice and loved the suprise of the heart shaped rice. They had some unique dishes i haven't seen before that I'm interested in trying. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Mom and pops place - convenient location ordered Penang curry (veggie) - was not disappointed. Portion size was generous; I love yuphas but this is definite a second close"}
{"text":"Great for take out. The pad Thai was pretty great and the coconut soup was amazing flavor and filling. But overall a great place for Thai."}
{"text":"Great little Thai spot hidden off the beaten track.  I love their yellow curry, spiced just enough to make your brow sweat.   An important factor for me is the potato.  Too many places have them undercooked, this spot nails it every time."}
{"text":"Incredible service. I had the Yellow curry and loved it! Great glass of malbec too! Cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"The food is so good that we went twice in one week!  Our 15-year-old granddaughter loved it too.  Hope it stays for a LONG time."}
{"text":"New owners John and Susan have really taken this spot up a notch!  Delicious food and beautiful space in a great location. Spicy eggplant and Tom ka ga soup are fantastic. Be sure to try this if you're in south Chandler and live Thai food."}
{"text":"Very good Thai ( and fusion) in So. Chandler. Authentic and freshly delicious. Solid service in modestly elegant setting. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I go out of my way to support small, locally owned businesses but Silk is inconsistent with food preparation. When it's good, it's good but other times not so much. My biggest pet peeve with them is they say they are open until 9:00pm but if you walk in at 8:30pm they make you take your food to go only; no table service. Not a good business decision."}
{"text":"We really like this place. The lunch special is an amazing deal. The food is delicious and the service is very good.  I like their big patio as well."}
{"text":"placed order online and went to pickup. Waiter couldn't find my order---he didn't know they accept online order. Paid with credit card and after 20 minutes waiting, the same waiter asked me \"are you paying cash or what?\" oh shit my signed receipt is there on the table. Taste is just average, and over priced. No need to visit again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time. I stopped my on two separate occasions and they were closed. I was really looking forward to having lunch here with my girlfriend on a Friday afternoon when they were open. Our server was awful. There was only our table and one other table being served. She never took our drink order, she forgot my side item, which I ended up asking another server to bring over. She sat on a barstool by the counter and never checked to see if we needed anything. There are too many other good restaurants to except this level of customer service."}
{"text":"Dr bfFood is always tasty and ceeeeecn rsjxnnuusxxcguvportions are big. Friendly RRGrz customer service.  I had the pad thai rchicken level 3 and it hit the spot.iij dd.  W.  fF"}
{"text":"I visited S T A for lunch today with my wife and kids.  My kids are picky eaters but both seemed to like their food.  My wife and I both agreed our food was good and would return for dinner and try something different. I won't say this was the best Thai food I have ever had, but it tasted good to me and worth a return trip.   I think they could do a few things to improve but nothing that I would consider major.     On another note I must say I had read the other negative reviews and was a little shocked.  I found out about this place by my neighbor who said they had a good meal.  I think if I had relied on yelp alone I would not have tried this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like Asian food and have eaten st some fantastic places and this place rates up at the top. The food was fresh, flavorful and hot. The wait staff attentive and friendly. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"We got take out and were very pleased with the quality and quantity of food.  I can't speak to the ambiance of the restaurant since we did take out, we will go back and find out.   My tom kha soup with vegetables was excellent.  I also tried the Thai dumplings #2. Those were delicious. The ginger soy sauce was great with it.   I had the yellow curry with chicken. Perfect!   My fiancé had the pad cha wild lamb and he said it was excellent.  He also had the jade rolls which were fresh and flavorful.   Their mild was a bit spicy so I recommend caution with the heat. Medium would have been too much for me.   I'm really pleased with Silk. They did a great job with our to go order.  I'm looking forward to eating there next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. We go here very often.   Great food, a friendly atmosphere, good patio seating. Attentive service. The owner is awesome! And really nice people."}
{"text":"I give this place 4.5 stars. I have never had a bad meal here. My wife & I live locally and eat here 2-3x/month.  Staff is always friendly and provide great service.  If you are looking for a great Thai place in Chandler with a very affordable menu, I highly recommend Silk!"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE Silk!  The food is so flavorful, and delicious!!   My husband and I always get the peppered chicken dish (medium spicy).  They really know how to season their food, so when you order use cation with the spice factor!  Atmosphere is comfortable and clean and they have just updated their patio - which looks very inviting.  Service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Dropping my review down a star because they forgot to put my ticket in yesterday and it took all of forty minutes to get my food. I understand that accidents happen but you would think with my husband and I sitting there not having received one order after such a long time they would have some urgency in getting my order out. I only have an hour for lunch and it takes almost ten minutes to get to and from the restaurant so I basically waited my entire lunch break to get my food to go. The owner blamed in on new chefs but everyone else around me received their order within a decent amount of time. My husband received his spring roll order though and they were great."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time as we are new to the neighborhood.  This place is excellent, their menu you has a lot of options but not overwhelming.  They have a lot of traditional Thai recipes that go above and beyond the norm.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back!"}
{"text":"We frequent several Thai restaurants in Chandler and Silk is our new favorite. Everything we tried was very fresh and delicious. We had the fresh rolls with avocado and pad see iew. It was easily enough for two. The server was friendly and helpful. Overall we had an outstanding experience and highly recommend Silk."}
{"text":"I came here for takeout yesterday and was sooooo disappointed. I ordered the lemongrass wings and sweet basil fried rice and a Thai tea. I sat at the bar for about 5 minutes before I asked to be helped or was really even greeted. It was somewhat busy, to be fair so I'm less upset about that. The wings were the smallest chicken wings I've ever seen and had no lemongrass flavoring. The fried rice was sticky and mushy; I've had Thai fried rice plenty of times but never this basil fried rice. I asked for medium spicy and there was no spice whatsoever. I got home (8-10 min later) and ate 2 bites of each and couldn't eat anymore.  It seems like a somewhat popular neighborhood spot so maybe I came on an off night but I wouldn't return. Perhaps the dish is supposed to be mushy? Either way I was not happy. I HATE leaving low ratings for places but this was just too disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout: Chicken Pad Thai, Red Curry with Chicken and Mango Sticky Rice. I ordered the Pad Thai spicy and the Red Curry medium- both were beyond hot, thus the 4.5 stars.   I have to say this is the very first time at any Thai restaurant that I've been given as much mango as I was (perfect)!   There are no downsides to this review: super clean restaurant when I went in, not crowded, pleasant staff, food was hot. I think if my food would've been truly medium and not spicy, I would've eaten more than a few bites because it was very flavorful! We will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go...crab puffs (or whatever they call them...in any event when I got home I ended up with egg rolls...or whatever they call them).  Also ordered pad thai and yellow curry.  Egg rolls were ok.  Although I would have liked to have got what I ordered (crab puffs).  Pad thai was good.  Not overly sweet like others I've had.  The curry was also good.  I asked for both dishes mild.  Unlike most thai places I've been to, mild actually means mild.  There was a time I could eat spicy food, but that time has passed, so actually getting mild when you order mild is a good thing."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was at least over a year ago. Since we were craving for Thai food tonight, we figured we would give it another try again. For appetizer, we ordered the spring roll. It was a bit blend but the peanut sauce helps out with the flavoring. For main entrée, we ordered Tom Yum noodles. The broth was delicious and flavor able. I will order it again. The crab meat fried rice was my favorite. The crab meat portion was generous and the overall dish is absolutely delicious.   I really wish I had room to try their dessert. I'll definitely come back here again to try something else."}
