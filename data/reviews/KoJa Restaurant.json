{"text":"I've been here a few times sampling from the Korean and Japanese sides of the menu but my favourite was definitely anything that included their black rice. It tastes fantastic with all of their dishes.   The atmosphere is nice and casual, but beware of sitting too close to the kitchen. This doesn't always happen but the last time I went there they were cooking fish in the kitchen and I walked out smelling like it. Otherwise this is a great place! I live nearby and this is definitely one place I frequent."}
{"text":"great place for lunch. things are priced so well.  portions are huge. food is fresh. love the korean rice they use."}
{"text":"My favourite place for affordable, healthy sushi! BEST VEGETARIAN ROLL EVER! I took my vegetarian friend here and we've been back a few times. Everything is always fresh, crunchy, filling and just absolutely delicious! I love the purple rice too. Seriously, best vegetarian roll (and I'm a meat eater!). They make vegetables taste THAT good! Note: their sushi and rolls is on the sweeter than savoury side. If anything, it made the food more refreshing and light."}
{"text":"Sushi was good but the service was absolutely terrible. The place is tiny so it's not like there were a million tables (there were 4 other than ours). Took an extremely long time to come over and take orders, they never bothered to bring water which was ordered twice, and we waited so long for our bills and then for the machine to pay our bills, we almost walked out. The sushi is not worth the brutal service."}
{"text":"3/5! Great maki (wrapped in purpule rice). The Medium Boat platter is a lot of food for 3 people so recommend ordering the Small version. Overall, the fish was fresh but the rolls were typical/average. If you want a unique experience try some of their original rolls. Next time, we would definitely order to speciality rolls over the boat."}
{"text":"Hands down my best sushi experience! The purple rice, quality and portions is why I travel almost an hour just for Koja Sushi!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch while in Liberty Village today. I'd been once a couple years ago and was unimpressed but decided to give it a second shot.  Glad I did. Had a simple and delicious lunch. For $14 including tax and tip, I had tea, soup and a yummy bowl of beef bibimbop. Everything was piping hot, and the fried egg gave a beautiful runny yolk to stir into the mix. A bit of hot sauce and soy sauce and it was a perfect lunch dish. The hot stone bowl left delicious nuggets of crunchy rice and noodles for me to scrape up and enjoy at the end.   Yum!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place all the time before finally deciding to stop in. What a surprise - great service and great sushi. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"They have purple rice, which is a korean rice known to be a combination of black, white and brown rices. It's full of flavour, and the sushi is incredible. The rolls are big, and the spicy salmon actually has a hint of lemon. It's just so delicious. Highly recommend for good quality sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi is so so. Beware of the menu ordered twice from here.  First time ordered 3 different rolls with \"crab\" turns out all the crab is imitation. Pretty typical that cheap places use imitatio crab.  Second day we order we skipped everything with \"crab\"  but did notice for $10.95 they did have a spider roll...  which is listed as deep fried softshell crab with avocado and cucumber.   Picked up my order didn't notice till we got home that they charged me $12.95.  They I had a bite and guess what the deep fried soft shelled crab is actually a piece of imitation crab they deep fried???  So what they did was take a California roll that they charge $4.95 for and deep fried the imitation crab then charged me $12.95.  When I phoned back the guy pretended he didn't speak English."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Toronto!  Luckily I live near here so I'm in it all the time! Their rolls are huge and so cheap for what you get.  Have had so many different things on the menu and never been disapointed.   Only thing I'd say is to never get takeaway as it has been pretty bad whenever I have gotten it. No idea why but they don't do takeaway well :(  They also play the beatles but it's covers by a traditional japanese band, it's hilarious!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they take forever to serve the food, a big turn off for such a nice place."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall style sushi place, extensive list and even request for things not on the list can be obtained. Location is right in the heart of liberty village with amazing decor and an awesome Japanese staff.  In a personal lover of shasimi  (raw fish no rice or role)  Pros - location , freshness  Cons - nothing really. Maybe because bathroom is downstairs but that seems the normal in toronto"}
{"text":"Love this place. We've tried several places in this area but for us it's a best sushi place. Not really spendy and signature rolls are really big - you can order 1 for 2 people. And all sushi are made with mixture of rice which is good for you. And btw soy sause isn't that salty like in other nearby places (which is also good for you)"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in TO. Absolutely love it! Las Vegas roll is A MUST try! The staff is always nice and food is always outstanding. I usually do pick up simply because i live close by , however, this place is definitely worth a visit even if you live on the other side of the city. 5 stars without any doubts!"}
{"text":"Ordered two rolls for dinner last night through Ritual. Spent all night throwing up the sushi. Definite food poisoning."}
{"text":"The food and sushi here is actually quite good. I would've given this place 4 stars based on the food alone. (Or maybe it was just because it's literally the only edible sushi joint in this area.) Anyway, this place is pretty unique because they made their sushi with black rice. I used to come here at least once a week.   BUT... OMG... the female server that works here is so surly towards me. She's always in a bad mood. I don't know why. It's so awkward to sit on the table as she begrudgingly brings food over without saying a word and/or her rolling her eyes.   The last straw was when I came to do a take-out over and she overcharged me (didn't realize it til I left) and she didn't even look at me when she dropped my order off to me.   So happy I moved far away and never have to come back here ever again."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for dinner last night. It's cosy inside, decorated with umbrellas, and tables are partitioned with screens for a little more privacy. It looks small, but apparently there is a basement level to be seated in as well. They have some interesting music in the background (think Asian-flavoured Greensleeves). Right away the server greets you with a bright \"hello!\" and brings you a warm mug of barley tea. It was my first time trying barley tea, and it was wonderful and comforting. I will have to see if I can find some at the market!   The two of us shared the sushi pizza ($10), sushi dinner (18pcs - $17), and ordered the scallop skewer ($8), but cancelled the skewer when we found out it was imitation scallop (?) It turned out to be the perfect amount of food, plus two scoops of mango ice cream each and free pineapple for dessert. The sushi pizza was the best I've ever had, no exaggeration. The crust was a mixture of white and black rice, which looks more interesting and is also healthier. There is a lovely sweet character to the rice which tastes a bit like raisin or date. Perhaps it was a type of vinegar I'm not familiar with. The crunch and sweetness of the rice base perfectly offset the roe, salmon pieces and various sauces. Texture, taste, and presentation were all on point. The sushi dinner was okay. It was 10 pieces of assorted sushi which were not fresh, and included one piece of a white and red fish with a band of seaweed around the middle which was not for me. It had the consistency of dried apricot and about the same taste but in fish form. At least they again had the mix of white and black rice that was really good. The 8 pieces of dynamite maki were better, not quite rolled tight enough which made for some tricky handling. The sushi dinner comes with miso soup and a green salad with a nice mild vinegar dressing.  The service was a little slow but he was nice and they were busy. It was also nice to hear the other tables around us complimenting the food. I'm a fan of the sushi pizza and barley tea!"}
{"text":"Went in with a friend for lunch (2:00 PM) on a Friday, only a few other people in the restaurant. The restaurant itself is a little clustered in layout and would benefit from more open space.   As we were sat, we were served a hot tea -- I'm not sure the flavour. We informed the server we'd need a minute to look at the menu.   We decided on starting with one wonton soup each followed by small sushi and maki platter, a total of 30 pieces for around $30. We let the server know we'd like a can of beer each, but to serve it with the sushi.   The wonton soup was delicious. Fresh vegetables, a flavourful broth and two big dumplings.   The server then brought the platter and beer. The nigiri were smaller than expected, but the maki was bigger than expected. There was a good selection of nigiri, but only one of some kinds of fish, making it hard to share. The nigiri also did not have wasabi between the fish and rice, just as a note. Nevertheless, it was all fresh and tasty.   Apparently we were pretty hungry, so we ordered another small roll each -- I had the spicy tuna, and my friend had the tuna and avocado. Both were great.   Overall, relatively cheap for good sushi. Would go back."}
{"text":"Great to eat in. Not so good for take out. It almost feels like experiences from 2 different restaurants.  Service in is fantastic. Attentive, fresh fish, love the black rice, beautiful presentation, great seating area.  I've ordered for take out twice from here and the rolls were a mess and seaweed was soggy. Maki rolls are almost too big."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot. Sashimi is pretty fresh and portions are really generous for the price. I had the chirashi before and they give you a pretty good assortment of fish, especially given it was like $13? Presentation was cute as well (in a fish bowl)! People seem to love that they serve purple rice( mix of white, black and brown rice), unique choice and healthy as well! Service is friendly..but definitely hard to get anyone's attention when sitting downstairs. Anyways, definitely will be here often for lunch!"}
{"text":"Another Liberty Village lunch staple. Cute decoration (love their glass), dimly lit place, nice open patio to eat outside. Suffering the same problem as their Japanese cuisine neighbour 'InJapan' in that their food is highly forgettable. I would've given this place a 3.5 though just because their glass noodles has some flavour and chicken cutlet is a little bigger. Also purple rice.  On Ritual."}
{"text":"Came here for a bite during the night. I was immediately heart eyes when I saw they used purple rice!! My favourite has to be the Boston roll. I also ordered beef gyozas but it tastes frozen from the package and was awfully rubbery sooo I wouldn't recommend ordering that.. Everything else was good though from service, friendly staff and presentation. They also gave us a small cup of bite sized pineapples to top it all off."}
{"text":"Went again after a week. Tried the diablo roll. An absolute must if u go here. It's my new favorite! Bibimbop was also very good although I had to load it up with hot sauce and mix it myself. They could consider mixing it in front of u. That will enhance the experience. Spicy tuna roll was good too. Service was very good as usual. Koja continues to impress."}
{"text":"This is such a gem; it's really convenient, because it's in my neighbourhood, but if I ever moved, I think I would come back to this hood just to visit this restaurant. They have fresh food with great presentation, fast take out, decent korean dishes to satisfy your korean food craving in a pinch and delicious rolls. The boats are huge and has great variety. The price isn't on the cheaper side, but I think you definitely get quality and good portions for the little more that you might pay compared to other cheap sushi places. I particularly enjoy their rice paper rolls (along with the usuals) and the kanpoongi.   It's not a showy place, but great for weeknights and take out. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Practically came here on a whim and decided to give it a whirl. Ended up ordering a platter containing sashimi pieces of salmon, white tuna, otoro albacore, jack mackerel, surf clam, toro (fatty tuna belly), as well as purple-rice sushi and interestingly enough, vermicelli-wrapped sushi which I never see at other places that I venture to. The vermicelli-wrapped sushi had a nice crunch to it and had a blanketed drizzle of spicy mayo as a nice added touch so I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. The entire platter was about $36 and does not come with miso soup, so be prepared to have that as an added charge.  The ambiance was fairly quiet as my guest and I were one of the only other customers here, however as we were enjoying our meal, there were plenty others who came in to pick up for take-out. The vicinity in itself is fairly small considering it sits on a block meshed with other small restaurants and towards the end of the meal, music started playing in the background so that was kind of an odd ending to the night, but at least there was a TV playing some CP24 in the background to drown out the stillness of the chatter. I would recommend this place, but they don't do ayce sushi (all you can eat)."}
{"text":"Sushi and noodle are always good there. I usually ordered the noodle combo and the portion is always generous. I just wished that they have an alternative to their purple rice. I'm not a big fan. I would have preferred white rice instead. Basically I'm stuck ordering sashimi or noodle every time I go there since their rice dishes are all made with purple rice. Given that the place is small, they are able to accommodate their clients pretty fast. Service is fast and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Liberty Village hands down. The care they put into playing and making the food is exceptional. You can't go wrong with ordering the combo, great bang for your buck. The purple rice makes KoJa stand out. I highly recommend KoJa."}
{"text":"Koja unfortunately was just okay. They have this purple rice, so our friend wanted to try it. I got a bulgogi be to box. The meat and veggies were tasty. The meat reminded me of ground beef (in a bad way) but the flavor was fantastic. It comes with the purple rice (which was dry) and it had a deeper flavor than most rice which was pleasant. The glass noodles were a little funky tasting but had a normal texture. The sushi served was stuffed with tempura fried sweet potato and the texture was less than pleasant as the fried sweet potato quickly became salty. I have to be honest though, for $10 you can't expect much else for this much Japanese food. I had a large hot sake and it was pleasant. Not a terrible place but certainly not amazing. It should be noted that the fish filled sushi was tasty and reliable."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best and cheapest sushi in Toronto. Their rolls are meals themselves, and absolutely melt in your mouth. They use black rice which is high in antioxidants, and just tastes better. The service is the worst though, they only hire Koreans, and the waiters' English isn't very good at all. They are also not very attentive to refilling tea. Despite the bad service I would come back here again and again for the sushi. Their bibimbap is also delicious."}
{"text":"KoJa is a great place where to dine.  I live down the street from the restaurant and I lost the count how many time I walked in front of it being reluctant whether or not to get in because, in all fairness, it doesn't look very appealing.   The location is great, because has high traffic just at the doorstep, has a good size patio that you can certainly enjoy in summer, but inside is where it lacks of personality. Dark, fairly old looking and with the space that, in my personal opinion, could use a better design to maximize the space available.   However, let's get down to business. Fresh sushi and sashimi seems to be the normal way of running this restaurant here. I am very picky about where I eat sushi and this place is great for fresh and quality food. I find the sushi here, delicious. The food is both appealing to the eye and to the pallet. The presentation of the plate included a small bonsai tree. This is the first restaurant that isn't just making sure the quality is there, but they also pay good attention to the presentation of each dish they bring to your table.  The people that work here have always been nice and while the service I found it to be a bit slow at times, in the other hand is attentive, and so far I have never had a mistake with the order or needed to send something back because not happy with the quality.  One of the few in Toronto that are great for the balance between cost and quality! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this place for lunch! So good! Service and friendly waitresses. The food is is good and comes at a good speed! Good atmosphere fish taste fresh and even the presentation looks good! Very good location in Liberty village and easy to find. It's defiantly a place I would suggest to try if you're in Toronto for a short period!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down, this place does not pass on hygiene. While waiting for my meal I saw the staff drop several takeout lids on the floor (food side facing downwards) but continued to use them on the food.  Less than a penny to replace the lids but based on my observation & other reviews, food hygiene is clearly neither a priority or customary.  Probably not harmful most of the time but not worth the risk of food poisoning."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the full name of this place isn't up- it's called: Sushi & Bibimbop KoJa  Ordered two of their more creative rolls and man oh man...it was a MASSIVE portion. Their creative rolls are about 10-15$ and seems a bit steep for just a random sushi craving but these rolls will nock your socks off.   They are really well prepared and constructed- there is a lot of care that is put into the food here and you can tell when they serve you.  It seems Korean owned but I'm not too sure."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of work colleagues for lunch and we were seated right away. The service was quick and easy (our server was very attentive and accommodating to our food preferences). Definitely recommend getting the lunch special since you got a miso soup, salad and your sushi for a very reasonable price. All the food that came to the table was fresh and delicious. The rice was definitely an unique experience (very delicious however our server wouldn't tell us how they got the rice purple haha). I would definitely recommend coming to KoJa to di or if you just want to pick up some takeout. You definitely won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The bibimbop tastes authentic - although to be fair, the only other place I've had that dish is at Earls Kitchen. Still, the joy of mixing the bowl while it's all fresh and adding the chilli sauce makes it a fun experience.   I've also had the udon noodles - nothing crazy, can't go wrong with it."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi in toronto hands down. It just seems to have something special about it unlike any other place I've tried. The rice is delicious and the sauce they use on the yam roll is so interesting and delicious."}
{"text":"Pros: Good sushi, average sized portions for what you pay but not small.  Cons: Poor service (timing, friendliness, overall).  Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"From the outside this place does not look like anything special... and to be honest on the inside it doesn't look like anything special either (pretty sure one of the tables is in what used to be a coat closet with ikea foot stools as seats, but the food is DEEEEELISH. I always get the vegetarian special and it comes with sooooo much food (soup, salad, veggie tempura and a giant yam roll). My boyfriend always gets the salmon terriyaki and he absolutely loves it.    The atmosphere definitely leaves something to be desired, but the prices are reasonable, the service is good and the food is incredible."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place if you are looking lots of sushi and a cheaper price. My friends and I came here on a Friday evening and thought it would be busy since it was a Friday night but the restaurant was half empty. We ordered a small boat to share. You truly do get what you pay for the quality of the sushi was average but the part that made it difficult to eat is that their \"healthy\" purple rice that was used for the rolls did not keep the rolls together. I must say that this is the first sushi restaurant that I've been to where the rolls were falling apart before you can even put it in your mouth. It ended up being a waste and unpleasant to eat. Besides that the sake was pretty good, presentation wss pretty impressive and service was decent."}
{"text":"Purple rice!! Service: 5/5 - we were welcomed and seated right away. Our server even offered us free miso even though it was not included with our meal. You can tell there are a lot of regulars at this place   Food: gyoza: 5/5 - perfectly deep fried. Just be careful it's hot.  Small sushi and maki platter: 4/5 - I love the purple right and that the sushi isn't overstuffed with rice as well. Only down side is some of the fish didn't taste the freshest, which is typical for many sushi spots in Toronto but the salmon was great and so was the maki."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE sushi snob. I've eaten in a little restaurant in the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo so I can say that and not be the least bit pretentious. Okay maybe a bit pretentious. That being said I've eaten at any sushi place that will let me in the door - which is pretty much all of them since I look like I could kick ass if someone denied me my sushi.  What was I even talking about? Oh right...  So I met a friend for lunch today and she suggested this new sushi place that had just opened up in place of the old Afares Cafe in Liberty Village. The menu was pretty much as expected price wise for LV - the bento boxes were ranging from $10-14 and rolls from $6-9. I opted for the maki bento and asked the waiter what that included - fully expecting for $14 some california rolls and avacado and cucumber. He told us that it was chefs choice, different every day. So now I'm expecting egg and cucumber.   Man was I ever surprised. Not only were our green teas presented in lovely flowery English tea cups - our bento's included a very tasty (though lacking in free floating seaweed) miso soup. And what a surprise with the maki! We each had a total of three complete rolls cut into 6 pieces per. One roll was a dynamite style with eel, one was tempura shrimp bits and crab, the last was crab, egg and spicy salmon. There was also a rice ball that had a bit of crab and fruit - very interesting. Last but not least there was a tempura shrimp and yam piece.  I hardly ever feel like I get my money's worth in the overly trendy area anymore. And as far as sushi goes - RAW around the corner is pricy but unfulfilling and In Japan is a disappointment at best. Sushi+ was a surprise hit that I'll be sure to be revisiting whenever I'm back there."}
{"text":"Had the Hot Sunkist and Lobster sushi rolls along with the Galbi.  Taste (3/5): The Galbi was a little chewy and you don't really taste the lobster in the rolls. Not a fan of the purple rice as it was dry  Service (3/5): Food was served quickly, but did not get refills of the tea  Value (4/5): For the amount of sushi rolls and Galbi you receive this is a good deal as each dish is about $15-$20  The location is small and has two floors with some interesting decoration and dinnerware. Overall this is a good and quiet spot to visit."}
{"text":"I've had sushi all over town! Has to be by far the worst place! Rolls are too big you can't even stick them in your mouth fully! They break easy, the food was below par. The spicy mayo was awful. I asked for more ginger and they said they would charge me extra! REALLY!!! How ridiculous. Ginger cost dollars in china town and no other sushi place I've been has charged for more ginger. He didn't want to give us a second napkin, like it was too much to ask him for another napkin. The gyoza's were horrible as well, as if they just were defrosted and then fried, I'm praying I don't get food poisoning tomorrow! We only came here today because our normal spot on ossington BAZARA  was closed! Never again will I be back. I really hope someone will read this and trust me, if I saw a review like this I would have not gone here at all."}
{"text":"Excellent food - tasted so fresh and portions were great! Service was fast and friendly, already planning a return."}
{"text":"Just eaten at the restaurant for the second night in a row after getting take out last night. Love this place! Service is friendly, food is great, restaurant itself is pretty cool too. Defiantly try it."}
{"text":"Here's what I got: - 18 piece Sashimi Dinner, comes with rice (not sushi rice with vinegar so if you looking for that, look elsewhere) - Unagi Roll - Salmon Skin Roll  All three things were good and hit the spot. The best was the salmon skin roll. The sashimi was exactly 18 pieces and had an array of 5 different types of fish. They definitely doubled up on the salmon which I guess is common as it's the most liked but I would have liked one more variety of fish. The red tuna was too great though, it had these white cartilages which meant it wasn't high quality. They had these two seared fishes were were good though.  The price is fair value but if you want/like sushi rice, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the sushi here. Very mediocre, the crispy bits that were with the spicy Tina/Salmon were very stale. Also the spicy mayo was off.   There isn't really any good Japanese restaurants in the Liberty Village area."}
{"text":"Pros:  Great location Fast service Food served at correct temperature Customer Service The Teriyaki chicken Great meal combos Super friendly staff Price  Cons: Can't think of anything  Summary: All the staff are wonderful, they greet you with tea and all bid you farewell when you leave. Definitely tip them, they work hard!! Super amazing, I have no complaints. The decor is fun, the people are nice, etc. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place in the city!  I've been going for years, and while they've had their ups and downs, the food has been very good lately.  Everything is tasty, our favourite is the Volcano Roll!   They have great Korean dishes as well, so feel free to let your taste buds explore! Prices are pretty fair, a few dishes are pricey (the Korean ones), however most are a good deal.  The atmosphere is very nice inside, feels quaint and homey. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Won't be visiting again. Service: I guess we were sat in the \"you don't exist\" booth because we had to flag down someone to even take our order. Also had to ask for water from 3 different staff members before getting one glass 15 minutes later (there was 2 of us). Even when we were done we sat for 10-15 waiting for them to take our bowls away (after asking for the bill). Eventually started getting dressed and they handed me the bill AS I was walking to the counter. Food: we both had the chicken Bibimbap, but it wasn't like bibimbap I had in other restaurants where they bring it to your table, crack an egg in, and mix it with sauce while the sizzling bowl cooks it. Only sign of seasoning was strangely purple rice in the centre; egg was already cooked, sunny side up. Tasted alright, not as flavourful as others as I've had (hot sauce helped). Came with rice noodles, rice, bok choy, onions, carrots, bean sprouts, and one lonely piece of broccoli (bad news for those of us who like broccoli). Terrible service, meh food. Geographic convenience was my main motivator for going there."}
{"text":"Their salmon and avocado sushi (maki) is absolutely delicious!  Incredibly friendly staff!   Have only done take away here so far, I recommend calling a head of time so you can just pick up your food without disturbing other customers who are eating in the restaurant. Or possibly using the order app \"Ritual\" which I have yet to try. Anyway, great experience!"}
{"text":"Come here after work, I think it's worth to try it. My friend and I love this place. Since their price is reasonable compare with the portion. They have korean and sushi menu. I really like their service. Servers are so kind. Pretty good for dinner time. Hope that i can come here on summer time to sit on their patio."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch takeout and got the Sushi Lunch B which is 8 pieces of nigiri sushi with a dynamite roll. Initially I thought it was a bit pricey at $14.95, but when I got home and saw the portions I was very surprised at how much sushi I got! The dynamite roll had 10 pieces and they also added in 3 yam maki sushis on the side. For all that, I think it's definitely worth it. It's a Korean run sushi place, which is almost always good quality. Here they seem to specialize in using purple rice instead of the normal white rice you're used to. This is a pretty popular rice in Korean cuisine, so it was an interesting twist. The sushi itself was very fresh and the rice surprisingly worked really well since I was expecting it to be a little hard. Would definitely come back to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been here twice recently and both times didn't disappoint.  Service was fast and friendly and the food was great.   I really really love the Volcano rolls. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing Korean restaurant that's specializes in a slightly Korean twist on sushi.  Their signature is 'purple rice' which is a combination of white and brown rice, but still healthier than white, but not as bulky and filling as the brown one.  Their bento boxes are awesome, and so are the sushi specials, but the best food is the Korean one, like the Bulgogi and Kimchi dishes, and also the Donburi bowls."}
{"text":"I did not think I was a sushi connoisseur because I've been content on many occasion with pharmacy sushi.  I'm talking about Walgreens, Walgreens has sushi! The sushi here at KoJa was still sushi and I would eat it again, but for the first time I can say I would have rather tried the pharmacy sushi.  The server was nice but a little slow, maybe he was new.  The miso soup was a super small portion and, it's hard to say this about miso soup, but I think I've had much better tasting miso soup.    The edamame was good, it was like edamame on 'roids and it was hot until the last bite.  There was also no parking."}
{"text":"Ok I was going to give this place four stars at first, but after consideration of the whole experience I have settled on three.   My friend and I decided to give this place a try because it was open late and had good reviews. We arrived around 8:30pm and the restaurant was moderately full. They gave us a table and menus right away, but then the wait began. We sat at the table for 35 minutes without anyone even offering us drinks. We were about to leave when our waiter finally came over an took our orders. We waited another 15 minutes before our waiter finally brought us our glasses of water and my friends miso soup. Then we waited another 20 minutes for my salad to arrive. We were not impressed!!! While still waiting for our food another table was seated, made their order and had received their drinks and appetizers. We then heard the waiter tell the table behind us that there was about a 30 minute wait for sushi right now. Ummm thanks for letting us know!!! Finally after a total of about 80 minutes of waiting our food came to the table. I had the volcano roll, which is spicy salmon, avocado, crab, and cream cheese. My friend had the combo of tempura and vegetarian sushi. The food was amazing! The portions were way bigger than I expected, but still decent enough for one person. The black rice they use is delicious and all of the ingredients tasted fresh.   I would go back to this restaurant in spite of the service, simply because the food was great. However, I will be asking our server right away how long they expect it to take. I don't mind waiting for good food, but I expect our server to inform us of the delay. That way we can make the decision whether to wait or not. I find it really inconsiderate that they neglected to tell us about the wait and also that they took so long to even offer us drinks."}
{"text":"I found out about this place online and it totally lived up to the hype I had read about.  Their rolls are huge and quite decent quality for their reasonable prices.  I personally am a fan of the Mountain Roll.  Just be aware that they tend to use a lot of Fish Roe in their rolls (which I quite like, but have friends who don't)."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  KoJa wins the award of the most beautifully presented lunch special dish I've ever had. The photo I posted explains for itself. But was it good? With confidence, yes!  I ordered the Sushi Lunch A, as it is the lower cost option (I don't usually spend more than $15 for sushi lunches unless it's an authentic place). The first thing that definitely surprised me was despite the fact it mentioned 8 pieces of sushi and 6 california rolls, I ended up getting 3 extra rolls! I'll take it for sure; who doesn't want free food?  The lunch came with a miso soup and salad. The soup tasted way better than the salad in my opinion.  As for the sushi dish itself, the rolls were simply brilliant. I always loved purple rice, and this restaurant was no exception. The size was quite generous as well! The sushi was just as good, with the minor setback being the fact the fish was very thin. Not a huge issue as the flavour was there, but I'm generally used to thicker slice cuts.  Service was quick and efficient, and the employees made sure my whole meal was satisfying and made sure I was able to find the washroom (it's down in the basement by the way).  Liberty Village may be hipster, but the residents there sure have a lot of excellent food options!"}
{"text":"KoJa is a reasonably priced restaurant that offers a tasty meal. The chirashi is always a good pick, and the rolls are great too. The service could be a lot better, but is not enough to stop is from going. If you're looking for a casual meal this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Good rolls, personally I like the Boston roll best. The sushi boat when dining in is impressive, especially for a 'bigger' group. Wouldn't order the sashimi dish again, but the maki rolls are a good size and the purple rice is great!"}
{"text":"Koja's been there for at least six years. It's never changed, and, I believe, it never will. I know the dishes I like are good and they will never mess up - like the Hae du bop and Chirashi. I always order something with rice because they make the best purple rice EVER, perfectly seasoned, I eat so much of it I would explode - I am not particularly fond of rice, but THEIR rice is something.   The thing is that they never change. They play the same songs over and over again, and I'm not sure how the employees and even the owners don't go mad - I avoid visiting the location because I can't stand listening to the SAME ALBUM EVERY SINGLE TIME. Is it some sort of torture? Is it a social experiment? Serious questions. Play the radio, play something else, please. Just not that album."}
{"text":"I've lived in liberty village for 5 years now and not once have I tried sushi at Koja.  So, a couple friends and I thought why not.  We ordered the small sashimi+sushi+maki platter (36 pieces) with a special roll on the side. On top of that we got the big tea pot of sake.  The presentation was fantastic. See my pics and the purple rice was a nice novelty but that's all it was. Either they didn't use enough rice or the purple rice doesn't get sticky enough. Almost all the maki pieces unrolled when trying to pick them up. Definitely not worth trying. Stick to the sushi and sashimi here."}
{"text":"The presentation for the food is always realy cool and  neat  ! The sushi is really good and the purple rice makes it a lot healthier ~"}
{"text":"I've been here 2 weeks in a row Nov 15 & 22, 2015. I've also been here before but it was a few years ago.   The most recent two times the service was courteous as always. We were seated downstairs the first time and it was kinda odd as there was only 1 other table full. But the food tasted just as good and the waiter came often to check on us. There is a tv down there on CP24 as well as the bathrooms (the female bathroom was clean both times).   We ordered basically the same thing both nights. Yam maki, mountain roll (too big to fit in your mouth in one bite - not good for a date), salmon and butter fish (white tuna) sashimi (3 pcs with each order). It came to approx $32-35 + tip each time for 2 people and we were both full. Plus we got tea and lots of frequent refills (unlimited it seemed).   I like the purple rice but it does fall apart with the specialty/larger rolls.   It's a great local place, a bit of a hole in the wall and seating is nicer on the main floor then downstairs. Regardless, I would go back again for the food and the service and the convenience. Also good for take out!"}
{"text":"My go to Sushi place in the area. Their sushi is so fresh and the flavours bright and consistent. The service is great and qhen I call for takeout my food's always ready in 15-20 mns tops. Love love their rolls"}
{"text":"Filthy floors and kitchen. I think our hunger and politeness made us stay. The order wasn't taken properly which should of been the first sign to maybe not stay. I have no idea why this place has a high yelp review?! I will help balance the scales. We ordered maki rolls to which they use a blended rice (white, brown and black) - this will not give you a consistency for sushi. It was mushy, like over cooked rice that had been sitting in water all day, the tempura was clearly fried in old oil and had a hard texture and odd stale taste. This place was busy with pick up orders all evening - I cannot comprehend how people (including myself) would eat here as the kitchen was such a mess. Are we all too polite or just don't care?! I will gladly kick my own bum for continuing to entertain this place during my meal, but I will not return."}
{"text":"I don't live in the area but when my brother in law ordered take out for me.. i immediately fell in love. Im a sushi lover and I'm very picky when it comes to it.. and i have to say this is a delicious place for quick and easy sushi! I ordered eel avocado and a few ikura pieces and I can't stop thinking about it! The rice is fresh and i love the small portions!"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular here. Great sushi combos, with high quality ingredients. Combos are reasonably priced, with very good lunch pricing for the LV folk during the day. A good mix of both Korean and Japanese, and they use purple rice too. A la cartel selection for sushi isn't as extensive, but understandable given their core demographic. One of the few sushi joints in the city with a patio too."}
{"text":"Eating here was due to the fact that our initially chosen restaurant for dinner was unexpectedly closed that night. We entered to find a tiny, cozy little sushi restaurant. The size and decor made it seem pretty authentic, just like what you would expect to find if you went to a regular sushi place in Japan. There were like 5 tables on the main floor, which were all occupied, and a few more in the basement that were empty. The server was very friendly and showed us to our table once it was available.  What impressed me was the prices, especially the combo where you can pick any 2 options, for around $16 (also came with miso soup and salad), which I found was a great deal and is rare to find in any other sushi place. They also had another combo deal, with slightly larger portions for $18. I wanted to get that initially, but wanted to substitute the dynamite roll for the same priced vegetarian roll, and that way I can share it with my vegetarian friend. However, despite being the same price the sever said that it will cost an additional $1 or so for substitutions. So I went for the unagi roll with 8 pieces of nigiri for $16 instead, which is a portion I can finish myself.  My friend got the hand roll, and the combo of 6 pieces of vegetable tempura + 4 vegetable nigiri's. It took a good 10 to 15 minutes for the food to arrive, but when it did I was really impressed with the presentation! They also used purple rice for their maki sushi. The first thing I noticed was that the nigiri pieces were on the small side, which I was not upset about, as this is the size of how an authentic nigiri sushi should be, rather than the giant golf ball sized ones you get nowadays. My only complaint was the maki sushi, which were loosely rolled and fell apart very easily.  In conclusion. to find a good, non all-you-can-eat sushi spot that isn't overpriced is rare these days. I really liked this place and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a away from the generic and tasteless sushi you get these days. For flavour, authenticity, along with affordable prices this is an ideal spot to go."}
{"text":"This place is the best in Liberty Village.   It is somewhat of a hidden gem.  The seating inside can be limited, but every time I've gone, I've been able to grab a table with no problem.  This is the place where they have the PURPLE Rice! They mix it with the White rice, and it has a number of health benefits apparently (to be honest, it looks great, and I love sushi so I'd eat it regardless! haha).  But in all honesty, the portion sizes are phenomenal.  It's fresh, and there is a HUGE selection - which I like.  It is not AYCE, but the value is so, so great. You don't need AYCE when you can go to Koja.   They can accommodate Nut Allergies, and even those non-fish eaters in the group.  They have a HUGE portion of Beef Teriyaki that tasted amazing.    And by the way, one of my favourite things about this place is how they present the food to you. They love what they do and you can tell - their presentation is always on point!   HIGHLY highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This placed has a perfect location for those in liberty village. Minimal parking but that alone is a plus.  I ordered the combo and decided on two maki rolls. I was surprised by the size and quality of them, as well as loved my purple coloured rice.  Service was great, and I love the feel of this place. Very quaint, nice decor and comfortable seating. Good pricing for quantity!"}
{"text":"Purple rice?!?! Count me in! !! Just kidding - this place was subpar and here's why.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch bento on ritual. When I went to pick it up, there was literally no one eating in the restaurant and a huge crowd around the back of the place with people anxiously waiting for their ritual orders. Protip... when the app says 25 minutes... it means you will wait at least 25 minutes.  I also really don't like miso soup, so I asked for a substitution of the soup with salad. They responded in a very demeaning way and shoved the miso soup into the plastic bag and handed it to me. I guess they were in a really stressed lunch rush, but it was still no excuse for poor treatment.  I swear super dry was named after the chicken teriyaki I had because it honestly tasted like rubber.   Everything else tasted decent.  Purple rice and fairly good execution merits 2 stars."}
{"text":"Walking by and saw Bibimbob advertisement which looked so delicious . Ordered the food and this is what came up. Vegetable and chicken, rice portion is way way smaller than any other restaurant , vegetables are not fresh at all. Totally different from picture . Worst Bibimbob I have ever seen. It's just waist of money, wont come back again."}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service ***1/2 Ambience ***  I've had a few roles here and everything has been decent.  It's the perfect place for a mid-week meal where you may be a bit tired from work and don't want to cook or craving sushi.    We ordered a number of deluxe roles at various times including: Diablo, Sunkist, Spicy Salmon, Salmon Scallop, Caterpillar + others.    The rolls were large and quality/freshness of fish was good everytime except once on 1 roll (still edible though.). The tempura on any of the shrimp was fresh and crispy, meaning they don't make a bunch in the morning and then throw them in the rolls as needed.    The couple areas for improvement for these deluxe rolls and many sushi shops around the city, would be:. I) don't mix your hot sauce with tempura bits, it makes it soft and kills the crispy texture you're aiming to add.  II) drop the cream cheese from the rolls (personal preference) I'm not sure how cream cheese fits in some of the rolls however it kills the texture and adds a lot of calories.    Service at Koja was good overall and staff are very friendly. Onne instance they mixed up our order and we received two of the same roll.  No big deal..."}
