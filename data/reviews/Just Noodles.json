{"text":"The food was really good and came in a big portion for the price you pay for. The service was really fast and the place is clean and decent. This is like a better version of thai express!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. We ordered here from the office and no one was really blown away by the quality of flavour. It mostly came across as just meh.  I ordered a stir fry with peanut butter sauce and it came tasting pretty bland and kind of watery. I doused the sucker with hot sauce and soya and it didn't make things much better.   My co-worker who got the Pad Thai seemed pretty happy though, so maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel after all."}
{"text":"Nicest owner and staff I have ever met. Food was receive quickly and the portions were huge. Definitely a great late night option."}
{"text":"A good mix between Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. The menu prices were definitely cheap for the portions, but decor inside was hole-in-the-wallish."}
{"text":"Amazing food and some of the nicest staff I've ever come across.  Truly a gem. Went here late night after a long night of dancing and was incredible"}
{"text":"great service polite and just a nice place to be with that special someone 97 choices on the menu sure to please everyone .."}
{"text":"I had the wonton noodle soup. It was better than I expected but the place is just okay."}
{"text":"attention!!!!!!! this place will include tip in your bill and will not mention it, customers then leave a tip on tip big scam!!! they did it to me a few times they got me the first 3 times on my 4th, i came prepared and asked for my detailed  bill just as i was paying. he started justifying the extra \"divers\" lines in the bill saying these were tips included"}
{"text":"General Tao chicken is on point. Service is fast and friendly. They use good meat. The restaurant is clean. Not a bad Asian takeout place."}
{"text":"Watch out for the rip off. They raise prices at night and charge you way more then you should have. All the bills are done by hand, probably tax evasion too.  Plenty of 24h places in montreal, stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Okay Asian restaurant. The food is not extraordinary but comes in a healthy portion that can be finished easily. This is ideal for St. Laurent partyers because it is cheap and open till late."}
{"text":"Very international crowd in this inexpensive Chinese joint.  Great Cantonese Chow Mein, and very friendly service.  The restaurant's open late (forgot how late) and was fairly crowded even at the odd hour of 9:30 on a weeknight.  Most dishes in the $6-$9 range."}
{"text":"I went there once, nothing special. I think Soup and Noodles across the street really kills their business."}
{"text":"Classic drink food. Just Noodles, no frills, open late, cheap as dirt, served super quick in massive heart-stopping portions. I don't know for sure that it's MSG laden, but the hallucinations suggest that yes."}
{"text":"Beef pad thai is around 12$. Service is quite fast and food is quite good for this price range. This place is kinda like a fast food but a really good one. I mean I don't think you would want to bring a date there... That s just not that kind of place."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go if you're hungry and don't have much time. The food is prepared and served quickly if it's not busy.  The soups and noodles are good and the prices are low. Expect to pay 8-9 dollars + tax and tip for your meal."}
