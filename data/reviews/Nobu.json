{"text":"This was the place I was most looking forward to eating at in Vegas. I'm sad to say I was disappointed.   The food was amazing, but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge. It felt like a cheap club with fantastic food. Very disconnected. Our server was condecending. She seemed annoyed we didn't order \"enough\" (she'd recommended 2-3 cold dishes, 2-3 hot dishes, and 2 sushi rolls) but that was our choice. We'd had a late lunch.   If you just want good food, I'd recommend saving your money and going elsewhere. If you're a 20 or 30-something and want a party atmosphere and don't care about the bill, this could be fun for you."}
{"text":"Lucky Las Vegas!! Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!    First, a few fun facts: - The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013  - Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide!  - The NOBU Hotel, a \"boutique hotel\" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first \"NOBU Hotel\" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)    Now, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.  Now, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!  1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!) six (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking \"should I order another round now or later?\" as they are finishing off this one ;)   2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!) So succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't \"pass\" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :)   3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!) This comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, \"las vegas\", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their \"own\" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious!   4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!) OK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces.   5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16 This was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle...   6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14 If you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!  Dessert We went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15 Flourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience.   I'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!"}
{"text":"YES! I finally dined at Nobu, considering it was Iron Chef, Masaharu Morimoto's restaurants when he won the challenge. Ok, this is not the original restaurant where he worked (that is in NYC) but this is a branch of it. According to Wikipedia, he left Nobu in 1999, eventually opening his own Morimoto restaurant in Philadelphia in 2001. So I will eventually eat at Morimoto. Nobu was a good experience, although as other yelpers pointed out, why was this in Hard Rock Cafe (seemed kinda out of place) and the kitchy Hawaiian decor, the decor lost one star in my books.  The miso cod was heavenly and so was the tuna tartare with caviar. The roll we had was good as well. Pricey but definitely quality sushi."}
{"text":"The staff was well trained, our waiters knew every ingredient and its sole contribution to the dish.   I have been attempting to word this review and I can't seem to express my satisfaction.   Today, I have tasted and experienced the better things in life"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Nobu and I was completely let down.  We went to Vegas for my sister's 40th and got a reservation at Nobu Friday night.  They sat us at this square table in the back with no atmosphere.  Service was super slow and our server was nowhere to be found most of the time.  Average tasting rolls and a huge bill..... not good for a group."}
{"text":"This place. This damn place. First off, you feel like a king just walking in and being sat down. Service unlike I've ever experienced, absolute 5 stars for sure. Yes its insanely price, but the food and service make it worth your while.  The only thing that irritated me is when they brought out a bottle of Fiji water when you say yes to being offered water (assuming water is free!) and being charged $8 for it!!! Not OK!"}
{"text":"The black cod miso was absolute delicious and they have a great menu. Sushi was excellent as well as the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Horrendous.   This place should not share the same name with its counterpart in New York. The latter is the real deal. This Vegas place is the real steal.   My wife and I got the omakase - just as we has in New York. However, there was no progression / logic or thought in the Vegas parade of dishes. It seemed that random servers would simply drop stuff on our table with a quick description. In New York, we had one attentive waiter who would explain the dishes as they were delivered and really seemed to know what he was talking about.  I don't know what it is about the Vegas knock offs...Bouchon was dissapointing as well. Word to the wise, go for the real Nobu deal when you are in NYC. In Vegas, get the lame-ass buffet. You are there to gamble anyway."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi joint anywhere. If there is a Nobu in town, I am going. The Ceaser's Palace Nobu is fantastic. Love getting a spot at the sushi bar and taking the recommendations of the chefs that night."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Every dish was the best ever of the thing that it was.  One of them was the best fish ever.  Seriously, I think my mouth had an orgasm.  I'm sure everyone else has told you to get the jalapeno yellowtail sashimi and the miso cod.  We also really enjoyed the beef tenderloin, it was so tender it felt like sashimi, but with the deliciousness of steak.  We also got a couple tempura things that were very good.  I was also very impressed with the service.  We were at first confused because of the casual atmosphere and high prices, but I actually think this is great.  The service was still impeccable despite the casual tone, and it made us feel at ease, unlike many other restaurants with such high quality food.    I was very impressed that the small plates came out in a well thought-out order.  So often at a small plates restaurant your meal will feel harried because a bunch of things arrive at once or things arrive in an order that doesn't suit the meal.  Each item arrived at just the right moment and in just the right order.  Great great great restaurant, I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Highly overated, fresh wasabi for $12 came as wasabi mixed with water that diluted the taste instead of freshly grated.  Sashimi was a huge disappointment in both taste and presentation.  Servers which should be confident but was arrogant instead.     2 stars was for the nice ambience."}
{"text":"Hype hype and hype  $12 for fresh wasabi and was given a watery paste!  I know what fresh wasabi is and that is why I am willing to pay.      Waiters are arrogant not confident.   When asked about a dish they just rant off the menu as is I can't read.  Long story short, if you want good japanese go to kabuto at spring mountain, it is better than a lot of sushi bars in Japan.  1 more to avoid would be Masa at Aria, they served my frozen tilapia when I ordered Tai (pink snapper)."}
{"text":"So we had reservations for 930 on a Friday night and were seated immediately upon our arrival. The (almost all-male)staff were attentive, informative and friendly.   Our meal:  -Edamame with shaved seasalt -Sashimi yellowtail with miso and jalapeno (yummmmy, Bobby's favorite) -Black cod in lettuce cups with filo flakes (my favorite, so perfect) -Sashimi with garlic chips (little too salty) -Salmon sushi -Toro sushi (very tasty fish) -Dessert: edamame icecream atop a brownsugar brownie,Caramel sauce, and tiny sliver of decadent brittle...the icecream scoop was so tiny that we really couldn't taste the edamame.   A super treat for sushi, but be prepared to spend money!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this plain and simple. The BEST service I've ever received in my life. Matt & Juan were fantastic! I'm usually very critical about service since I was once part of the industry but I literally could not find anything wrong. I'm extremely pleased and highly recommend this location to all!"}
{"text":"Walking in, the atmosphere is great!  Really nice space. My first impression was not great however, as they lost my reservation, that is never good when you are starving and ready for a good meal. However, they did move quickly to rectify the situation and found us a decent table in the bar.   Now, I have been fortunate to partake of some amazing sushi from NY to LA, and for these prices, that is what I was expecting.  Unfortunately, they did not deliver. It was good, it just wasn't fantastic, and for these prices, fantastic is what I would expect.   The service was also just good. Little mistakes here and there that should not happen at a reastraunt of That caliber.   Overall, just not what I would expect when I'm shelling out close to $500 for myself and two friends. I'm afraid that in the end, Nobu just came off as pretentious."}
{"text":"BEST. SUSHI. EXPERIENCE. OF. MY. LIFE.  Wow, that is all I can say. Each and every dish tried was to die for.   Don't get me wrong, it cost us a fortune- we had a large group and they serve small plates. So naturally we ordered a LOT of plates. But I swear, it is worth splurging here.  We had an awesome waiter! He was funny, friendly, and made great recommendations. He advised us on how to use the menu and where to start.   Our favorite dishes were the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, and one more sashimi dish (I can't remember what it was called!) They were perfectly simple and fresh. They weren't drenched in sauce like many other sushi bars you experience. I'm pretty sure I could have eaten this for the rest of my life.   Try it. It's worth the money."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I've had the best Toro of my life at this restaurant (and I've had it all over the world). The following are a must:  Wagyu Tacos Toro TK 40 (Nobu Sake)  I've had lots of stuff here and done several tasting menus.  All considered, explore the menu, but order what I listed above."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day for a company function and I am going to say--hands down--the best japanese food/sushi in my entire life! None of the dishes disappointed me and I couldn't wait for each dish to come out as they got better and better as the meal went on.   Supposedly the owner of the company that took us here is a big deal so we got excellent service. The waiters and the chef knew who he was so we got taken care of. I went to show someone where our table was (literally not even a minute) and my napkin was refolded at my seat.   This is what we had:  -Edamame -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Cream Spicy Sauce -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu -Black Cod Miso -Chilean Sea Bass with Dried Miso -Beef tenderloin (medium rare) in a claypot -Mushroom soup -Pickled Sushi Platter   -Sushi platter -Ceviche with mixed seafood (and quail egg) -Fish egg sushi with quail egg -Sweet potato and avocado tempura -Dessert: Chef's Tasting Platter  Alcohol: I had a mango martini--delicious! I don't really like to taste alcohol, but this was a good sweet/tart drink that got me slightly buzzed. Good tasting + getting buzzed = winner!  Some highlights of the meal:  -The seafood was amazingly fresh and it was the best quality I've had. My top favorite was the black cod miso and the chilean sea bass. Melt in your mouth HEAVEN.  -Beef tenderloin was perfection--I love my meats medium rare and it was good and bloody.  -I did a shot of the ceviche with a raw quail egg and it was great. You only live once, and if you want to try something might as well do it at Nobu since they know how to prepare it properly. Bottoms up!  I'm so glad I went with a company because there is no way I would have been able to 1. afford all of this food and 2. to order this many plates. Nobu is great and I would gladly go back if I had the chance!"}
{"text":"The best Japanese food I have ever eaten! You better go prepared to spend a good amount of money but it's definitely worth it! Try the fish that comes in the lettuce leaves... It's AWESOME!! The Japanese beef, the lobster, everything is over the top. The only thing is that I was not a fan of the desert they offered. The Japanese doughnuts were not that good otherwise it was completely fenomenal."}
{"text":"We went to Nobu first time. It was like a friend. Super crowded. Actually they didn't make a reservation sushi bar. We got there at 9:00p.m. Hostess sad waiting time was 45minute. Eventually we got seats at sushi bar. Almost 8people was working sushi counter. Appetizer was coming from the back not sushi bar. All appetizer was almost huge size we couldn't eat sushi at all.....Price was two of us including alcohol 220 bucks. All appetizer was delicious. We were satisfied. Thank you so much Rikisann~^^^^"}
{"text":"short and simple review. Do not order things you would typically order at your standard sushi joint. Go with the sashimi and other more exotic dishes. Thats the stuff they put effort into."}
{"text":"Expect to spend some money if you go here. Don't be cheap! Nobu is a great place to go for a special occasion or... if you just have..... a lot of money. The sushi is definitely fresh and the warm dishes are absolutely delicious! The inside is clean, nice and has modern decor. The sushi bar is quite large and there's also a bar and lounge in the front. The spicy tuna roll is different from any other place that I've tried. It does not have the minced up tuna but instead a nice, thick slice of tuna with a spicy, scallion sauce. Also, the rolls have the rice on the inside not on the outside, like you find at most places now a days. The rolls are small, so they fit right into your mouth with one bite. Some things that I recommend are the yellowtail jalapeno... it is to die for. The yellowtail is fresh and the jalapeno pepper gives it a little kick. The black cod miso is absolutely delicious, it melts in your mouth. The rock shrimp tempura is really good as well. They also have new cocktails every month, so ask your server or the bartender what the special cocktails are. The lychee martini is really good!  Nobu is also a great place to spot celebrities. If you dine here you'll most likely see at least one celebrity. It's a hot spot.  Try Nobu and you won't be disappointed but I have to say again, don't be cheap!!! Enjoy the ambiance and the great food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants of all time! The food is amazing! I never get disappointed when I dine here. A few of my favorite dishes are the yellowtail jalapeno, mushroom salad, spicy tuna roll, black cod miso and the bento dessert box. The chocolate cake in the bento box is to die for, literally. It's quite pricey here but for the quality and experience, it's well worth it and sometimes you need to treat yourself. Don't be cheap if you go here, enjoy yourself and try some new things that you have never tried before. The staff is all really nice and knowledgeable. The restaurant is HUGE and the decor is beautiful. Everyone must dine here at least once in their lifetime!"}
{"text":"Party of 2 Gave our food preferences and they created the menu A little more than 600 including tip  Yellow tail with jalapeño was awesome Salmon belly unique to the Vegas location was awesome King crab tempura was meaty and perfect Wagyu beef was amazing.  The miso cod was just ok, a little salty and they left a piece of skin on it that made it a bit fishy.  And they lose points for not offering a desert on the house for my wife's bday.  While those last two things he were annoying, I would still be back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas staying at the Hard Rock and craving sushi. Where else would we have gone to eat? We ordered two signature dishes (yellowtail and cod).. We started with the yellowtail with jalapenos and cilantro. The jalapenos are an interesting departure from the wasabi we are so familiar with.  I only like a little bit of heat, but I actually wanted more than the thin slices offered.  We each had an order of sunomono (cucumber salad), which were quite large.We ordered the black cod as a hot dish. I would come back in order this again and again and again. We ordered the chef's choice for sushi for two... which was your usual assortment. The tamago was sweet and had the restaurant name seared into the top.    The food was very good, the ambience was nice, my Asahi was on tap, but you have to leave the restaurant and cross the casino to use the restroom, and the prices were quite high.  Yes. I will go again."}
{"text":"Always top notch. Have never had a bad meal here. Some faves: shishito peppers, any of the rolls, the miso cod and cucumber martini are all amazing."}
{"text":"A little pricey but great quality and service. With Omnia open it has become a good dinner spot before the nightclub with a good looking, young crowd"}
{"text":"I definitely love fine dining but I believe for the price of the food the taste did not blow me away. I loved the atmosphere the decor was excellent. I went and dropped 2 bills and leave still hungry is disappointing which I know is typical at some fine dining places but for that price I could have ate at Mastros or another place where the potions are larger. As far as the food I ate a steak with onions as truffle sauce and it was excellent. This place is for the experience not to get full. If you want to leave full expect to at least pay 300. I would a have gave it a higher rating but I wasn't blown away by the taste and I didn't leave thinking it's expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best sushi I have ever had. We did the $225 Omakase, every dish was melt in your mouth. The A5 Wagyu was just stunning! Service was very customized, our waiter Jonathan did an excellent job tailoring our menu so we get to sample a little of what is best of Nobu. I can't wait to come back again and would totally do the same dishes again!"}
{"text":"This was initially a 2* but, having been in the service industry for so long, I can take our experience with a grain of salt. To sum it up: the food was excellent and over-priced - just as we expected and were ready for, but the emphasis should be on excellent because it truly was worth it. The service, however, was pretentious, inaccurate, but most of all - excruciatingly slow. Our server, a gentleman with an Italian name that I had to ask for because he offered no information to us outside of his overbearing spiels, simply did not care that much. I could throw out guesses as to why he was the way he was - most likely our group didn't seem like it would be particularly lucrative for him (we were all bartenders/servers so he assumed wrong) - but that is conjecture. Getting in our order was a painful 30 minute process. Getting a refill of our alcoholic beverages (a tap beer and a whiskey on the rocks) took 15-20 minutes (it was not busy). And in the end just getting our damn bill took a good 20 minutes. I might go back but I would make sure he is not my server. Also, dude, that whiskey isn't made from actual coffee - it's made in Coffey stills."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! By far the best sushi I have ever tasted! The quality of the food definitely speaks for it's self!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm not a sushi fiend so keep that in mind.  Enjoyed the atmosphere...  Enjoyed the drinks...  Lychee Martini, Blueberry Mojito, and hot saki...  And the food was good.  What I liked the most was the California rolls and ebi, but I've had just as good at much cheaper prices...  In the end, your paying through the nose for the atmosphere and pretty good (but not amazing) food.  Probably won't go back, but if you love sushi,  give it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Nobu on 12/29/13 for our 9th anniversary. We had reservations and were setting right away. Our table was so small and in the middle of the aisle near the door to the ktchen.So my huband asked if we could have another table.The Hostess left us standing there, looking so out of place, and went to check. A few minuets later, she comes back and tells us the only tables are for big parties and this is it and advises not to wait. So we sit dowm. 5-10 minutes later someone finally comes over for what we want to drink. Well I know Nobu is expensive, but $20 bucks an up for a drink. We looked at each other and walked out. We are probably the only people that have walked out. Went to another resturant and had a great dinner for 1/2 the price with very nice and fun waiters and hostess."}
{"text":"Four of us dined at Nobu on Feb 28th. I was very disappointed in the quality, texture, and flavor of the seafood dishes. Also, the waitstaff seemed rushed and it was extremely loud. Those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. We ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. The following are dishes I had sampled.  Spicy Miso Lotus Chips with Tuna & Scallop - The chips were crispy and not oily. The tuna was ok. The scallops were not. Something was off.  Shishito Peppers - I loved these peppers. They are full of flavor yet not spicy. I could snack on them all day.   Mushroom Soup - This tasted meaty and delicious.  Toro (Blue Fin) and Scallion Sushi Roll - I did not like this at all. The texture of the fish seemed off to me.  Sea Urchin Nigiri - The texture and flavor was ok.  Chicken Kushiyaki (Teriyaki & Anticucho) - Ok. A bit dry and overcooked.   Teriyaki Tenderloin of Beef - Good."}
{"text":"It was a hit-and-miss experience at Nobu in Vegas.  Hits: Mixed seafood ceviche, sweet shrimps - new style sashimi, kumamoto oysters with Nobu sauce, Nobu style lobster tacos, Bluefin tuna tartar with caviar, and tiradito scallops.  Misses: Black cod with miso, house special deluxe roll, fried mai with sweet butter sauce.  Personal favorites are Bluefin tuna tartar and sweet shrimps - new  style sashimi. Presentation and tastes of these two plates are superb and I have never had before. You will be craving for more after you finish the tuna tartar, which are sized like your pinky; you will keep sucking the shrimp tails to get the last piece out.  The reason of my miss experience is that we trusted the waiter's recommendations and ordered the cooked food. To be honest, I strongly advise everyone to stay away from the cook food. If you want to be full, go across the street and get a burger after. This place is pricey and you definitely like to spend your money wisely on the right stuff.  P.S. I have not had the opportunity to have hamachi jalapeno and cannot offer any comment. However, I know a place in San Francisco offers a very similar dish and it was quite good, if not great."}
{"text":"Meh... The mushroom salad was great but the prices and quantity of everything else just wasn't up to par. Nice to have tried but I have no intent on coming back."}
{"text":"Great food but the service wasn't up to par.   What we had: Salmon sushimi - fantastically fresh Seasonal Aji nigiri - To die for King crab tempura - just okay Spicy Miso lotus chips with tuna - I can't really remember these Rock shrimp tempura with spicy sauce - pretty decent Japanese style tacos (beef) - very good broiled hamachi collar - FANTASTIC - probably my favorite dish Special salad with artichoke and a cheese I forget... parm? - TERRIBLE Chilean sea bass with miso - nothing special.   Dessert: Some chocolate bar thing - Meh Japanese doughnuts - AMAZING Mochi - some good, some bad... standard mochi  My main problem with the service is that we had to ask literally 4 times for a second bamboo container of Sake. That's just not star quality service, sorry Nobu."}
{"text":"Skip Nobu if you've been to any other location. The atmosphere was very LA and kind of snobby. It's a place to see and be seen and sadly this is applicable to the food as well. The menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. We decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). We chose the Lobster Ceviche, Big Eye Tuna Tempura Roll and the Nobu Style Lobster Tacos to start. The tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. These composed the \"cold\" dishes that Nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included Kobe Beef Tataki style, Black Cod with Miso as well as some Sashimi. The Kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the Cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. Looking at the menu now I'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but I remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like I got real value from our money. The atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. The food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. Sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a sushi snob. I admit it.b The setting in this place is too loud.  Food was ok. We went for the omokase dinner - which starts at $100/person. This was a sponsored dinner, so these comments are void of any financial influence.  Tuna tartare on a lotus root chip. Decent - tuna was ok, not too fatty. The chip had some kick to it. Back to back sashimi dishes. Boring. Fish was ok, but smothered in ponzu.  Squid and mushrooms - quite tasty. Squid perfectly cooked. Earthiness to the shrooms. Lettuce cups with miso cod and grilled scallop. The best dish of the night. Some kind of spicy rock shrimp with a mayo dressing on top of a bed of greens. It wasn't bad, but not quite what I wanted. The greens were good. Steak - not Kobe, but damned good. Heavily seasoned. Finished with Calif roll and spicy tuna roll? Are you kidding me? Beer and sake flowed; service was good. I ate here many years ago and the service was so bad, but this time they did well.   We had fun as it was a group that hadn't been together in a long time and as I said I didn't pay, but I would say for the money, there is better food in Vegas and better sushi in many places. If I had paid for this dinner, I would probably have knocked off a full star."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to eat at Nobu for more than 10 years.  I lived in NYC and Nobu was a big deal then.  I live in San Francisco now.  I eat sushi every week at least once.    I thought the food at Nobu was excellent, the service (at the alcohol bar) was lousy, and the ambience was just ok.  I'll spare you the details, but the food at Blue Ribbon at Cosmopolitan is just as good, but the service and ambience are much better.  Both are outrageously expensive, as you should expect."}
{"text":"Great meal, every dish was better than the last. Lives up to all expectations. Expensive but that should not come as a surprise to anyone who has dined at any of the other locations."}
{"text":"Yellow tail with jalapeño was awesome Salmon belly unique to the Vegas location was awesome King crab tempura was meaty and perfect Wagyu beef was amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi meals I have ever had the pleasure of eating. My brother brought me here for my birthday and we did the 5 course tasting menu which was surprisingly filling."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  If you can afford to do the chef tasting I would highly suggest it.  I think the secret item here is the Snapper (could be another fish).  The whole fish is deep fried and set standing up on a bed of miso butter sauce.  It is a suprising presentation. You get alot of people looking over at your table.  Crispy exterior with a flaky moist interior.  Dip that in the miso butter sauce and you have gone to heaven.  Obviously, Nobu is know for its sushi so going here will not let you down. GO!!!"}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable.  The fish was so fresh and prepared in  a creative way.  We tried almost everything on the menu.  The bill was not so friendly but who cares you are at Nobu eating some of the best sushi around."}
{"text":"In April, we went to Vegas and stayed at the Hard Rock.  I love that place.  That douchebag Simon has a restaurant there, right across the hall from Nobu.  We looked inside the newest entry into the highly competitive arena that is your mother's meatloaf and a chocolate shake for $35, and it reminded me of my elementary school cafeteria.  We were looking over the menu outside the door, which of course was a joke and not the least bit original, at which point the following conversation occurred:  Me:  Jesus what a joke. Wife:  Yeah, it looks pretty lame. Me:  I mean, really.  What a stupid ass restaurant. Wife:  Yeah...  Well, Jon Bon Jovi likes it. Me:  Yeah, well, Jon Bon Jovi is an asshole. Wife:  (now in a hushed tone):  I mean, he just walked out the door and right by us.... Me:  Oh shit.   Fortunately, it would seem that he was out of earshot by that point.  More fortunately, it appears he left Simon in favor of heading over to Nobu.  Good call, that.   We did Nobu twice during our stay.  It was fantastic.  We did mostly just sushi, which was uniformly superior.  However, it is also supremely expensive, and it does have some of the trappings of a touristy restaurant as opposed to a true sushi bar; most notably the fact that it is not necessarily understood that an \"order\" of  \"sushi\" means two pieces.  This can be disconcerting when you get the bill and discover that the toro, which is unbelievably and deliciously oily to the point that it seems suspended between solid and liquid states, cost you $15 PER PIECE.  Not per order, PER PIECE.    I have NEVER had an order of sushi that expensive, and in my mind, no sushi is worth that price.  And I have been to the now relocated-to-New-York Ginza Sushi-Ko in Beverly Hills (afka the most expensive restaurant in LA).  There, their equally top-notch toro was a mere $15 per ORDER, a la carte.  In our second visit, we wised up and didn't order the especially pricey items and still had a terrific experience.  I have no complaints about the place, other than the price.  The chefs were very attentive, accommodating, and friendly.  The waitresses were a little hard to flag down at time, however.  Nobu LV is at least as good as its counterpart in New York, as well as Matsuhisa in LA, and I believe better than Nobu Malibu, all of which I highly recommend.  I'd give it 5 stars if the service were a little better and the prices more reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not saying the food wasn't good--it is definitely good, but not amazing. and definitely not for the price. I ordered my favorite black cod miso, and it was really lacking in flavor. Our $65 sashimi platter was also a huge let down--there were probably only 8-10 pieces of sashimi. The rock cod tempura was probably the best thing of the night, and even then, I've had better at less expensive Japanese restaurants.  Nobu used to be my favorite place in NYC, so I was super excited to go to the Vegas location. Maybe it's my taste buds, but I was really disappointed this time around :("}
{"text":"Overall an Excellent restaurant.  My only issue the level of foodieness that is the norm here; I don't eat any grains, soy, or dairy (yeah I know don't eat sushi right?!?) and at some sushi places they will make rolls with cucumber instead of rice.  Not here - they were very helpful in terms of switching sauces and advising against dishes that could not be 'tampered' with but overall it was a bit of a chore to choose wisely.  That being said the quality of ingredients was awesome; that is why i eat sushi...i like fresh fish.  We had some hot dishes too...totally forgot what but loved every bite.    SO I vote YES to this place unless you eat paleo and want to dine with semi-reckless abandon, in that case go get a burger, hold the bun, ketchup, and fries."}
{"text":"This place deserves 3 stars.  The food was fantastic.  I highly recommend the blackened miso cod, beef tataki, and the bento green tea dessert.  However for an upscale restaurant, the service was very unsatisfiying and snobby.  Our waiter was very rude to begin with when we were ordering our dinner.  He did not take the time to explain the dishes we asked about.  Not only that he forgot our sashimi dinner, so we ended up waiting at our table an extra 20 minutes for that to arrive."}
{"text":"Good service and good decor. But the food is too salty and too sour. Not a good Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good and for sushi lovers it is somewhere to check off your list but,  for the price  I expected more, a lot more. The reason for only two stars is the servers are rude and arrogant when I asked if they had the real wasabi root and if I could have a side the waiter asked me if I would like ketchup with it as well. Not sure why the attitude over a simple question and a common request."}
{"text":"I probably expected too much in this hyped restaurant.  Inside an ordinary Hard Rock hotel which is away from the Strip, Nobu is a lot smaller than I thought.  Its interior wasn't the best and it was loud.    Nobu's signature dishes are all on the first 2 pages in the menu (mostly cold dishes on right and some hot dishes on left).  Go for these signature dishes:  Yellow Tail sashimi with jalapeo, Toro tartar with cavier, and Todari with Nobu style (Live Scallop!). The black code with miso is great but a bit on the heavy side.    These dishes are crafted so skillfully to burst your taste buds with delightful surprises.  A bit sour, oh wait... that melt in your mouth texture..., delicious.. and wait.. spicy.. no no and also fresh parsley taste too!  Oh my, how can I describe it?  And worse still, I had it all expressed on my face so it was like I was making faces.  It's hard to control.    Expect and prepare to pay, a lot."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying that I am a vegetarian and do not eat seafood. I asked our waiter what vegetarian options they had, and he suggested the tofu toban yaki and vegetables for $30. I asked if there were any off menu items, and the chef told him there was a tofu with cantaloupe salad also for $30. I ordered the latter, and there must have been some miscommunication because it ended up being so small, I wouldn't even call it an appetizer. I'm surprised they both cost $30 for such vastly different amounts of food. I promptly called our waiter over, and he willingly switched my entree for the tofu toban yaki and vegetable stir fry. This ended up being cooked in flamed sake, and it had a rich sake flavor, which I think was pretty unique. However, I'm kind of disappointed and feel ripped off that I essentially paid $30 for tofu and vegetable stir fry that didn't even include unique vegetables. Ultimately, it kind of sucked that my girlfriend and I weren't able to eat at the same time.  My girlfriend ordered their black cod, one of their signature dishes, which she loved. This was a large piece of fish cooked well and included their miso sauce.   I personally would not go back nor recommend this place to somebody who doesn't eat seafood. If you eat seafood, you'll probably like the food, but be prepared to pay out the wazoo."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of Sushi here a few years ago.    Food presentation was really impressive. The sushi was VERY fresh. I have to admit I am still not a big fan of sushi, but had a great time trying the selected variety.   Service was excellent. It was very busy and noisy, but that is expected when you go to a top well-reviewed restaurant that has lots of celebrity sightings."}
{"text":"Tasty, but a little over-priced. Tapas style, so it's great for large groups. Tempura was the best that I have EVER eaten."}
{"text":"I really want to know what all the fuss is about. Seriously, can somebody fill me in? I was at Nobu recently with a couple co-workers on a business trip and we decided to splurge on the Omakase. I've said it before...if I'm spending $100/head on a meal it better be transcendent. I want to leave the table full and buzzing and humming about how awesome the food was. This meal was, frankly, lousy.  Nearly everything that came out was drenched in citrus, which overpowered the fish. Isn't fish supposed to be the showpiece of a good sushi restaurant? And, honestly, that's the only real takeaway I had from this meal. Too much citrus. Everything.   I'll save my Omakase dollars for Austin's Uchi. Now *that's* transcendent."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Nobu's.   Our server recommended getting  one of each of the different types of Omakase dinners.  Although they were expensive it was totally worth it.   Everything was delicious.   We can honestly say that we don't know which one we preferred over the other because they were both so good.   Service was fantastic.   Would definitely go back there again next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed. What happened to Nobu? Used to be a great experience. I can get better in Albuquerque at half the price. I ordered the fish taco as a starter. It was the size of a Dorrito chip and not as good. At $12.00. Everything was bland and unimpressive. I gave Nobu in the Hard Rock 2 stars because the ambience was how I remembered it and the staff well trained. I am done with Nobu."}
{"text":"Sooo, I made reservation this monday at Nobu, with high expectation and hope... I was expecting excellent quality fish from the price they were charging.  I went to Vegas to eat here... I was expecting to spend alot of money too.   However... when i walked in, the resturant looks nice and hipp, was pretty busy for a monday night. We made reservation but they tried to sit us in same booth right next to another customer so we decided to sit at sushi bar.   Server was super friendly, knew his menu well, sushi chiefs were all Japanese and friendly/helpful as well.  I ordered one of recommendation from the server, and Toro Tara to start with, still excited!  I got bit suspicious when toro tartar came from kitchen, instead of sushi bar, it looked amazing with ice, caviar, lil bamboo shoot garnish and side of Yama-momo japanese plum.  When I see the actual Toro... I was more suspicious because of the color of the fish... it just didn't look like toro to me at all... I took a bite hoping to hop with joy, instead i had to look at my dish again... to make sure it was BLUE FIN TORO TARTAR.... I swear, its a scam, i had blue fin toro and good toro many times in my life time, but it is not a blue fin toro! It tasted like regular crappy tuna grinded up like a baby food.  argh... you don't understand the disappointment... coming all the way from phx to eat at THE NOBU... and this is what i get. =/   I had Uni sashimi, which was not that fresh, not so bad but for the price they charge, it should been better, Negi-toro was decent, it was real toro at least, not Tartar baby food crap.  King crab ceviche was just too sour... killed the flavor... after that, i didn't want to try anything else, but i had kabocha desert... which just tasted like normal pumpkin cake instead of japanese kabocha...   presentation was well done, its really beautiful, sushi chiefts are nice, and so are staff there but  food...   just dose not match the price of reputation. come on NOBU-san, you can do little bit better than that =/  I wish i ate at yellowtail or Shibuya instead, I will NOT be going back here again...   but plz ppl, don't try the toro tartar its really a scam =/"}
{"text":"Went here before going to the Shania Twain concert at Caesar's. The Atmosphere was nice, our server was OK, not overly friendly and didn't add much to the experience. The assorted sushi was about a quarter of the size of what you would expect for the price. Nothing special about the presentation and just OK. The miso cod was good but nothing that is crave worthy. Overall for the price and lack luster service I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!!  All of the dishes were delicious.  Four of us went for a birthday celebration and didn't know what to order so we relied on our server to 'surprise' us and we were delighted with his choices.  I particularly liked the Sea Bass, it was sooo good.  And the sake was also excellent.  I don't remember the names of the dishes, but I think anything here is going to be excellent.  The only disappointment was that we were promised a special birthday treat, but did not get it...... sad, because I'm sure it would have been divine."}
{"text":"First the good - the service was prompt, attentive and each server was knowledgable about the menu and specials.   Now the average - the food and portions. Except for the black cod, which was excellent, everything else was very average. The portions were downright silly. I don't know if you can slice a yellowtail thinner than they did and if they did, it would be an empty plate.  Now the worst - the prices, considering the above. We paid nearly $500 for 4 people. That includes a $60 bottle of Sake (I could be off on that price but that is what I recall). If the food was fabulous, $100 per person I can handle considering it is Vegas. But with average food and terrible portions, no way.  Do not intend to return here."}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service and management. I dined here at the end of July and paid with my credit card. The bartender fraudulently added a 100% gratuity to my meal. A few days later I noticed it on my credit card statement so I called and talked to the general manager Keenan. He was helpful at first but I never got my refund for the fraudulent gratuity that I was wrongly charged. I had contacted him a few times after my initial conversation with him and he always said he would look into it but never did. It has been almost 3 weeks and nothing has been resolved. It should not take more than 10 business days to do a refund transaction. I am very disappointed in my experience at this so called \"upscale\" restaurant. It is overpriced and underwhelming so don't spend your money here."}
{"text":"Food was good. Don't expect it to be like the other Nobu spots, not near as good."}
{"text":"Whatever dude...  If you're playing at the Hard Rock Blackjack Table and doubled down with a $100 Black Chip and scathed away a winner, then maybe you might want indulge and utilize your proceeds to check the place out for shits and giggles.  Otherwise, save your hard earned money and hit Simone for dinner or head to Caesars if you're still up for Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, having heard so much about it. Although we enjoyed our meal, our entire party left with the sense that the experience was overrated.  The atmosphere was far more casual than expected. The food was good but nothing extraordinary. I was hoping for the best sushi of my life and found that it was only (and at best) on par with the sushi I get at most restaurants at home."}
{"text":"So- we utilized a tasting menu purchase from Groupon, and my biggest fear was that it was not going to be enough food...FAR FROM IT! The dishes are all good-sized portions (frankly, more food than myself and my boyfriend would normally eat) and everything was delicious! Some, more than others- the actual sushi roll was a little forgettable, but the following were amazing: Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, Rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce, Black cod with miso. Also, the desert was delicious.   I would recommend, however pricing is not for the faint of heart. It is pricey- but, I think anyone attending this establishment should know that."}
{"text":"The bar tender Ron, made my 21st birthday incredible. He was friendly, knowledgeable and hooked us up. He kept the conversation going and didn't seem annoyed at all by our drunk presence. I will definitely go back to eat the yellow tail and hang out with Ron again. THANK YOU RON!!! :)"}
{"text":"i don't know about the ny or la counterparts, but......  nobu LV must be the biggest scam in the history of fine dining.  i really wanted to like it because i didn't want to seem like a hater but seriously the decor is so uninspired (surfboards, bamboo, modern-classic clash) and the wait staff doesn't have the same refined elegance or grace as comparably priced restaurants.  just cuz you put on a black t-shirt and black slacks doesn't make it chic and modern -- unless you're steve jobs.  we had the yellowtail jalapeno which was genius -- at least for the accountants.  the live scallop was sour and spicy but just too much of each.  the moi new sashimi special could have been any fish.  the miso cod was tasty and one of the highlights, but was served lukewarm.  the uni tempura dish was also pretty good but you only get 1 piece of uni.  the bento box and yuzu wasabi desserts were ok too.  would i dine there if the food was 1/3 the price?  sure.  i just felt like i was getting duped and i wanted to scream out the king ain't wearing any clothes you idiots.  but then i realized between the loud noise of hard rock and the drunken stupor of the crowd , my efforts would be moot."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Everything presented beautifully and each bite was an experience like I've never had before. Kinako crunch for dessert topped it off. Spent about $500 (including tip) between 3 people so definitely not a place for weekly dining for the commoner like me, but for a once in awhile treat, it can't be beaten."}
{"text":"Years ago, I went to nobu at the hard rock with my husband. We had the waiter help us choose various dishes and we enjoyed all of them. On my recent trip to vegas with my mom, we visited the nobu at caesar's palace. The waiter was accommodating when I said we would probably want to order just a few sushi rolls. He didn't pressure us at all to order more. We ended up starting with the shrimp tempura, which was very good. But had I known how great the sushi rolls were, we would have skipped the tempura - or gotten tempura rolls. Btw, not typical tempura, as there is not traditional panko breading. The shrimp is fried, but doesn't seem breaded at all.  We ordered California rolls, tuna rolls, yellowtail with jalapeño rolls and spicy tuna rolls. They were fantastic. Ambiance is wonderful. Service was stellar. I had a beer and my mom said that the Arnold palmer was the best she has ever had."}
{"text":"On my most recent and likely last (for awhile) Vegas trip, my intentions were to eat at some top-notch restaurants...We stayed at the Hard Rock and headed to Nobu...  Nobu was on a Friday night about 8:30pm after being at the Ditch Day Pool Party at the Palms all day...needless to say we were hungry!  Very vibrant atmosphere and great for a starter to the nights activities...  Our first try was the Washu Beef tataki style which we ordered rare...FABULOUS!!  Then onto the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (whoever was the first to pair these two is a genius) you can never go wrong with yellow-tail  Rolls and Sushi were fresh and good...the restaurant was packed and I can see why...would definitely go again"}
{"text":"It is hard to find good quality fish in Las Vegas being that we live in a desert and our nearest lake is radioactive. But Nobu manages to find some high quality and good tasting fish. So far this is the only Japanese restaurant in a Casino that I have actually liked.    The Bluefin toro Tartar was really fatty which I love and it was sitting in a wasabi sauce that was amazing. With the caviar on top it is one of the single best bites of food I have had.   If you go I would stick to the specialty items on the menu and not order the sushi. You can get near equal quality sushi for less money at other places and it will fill you up faster so you wont get to enjoy their menu as much. Also, the black cod with miso was sooooooo good. The fish melted in my mouth and didnt fall apart when I put a fork to it.   The Saki selection is small but the ones we tried were great.  The lack of 5 stars is due to the fact that we ordered Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was soaked in sauce and there was no resemblance of fish in the dish. Everything else we had we loved though."}
{"text":"I wish I wasn't both hungover and tired to enjoy the meal more because the experience, the setting and the food was excellent. Initially, I was a little skeptical of Nobu because it is part of a chain of restaurants. Being a little hungover, a friend and I decided to go since it was within our hotel, the Hard Rock. Despite the restaurant sits in the middle of the desert, the seafood is quite fresh.  The few things that we did try were really good. However, I didn't order away and try as many things as I have wanted to. I had my basic sushi which were hamachi, ikura, and unagi nigiri. Then I had my spicy hotate handroll. I was a little full after that but my friend and I ordered two warm dishes. The calamari pasta should not be missed but the yellowtail collar was slightly overcooked. I wish I had room for their specialty which is the black cod in miso but the calling of my hotel bed and urges of sleep were way too strong for me to resist."}
{"text":"5 Super Stars!  The restaurant is located inside the Hard Rock Cafe.  Highlight of my trip to LV last wkend! All I have to say, is \"Wow!\"  I'm impressed & amazed w/the chef's creation :0   $100+ per person for Omakase course (we ordered mostly sushi).  Below are some of the stuff I ate:  Red Snapper w/Shiso + Salt  (Very light & delicious) /  Halibut w/Green Onion & Ponzu-type sauce (:d) /  Ootoro (OMG, it melted in my mouth :d) /  Live Octopus + Octopus Wasabi side dish (not too spicy & light) / Trout w/ Jalapeño (nice kick of hotness; interesting) / Tobiuo + Ginger (Flying Fish; Sorta sticky...interesting) /  Squid w/Tomato Flakes (Chef said, \"The most expensive kind of Squid\" - very concise & easy way to describe the ingredient :p) /  Negi-Toro Roll (Fatty Tuna & Scallion Roll - Orthodox but good!) / Uni (Sea Urchin - so-so, actually not too great; this was my least fav) / Miso Soup (Just Ok) / Abalone + Liver (Pretty Cool) /  Kinmedai w/Sakura no Ha (Splendid Alfonsino w/a Leaf of Cherry Blossom - Awesome, my fav! Nice aroma)  Unagi w/Yuzu (Eel w/Citron - Interesting to have it non-kabayaki) / Anago (Sea Eel -Too Sweet for me :0) /  Yamaimo w/Shiso & Umeboshi (Yam w/Shiso & Japanese Pickled Plum; very sour & salty - Nice way to finish the meal! Light & Refreshing!) I don't think they used Nama-wasabi, but I didn't mind.  I know it's catered to non-Japanese, but they definitely can make a better green tea.   Other pros: Nice Decor & interior Design. No waiting time (although we came here pretty darn early; so, that may be why). I didn't really have that much issue w/ noise (like some other yelpers were saying). Great service (very attentive)!  Long story short, if you're thinking about visiting this place,  ordering some California Roll, Tuna Roll, or your regular Tuna, Salmon, & Yellowtail Sushi are waist of your money. I felt so sad to see some people next to us eating such thing & paying so much for their dinner. You can get those anywhere for a decent price w/any restaurants, unless you're going to places like Rio's Seafood Buffet (Their sushi taste nasty! Although everything else tasted good :p).   Anywa, Great Sushi*  Fish are fresh, Shari (the Rice) is nice and airy. Well worth the price. Order the Omakase :d I recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is excellent though not quite sure it's worth the price.   We had the black cod miso which I have had before and it's a favorite, seared scallops, jalapeño yellowtail sashimi and grilled octopus all were good.   We had the toro/scallion, spicy scallop and rainbow roll which were all good too, though there are better sushi places.  My only issue and why it's not 5 stars is the up-sale by the staff.   Our waitress was great but we couldn't stand the constant suggestions of trying different dishes etc.   I recognize the concept of the restaurant but at some point enough is enough and just let us order what we want.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"you must be tripping if you think this restaurant deserves 4+ stars. how the hell can you justify $20+ for seared hamachi with jalapeno? It's the same damn dish served by 50%+ of the other japanese restaurants out there, except it's $10 more expensive!  The quality of the food isn't bad, but it sure isn't on par with a Sasabune or Sushi-Zo. And there's nothing innovative about the menu at all that you cant get from most other japanese restaurants, so quality is really a big weighing factor here!  I get that there's a certain premium that you're expected to pay to dine at a prime location in Caesars, but they are literally bending you over the table, pulling down your pants, and....well, you get the idea.  The service was pretty good, so if you are looking to have dinner in a nice, upscale restaurant, and don't mind paying exorbitantly for decent food, then by all means this would be a respectable choice. But just know that you can very easily take a cab 10 min off the strip to any number of japanese restaurants that serve same or higher quality dishes at 1/3  ~ 1/2 of the cost.  I was browsing through a yelp review while i was there to see what to order, and i actually saw a reviewer sitting at the table next to us who gave the restaurant 5 stars. She was eating some maki rolls by nudging a roll with her chopsticks...onto a spoon, and then eating out of the spoon. Her bf is a lucky, lucky man...."}
{"text":"i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in LA for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. Nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.  now for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. And when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience.   *the YK50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light *shishito peppers - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame *tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips. *kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster. *yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p *sashimi salad. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix *amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh. *crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll. *tempura plate. the vegetables were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce) *fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance.   i do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas. Hands down! Black cod,  yellowtail jalapeno sashimi, house special roll, and lychee martinis. Pinch me!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing (my favorite: yellowtail sashimi with a citrus soy sauce, miso Alaskan cod and the bento desert), staff was extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the dishes. We went to the Hard Rock Vegas one on a Groupon and loved the food and experience. We will absolutely return and will also try other locations around the US."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We went to celebrate a family members graduation and of course we started  off with drinks. Amazing cocktails then we had sashimi that melted in your mouth and red meat that sliced like butter. We finished with dessert and then went into a food coma. We woke up the next day wanting more."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night. We got there at 10:30pm and it was still packed. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, very good. Followed by the shrimp tempura roll and lobster ceviche, both were good. I wouldn't say anything spectacular but good nevertheless. The best for last, the black cod miso lettuce wrap was very good. It's sweet, buttery, hot & cold, soft & crunchy. The dish was the highlight of the evening. The GF enjoyed the miso immensely. We also had the bento box dessert, simple but good. Service was good to us.  Being Nobu, you pay a pretty penny for a small amount of food. Ok...you'll drop a few bills here. But it's worth going to, esp. if you never been."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been to Nobu Las Vegas, the first time was probably 8 years ago and I remember loving the food!  This time, I was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:  1. New style sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  S.B. and I both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  One suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish... 2. Confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  I asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  We settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet. 3. The format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete with teriyaki chicken, salad, and tempura!  Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  I guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a Japanese restaurant.  It was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.  Back to the drawing board Nobu!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Just watch your waiter. We ordered a bottle of white wine and unknowingly he substituted the bottle with another more expensive bottle of wine. At 72 dollars a bottle it wasn't that great!"}
{"text":"I have heard about Nobu and knew it's expensive but wanted to try it.  My husband and I went there on Thurs eve.  They could only take us at 10pm.  It's really not worth spending the money.  Since it's our first time there, our waiter suggested a couple of cold dishes, then a couple of warm ones.  We had snapper ($34 for six very thin slices in a sour sauce) and yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño ($24). The fish was fresh, but not that special.  We also had the uni shooter ($16) and oyster shooter ($12).  They are both pretty good. My husband liked the oyster more.  For hot dishes, we had their famous black cod with miso ($30). We didn't really like it, the sauce was too sweet for us. Then we had the scallops with wasabi pepper ($36). The scallops were too dry and really spicy. We couldn't eat it so the waiter offered to take it back. The waiter asked if we like tempura. We said we like it ok. He suggested king crab tempura. As usual it's a tiny dish (about six small bite size pieces). We later saw it $48 on the bill. It was good but again very expensive.  Since the plates were so small, we ordered one more hot plate. It's the tobanyaki beef. It was good and the beef was tender. I think we liked this the best. It was ($44).  So overall, our experience was quite disappointing. We didn't mind paying $$$$ since we knew that it's a pricey place. But the food and the service were not a good experience.  If you really want to give it a try, purchase a groupon. We didn't think of checking groupon before going there. I later saw it available. You get $150 value for $95."}
{"text":"Fresh yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno Spicy miso scallop chips Tuna tataki with ponzu Black cod with miso Tenderloin of beef \"to-ban\" yaki  Best. Dinner. Ever.  Oh, and did I mention Lindsay Lohan with her new Hard Rock beau and bodyguards. Good times!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Do the food journey, trust your waiter to make selections and you will NOT be disappointed. Loved our experience!!"}
{"text":"I was spat on by the host - metaphorically speaking. Rude, pretentious hostesses, treat clients as if you owe them money. The place was completely empty, yet the hostess looked at me up and down and stated that I'd have to wait an hour. Then she made an off putting holocaust joke to her coworker and they giggled."}
{"text":"If it were possible, I'd give Nobu 4.5 stars.   My sweetie and I spent a few days in Las Vegas this week and went out to high-profile restaurants every night.  All of the food we ordered was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The sushi and sashimi were served at the perfect temperature, and everything tasted absolutely fresh.    Spicy Miso Chips w/Scallop Sashimi Squid Pasta Miso-Glazed Black Cod - (A Nobu specialty and the best piece of fish I've ever eaten) A Selection of Sashimi and sushi including yellowtail, fluke, salmon avocado roll, and yellowtail scallion roll. Flourless Chocolate Cake Bento Box - (As a pastry chef, I'm pretty wary of the whole \"flourless chocolate lava cake\" trend, but this one was fabulous, perfect texture and molten center,  served with white chocolate sauce and green tea ice cream. Yum!)  I'd say the prices were quite reasonable as well.  Keep in mind this -is Vegas, people.  After checking out -many- of the restaurant menus in other hotels I'd say Nobu was absolutely less expensive, and there's no way you're going to get better food quality.  The only half star missing would be for the quality of the service.  The clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.  He seemed almost on the verge of addressing us as \"guys\" or calling my sweetie \"boss\".  Nothing wrong with being friendly, but lets face it this isn't a diner.  A little more dignity would have been appropriate.  Luckily, the professionalism of the runners made up for it.    Yay Nobu!"}
{"text":"It's Nobu. It set the gold standard for Japanese fusion cuisine. A lot of Japanese restaurants have copied Nobu's dishes (Miso Black Cod, Japaneno Yellowtail), so you know they're doing something right, 20+ years after the original opened in New York City. I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said. Treat yourself and go."}
{"text":"Food:  it's good sushi but not worth the 3x premium they charge.  Sushi Roku is just as good and much less expensive.  Ambiance:  it's good and should be, but it's not a top flight experience.  It's a fine upscale dining experience but that's it.  The dining room itself lacks any real joie de vivre.  Prices:  extreme... Your paying a hefty premium to eat at Nobu.  To some, being able to name drop is worth the price, but the food and experience don't justify the price.  Final take:  Nobu is tasty but lacks inspiration.  The dining experience was nothing experiential nor terribly memorable.  Given all the other options in Vegas I won't be going back.  Life expectancy:  2-3 years"}
{"text":"Nobu is the best!  We always eat at the bar.  Everyone is so friendly and gives great attention.  Have tried so many dishes and all are great.  The atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"We are regular's at Caesar's Palace, but we tried Nobu for the first time on our last trip. We tried a number of different dishes from each section of the menu and everything was exceptional.    Our server, though young, was incredibly knowledgeable about the wine selection as well as their extensive menu.  I really could not ask or expect better service from a server or his accompanying busser and runner staff.  Nobu is deserving of the \"$$$$\" as is listed.  Expect to spend a decent amount of cash.  I am only disappointed with price when the service or food does not match. Our tab for two with a tasty bottle of wine and a nice selection of food was $270 + tip, but it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Ate here last night, the service was great, but I didn't think the food was over the top for the price. The wagyu beef we had was under seasoned and the sashimi in my opinion was just sashimi. I didn't have any flavors that wowed me. I would however go back and try it again. The menu is huge, so it is possible I just didn't get the right things for me. Presentation of all of the good was absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"Amazing service. We had each course and each was better than before. Highly recommended the fried rice balls dipped in soy sauce and spicy tuna. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd eat here every day!"}
{"text":"I've only had the pleasure of going there once, but it was memorable for sure! My boss loves sushi as much as I do and he went there on his last trip and highly recommended it. Before I left for Vegas he said go to Nobu and spend $150 on him!!! Nice boss!   I sat at the sushi bar and told my chef it was my first time and to make me something good and he certainly did. I left it all up to him and he served me numerous plates of fancy sashimi...salmon, yellowtail, barracuda, and more! I thought I would miss rice, but I did not. I had a Japanese beer and 2 glasses of red. I had no idea how much the check would be...turned out to be about $135 + tip, which worked out well for my budget! lol p.s. the wine was $17/glass...ouch. Anyway, I never ate so much sashimi before and enjoyed every bite!  Oh and  the waiter I had was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas and want Sushi, I come here. The Sushi is exceptional, I usually get the Toro, it melts in my mouth. I down it with a Sapporo. If I'm with a small group I like to sit at the bar and ask the Sushi chef what he recommends. Never have had bad food here, it never disappoints. The staff is nice & friendly. Bonus is, it's at the Hard Rock Hotel, so when I stay here I don't have to go far."}
{"text":"Pros:  Good service,great atmosphere. Delicious sushi, all fresh and presented well. We order many dishes. All were splendid.   Cons:  Pricey. This is where you go if you feel like splurging for sushi. Be prepared to drop a cool Franklin per person."}
{"text":"Just got back from Nobu. I sat at the sushi bar and ended up a little tipsy-er than expected. Even so, here is the review:  Their specialty dishes are really very good. I got both the Toro & Caviar dish and the Live Scallops. Yes. I really did pay $40 for the Toro and Caviar. Was it worth it? At least once. All of their normal sushi stuff was fresh and good, but to be honest, there are a million other sushi places that offer fresh, raw fish for a lot cheaper. So my suggestion? If you are going to go there, make sure to try at least a couple of the specialty dishes.  Decor seemed fine...I was more interested in the lightning hands with uber sharp knife sushi chef. He was not only super cool to watch, but also offered some superb suggestions, even though he clearly only understood a tiny bit of english. Ultra attentive wait staff...maybe even a little too attentive, but I think that is because chairs are so close together at the sushi bar that you can't have more than 1 plate in front of you at a time. In other words, if you didn't have an ultra-attentive wait staff, you wouldn't be able to order more food.  What keeps this place from 5 stars? PRICE. Wicked expensive. Like super-wicked. I know you expect to pay a bunch for good sushi, but this is pretty high. Drinks run $15, specialty items run $20-$40, and any other nigiri hangs at around $10. Though, you should be scared when you notice the no price dillio on their website.I had a great meal for sure, but I don't know if it would be worth $130 again.  I went alone, and didn't feel odd at all. I'd love to say that I'd be back, but the things that could hold me back are the price tag, and the lack of proximity to the strip. That being said, if you are getting some cost assistance (biznass trip), and are staying somewhere close (say...the Alexis Park Hotel), then I'd go for sure."}
{"text":"In Japanese, Nobu (?) means \"trust.\" I find it ironic then that I cannot TRUST the chef to provide a single delicious plate from his 7-course, daily \"chef's choice\" special at this Caesar's Palace location as 2 friends and myself experienced one of the worst dining experiences of our lives. I normally don't leave reviews, and when I do, they're usually positive. I've had sushi around the world, from Hong Kong to LA to Tsukiji in Tokyo, and while I didn't expect to have the best sushi of my life in Las Veags, I certainly didn't expect to have the WORST.   The visual presentation of the courses was cute, but that's about it--the sashimi was bland, the soup broth was burnt, and the oysters were mediocre at best. And even worse, we were still hungry at the end of this $600 colossal disappointment. We politely filed out complaints with the manager, who received our comments with condescension and refused to even apologize or attempt to offer anything that might have redeemed the night. He simply said, \"we appreciate the feedback\" and walked away.   But if you DO go here, do avoid the chef special or anything else that sounds fancy on their menu. TRUST me."}
{"text":"Just went back recently...glad this place is not closer...i would be here everyday!"}
{"text":"Didn't allow take out at lunch (I wanted rolls). One table seated and 5 people at the bar. EPIC FAIL. Everyone was next door watching the games in the betting area (NFL playoffs). not eating there. Ever."}
{"text":"Horrible service an cost was outrageous, even considering it was sushi... Be warned when you go, if you want to spend 500$ on appetizers an couple drinks then this is the place for you. This place will never have my service again... Hustlers."}
{"text":"Good service but the chef's omakase was very mediocre, even bad.  Sauces are way over powering on natural qualities of main ingredients and none really had complimentary flavor profiles.  Suggest going a la carte and picking out what you know you like.  Though, I would just put $400 on black and go eat at a food court.  You might lose $400 but you could also be up $400.  Regardless, the $20 you spend on food will have saved you a big chunk of change."}
{"text":"It's my first time to Nobu which I have been thinking about going forever!!!   I tried the Omakase $125 which was sooooo good. It came with 7-8 courses. It looked so simple but each bite was so flavorful. I just realized there is Nobu in Palo Alto too. I can't wait to go again!  Everyone is friendly. The waiter asked us our time frame so we wouldn't be late to watch the show. I appreciate the courtesy!  Not 5 stars because I ordered Old Fashioned. It's not as good as I thought it should be. But the food is definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"From the moment we arrived we received impeccable service and a customized menu which entailed the finest seafood as well as wagyu which outstanding! I would definitely recommend this location vs California. The entire selection of items off the menu were provocative to my taste buds and left me wanting more. This was a relationship full of amazing experiences rather than a dinner."}
{"text":"Nobu I love you!!  Came here on a Vegas trip with one of the girls and this was our first stop! We dolled up, drove to the Hard Rock where there is valet parking, and walked into the center of the first floor where this ridiculously delicious restaurant is located.  Service-Great! Everyone was really attentive. I always had my water filled, any finished dishes cleared off within the minute. The food came in really good timing as well. I was starving going in and I didn't have to wait. Although coming from a restaurant like this I didn't expect anything less.  The decor is really comfy and not as fancy as I'd originally thought (or the other Nobu restaurants apparently). You can definitely get away with begin pretty casual or dressing up your attire. While there were only small groups there they had some large tables and some hidden rooms for even larger groups so if you need to bring a lot of people it seems as thought they'd be able to accommodate for more people.  Now onto the best part of all! Fooood is so worth the price!! Dessert: lemme start with this one because I cannot get over the delicious trio of soy caramel, miso apple cinnamon donuts and a really delicious HOME MADE ice cream with toasted pecans. Their pastry chef changes the dessert menu every season to go with what's in season which means I'm going to have to come here every season :)  Apart from that we enjoyed the black cod miso, eggplant miso (best i've ever had, decent portion but very rich), yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (not spicy and very fresh!), japanese snapper dry miso (the garlic chips added great texture but the citrus oil sauce was too overpowering) and the shiitake mushroom salad (very strong citrus vinaigrette but delicious mushrooms to make up for it)  Awesome experience and a high price but definitely worth it :D"}
{"text":"When you hear that name, you know the food quality will not disappoint. We ask to sit at the sushi bar and The sushi chef is very personable. Price average per person is $125."}
{"text":"The lobster tacos were probably the most whimsical, brilliant, west coast culinary delight that I've ever tasted.  Sounds simple, but I dare any high end Mexican eatery to execute as well as the chefs at Nobu.  The Salmon tartare with caviar was different than anything I've ever put in my mouth.  Top 5 meals of my life."}
{"text":"Raw fish and scallops which were so fresh and clean, they had no fishy scent or aftertaste. Cod, trout and rock shrimp were melt-in-your-mouth good. Every bite was a joy to consume. Serve staff were attentive to a group of 5 women giggling and enjoying a fantastic meal accompanied by a bottle of rose. Food arrived well-presented, without long wait between courses. We were sushi novices before eating here. Nobu set a high standard. Expensive without the Groupon deal for us, mere mortals who went to Vegas on a budget. They allow up to 3 Groupons per table which other restaurants will not do. Bill for the 5-course tasting menu for 5 women with 3 Groupons and 1 bottle of rose came to $350. Thank you, Nobu, you made my 50th birthday memorable."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent customer service!  The staff quickly fixed one minor issue we had and from there they bent over backwards to make sure we were happy!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, the staff is wonderfully friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items, all and all an outstanding experience!!"}
{"text":"I go to Nobu,s every year I visit Las Vegas and it has always been great. I can only remember one year when my waiter was a bit slow and unresponsive at times but overall a must try if you like Japanese food."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Our favorite dishes were the Yellowtail with Jalapeno, Wagyu Tacos, Miso Spinach Salad and King Crab Tempura. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Best waiter ever . Chris at nobu Las Vegas . He knows his shit. Damn sushi was excellent .  He's so helpful. If your in Vegas come see him. You won't be disAppointed"}
{"text":"The fish was very fresh and the sushi was up there with the better restaurants I've ever been to.  It was pretty pricey, though not quite as expensive as I was anticipating.  But the real star of the show was our waiter.  He understood exactly the kind of meal we were going for and provided absolutely impeccable service."}
{"text":"Excellent...My reviews are based on food+price+city=stars, and they should always be proportionate to the rating.  (Chipolte is 5 stars in Barstow, CA  and Chipolte is 3 stars in Las Vegas, NV)  Really good sushi...but not that 20% better than the great many other sushi restaurants in LV.   Definitely worth the price if you are a tourist and staying on the strip, but if you are a from LV there are many great options that are similar in stars at a much more fair price.    The place is great...but to me its another commercial restaurant that you are paying for the name and reputation and not the \"food at a fair price\"  I am confident that the rating would be 5 Stars regardless of price if the chef who was on the sign owned/operated/was actually there weekly."}
{"text":"I am still amazed by how amazing the food was here. First and foremost, it was definitely worth the price.  My boyfriend and I have always wanted to try nobu everytime we were in Vegas but never got the chance. This week we were in Vegas and decided it would be the perfect time to try it.   Service: I really enjoyed the service here. We told our server it was our first time and she did a great good at explaining the menu. She kept it simple and really knew what she was talking about. She helped us named out some popular dishes but never forced anything on us. We decided to order a little bit of everything instead of the omakase. They also had helpers that were always constantly refilling our water and cleaning our table after every dish.  Decor: the decor inside was very modern. They kept it dark, which was a little bit too dark for me but I didn't mind it too much.   Food: The food here was absolutely amazing! Before we ate here my boyfriend and I were talking about how we don't think chefs were able to make sushi taste that different to charge the prices that they do. But as soon as we took a bite into the yellowtail jalapeño appetizer, it was delicious! The flavors were so well put together and had a great balance. I was in love with their new style scallops and salmon sashimi. Chef Nobu really nailed it. We also tried his signature Cod dish which was also amazing. I appreciate how they serve their cold food then Hot after, it really did make a big difference and we enjoyed our meal.  For two people we got to tried a little bit of everything and some of his best dishes. Our total was about $200, which I didn't think was that bad  for how amazing the food was. After dining here, it definitely changed my view on how to eat sushi. I would love to come back here again one day. Amazing job"}
{"text":"Well, I have tried many Japanese restaurants, I have also tried 'other' Nobus. The one in Las Vegas was simply not as good as the ones in California. Perhaps the fishes need to be shipped to a very dry desert and deteriorate during the transit. That being said, Nobu is one if not the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on the restaurant side only and not the teppenyaki side.    I went to this new Nobu on 2/13 and it was packed from walk-ins and pre-Valentine dates.  I called ahead to make reservations for 8 p.m. as that was the earliest you could make a reservation on that particular day due to a function.  The hostess on the phone was not very friendly and very rude, and I knew who she was as soon as I arrived.  The hostess desk was very unorganized and they had no clue as to what they were doing.  But this is the strip, people do not care what you think because they know they will get business no matter what and most people are from out of town and will not ever be back anyways.  The manager, who I quickly recognized from the Nobu in the Hard Rock needs to help them instead of stand around like I saw her do the whole night.  Anyways, that was really my only gripe about this place,  and I do not see this particular location getting another Michelin star anytime soon.  They cannot say the new servers and staff do not know what they are doing because they all came from the old Nobu.  Get it together. (Front desk, management).    As for the best part.  The sushi is still amazing here as well as all of their hot dishes.  Like most people that do not know anything about sushi, you will most likely get the Yellowtail Jalepeno sashimi dish because you heard it was good.....IT IS AMAZING, only 6 pieces but worth the $$$.  I have been to Nobu many times at different locations and I would highly a few of these dishes:  Yellowtail Jalepeno Sashimi Tuna Tataki Any of the New Style Tiradito dishes 100% get the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Sauce, you won't regret it. If your down for spending to impress get the O Toro Black Cod Miso Beware, shrimp tempura is only two pieces 8$ Get the Hamachi Kama for sure Most of these dishes are small, so if they don't fill you up get the beef of tenderloin But remember this is a Japanese restaurant not a steak house. And to top it off get the Bento Box for dessert!  If you haven't spent at least 100-120 per person you did not do Nobu right.  This place is no Jiro sushi and definitely better than Yellowtail in the Bellagio, which is a cheap ripoff of Nobu, but definitely the best Japanese restaurant you will find in the United States hands down.  Giving three stars for service."}
{"text":"I would give this place a million stars, but it only goes up to 5.  My husband and I were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino on our honeymoon, and received a gift card to Nobu, at our request, from my sister-in-law.  I've heard nothing but good things, and they were ALL true.  We chose the OMAKASE menu option.  We had 9 courses EACH, and the dessert came with THREE different items, for each of us.  We spent just under $400 after the tip for both of us, and it was WORTH EVERY PENNY.  The service and food was absolutely impeccable.  Our server was AMAZING.  The manager came out to our table personally and presented us with the gift card my sister-in-law had purchased prior, over the phone.  He also provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne.  I am terrible at naming cuisine that I don't normally eat, so can't remember specifically all items we had, but for certain, the YELLOWTAIL TARTARE W/ CAVIAR, the MUSHROOM SOUP, the BLACK COD w/ MISO, the WAGYU BEEF and the CHOCOLATE MOLTEN CAKE, GREEN TEA ICE CREAM AND CAPPUCINO desserts were so delicious.  I have not one bad thing to say about the food or service at this place.  Nobu at the Hard Rock is a GEM in the middle of a loud and crazy city.  This meal was the highlight of our dining experience on our week-long honeymoon in Vegas.  I would eat here every single day if I could."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food here is exceptional!  We had most of the restaurant's favorites and recommendations.  Some stand out dish were the black cod miso which was heavenly and my favorite was the toro sashimi - TO DIE FOR!!!  The service was good.  But the vibe at the restaurant was a little strange.  Felt a little bit too night club like, especially with the volume of the music.  I couldn't even hear our waitress at times.  But overall, a great place and I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Go to see and be seen in this gorgeous space. You're sitting in a fishbowl with all of Caesar's Palace swirling around you. Fish is fresh, tasty, and artfully presented. Excellent wine and beverage selections. Staff is a bit aloof. Be prepared to pay a premium for the privilege of dining in the new Vegas hotspot."}
{"text":"Wifey and I each ordered Omakase style which was delicious, fresh, and exciting. It's 5 courses, and they threw in an appetizer to hold you over while they made it. It's pricey with tip, I think we spent $300+, most of which was paid for by wifey's dad, who is a chinese mobster.  Go here if money ain't a thang and you want some yummy fish."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended to us by a waiter at another restaurant (thanks for the complete disappointment Eduardo!).  These are the dishes I tried:  - Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - was spectacular!  The flavors of this dish were very fresh and enjoyable  - New Style Sashimi Salmon - was basically thin slices of poached salmon drowning in sesame oil  - Albacore Sushi - thin slice, nothing special...  - Salmon Sushi- thin slice, nothing special...  - Spicy Tuna Roll- wasn't spicy and the nori wrap was gummy  Overpriced and completely not worth it.  And my new pet peeve - DO NOT wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while I am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  Clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  It's completely RUDE and I think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Easily the best Sushi I've ever had.  The Red Snapper was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Nobu in Los Angeles and it was excellent. So I decided to try the one in Vegas. To sum it all up, Nobu...Never. First, the service was indifferent. Judging from the attitude of servers, they just wanted their shift to be over. Second, we opted to sit at the sushi bar. I had to stare at the sushi chef for eternity just to get his attention. I like to order sushi one at a time for maximum enjoyment. Clearly, the chef was annoyed by all the extra work. Third, placemats were placed so closely together, there was no room for me to move without the risk of disturbing the diner next to me. Fourth, I know it's Vegas, but they don't have to put that many tables and chairs in a limited space...utterly cramped everywhere you look. For the price, they should have considered the comfort of diners a little bit."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. We went with a bunch of people and ordered a bunch of things on the menu. The shrimp tempura was great and the tuna was also excellent.  The sushi seemed extremely fresh and the cocktail menu is extensive. I had a lychee martini that was cool and also the tea infused vodka. The waiter said the tea vodka isn't a favorite, but if you like tea I think you'll enjoy it.   The service was great and we managed to get a reservation on a Friday night for 6 people (though we did have to do it during the last time slot)."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought it would be helpful to share our perspective on a recent visit to the Nobu Restaurant in Las Vegas (Caesars).  We both eat out a lot and love to dine at sushi places all over the country.   To keep our input brief, I will share the good and not so good aspects of the visit.  Good: ·  Quality sushi and special bites ·  Decent ambiance  Not so Good: ·  Major push to upsell you on items ·  Saki bottles are marked up 7 times- look them up for yourself ·  Service was horrible- wrong dishes brought out and 20 minute wait for drinks ·  Management staff seemed clueless"}
{"text":"Definitely a hopping place, but the food and service were just average and did not live up to the hype.  I ordered a wide range of sushi and sashimi and the only thing that was memorable was the yellow tail with jalapeño sashimi appetizer.  It was beautiful and delicious. The rest of the meal was pretty standard fare, and certainly not worth $125 per person, which is what our bill ended up being."}
{"text":"I'm only giving Nobu Vegas 3 stars, but part of this could be my fault.  In restrospect, I should not have ordered the Omakase Sushi as my dinner there.  Since Nobu is known for his innovative hot and cold dishes, I wish I had ordered a bunch of those instead.  One thing I did get to try was the Sea Urchin Tempura, which was very unique and tasty.  However, they really could've made the Omakase Sushi more interesting and worth the hefty price.  The sushi was fresh and all, but not very innovative or interesting at all.  It was just simple, no-frills negiri sushi.  I've had some fantastic and creative omakase sushi at more humble Japanese restaurants, so I thought Nobu could've done the same.  Perhaps I'll try one of Nobu's LA restaurants sometime."}
{"text":"Very, very good food, but still drastically overpriced. Maybe I'm just not used to Las Vegas restaurants, but $300 on dinner for two (no alcohol) is still a lot to me.   The most impressive part of the meal was probably the carpaccio type cold plates that made up the front part of the meal. Very interesting pairings of sashimi with citrus and chilies. Probably the best was the yellowtail with a paper-thin shaving of jalapeno and dressed with cilantro and yuzu ponzu. The warm preparations were also very good, but I was unimpressed with the \"signature\" black cod in miso glaze -- perfectly executed but quite simple and similar to many dishes I have had in Japan at far lower prices.   At $200 for dinner I would have been happy; at $300 it's just overpriced. Further, charging $10 a bottle for water (no complimentary water offered) is an insult to customers. Nobu is lucky he can cook."}
{"text":"have the bluefin toro tartare w/ caviar & the miso black cod - we made the mistake of ordering the lettuce wrap instead of the whole fish this weekend, order the fish instead of the wraps its muuuuch better. you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! I don't remember what else we had because we had one of each of the specials. *be sure to have uni w/ quail egg and the cucumber or acai martini   the service:  the first time we went it was impeccable.  second time, it was no bueno... I brought friends here bc I had been ranting and raving about it & they wanted to hear what the fuss was about. the food they loved (minus the lobster tacos). So about the service, I think the waiter was having some issues. i had him repeat the order beforehand bc I wanted everything to go smoothly. regardless of that he messed up our order. drinks - brought one too many, double ordered the miso black cod & the brought the wrong kobe dish which is $35 an oz..... we got a few ounces. It reflects me so I was bothered, I tried to work it out with the waiter bc I for one was not going to have us pay for HIS mistakes. he was only able to comp 2 oz of the kobe and remove half of the cod.. usually service can ruin a rating but I love the food and forgive the guy, must've been one of those days."}
{"text":"Nothing special except the outrageous prices. Well, I shouldn't say that. They have super sharp sushi knives... I've never seen sashimi cut so thin! 6 paper thin slices of hamachi for $30. Ouch. Asian Fusion, right. But I need a bit more. Jalapeño Hamachi. Done elsewhere just as well for half the price."}
{"text":"The team at front desk very rude and unprofessional.  The food is very expensive and for no reason.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"Nobu never fails.. Was there with a group and everyone loved all the dishes we were served. Some of my favorites are the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi, spicy tuna on crispy rice, miso black cod and the Chilean sea bass was divine! The tiraditos, ceviche and sushi are fresh and delicious. Dinner ended with a decflourless chocolate cake."}
{"text":"This restaurant was easily the most pretentious restaurant I've ever been too.  Also the most fun I've ever had at a restaurant in recent memory.  They serve little plates of bite sized sushi and Asian fusion that the chef prepared for us at his discretion, for ridiculous amounts of money. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful and had the best sense of humor.  They say stuff like \"this is baby yellowtail with miso sauce dusted with fennel pollen.\"  They know they're saying some pretentious stuff and they laughed with us about it without breaking character so to speak.  The best part is that the food was excellent.  Best sushi I've ever had.  Well presented with a genuine smile.  Fish so fresh it melted in my mouth.  For the price, the service and the fun I had tonight I'd say it was well worth the effort.  Be prepared to drop $100-300 per person + alcohol and tip."}
{"text":"I loved my food here! Please see pics of my appetizer and dessert. The service was wonderful from beginning to end. I had salmon wrapped pear as an appetizer. It was sprinkled with olive oil. Very fresh, light and refreshing! To drink...a lychee martini. It was good For my main course, I ordered the black cod with miso sauce. It was scrumptious! It was flaky and flavorful. I would order this again. I just couldn't go to a Japanese restaurant and not get sushi...so I order yellowtail with jalapeño. It was the right amount of spicy. Dessert...flourless chocolate cake...side of house made green tea ice cream garnished with blueberries and raspberries. Phenomenal! My only complaint is that it was extremely pricey. But I would still return!"}
{"text":"Put your dinner in their hands!!  Best nobu meal i have ever had. We just asked them to bring out dish after dish after dish for our group of 12 without ordering from the menu.  Every dish was spot on and better than the last.  Delicious rare ingredients from parts unknown.  Awesome service, awesome drinks.  One of the best meals i have ever had anywhere.  Expensive but amazing."}
{"text":"The kobe beef steak cooked on a hot rock at the table. Is the bomb!! Beware its very expensive, 8 oz feeds about four people and its around $300.00 but well worth it to get the full nobu experience!! The service was excellent too!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate the food was good and the service was okay.  The second time, well, I have no idea how the food was because I never got service.  They served everyone around including people who arrived after me.  Not even the sushi chef could get me service.  Worse part was they treated me as I was not even there.  Maybe because this time I was alone, maybe because I have several visible tattoos.  Don't know.  All I do know is I have no plans on returning.  Does not matter how good the food is.  If service is bad, it is not worth it.  You mileage may vary, but if you are alone and with visible tattoos, you may not get served."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a visit to the Las Vegas location of Nobu. We were disappointed with the decor, which is fairly decent modern with Asian flair, but lacking from the La Cienega location. It's also quite noisy during busy times so be prepared to either sit very close to your dining companions or speak LOUDER than normal.   The service here was impeccable. Our server was very knowledgeable and courses arrived exactly on schedule. Dishes, once finished, promptly removed.   The only disappointment I noticed was a difference in menu prices than the other locations, but expect the same food. We opted for omakase and it was definitely worth it. A much better choice than ordering a la carte.   I'd go back for a fun, casual dinner, but don't expect a serene ambiance. It's fairly lively inside."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, excellent service, friendly host, absolutely delicious dishes. We loved the thinly sliced yellow tail sushi. It was one of the most memorable appetizers we had on the strip. Their wine list is also quite decent, although their servers could be better trained at discussing their options and pairing the right glasses."}
{"text":"Nobu is hands down the best sushi on the strip. I lived in LV for 3 years, and have been a frequent visitor before and since. Naked Fish is the best, but it's off the strip. Nobu on the strip is incredible. I had one of the best dining experiences here of my life. Their service was amazing. Our waiter, Andrew (5 stars+!!), took our menus away from us in the early going. His confidence that he could order better than us was not misplaced. What followed as an incredible sampling from across the menu. We were exposed to a variety of flavors and types of sushi. It seemed that right after we finished a dish, and had a moment or two to talk it over, another roll appeared. I can't describe how wonderful and timely the service was. Maybe this is the best way - The next night we literally cut a meal at another sushi place short halfway through and jumped a cab back to Nobu. We were glad we did. Thank you Nobu, and thank you Andrew! Cheers."}
{"text":"If you like Sake, get the exclusive house Sake.  I repeat, If you like Sake, get the exclusive house Sake.  Great service, we entrusted the waiter to bring the best stuff and OH BOYYY did he ever.  Me + 3 people, bill was $400.  The Sake was $125 of that though, and we were full and sooo happy.  If you are gunna splurge in Vegas, on Sushi, and you love Sake,   you will not regret splurging here.  I'll definately be back."}
{"text":"Agree with other reviews. Sushi and rolls were amazing because the fish is so fresh.  The special dishes that we got were expensive and okay. I would stick with sushi and rolls. Service was okay; I think our waitress was new."}
{"text":"I'll just sum it up in a few words:  Everyone skinny and blonde. Service too good..almost annoying. Hot plates rich like butter. Sushi could be better. Alcohol..oh baby. Overall overhyped (DUH) but still kinda tasty!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend Nobu enough. The food was absolutely exceptional, particularly the Black Cod, scallops, and sushi. Nobu also offers an exceptional selection of quality cocktails and Japanese whiskeys. The staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, I would easily rank Nobu among my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"A disappointment all together. Food was good - not great... Server good - not great..... Busser - terrible!!! For that kind of restaurant and price I would have expected courteous and professional staff. Busser literally busted in between me and my son on 3 different occasions just grabbing plates without regard for whether we were done or in the middle of conversation. (We sat at the sushi bar). Final straw was when I was sitting with my napkin in my hand and he quite literally yanked it out of my hand - REALLY!!!! It took a lot of self-control not to stand up and yell out after him. We will never come again to endure that kind of treatment for a tab of $230 for two."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place while in Vegas as I knew the NOBU in New York is the real deal. First of all, it was in a weird location inside the Hard Rock, hard to find at first. We were dressed up a bit for a nice dinner and were getting some stares as everyone in the lobby was super casual. We walked past the slot machines, drunk frat boy almost falling over us, and there, we finally found it. Decor was quite dated and not so impressive for its name. We had wine and sake flights and way too much of it before food but the sashimi is the thing to get here. It's not raw, seared lightly with some delicious sauce. Sushi was very fresh as well. Our waiter was very funny and knowledgeable. Overall, even though it was quite expensive, it was doable according to the Vegas standard and I would return here again so that I can say, \" Can I have 10 plates of sashimi only please!\""}
{"text":"The menu offers interesting unique dishes.  I was almost going to try the truffle tasting but after the disappointing white truffle dobin mushi I am SOOOOOO glad that I didn't splurge on the $400 tasting menu.  We tried several pieces of sushi we had not heard of before and they were tender but not much flavor.  The black cod miso was delicious but the kitchen needs to do a better job at removing the bones - way too many left in - chef Nobu would be ashamed.  The sea bass with dry miso was just as delicious as the black cod.  The service was ok, but way below what I would have expected from a restaurant of this caliber.  The reception desk was well staffed but two of the three girls were clueless. the waitress was pleasant enough but didn't seem to be concerned at all about the amount of bones in the cod and I'm sure did not bring it to the kitchens attention.  the manager/assistant manager Annie should be fired - when an issue was brought to her attention she seemed receptive but all she did was hang out on at the sushi bar and never came back to follow up with us - a bigger slap was when she was straightening up chairs at the table across from us she deliberately avoided us and ran back to the sushi bar.  This is the second time I've eaten here and would not go back.  There are TOO MANY other options in Vegas with fabulous food and better management & staff.  No reason to waste your time and money on this restaurant.   However, I would absolutely stay in the hotel again - so many nice touches - almost felt as good as a Four Season's."}
{"text":"When I die - I want to come back as a Black Cod with Miso.  Why, you might ask?  So that when someone eats me, I can give back the warm fuzzy feeling I get from this dish.  Whoa.    Hands down, off-the-hook, delish!  Bring your ass here - and don't forget the Benjamins."}
{"text":"We arrived at our table and the waiter had no interest in giving us a menu. Instead he was wanting our party of six to let him bring us appetizers, and entree that he thought we would prefer. My wife ask for a menu and the waiter was put out. He did return with one menu. Others in my party ask for a menu, where the waiter eventually  brought them. He was obviously disinterested when we ask a few questions in regards to the menu. I then ask to speak with the manager, he in turn was condescending to my wife. That ended our brief experience. I can only speak for the Nobu at the Hard Rock. But definitely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for my birthday and my friends and I went here for my birthday meal. Everything was delicious! My favorites were the yellow tail sashimi with jalapenos and the black cod with miso sauce. AMAZING! Our waiter wasn't very friendly but the food made up for it. I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, loved the food. Highlights were rock shrimp tempura, yellowtail jalapeño sashimi."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Las Vegas is as great as NYC. Decor is amazing and food even better. I had Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and Cilantro cold appetizer. This is my favorite! Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu hot appetizer....awesome!  Soft-shell Crab and Lobster Roll and a Salmon Roll, traditional and fabulous!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience some of the best sushi in the country, you must make your way to Nobu at the Hard Rock Las Vegas, or Nobu New York.  Be prepared to spend $150+ per person.  Rolls run about $49 per order.  They have hot dishes and cold dishes.  I kid you not when I say, every dish will be better than the next.  If you have never been here, ask for the Chef's Special.  They will bring an 8 course meal specially made by the Chef.  This will cost you $150 per person before drinks and gratuity.   If that's too steep, go for the piece by piece sushi.  They run about $12+ each piece.  The atmosphere is definitely who's who.  Beautiful people everywhere, great music, dim but can be quite loud.  Other than that, worth a visit and worth every penny.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time.    Hot food: Tried the Sea Bass w/ Miso sauce, Teriyaki Tasmanian Sea Trout Skewers (Very similar to Salmon), and Shrimp Tempura.  All very very good, especially the Bass and Trout.   Sushi: Fish was the freshest around.  However, I was very disappointed with the lack of creativity.  I asked my Sushi Chef for anything unique that they do with their sushi.  Got a blank stare.  I'm used to the unrelated and not-so-famous Nobu's in Solana Beach, CA where creativity is more common than not, and what a difference it makes.    Service was incredible.  It felt as if they are standing behind you waiting for your every need.  I suppose you have to order off the specials if you want something creative (non-sushi), but you'll be paying a premium $30 to $75+ per plate.  Should be a 4 to 4.5 star, but since I had high expectations that weren't met, I'm docking my rating by a point."}
{"text":"I came here with a huge group, and so we got a bunch of different things.  Generally, the sushi ranged from good to fantastic - the ahi tuna was the best I've ever eaten in my life, and the tazmanian trout nigiri was out of this world!  All the other sashimi/nigiri/rolls I had were good, but didn't stand out.  The cooked dishes were just okay - we had some sort of sauteed scallops with scallions over rice, chicken and beef, and lobster tacos (these were very good!).  Dessert (pistachio and cherry blossom mochi ice cream balls) had fantastic flavor, but the mochi was very thick and very stiff.  I think I would enjoy this more if I came back with a much, much smaller party and stuck with only ordering sushi.  Besides the lobster tacos, skip anything thats cooked."}
{"text":"From a Celiac:  I have been to this location about 30 times in the last few years. We have always ordered the same thing: 10 tacos each then share rice and plain seabass. I am now completely following my Celiac diet which changed up my last time to Nobu significantly.  I'd have to say this was one of my favorite meals of all time.  We have now moved into the bar area, in a nest, instead of in the main dining room, which I hate. The decorations look like something cheap from Zurchers, and the booths make it feel like you're sitting in a cafeteria.  Anyway. This time, in a nest, in the bar area, we had Johnathan. This guy was FANTASTIC! I told him my new diet and he hooked me up with the best food ever. He had me try the New Style with Scallops with gluten free sauce. It was so amazing I refused to even share with the boyfriend. I made him eat his own tacos. Then I had the seabass, as it is prepared there with the sweeter sauce. Also amazing. Then... my favorite with the black cod miso prepared gluten free in lettuce cups. Those pieces just melted in my mouth. I wanted to go back the second night, but went to Jardin instead (huge mistake, that was horrific).   I really wish this location would get a better wine menu. That is a huge complaint of mine. It's worse than some of the restaurants in Utah- and they have the worse wine lists. I honestly don't like any of the Chardonnay, but I did get the Pouilly Fuisse and that was actually the perfect pairing.   All in all, totally my new favorite Celiac friendly restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Will never go to Nobu Las Vegas ever again! No ambiance and the fish (sushi and sashimi) are tasteless. It's sad when rock shrimp appetizer and mediocre cocktails are the best items in the meal. I guess this is how \"getting robbed\" feels like. Mizumi at Wynn provides better quality food and value - even for black cod dish. Wowww. To top it all - what great Japanese restaurants would charge for ponzu sauce?  Hahaha. I'm just laughing when I looked at my bill - didn't dispute the bill - just laughed. I would rather give $300 extra tip to the sushi chef at hamasaku in LA than go back to nobu again."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing. Have been to 5 different Nobus. Have been to the one at Caesars palace twice before. Had my first mediocre meal tonight. The service was rushed. The new Sashimi was tasteless. The only drinkable Sacki was $40 a glass (I tried 3 others), The Sushi was worse then I get in Michigan. The Tuna was very red. Wonder if it was gassed with Carbon Monoxide to get that color. Maybe they have over expanded."}
{"text":"I must admit, I have not been to a Nobu that I didn't like.  So yes, I am a fan of this high-end Japanese chain restaurant.  We had dinner here this past Friday night.  Unfortunately I am not fond of the hotel that it's located in... which is barely a step up from a Hooters-type ambiance with the class-less tatted out clientele and their hoochie mama's attached to their hips.  Well back in the day Hard Rock was the place to go to... but that was years ago.  So the fact that one has to step foot into the Hard Rock Casino to get into the entrance of this restaurant... should really get a minus star for not strategically relocating this at a more ritzy hotel casino like Bellagio or Cosmopolitan.     We started off with cocktails... Lychee martini and a greyhound... can't go wrong there.  As for the app...started off with the sea salted warm edemame.  I was so hungry, I practically ate all the soy beans.  I ordered the yummy Kelp salad and he ordered Hamachi sashimi with Jalepeno... so perfectly fresh with Ponzu sauce or Miso... so good!  He ordered the Shrimp with spicy garlic was sinfully delicious... (fried so not a healthy choice).  And I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with dried miso... my all time favorite, which did not disappoint!  Salmon, Hamachi and Unagi sushi... small but still so good.  AND we ended with yet another cocktail :-) and the Bento Box.... flourless chocholate cake with white chocolate sauce and green tea ice cream... OMG!  Amazing dinner with outstanding service.  Yes Nobu is expensive but I was fortunate that he was so generous... so not really sure what our bill was... but so worth every bite."}
{"text":"First time going to Nobu and I'd say it was definately a pleaser.  My friends and I decided to go to Nobu after hearing it was voted one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Service: Amazing. Excellect. Outstanding.  Food:  Over the top quality food.  I can't remember all the food we had but the ones that stood out.  Black cod miso. Yellow tail cold dish. My only disappointment would be the rolls.  I'd stick to the cold dishes and hot dishes and stay away from the rolls.  Sushi quality fish covered up in rice and seaweed.  If I stayed at the Hard Rock again I definately would go back."}
{"text":"the best sushi (melts in your mouth) and Japanese dishes ever!  EVerything is sooo good!"}
{"text":"Sushi in the Vegas Desert? Oh, yeah & worth the inland gamble!   San Francisco has made me a bonafide sushi snob & my elitist attitude usually precludes raw fish in non seaside cities.  But c'mon...it's Nobu!   Great location in the Hardrock & I like the funky space.  Initially planned to try the omasake, always a fan of chef's choice, but $100+ price per person was way out of our party of 8's budget.  We settled for delectable selection of other treats.  Peppers lightly sauteed and topped with sea salt & lobster tacos were big hits & additions to traditional sashimi & nigiri.   Better make sure you hit the blackjack table & win big before dining at Nobu...big name sushi comes with big bill...great sushi & fun atmosphere makes Nobu-Vegas worth the gamble!"}
{"text":"Aaaahh... what can I say. Nobu is awesome. Service was great as well. We ate several years ago at Nobu Atlantis and had a bad experience however decided to give Nobu Vegas a chance- boy are we glad that we did. Had the yellowtail  and ocean trout sashimis - so yummy. For hot dishes had the black cod with miso and ocean trout again. So delicious. Weren't that hungry since we had a late lunch at the pink taco also in HRH (which was not good food) so we were full after 2 cold and 2 hot and had to pass on the rolls which looked great."}
{"text":"We ordered the chef's tasting menu and the food was amazing!  Delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Nobu definitely lives up to it's reputation. This was a last minute splurge that replaced dinner reservations elsewhere. The menu is extensive and offers a wide range of options. There was so much to choose from, we ended up trying the Omakase multi-course dinner with flights of sake and whiskey as we thought this would be the best way to experience the chef's signature dishes.   Our meal started with cold appetizers which included chef's sushi and sashimi assortments. The Whitefish with Yuzu sauce just melts in your mouth while the crunchy sea grapes offers a different textural experience. The salmon carpaccio Salad with Lettuce Handroll was refreshing and crispy. The Chef's Sushi Assortment and Chef's Sashimi Assortment were decadently amazing. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, toro, Salmon Tartare with Caviar, Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar. Yum! The pickled peach that accompanied the appetizers was delicious.  Our hot entrees included their signature Black Cod Miso, which was succulent and both sweet and savory. The Beef Toban Yaki was tender and nicely paired with mushrooms and caramelized onions. I liked this much better than the NY bone-in steak we had for dinner the prior night at Bouchon. While the tofu was delicious, the miso soup was a little salty for me. I actually couldn't finish it after a couple sips.   We finished dinner with the bento box dessert which included a sinfully rich flourless Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Sauce, Shiso Syrup & Green Tea Ice Cream.    The service was wonderful and ambiance lively.  Looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"Incredibly attentive, but not too, service. Amazing meal. Refreshes the palette with every course. Very cool ambience."}
{"text":"It doesn't get ANY better than Nobu.  Straight up.     Now, I thought about just writing that above, but 'cmon you know that's not my style.  I believe in a previous review, I raved about Nobu and it wasn't even Nobu's review.  If you don't know what Nobu is, please move on.  It is culinary heaven.  If you don't know by now you probably never will.   I have eaten at a Nobu 4 times now.   Twice in Vegas, and twice in Los Angeles.   Chef Nobu and Mr. Deniro have got this bad boy down!   I have eaten sushi in Japan and it didn't even taste like this.   So here's the deal, I took a bunch of co-workers here.  Telling them it will be the dining experience of their lifetime.  Some were skeptical.   When the waiter said, has anyone dined with us before and I'm the only one that raised my hand, he knew that I knew that he knew it was about to be on!    So I jokingly said, sir, please keep it under $500 a person.  He said, well if you have eaten here then you know I could make it $1,000 person easily and you will still be hungry wanting more!   I was like yeah, I know....for that smart comment, keep it under $250.  :)    And he did.  However we left and the bill was just shy of $2K for 5 people.   I don't even need to get into what we had.  It was an assortment of 6 different courses that included sashimi, sushi, wagu beef, and then a desert of shaved ice with a hidden treasure in the bottom.   I've eaten all around the world, as my profile says.  Literally.  If you want the BEST hands down experience one could ever have, then Nobu is your answer.  Bring your wallet....and make sure you have a second credit card on hand cause you might max out your first one!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a huge self-admitted sushi addict and my husband is Peruvian, so Nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  Aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice.   We started out with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  Yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and I've had a similar dish at several excellent Bay Area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that I've had. The sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome added bonus (honestly, I've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in Vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise.   Next, we tried the Tiradito Nobu Style with some type of halibut like fish.  Now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  My husband says this is exactly what Tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in Peru.  It was amazing.  We then moved on to the Black Cod Miso next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that I was underwhelmed by.  I know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at Nobu, but I've had a very similar dish at both Morimoto Napa and at Hyakumi at Cesar's Palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that I have come to expect from the dish. The flavor was right on, and if I'd never had black cod before, I would have loved it.    So, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the New Style Salmon Sashimi (new style because it's served with ginger, and some other amazing deliciousnesss that I can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the Toro Green Onion Maki (Cut).  They were both amazing.   What shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two desserts we had were.  We tried the bento box, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea ice cream, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger ice cream.  I don't know if anyone else finds some green tea ice cream to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this ice cream was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  The warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger ice cream was a highlight of my whole trip to Vegas.  (And I'm not really a dessert person)  Okay, this review is way too long, and I didn't even mention the impeccable service.  I can't wait to go back and wish there was a Nobu in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 different rolls.  All had thick heavy rice and too much of it.mThe salmon Roll and tuna roll  had chopped fish! The shrimp tempura roll was flavorless and had a thin piece I'd shrimp. Even the edamame was mealy. I was so disappointed. Glad we joint order a big dinner. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service and overpriced. Food was good enough but not how I wanted to spend 3.5 hours..."}
{"text":"I went on a random trip to Vegas with a bunch of friends and highly recommended to everyone that we had to dine at Nobu. Sure enough, we were NOT disappointed.   This restaurant is absolutely amazing. A very trendy and upscale atmosphere with some of the most amazing food I've ever had. Our waiter did mention to us that Nobu is not known for their sushi, but boy was he wrong. We had some of the most amazing sushi ever at Nobu. Their most unforgettable plate was the Yellowtail Sahimi with jalapeno. PURE PERFECTION!  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I must first say that I was mislead by their online menu.  I was unaware of the EXTREMELY small portion sizes for each dish and that you are meant to get at least 2 to 3 items off of each section of the menu. I glanced at the prices to get an idea of what I was in for before making reservations. That being said, I am aware that does not reflect on the quality or the dining experience. The food itself was good (I highly recommend the tuna tataki). However, you get next to nothing for the price. What you do get however, is a very loud atmosphere (think open walls so that the noise of the casino spills over into the quiet, dimly lit setting of the restaurant), and service leading much to be desired. When we informed our server (who looked distracted and slightly as if we were bothering him the whole time, not cracking so much as a smile once) that this was our 1st time, he spent all of 15 seconds explaining the very complicated menu. He also became even less interested in us when we only ordered about $200 worth of food, when he clearly would have like for us to order $250 per person. To his credit, our waters stayed filled and the food came very quickly. But the noise meant we could barely talk, despite the romantic setting. We ended up ordering 2 items from the cold menu (tuna tataki and 2 bite size salmon tacos), 1 from the hot (creamy spicy rock shrimp that was just a step up from bar food), and 2 sushi rolls (very soft rice but overall forgettable), spent almost $200 and ended up getting burgers afterwards because we were so hungry ,which is just crazy. Overall notes? Do your homework first, and be prepared to drop $400 or more easily, but also to not be able to speak to each other or enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow!  Let me first start out by saying the food was good but that is all I can say about this restaurant.  After we decided that the 125.00 per person to 225.00 option was not what we had in mind for tonight's dinner,  the evening fell of a cliff.  We wanted a quick bite before a show,  made reservations  and since we were not spending an absurd amount of money person, we were ignored by the staff.  Our waitress for the evening placed our order and then never returned.  Only when she heard us ask another person for the bill did she come back.  We went looking for a nice evening out with friends and excited for the night.  This was a huge disappoint.  I'm am very sorry to say I will not go back to the restaurant  again."}
{"text":"It is the best restaurant in vegas!!  High quality and fresh ingredients!!  All dishes are different taste and suer delicious!!!  I would like to eat every day!!!  I also come to here with my infant baby. They allowed baby!!"}
{"text":"Well... Had high hopes but extremely disappointed tonight... Nobu has been one of our favorite restaurants, we love making a stop here when we hit vegas. I dont mind paying a high price if its worth it... But... We ordered omakase... 2 of them.. Our bill was $300... One of our courses was miso soup..really?... We just dropped 300 bucks and you guys are serving us soup? Severely disappointing when the soup came toward the end. The sushi course with a few different pieces of fish didn't taste quite right... which is why i asked for soy sauce... But everyone insisted i taste the fish and it would be overpowering... The salmon course and cod were wonderful but not worth that price tag. Lastly the lava cake for desert wasnt even that great considering the ones i just picked up from Trader Joes earlier this week were better...We wont be back for that price with that quality of food... RIP OFF..."}
{"text":"New style sashimi and washu beef are to die for. We also loved sea bass with dried miso."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  One thing I wish we would have realized or been told is that everything comes out as its ready and each person doesn't really order a meal for themselves but everything is shared more or less. The black cod was delicious and a definite must. My husband ordered sushi and thought it was just okay; I would stick more with the hot and cold plates. The dessert we ordered was amazing, I believe it was called Kinko or something (chocolate crisp with carmelized bananas), last dessert on the list. Our waiter recommended it and I am so glad he did. Overall we would return but not without trying other Vegas restaurants first."}
{"text":"A perfect escape from the typical Las Vegas fare. Super fresh fish and incredibly prepared Sushi. I have a few slices of sashimi as well as some rolls and was perfectly content. I sat at the sushi bar and was well attended to. Definitely on the higher end in terms of cost for sushi, but reasonable when you consider the alternative dining at this level. Seating is prompt usually when you want to sit at the bar, but reservations are highly recommended if you want a table."}
{"text":"Was waiting to be acknowledged for my reservation , but the 4 hostesses were more interested in gossiping than acknowledging paying customers..  wasn't very inviting  at first,  but waiter was attentive,  meal was a bit over priced,  but good.  I went back a few days later and sat at sushi bar & the sushi chef was attentive. But the \" waiter\" made it seem like i was an inconvenience. ...    I don't mind spending $$ for good food,  but do mind pretentiousness. .. so for that reason.. only 3 stars"}
{"text":"We make a point to come here almost every time we're in Vegas (which is often) and we have never been disappointed.  We like the small plate/sharing concept, but also like that there are entree size dishes too (which we could also share).  The Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna is a must have - it's the ultimate umami dish. Hot crispy sticky rice cubes, salty sweet dipping sauce and a creamy cold tuna spread create a one of a kind flavor that melts your palate - it's seriously such a one of a kind flavor meld that you'll remember the first time you had it.  And  you'll want to get it again and again.  Black cod miso is Nobu's signature dish, it's so delicate and tender it's like butter, the miso glaze is sweet (but not too sweet) and the fish will literally melt in your mouth.  It's delicious with hot rice.  The Wagyu gyoza takes potstickers to new heights - the beef is tender, delicious and the scallions and shoyu take this common appetizer to first class.  The wonton wrapper isn't too thick (thick wrappers are a no no in my book) and they're steamed to perfection.  Scallops with spicy garlic was flavorful with pattypan squash, asparagus, and big fat scallops grilled and cooked perfectly.  The only miss was the creamy spicy crab - yikes, this should come off the menu.  The creamy spicy sauce was cloying and completely smothered the crab, it was buried under it. The crab was tough and not appealing.  The waiter noticed we didn't have much of it, asked if we liked it, we said no, he removed it from the bill.  Yellowtail jalapeño, rock shrimp tempura, and toro are also great.  Skip the tacos - they're overpriced and not that interesting.  Service is swift and attentive without being intrusive.  We never had to ask for refills and our used plates were quickly replaced with clean ones (which is great when you're having small plate dishes and mixing the flavors on a single plate doesn't always taste great).  If you like Japanese food with a hint of Latin flair, treat yourself."}
{"text":"Well, we informed the Maitre d' that its an anniversary dinner when we booked the reservation.  But, we were disappointed that nothing was done to the dessert we ordered.  Plus since I was prego, I was not suppose to eat any half-cooked eggs.  But waiter insisted the chocolate cake is cooked.  But it turns out  the chocolate cake was more a chocolate souffle...which is usually intentionally runny and NOT 100% cooked inside!  So, I guess it was not a \"sweet\" ending UNFORTUNATELY.  Plus we also had to wait a good 15 minutes just to get the check after we are done.  Sure went from 5 star to 3 star for us.  I don't like RISKS. especially on special occasions....So, we'll think twice about coming back.  On the Positive Note: The bus boy was gave Superb service and attention to water/tea refills.  Waiters were overall good to great.  My food was not as good as normal.  But, I had LIMITED selection due to being prego.  (no raw, no sake, no sea bass... all the tasty foods out the window!)"}
{"text":"This would have been four stars, but the inner kitchen made a serious error.  The decor was natural, grounding, with a slightly modern twist.  The restaurant was too loud, but the noise was voices and the casino a bit.  It would have been much better if it wasn't so loud and you could concentrate on the food.    I ordered the specialty tasting menu which is a seven course meal that is over a hundred dollars.  I made it known to my server that I eat \"Kosher style only fish that have scales and fins, when alive e.g., salmon, Tuna, white fish, etc, No shell fish under any circumstances, lard, red meat, or gelatin unless it is seaweed gelatin.\"     The hors d'oeuvres, salad, and specialty roles were amazing!  They told stories in my mouth and gave me a unique and exhilarating experience. The warm dishes were good, but the specialty rolls are so much better.  Stay away from the basic sashmi and regular rolls.  It wasn't worth it for the price.     The fiasco really started when I was given miso soup with shells in it!  That type of error should NOT happen.  It was a mistake in the kitchen, but the manager was very lucky that I was not allergic.  While she apologized, and asked how she could make it right.  I had to suggest a discount.  I think that it should have been immediately offered.  To the manager's credit she did ask if I had a shell fish allergy, and she did go immediately to talk to the kitchen, but that kind of error is inexcusable to me.  This is especially true given how much I stressed no shell fish and how severe shell fish allergies can be."}
{"text":"Order the Black Cod Miso! Hands down the best fish that I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in the HRH, but very hot-and-cold.  The Creamy Crab appetizer and Lotus chips were out of this world delicious.  The Molten cake desert = divine.  The Spicy tuna and Yellow-Tail & Jalapeno rolls were meh, definitely had A LOT better; the seaweed seemed a bit old and the rice was over cooked.  The service there was the best I experienced in the HRH (next to the security, surprisingly awesome guys) and the atmosphere was also very nice.  I just love the concept though,  it is basically Asian cuisine meets Tapas.    Worth it if you are staying at the HRH;  not worth seeking out... except maybe for the cake :)"}
{"text":"Amazing dishes, top quality and amazing staff who work with you to recommend different dishes based on your preferences.  Every dish is a work of art and is meticulously created to appeal to all your senses.    Recommended dishes.  1. Black cod miso - best fish I have ever had  2. Tuna tartar  3. Hamachi sashimi - symphony of flavours.  4. New age sashimi   Skip the sushi rolls.  They are good but not worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a guy who likes to eat really cheap food. I will even eat Taco Bell over Chipotle just to save a few bucks. However, I was invited to dine at Nobu and even be seated at the Teppanyaki table (they cook the food right before your eyes).   I almost had a heart attack when I opened the menu. Prices ranged from $5 for one piece of sushi all the way to $600 for a 12 oz. steak. Being at the Teppanyaki table, the best experience is to order from the teppanyaki menus which (excuse my lack of fancy vocab) was kind of like a 6 course meal. Everyone in the party ordered the same food course thing.  After a few minutes our chef, Nick, came over and introduced himself. Before cooking he asked if we wanted to see a \"quick show\". In just a few seconds he had his cooking utensils flying everywhere and spinning in a rhythmic, stylish manner. The tricks didn't  stop there; even while preparing the food, he would throw eggs in the air catching and breaking them with one swing of his spatula. I've seen magicians who aren't even as quick as this guy was.   Aside from the incredible sleight of hand, Nick was very fun to talk with and the whole atmosphere felt much more alive than just a chef cooking food. He told jokes and interesting stories. I would give Nobu 5 stars just for Mick's performance.   The food itself was outstanding. Being used to eating cheap and on a budget, this dinner blew my mind. The steaks were so tender that you could cut them with chopsticks (which are the main eating utensils). Everything was so well prepared and delicious (plus you get to see it made right in front of you). Even though the prices may be steep, you get more than just a meal; it's an experience."}
{"text":"OMG the Albacore was AMAZING, With garlic. We had the famous Black Cod, very good! Salmon ok. Yellow tail good. Octopus was firm and thick. We had the $35 yellow tail belly seared with jalapeño sauce something really good but not worth $$. Ohhhh the MOCHI oh my god Guava was super delish!!  Will be back for sure. And the service is on point! You pay what you get here for sure."}
{"text":"Yup giving it 5 stars!  I've been to Nobu NYC, Nobu next door NYC and Nobu Malibu and Vegas had them all beat!!  We put our meal in the hands of our amazing wait staff for our client night out and we were blown away. I can't even go into all of the incredible and unique things we had but of particular interest was the Wagu beef cooking on hot rocks table side, crispy rice and cod. Must check it out and let the waiter do the ordering."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype.  Had the chef's selection menu,  quite expensive.  Tasty sushi, uni shooters, yellowtail and jalapeños."}
{"text":"First impression: Cheap chopsticks! Really? I don't want to taste wood while I'm eating expensive food.   The waiter, Billy, was great! Even though I couldn't hear half of the things he was saying, he was really into the presentation and food. The atmosphere was loud so I could not hear.   We were two people on a romantic vacation. We both decided to get one of the chefs daily selection and one of the creations where they choose from the existing menu. My dining partner also elected to get the sake flight - a presentation of a carefully selected sake to accompany the dish they select for you. Everything was great! We both have our favorites and preferences, but not having been there before, it was nice to have someone else choose the better dishes. I expected to leave hungry. Instead, I was so full I thought I was going to die. Could have done without the final sushi dishes or dessert. This trip was meant to be a search for interesting food. I think we were pleasantly interested. Just two suggestions: go lighter on the sauces. Good fish does not need to be covered up with a heavy sauce. Secondly, change the decor. Wooden tables and cheap wooden chopsticks leave you with a sense of the mediocre not extravagant."}
{"text":"I almost die eating at Nobu! On May 31, 2016 I want to Nobu with a friend and we both became ill! I had to be taking to the hospital by ambulance. I suffered serous, severe life threatening injuries. I had to stay in the hospital for 3 days taking dialysis treatments. The only thing the GM would say is that they \"made the dish earlier in the day and reheated it because it was to late to make a fresh dish! It takes 20 mins to make the dish\" I ended up having a $40,000 hospital and no one from Nobu would return my calls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Japanese restaurants that I have been to. The fish is SO fresh. I would go back again and again if I could afford it. The service is amazing and the serving size is just right. It is family style so they encourage you to order a few more dishes than usual because it's for sharing and the sizes are not that big.  Here's what we ordered: -Salmon Tartare with Caviar (It was so fresh and soft. The salmon pieces were also cut much smaller than other tartares, beef and tuna, that I have had before.) -Yellow tail Jalapeno (My ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE!!! I can eat this day and night. I'm not one to eat a lot of spicy food, but a small slice on top of the fish isn't bad at all.) -Chilean Sea Bass with Balsamic Teriyaki (ddddelicious! so tender!) -Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic (Mind you the past is the is the squid pieces. There is no actual pasta. It was so good! The squid wasn't chewy at all!) -Tasmanian Ocean Trout with Crispy Baby Spinach (the spinach wilted a bit in the sauce, so eat it quick. It may get too salty that way.) -Bento Box and Kinako Crunch for dessert (both delicious and delicately made, but I'd prefer to eat the main dishes and appetisers)  I wish I had eaten everything on that menu! :o)"}
{"text":"The universe isn't so complex.  There is always something simple that governs how everything works.  Think of a really good song. It will start subtly, build up anticipation, then rock you with the chorus, keep you there for a while, and slowly let you down.  This is true of any good thing, a good book, a good time, a good movie, and life if you do it all right.  If you understand this principle, then the same is applicable with a good meal.  I made the mistake ordering the Chef's Choice during my one and last visit to Nobu on one of my many excursions to Vegas.  The anticipation of eating here is enough with all the effort required just to get in the door of this place.  When you do walk in, you will be dazzled.  Everything is beautiful here, the paint on the walls, the sculptures you'll pass on your way to being seated, the kitchen, the staff, and even the patrons.  And when you finally do get your first course, you will feel as if you just might be taken to a place you have never been before.  It is so good.  But then the rest of the meal just doesn't follow the principle mentioned above.  The order of things was wrong.  Some courses didn't build on the last.  By the time you finish the last course, you can't remember the first.  Because taken as a whole the meal is forgettable.  Now my friends that ordered entrees coupled with various sushi plates, their meals were wonderful.  But it is a big disappointment especially since the Chef's Choice is Nobu's flagship dish and most expensive item.  You are ultimately left with an empty experience afterwards.  Which is the case with the whole experience at Nobu.  It ended up being empty which had a lot to do with the content of my stomach after the meal.  As it too was empty.  I can see where Nobu get's its reputation.  You'll be able to see this too when you walk into this place.  But you will also be able to see that a lot of that is due to style and has little to do with sustenance (pun intended)."}
{"text":"Nothing short if amazing! This food was SO delicious and fresh. I thought I tried everything and I guess not. I can't remember his name but there was an el salvadorian sushi chef there and he was so creative I told him things I like and he just handed me dishes he thought I would like and they were all yummy!! You have to try the flourless lava cake....to die for!!"}
{"text":"These dudes know what they're doing with fish.    Our waiter was super knowledgeable, even accommodating a vegan at our table.  The waiter suggested lots of interesting dishes like Salmon-Jalapeno sushi, miso-soaked cod, scallops, some kind of bite-sized salmon fried cubes (tastier than it sounds), and some sea urchin sushi.    Cool stuff.  Just wish these fishmongers charged less than $35 for a typical dish because it adds up (note to self:  drink less Sake next time)"}
{"text":"So much fun!  We sat in the bar area because of recommendations of two locals.  The service was outstanding from the server picking out the historical favorites to the food runners explaining the dishes as they drop them off even going as far as telling us how to consume them.  We started off on the Cold Dishes and had the Yellow Fin with Jalapeño and Cilantro and it ended up being one of the best things we have every eaten.  We also really enjoyed the Spicy Peppers from the starters.  If you have never been to Nobu this would be a great way to start.  Our server then told us to try the Cod with Miso sauce.  This is the chef's speciality.  The most surprising part of this dish was not the taste which was amazing.  our how flakey and light the fish was.  It was the size.  The portion size was huge!  A absolute must to try.  To finish off the dinner I had the sashimi section and she had the rolls.  We both agreed Nabu would have been five stars if the rolls were better.  But what do you expect they are rolls?  The seaweed wrap took away from the flavor of the fish."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! There wasn't a dish that our table didn't love. However, they state the tacos are sharable, and they're not. They're about 10-15 a pop and they are bite sized. Our bill for a 5 people was over $900 (with drinks). Very pricy."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Very busy, but they were able to get us a table for two in 45 mins. Get the oyster or uni shooter... oh it was short lived, but it was heavenly!"}
{"text":"my favorite restaurant thus far! Everything we ate was a culinary masterpiece. The hub & I went with the 2nd level Omakase menu. As we understood it, the 1st level is a sampling of their menu items, whereas the 2nd level allows for more creativity (and better ingredients) by  your chefs. Maybe it was being in Vegas, but why not - we're at Nobu! High roll it all the way! Our courteous waiter proceeded to ask us if there was anything that we were allergic to or simply did not like. While I'm game for anything, i appreciated the question.  We were surprised to receive a complimentary appetizer (I think because we were first timers - and duh, we ordered the most expensive option on the menu already!) of the Spicy Miso Chips with tuna tartar - Excellent! It was followed by 4 succulent cold dishes, a peach sorbet to 'clean our palettes', 3 mouthwatering hot dishes, a clear clam broth, a plate of nigiri and then a deliciously light chocolate dessert (i dont even know how to describe it, and i was raised in a bakery!) with fresh berries made special by the pastry chef. These were plates PER PERSON. I won't go into the details of each plate cuz there were too many, and none of it is on the menu anyway since they make it up for you on that day - but we were literally in HEAVEN. Time stopped still and it wasn't till we walked out that I realized we had been there for 3 hours!  I kid you not, everything that I ate here that night, my tastebuds had NEVER tasted before. Even the exotic nigiri was a whole 'nother level of meat. My Nobu experience was completely unique of anything i've ever had.  While its a pricey meal, it's one that I will gladly shell out for"}
{"text":"Mooi, sfeervol Japans restaurant. Prima eten. Sushi is heerlijk. Je proeft dat ze kwaliteit ingredienten gebruiken. Bediening is professioneel en vriendelijk. Jammer dat een groep tieners ons etentje verstoorden met luidruchtig geschreeuw en gegil."}
{"text":"Food was great - yellow tail sashimi with the ponzu sauce coupled w/ cilantro is worth going alone.. I'm not exaggerating.  One little complaint I have is that when going with a group they say they will get you an amount to feed everyone, but neglect to mention is that they will charge you per order and will just kinda guesstimate how many orders you actually ate.  I mean, the place isn't cheap and we knew that coming in but did we really need 8 orders of sashimi? I'm not going to overthink it because it's not that big of a deal and I was comfortably stuffed. Overall was a great time (esp. when you end up not paying! Hey I'm worth it.)...."}
{"text":"I've been to Nobu in Vegas twice before and in NYC once and always loved it, so, naturally, when in Vegas with a friend, we made a reservation for dinner.  My friend is a big Nobu fan as well, and we were both disappointed with our experience this trip to Vegas.  What was great about the service - that they brought the dish, explained it and then left us alone to enjoy food w/o constantly checking in w/ us - also turned out to be an issue.  When we were ready to order more sake, we waited over 15 minutes, and, when no server had come to our table, my friend got up and found one to take our order.  The food this time was also a disappointment.  The rock shrimp tempura wasn't as tastey as always, and the sushi rolls were just ordinary.  Certainly not good enough for Nobu prices.  The Miso Cod and Yellow Tail Sashimi were both delicious, but the others were sub-par for Nobu's reputation.  Sometimes, I'm not sure it's a good thing to have all the big name restaurants in Vegas... if the big name chefs are elsewhere, the Vegas fare seems to suffer."}
{"text":"Holy Vegas. This place takes Japanese food and sushi to a whole other level. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm glad this place isn't in Seattle or else I'd be one broke individual.  Their food is heavenly. I'm talking heavenly, and I have had a lot of really good omakases before. Their sashimi is a cut above the rest! Fresh, meaty, delicious, I'm talking mouthgasms over and over and over.  This place is not just a restaurant, it's an experience. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Went to Nobu at Caesars with the my family last night. Took the waiters recommendation to try the Omakase Chef's selection and was not impressed. The servers told me 3 different geographic locations of the Ora Salmon, and they never got it right. The fish was only average. The real problem was the bill, not worth what I received. I felt taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Yup, this is how a nouveau-sushi bar is supposed to be.  Fantastically-fresh fish, creative menu twists to go with old stand-bys and top, top service from the men with the magic rice."}
{"text":"If ever in Las Vegas, you must eat at Nobu Restaurant.  Inside the Cesars Palace.  The food was phenomenal, japanese food with peruvian spices.  OMG.  Service was great also."}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was about $400 with for the both of us and well worth the price.  We are teppanyaki fans and so we decided to splurge and eat here.  The teppanyaki starts at $90 per person and goes up from there; we got the $140 plates and I know there are more expensive ones.  For that we got two proteins (me fillet and scallops, her sea bass and shrimp)  everything was cooked perfectly, and if you are a scallops or sea bass fan you know how difficult that can be.  The crab fried rice and miso soup were served afterwards so as not to fill us up before the main meal and the cake and ice cream in the bento box for dessert?  The illustrious girlfriend doesn't like chocolate and it was so good her box was spotless.  Here's the thing, they use the choices cuts (no tail of collar meat on their seafood) and they truly understand that freshness and quality are ingredients as much as spices.  They also value the experience.  No knives flying around like a Benihana.  Each item was cooked individually and is meant to be savored.  Their crab fried rice ... I don't know how they got such a luscious mouth feel with only a little butter.  The teriyaki is simply the best.  Their wasabi sauce is phenomenal and not spicy.    In short, I have been informed that everytime we are in Vegas, we are eating a dinner her."}
{"text":"We love sushi and the Nobu in Malibu is good! So we decided to try Nobu in Las Vegas.  Hostess: Definitely was not wearing appropriate attire. She was not friendly and everything she said was with an attitude. Server: She was very straight forward and not welcoming. She gave us some suggestions and then came back to take our order. My dad likes to order a bunch of things on the menu so we can try it all, especially if the portions are smaller. The server cuts him off and tells him to stop ordering because it's too much food for us...? I have never heard a server tell there table that they are ordering 'too much'. She didn't even say it a nice way, just very bluntly said that. Anyways, our plates came one by one, which was nice because we got to enjoy each piece.  Server rarely checked up on us and didn't care at all. We wish we had the other server that was at the table next to us, she was smiling and giving suggestions to her table, providing very professional service. Food: The quality of the food was very good. The fish was fresh and every plate had its own unique taste. It was perfection. The flourless cake for dessert and coffee with it was perfect touch to end our meal.  Because of the poor quality service we received, especially because we don't mind how much the price is, we will definitely not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Everything I had was delicious but there was not as much gluten free items as I would expect. They had gluten free soy sauce but many seafood items, like scallops and sea bass skewers were marinated that was not gluten free. So mostly shashimi was gluten free which is common to any Japanese restaurant. It was a little disappointing but they have a flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream which was very delicious, and there were only two cold dishes that could be made gluten free, Japanese snapper and yellowtail with jalapeños, I tried the snapper and it was extremely tasty! My husband had the teriyaki beef skewers and it was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Black Cod was good. I tried it on recommendation from a friend who LOVED it. It was a little sweeter than I was expecting, almost like a fish desert. But I was glad I tried it.   Sashimi was fresh, but I was expecting to be blown away, and I wasn't. It was very expensive and a little disappointing for all the hype the place gets. Like I said, I had high expectations, and they weren't met... probably wouldn't go again, not with so many other good restaurants to try."}
{"text":"I had to create a Yelp account just to leave a review for my experience at Nobu! What an amazing dining experience.  I was in Vegas for a convention and decided to treat myself to a nice sushi dinner.  I ended up getting the $125 omakase which has sushi but also some of their popular hot dishes.  It was a very well-rounded meal and I left full and satisfied!  They asked me about my dining habits before the meal and if I had a time limit.  I ended up spending almost two hours at the sushi bar but enjoyed myself watching and interacting with the sushi chefs. My waiter was very attentive and every dish was described in detail by the chef or the food runner.  They explained what should be enjoyed together and what order they recommended eating each bite in to experience the best flavors.    Their signature dishes were amazing.  I really wasn't interested in hot dishes but honestly the Black Cod Miso was phenomenal.  The fish was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The sushi chef overheard me talking to a neighbor about my favorite being uni and as a nice surprise he added it to my final sushi tasting.  Overall I had a great experience and all the flavors were on point.  My waiter took very good care of me and was helpful in suggesting Japan's top craft beer instead of the normal Kirin or Sapporo. I plan on returning with my wife and getting the second tier omakase meal."}
{"text":"Long wait and poor service as well as over priced. Enjoy! Sushi was ok but not in anyway the best we have had.   Large sake is $44 each... Fun times.."}
{"text":"Was able to snag a table for six on Saturday night with only a 45 minute wait.  AWESOME!!  Service started out slow ... but picked up.  We had various dishes ... skewers:  scallops, chicken, beef, shrimp.  Spicy crab, tempura shrimp, lobster, etc.  all very very good .  Small portions so you end up ordering three or four items each ... and spending $100 to get somewhat full"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and I would go back again.  The food has not been a disappointment. The Rock Shrimp Tempura and every roll I have had was very fresh.  The server was GREAT the first time.  Everything was prompt and he explained everything politely.  The second time our server was nice but was never there and barely spoke to us.  That is okay though...all the food runners were really cool...popping jokes."}
{"text":"As a celebration for my husbands 50th birthday dinner I thought this would be the perfect place. During our appetizer plate one of the waiters takes the plate before we're done, serves my husband his drink but forgets my wine. We the order a couple more plates and I swear I felt we were being rushed , they wanted to take our plates again as the forks were still in our mouths. Needless to say I never got my wine and I felt that for not being able to finish our dinner it was overpriced! I'll NEVER recommend any Nobu"}
{"text":"Food great. Service awesome. Experience exceptional.  Bill. Staggering.  But worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!  This is the best sushi I think I have had.  Very expensive but worth it as a treat to celebrate our 12-yr anniversary.  Cracked Basil Cocktail & Passionfruit Margaritas, Yellowtail Scallion roll, House roll, something amazing from off the menu, tuna nachos and baby tacos - Wagyu and lobster.  We could have skipped the tacos ---they forgot to put in the order and when the tacos arrived, the lobster was dry and relatively flavorless, thus the 4-star rating.  Overall, the service was wonderful.  We had such a great time!"}
{"text":"I had high expectation coming in and left feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  While I do think Nobu is a great sushi place to experience, it's a bit over hyped and is priced accordingly..  The place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  Our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  I ordered the Omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes: 1) Toro tartare with caviar - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous! 2) 4 different sashimi dishes - Japanese red snapper, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. I left Nobu with a very strong Ponzu aftertaste 3) Black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  The sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.   4) Tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - I really regret asking to have this well done.  Doh! 5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.  The waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  I found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  Nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  You see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  The predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local Cabarets.  Bottom line:  I'm glad I tried Nobu.  But, it'll be a long while before I come back especially when there are so many other options there in Vegas."}
{"text":"The new style sashimi with the whitefish which was halibut was amazing! Their Salmon sushi and Japanese Red Snapper was awesome! Overall it was a great dinner and nothing was disappointing."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a drink and apps. It was during the day, so the place wasn't crowded. Our server was friendly and attentive. The food and drinks were very good. It was a little pricey, but it's to be expected. It's really nice and clean. We had a lovely time with friends and would definitely return."}
{"text":"During our trip to Vegas, my husband and I ate dinner at Nobu for our anniversary.  Our expectations were high, and they were exceeded.  The food was out of this world!  Getting reservations at Nobu is always difficult, especially when you book last minute, like we typically do, but we were thrilled to snag a Saturday night reservation.    We loved: Yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno, Rock shrimp tempura, Artichoke salad, Shaved ice coconut dessert, Soft-shell crab roll We liked: Squid pasta, Black cod miso  I just found out that they are opening a new Nobu near us in Newport Beach and cannot wait until they open this Fall.  Nobu was fantastic and we will absolutely eat there again!"}
{"text":"the miso cod and snow crab cooked dishes are to die for .. as well grade a sushi perfection"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Nobu Hotel so we decided to try the famous Nobu restaurant, especially because Nobu Hotel guests get priority reservations. So glad we did. First, if you have the cash, I HIGHLY recommend allowing the server to select a series of dishes from the menu within your budget (not the Omakase pre-fixe menu, but similar concept). We had a series of cold & hot menu items, and everything was superb. Favorites were the Black Cod Miso, Yellowtail w/ Jalapeño, and Seared Duck Breast (off-menu item). We dined casually and enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Sure it's Nobu so it's got to be good. Right?  Food was good service was horrible, and when the bill came I thought I was gonna die.   We too had the experience of getting the bums rush kitchen is closing soon bs...then here's a tip. Don't seat us. Our meal for 3 people topped out at around 700. Without a LOT of drinking.   The server was so arrogant he condescendingly explained some dish to one of our Japanese guests. I just wanted to say dude, really?  Like maybe what the difference was between nigiri and sashimi. That blatant.   There used to be a really nice sushi bar across the way which closed down with this opening. It was much better.   I will never go here again."}
{"text":"One word:  Phenomenal  Spectacular dinner. We ordered the custom menu where the waiter and chefs select an omakase based on your requests and preferred price.   For ~$175pp, we had amazing sashimi, wagyu, lobster.  Fresh.  Perfect.  Classic Nobu preparations with excellent balance of citrus, heat, etc.  Everything we expected and more.   \"Best dish of the night\": an off-menu lobster \"pasta\" where the \"pasta\" was hearts of palm, served with a light(ish, given the composition) yuzu / buerre blanc.  Lobster was cooked perfectly, dish was amazing...  A couple of things we would have skipped:  - The Nobu signature shrimp... good, but heavy and not to our preference - Off-menu cherry dessert. Wonderful cherries (although prob too many), elegant sour cream ice cream, odd granola crumble (sesame seeds in the crumble seemed very out of place).   But overall, amazing. We'll be back."}
{"text":"!-!-!A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-!-!-! OK, so first off, I have never been a seafood fan, never mind sushi so this was my second time and it was AMAZING!!  Everything you've heard about Nobu is true!  I read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent Vegas trip. So we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  I ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  But I think the mango was the better of the two!   So, me being a newbie on the sushi scene I was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be GOOD!!! OMG, even bf, who isn't really down with tuna, was floored.  The tuna had scallions in the middle I believe....whatever it was delish!  And the sauce it had was SOOOO GOOD, I don't even know what it was, I should've asked.  OK, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree. Next, we ordered the soft shell crab roll was again a mystery.  Was a very welcome bite to my mouth, I don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  The crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it!  Also on our table was the shrimp tempura roll, I know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  Never mind that, this roll was a fave!  I also ordered another plate of this little roll because I loved it SO MUCH!  Again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  The amazingness of this is too good to put into words......I AGAIN don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but I honestly feel like going there again, like NOW.   So for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  It came out and looked like little donut holes!  Was so good!  They were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. Little bites of fried heaven!   As for service-stellar! She was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when I asked about rolls.  That's OK, I walked out very happy!"}
{"text":"We've only been to this Hard Rock Nobu, which apparently is not as popular as the Caesar's Palce location, but it's hard to believe it could be better. We've done the tasting menu with two different groups, two different price points. One came to about $200/person, but was too much food in the end. Last night we went back with our young adult kids and their friend. We paid about $150 person and had some truly extraordinary courses. I love their tasting menus because you can try so much and not everyone is going to love everything so in the end, it was heaven overall for our different eaters. Very attentive staff. Not squished in with too many tables as is so common on Vegas. Just perfect."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  The waiter was snobby.  There were four of us, and he wouldn't give 4 menus eventhough we asked for it.  He wanted us to order and share as a family style, but none of us like the same thing so we didn't do what he recommended; so, his attitude was snobby about it. The food is average, nothing is so special except the prices were way too much.  Not worth it. We would never go back."}
{"text":"Great sushi and sake!! A bit pricy.. but hey...."}
{"text":"This is my second time being back here in over two years. They no longer have my favorite blackened miso sea bass, but the other dishes are still great. We ordered a lot and licked everything off the plate! SO GOOD! This place never disappoints! We had their miso cod, chilean sea bass, eel and cucumber rolls, tempura shrimp, green tea ice cream and miso vanilla tart. DROOL! The service was really great, very attentive, went above and beyond my expectations. We ate here as a redemption dinner from the overpriced voodoo restaurant we ate at the night before. UGH! Voodoo was definitely garbage compared to this place. I'll definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"No matter which Nobu you go to they never disappoint! From cocktails to food everything was perfect! We didn't have to wait long to be seated for our reservation. The yellowtail with jalapeño is my favorite!!! Also we had some lobster with veggies that is melt in your mouth amazingness! For sure we will be back again!"}
{"text":"An experience you should try at least once!  Used the groupon to come here for the 5course tasting meal and it was well worth it!  The food was amazing and the portion size was just right. My favorite was the snapper sashimi and mixed sashimi platter. The dessert was the chef's choice which will always change. We got the Japanese donut balls which were to die for!  The service was very good too. We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"How can I put this...... it's simply fantastic.....wonderful food, excellent service, great location.  It's a \"must do\" when you come to Las Vegas . It was our second time here, both times we let the waiter order our food. Our dinner last night was out of this world! $500 later, including a bottle of wine, we had an unforgettable dinner!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 4.5+ restaurant.  Food and service is out standing.  Their Wagyu and sea urchin is so amazing, the best in the area.  If you want something more exotic,  they have a Chefs special not on the menu for 225 per person, well worth the experience.  The 0.5 was missing because of the desserts, unique enough to forget about the actual taste. Other than that it was perfect."}
{"text":"a few of us did the tasting menu and other's ordered ala carte, so we had many dishes to taste from. sashimi was really fresh, place is lively, service was ok.  one of the dishes we ordered was waygu beef, the beef came out and it was so chewy that it was as if you're eating chewing gum and that was their waygu beef???  the seabass we ordered came out over cooked and it wasn't the fatty part of the seabass so it wasn't as smooth as if should of been.  everything else was just ok, nothing we would say \"wow, this is as good as eating sushi in japan...\""}
{"text":"I saw the travel magazine to introduce this well known & highend restaurant. I'm so glad to come here with my husband & taste it. We order one Cheft's special 8 courses $125, & 1 Sashimi plate $64, & 2 glass of wines $30. The service here is good but the fresh raw fishes are not that fresh espically the Sashimi plate & the varity of the fish are nothing special, it's all standard & cheap stuffs.  Regarding the Cheft's special 8 courses which are nothing suprised me. Base on the price at least should have either sweet shrimp, raw oyster, uni or humbochi. I feel it's over value after spending almost $300 In here. I think this is the only one time stop restaurant. There are so many Japanese restaurants in US are not only food guality is fresher than here but also price. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"atmosphere - No Smoking.  Nobu is right next to the smoky casino, but they close their door and the lounge did not have smoking on our night.  Thank God, because many Vegas restaurants are infested with smoke from the nearby casino.  lots of bamboo.  Club music.  Loud, people having fun.  No toilet as people have mentioned.   service - excellent, our waiter (Jonathan) was fast and efficient, and the entire staff was fast and efficient.  He did not wait for the 'water boy' to get us water, for example, they all did everything.  One of the faster staffs I have seen in Vegas.  Food - Very good, not out of this world though.  Regular sushi was good, but not better than anything you get in California, NY, or Boston.  You really come here for the fusion \"sushi\", which was very good (but not out of this world).  Recommended.  Everybody should come here once.  And again, it is truly a nonsmoking restaurant."}
{"text":"I still could not forget the taste of their sashimi... Great food... good-looking waiters... what more can I say?"}
{"text":"They are unique because they listen to your preferences and then customize the menu for the meal. They have great yellowtail with different sauces. The sushi rolls are great. They serve fish in different styles and the eggs(masago) are delicious. Highly recommend the chef's fish special. The service is great and the music, lighting, and seating is very comfortable."}
{"text":"I thought Nobu was great. Sure, it isn't the new hot spot anymore, but the decor was nice and the food was excellent. I was happily surprised that the noise level inside the restaurant was kept to a minimum given the chaos outside the doors in the Hard Rock. i particularly loved the Miso Cod and the little shrimp things, I forget what they were called. On, and there was some tuna tartar (although they refused to call it tuna tartar) on spicy lotus chips that was excellent. We tried to go 3 years ago but our flight from SF was delayed, so it was a real treat to be able to go back (thanks Virgin America for getting us there on time)."}
{"text":"I have been to Nobu before, but this was my first time at the Caesar's location in Las Vegas.  We may have ordered too simply, because I expected more Wow factor in my food.  I ordered the black miso cod and it is justifiably the most popular signature dish.  I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size as well.  The fish and chips were actually sea bass and crunchy jalapeño strips.  I find sea bass too delicate to bread and fry.   That said, my nephew enjoyed it and it was done with a lovely dash of spice and lemon.  The disappointment came with the traditional sushi rolls.  Do not bother.  Flavors were not balanced and they were completely uninspired. My vegetarian sister had the roasted vegetable plate and it was lovely if exceedingly simple.  I am an Uni fan (sea urchin) and use it to assess the quality of the seafood in most sushi restaurants.  Their Uni was wonderful, delicate and creamy (and also $10 for one).  Sometimes simplicity is all the fresh ingredients need. All in all, I would go back for the cod, and maybe try a new dish to see if I could find another favorite.  Yes, it is pricey, but most of the restaurants in Vegas are.  The service was professional and sufficiently attentive."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.   The whole atmosphere is chic, modern and sophisticated. I was really excited to try another one of Matsuhisa's resturants and Nobu was a great choice for a romantic dinner with cocktails.  If you're looking for something energetic and lively, I would recommend getting reservations. I couldn't get a break in that they only had resrvations at 5:00 PM! go figure. I guess this place is the place to go right now.  However, if you sit by the bar, you'll get these wide spacious booths, very intimate lighting. Comfortable and good for conversation.    The food, if you've been to any of the other Nobu franchise is pretty much identical. If you're a fan of Uni, the tempura Uni was very fresh, prefectly battered but still sashimi inside! Genious!   The tobanyaki was also very tender and well marinated, flavored simply but nourishing. All the sushi was cut razor perfect, low grain. High quality of course.   Only downer was some of the wait staff seemed a bit spacy. Kept asking for water and additonal cocktails, and had to remind them a few times. ( Was not packed in the bar area ,,, soo... what gives?? )   Still a great evening. Good place to hit up if you don't mind throwing down some cash."}
{"text":"Expensive but very tasty. I always got to Nobu when in Vegas. Please note, this is inside the Hard Rock Casino. I have not been to the other one.   My favorites include the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi, Kobe beef on the hot rocks, and blue fin tuna. Service was prompt with quick drink refills and serving the different dishes at a nice pace."}
{"text":"Another wonderful iteration of Nobu. Having had this before at their Honolulu location I had high expectations for this Vegas experience. And I was not let down. Although Nobu is famous for their sushi I actually forwent having any and instead went for their superior and more unique hot and cold dishes. One constant stand out that I have had before is their blackened cod in butter lettuce cups. The varying textures and tastes are a perfect pairing. If you go you must ask for this as it is not on their menu. I also had the tempura fried rock shrimp in the creamy spicy sauce and again it was perfect, yummy, wow.   For dessert we had the mochi ice cream. And as you can read in my review of Bubbies in Honolulu it probably would've been just as good or better to have gone to Whole Foods afterwards and picked some up. Still is was very good but not Bubbies.  My only criticism is that this high style establishment is located in the Hard Rock. Kinda feels a little out of place but either way anytime I'm back in Vegas I will undoubtably be back."}
{"text":"Go with the chefs choices and you won't be disappointed.  I'm holding back one star not because the food isn't great, but I thought the value equation was a little bit off."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Nobu I have ever been to.  I've been to numerous Nobu's around the world.  My wife and I ordered the chefs tasting Omakase, and was very dissatisfied.  One of the plates brought out was miso soup and another a regular plate of tuna and salmon sushi- not even toro.  My bill was close to $500 btw.  Stay far away from this Nobu.  The quality and ambiance of this place doesn't deserve to be called a Nobu franchise restaurant.  There are 2 other Nobu's in Vegas that are better than this place I'm sure."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. The prices are high but it is located at the Hard Rock Hotel and not to mention the Nobu name which is like an insurance policy for your experience. Miso cod with butter lettuce is a dish that everyone should try. It is phenomenal! So many dishes to get, I try to stay away from rolls. Just stick with the specialty items, sashimi and nigiri sushi and you shall be alright. The sake is OK just be careful because alcohol could end up doubling your bill. Great food with a rock star ambiance. This place is very expensive, make sure you bring enough money."}
{"text":"We never even peeked at the menu, since this was our first time, Omakase ($125) was the best way to experience the varied menu. We told our server that we are adventurous diners, we love spicy and we preferred not to have uni since the husband isn't a fan - we left the rest to him. I had a fantastic sauvignon blanc with dinner and the husband really enjoyed the Sake selection. He sampled two excellent chilled varieties: black label and aged.    Our tasting included many of Nobu's signature dishes. We started with Yellowtail with jalapeno. This is a favorite of ours, it's a must whenever we go for sushi. It certainly did not disappoint. The next dish was Tasmanian Ocean Trout, it was rich and creamy. Very different from the delicate and refreshing yellowtail. The next course was Live Scallop with rocoto paste. It was beautifully presented and it tasted even better than it looked. The scallops melted like butter and the heat from the rocoto pepper awakened our taste buds. We enjoyed  chili so much, we were ready to book a trip to Peru.  Next, we sampled some hot dishes, beginning with the Black Cod Miso. This was delicious. The fish was buttery and the miso gave it the ideal amount of sweetness. I understand why it is one of their most popular dishes. Rock Shrimp with jalapeno followed. Now these were tasty morsels. Shrimp is so often overcooked, but not these. Perfection. And highly addictive. For the next course, the focus was on land rather than sea with the Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki. The scent of this dish was intoxicating. The beef was prepared very well and it was tasty. However, it was our least favorite.   We wrapped up dinner with a sample of Tuna and Salmon Sushi. Both rolls were simplistic, but incredibly yummy. The rice was beautifully seasoned, key for great sushi. Finally, we finished with a vanilla dessert and a variety of mochi. A lovely end to an exceptional meal.  If you can swing it, the Omakase is an awesome experience. Keeping it simple by choosing a few small plates would be totally worthwhile, too."}
{"text":"The food we got was good but didn't make up for the extremely pretentious wait staff who insisted we follow their process for ordering. They also recommended our group of 4 order 4-5 cold plates and 3-4 hot plates, easily a few hundred bucks. The portions were tiny and the sushi was nothing special at all. The most basic rolls you can imagine."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night without a reservation and were seated right away at the Sushi bar. We pretty much took all the recommendations from the waiter and we were not disappointed.  Everything was so flavorful and delicious. All portions are tapas style so plan to order a couple of things to share."}
{"text":"Nobu- all I can say is if you want the best sushi of your life, eat here."}
{"text":"Definitely is a five star Restaurant...I love the design and the architecture, since you walk the service is excellent. One of my favorites roll is the Lobster roll, Crunchy Shrimp, perfect amount of lobster and Shrimp; the Nobu Style tacos are so good too. It's a expensive restaurant but is worth it every penny you spend here."}
{"text":"So I don't eat sushi but I went for a batch party and the bride along with the other 10 girls I went with all eat sushi these girls had nothing but complaints about the food.  They said it is so over priced for the quality of food they also said they wouldn't go back next time they go to Vegas.  Since I don't eat sushi I was left with almost nothing to eat I could either get 2 tiny chicken squares or a $35 steak and that was not what I wanted right before heading out to the bars so I got the tiny chicken and edemame which was not filling but those were my choices."}
{"text":"I felt it was overpriced....there are by far better restaurants in LasVegas for the money. For 2 people, the chef's selection which is a taste of a bit of everything is $100 a person. We do not drink so I can only imagine how expensive it would have been if alcohol was included!!! Gotta try it tho"}
{"text":"My husband and I just visited, on a Saturday night. This restaurant has a great vibe. We did the tasting menu and everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The black cod was amazing and is a must get. Our second favorite was toro tuna. They also have a good selection of sake."}
{"text":"Sad Sad Sad ..... Made reservations for 10pm .... We arrived to the restaurant at 10:06pm. And was told our reservations were cancelled. We asked to speak to a manager. Patrick walks up and informs us that the chefs had put away all the food. I am just confused on how they couldn't accommodate a party of 3. This is sad. I will not be patronizing this establishment ever again. Shame on PATRICK!!!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 7pm on Sunday.. checked in early.. but. .unfortunately,  we had to wait even after our time. . As we are walked back to our two top ... there were 4 or 5 tables totally empty around us. . Yet we had to wait ? Only 1 of the tables filled while we were there,  so it couldn't have been from bookings. Guess they just didn't want to \"waste\" a 4 top on us.. a bit disappointing. ..   Aside from that,  good food and great service. . We went with the old school saki (warm) and a mixture of sashimi and sushi rolls.. couldn't believe that the people to our left were all on their cell phones,  as were the people on our right. . So sad that people don't know how to ENJOY a meal. . It's ok to NOT look at your phone for an hour. . It actually enhances your meal experience!  This was my second time at nobu. First time i sat at the sushi bar.  Was seated quickly as a single with no  reservations. . Yet.. with reservations And open tables. . We had to wait. .. would have given 5 stars if they had not made us wait when takes were open..."}
{"text":"Average but ridiculously  overpriced food. We are at Mizumi at Wynn the night before, which was an amazing experience, so we had high expectations. The food and service were average at best. We did the family style Omakase menu and was just not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of friends because we wanted to try out the tasting menu offered on groupon.  5 courses total including dessert.  My friend and I arrived earlier than everyone else and decided to have a couple of drinks at the bar. The bartenders were extremely friendly and had great suggestions of what drinks to order. Just the way they explained the ingredients in each drink made us want to try them all. Our favorite was the Cucumber martini (Finlandia Grapefruit Vodka, Fresh Cucumber Puree, Lychee Juice, Lemon Juice). The bartender also recommended the Spicy Acai Martini (Veev Acai Spirit, Acai, Passion Fruit Puree, Serrano Peppers). After making it for another customer he gave us some to sample and it was delicious. We will definitely be back for that drink  On to the food...  Yellowtail jalapeño: fresh yellowtail and just a slight but of heat from the jalapeño. Delicious.  edamame: pretty standard edamame. Nothing to write home about  Sushi: California roll, and 3 pieces of nigiri sushi. Good fish, but not a stand out course  Rock shrimp: battered shrimp in a creamy spicy sauce.   Miso black cod: favorite dish of the night. You really can't go wrong with black cod miso and Nobu has really nailed this dish. It was tasty and melted in your mouth.   Bentobox dessert: this included homemade green tea ice cream, flour less chocolate cake, and Suntory Cappucino (Chocolate crunch, coffee cream, whiskey foam and milk ice cream). The Suntory Cappucino stole the show. There were so many flavors that went together so well and weren't too sweet. I would order this again by itself  Overall, it was worth what we paid because we were able to try out so many different favorite dishes they offered. They offer the full menu at the bar just in case you want to stop in without reservations. Give the Spicy Acai Martini a shot!"}
{"text":"Only complaint is that San Francisco doesn't have a NOBU!  Great meal. We went with Chef Matsushisa's Omakase menu and gave the chef no limitations with food or money...so it ended up being a little pricer that we thought. None the less...AMAZING and worth every cent!  Staff was very knowledgeable with the sake selection.  Some favorites: Black Cod with Miso Live Scallop Sea Urchin Lobster Ceviche Toro with Spicy Miso and Caviar  Atmosphere is lively and loud."}
{"text":"I was very hopeful to have a blast at this place. I feel like I just tried another sushi place. Very disappointed with the taste and selection. Definitely not worth 200 per person. Sorry."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding!  It was pretty loud and hard to hear across the table. Service was very good - prompt, friendly and genuine. Plan on $100 per person."}
{"text":"I mean you really can't go wrong at Nobu especially prior to a night out in Las Vegas.. so would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're staying at Caesars Palace.   Crispy Rice with Tuna: Inventive presentation of a staple sushi bar item. The tuna was SO good I literally ate it without the rice...  Shrimp Tempura Roll: My go-to sushi order (super non-adventurous) but super good  The only downside was the edamame (nothing special), the 90+ minute wait but that was our own fault for not making a reservation on a Saturday night and the price, but hey its Vegas!"}
{"text":"When a restaurant has the nerve to charge exorbitant prices for food, I damn well better get THE BEST taste and THE BEST service in my entire life. You will not get either one at Nobu. I came here the other night treating an unemployed friend for dinner, WHAT A SHAM. I asked the sushi \"chef\" what is good that day and he recommended the king crab roll. We said ok and this little roll came out and the taste was simply ok. I was not impressed at all. I was actually quite annoyed. I ordered some Uni and monkfish liver. Now when I order monkfish liver at any other sushi spot, I either get 2 pieces of sushi or a few medallion sized sashimi. At Nobu, I got one medallion-sized piece on a gigantic plate that was covered in this peach sauce. I was becoming rather bored and none of this tiny shit was fulfilling my appetite. I asked the chef what he has that's unusual and off the menu. He said the yellowtail or white tuna, you know, cuz NO other sushi place has that! I told him something a little more unique and he just didn't know what to offer. Finally he said live octopus. I ordered it and it just kinda arrived in front of me. I imagined it would've been prepared in front of me or shown to me before cutting it.. anything. I have no idea where it came from or how it looked. It was drenched in some sort of clear vinegar-like sauce with green stuff and all I tasted was this crap all over it.  I got the bill and almost ran the hell out! It was $198. FOR THAT CRAP! We ordered 4 lychee martinis which were good, not worth $56 for 4 of them.  TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS for the crab roll! $25 for the octopuss! $15 for the uni. I payed in absolute anger and disgust, left a 20% tip and got the hell out of there.  Honestly, I am a harsh critic, I admit that. HOWEVER, I feel financially raped by this place and am losing sleep over it. The food was SO not worth it. Anyone who knows sushi really well wouldn't be caught in this lame over-priced trap. It should be illegal to serve crap sushi covered in taste bud-overdose sauce! I will never EVER go near Nobu again and will warn people waiting to not bother.  Here's a big middle finger to Nobu nationwide."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. The best things we had were the whiskey sampler & the miso fish that everyone orders. The presentation was also very weak. It looked like no love was put forth into the food. We opted to order from the menu rather than omakase because we had a show to attend afterwards. You usually have to allot 3 hours for one of those shindigs & we simply did not have the time. Good thing too because i can not imagine sitting there for 3 hours for mediocre food. Our server was ok. He came off as very pretentious though when he realized we weren't doing omakase. The hostesses were stuck up snobs that didnt acknowledge us when we arrived or left. After dropping $400 on dinner at a snooty place, we grabbed some burgers from whitecastle after our show. It was more satisfying than our whole experience at Nobu."}
{"text":"I LOVE NOBU!! Of course we spend more than $100 per person when dinning there (twice), but it was always a special occasion.  Will ALWAYS stop by when I'm in Vegas.  Wait staff was the best!   Orgasmic dishes: yellow tail with jalepeno, kobe beef \"sashimi style,\" and black cod.  Good Lord, I'm drooling!  Save money by getting tap water and not ordering edamame!!!!!!! haha!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats the Malibu location, the service wasn't that great. But the food was great!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. Food was fantastic. A little pricey but, again, it tastes wonderful. Try the fish collar!  Service was awful. Half of our sushi order and the vegetable tempura were not delivered. Our waiter said we should have revived it with the rest of our order. He apologized but it took 30 minutes for him to get to our table to see if we received everything. All we received was an empty apology."}
{"text":"I only had the sushi so I can't review the hot dishes, so here it goes. The Yellowtail with jalapeno and yuzu was by far the best and the big eye tuna and tempura shrimp were good as well, but not worth twice the price of a decent sushi place. I don't know what exactly I was expecting, but this definitely fell short.  Although the cucumber lychee martini was delicious. I would come back to try the hot dishes if someone else was picking up the tab, otherwise I think Pink Taco would probably be just as satisfying.  Oh and I really wasn't that impressed with the decor, why is bamboo so luxe?"}
{"text":"Our new favorite sushi place.  My bf and came for  Elton John's concert at the Cesar Palace for Valentine's weekend and had the best dinner here before the concert. A great calm and welcoming restaurant. Very good atmosphere. Excellent service...every dish was explained clearly and all the food looked and tasted great. Succulent!!"}
{"text":"this place was good when it first opened (like all the Nobu locations) but now they just skimp on fish and serve sushi that looks like a 5 year old made.... the rolls fall apart and they give you no fish... so you know what? I decided I would give them one more chance and try ordering sushi with little to no rice? instead I got more rice than fish... i thought it was a joke? I will never eat here again... the sushi is garbage and americanized."}
{"text":"Nobu has ruined me! How can I go back to mediocre sashimi after dining here? I wish I was a millionaire so I can eat here whenever I want.  Jonathan who is just delightful gave us the tasting menu. We ended up closing the menu and trusting what he ordered for us. At first I was a bit cautious since last time I did a tasting, I was still hungry at the 7th course! This one did not disappoint! We were stuffed by the end of the night!  We were very well looked after by Jonathan. I'm so glad I went with the cucumber martini. It was so good that I didn't bother trying any other cocktail and that says a lot! I usually try as many as I can handle. Loved loved loved the cucumber martini that I had 3. They used Belvedere. I hope it was certainly in there since after having 3, I wasn't even buzzed.   Each dish that came was an amazing surprise. OMG, everything was so so mouth watering amazingly out of this world good. I salivate as I type this.    It was awesome that every item that was served tasted as if it was caught on the day. It was so so fresh! Oh man, I want some NOW!  Out of all the dishes Jonathan ordered, it was hard to have any favorites. They were all excellent! I mean everything! So enjoy the pics that I posted. I will try not to lick my screen in the meantime.   Oh, at the end of the night, they will ask if you want dessert. I must've gone to the restroom at this time since we didn't get any. I would've still eaten it, LOL! Between the 4 of us, the bill came to around $700. It was SO dang worth it. I will continue to return here in every Vegas trip! YUM! One of my recommended must eat places!"}
{"text":"Omakase at Nobu might run you $150 pp with nigori sake.  If it weren't for the high-pitched cackling cohorts 5 tables away, I rather would have enjoyed the experience, but even those glass-shatteringly loud women aside, it gets a little noisy in here -- I had a hard time hearing the waitstaff describe each selection brought out to us.    I know this probably isn't the case, but from the looks of the floor that evening, the entire waitstaff was comprised of only smoky, built european men with bodies to accentuate black tight tees.  Interesting.    The decor is a play on nature, and I'm a big fan of the black stone encrusted wall."}
{"text":"Very great experience. Our waiter, Jonathan, crafted am entire meal for us because we were not sure what to order. Each choice was perfect. Delicious and unique menu! Great experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, not my cup of tea but my date loved it so I have to say it was an overall nice experience. It's hard to remember everything because we each ordered several selections. However, one thing that made an impression was shrimp skewers. I don't know what it's called but it came in two styles, something spicy and the other teriyaki. We had the spicy one. He raved about it and I didn't disagree. The creamy spicy crab was my least favorite. My boyfriend had a bite and enjoyed it though."}
{"text":"Wow , this place is amazing. The food was excellent. Jalapeño yellowtail , wagyu gyoza , sashimi platter premium , wagyu sashimi and black cod miso. Everything were delicious. Excellent service, and very knowledgeable . Overall 5 star , one of the best."}
{"text":"Great experience. A bit overpriced but very well prepared and presented food. Quite light overall and lots of attention to detail.   This was our first meal in Vegas and it did not disappoint. We couldn't get in until 10:30 but had some appetizers at Gordon Ramsay's next door (also delicious). We didn't really know what to get but the server was very helpful and made suggestions that we ended up going with.   As mentioned in many reviews, the yellowfin with jalapeño is very good. We also had a king crab ceviche, scallops on chips, and a salmon sashimi dish. One of my friends doesn't really like raw fish and she enjoyed many of the things she tried. In addition to these starters, we also shared a grilled beef dish as well as the signature cod dish. It was good but I wouldn't call it amazing... It has a nice sweet flavour but wasn't anything particularly special.   For dessert, we got the bento box which has a floury chocolate cake and ice cream on the side. Very good. For drinks, we got sake which is the perfect pairing with these delicate dishes. Wine would have been overpowering and the sake is a great palate cleanser.   I enjoyed my experience here but I don't think I could justify coming back. It was fun and nice to try a lot of things but it was a bit expensive given the portion sizes. I didn't come out hungry but for over $100 a person I think we could have done better. Definitely worth a try, though, as the food is very good and not your typical Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by Nobu in that the decor is aging and the food was good but definitely not worth the price. I eat sushi almost every day, and I could have paid 1/4 of the price for the same product. Combing that with the up selling from the waiter I was left completely unimpressed."}
{"text":"While Nobu highly promises a fine dining experience, I was quite shocked when a server pull the plate from under my jaw while I was still eating. I mean- as soon as I picked up the last bit from my plate, the sushi hadn't even reached my palette yet n the plate was gone from underneath my jaw.  It's customary for servers to ask before taking your plate away. This guy must have been in a hurry.. But boy! Never have I experienced something like that at even a diner, let alone a fine fine! Food was descent. This part just ruined the experience. Drinks were good otherwise. I expected a lot better from this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Nobu! It was nice to get away from all the steaks and heavier foods for a night.  Everything was so fresh and proof of good quality ingredients being used was obvious when we saw and tasted the food. Also, the portions were surprisingly generous as well!  We didn't have too much for dinner as we were stuffed from previous meals.   My mom started with their clear mushroom broth (I'm sure it has a much fancier name but that's essentially what it was). As plain as it seemed, she said it had a good balance of flavour in it and obviously did not have any hint of MSG in it. I started with the shrimp tempura. Nothing amazing, expensive for what two pieces but I guess eating at Nobu I shouldn't be surprised.  For our main course, we had to try the signature Miso Black Cod. I can't stress how beautiful a cut they serve. It was BEAUTIFUL. That cut alone wouldn't be cheap if you bought it to make it at home yourself. They cook it so beautifully that all the juices stay in the fish until you cut into it and put it in your mouth. The only thing I was a little sad about was because the cut is so thick, it should've been marinated longer so the entire fish would have been flavoured all the way through. No biggie. The top of the fish was amazing.   I suggest maybe getting a bowl of rice or having a few other small dishes with it because it's very rich if you try to eat it on its own and finish an order to yourself.  Definitely worth going to try. Beware slow service."}
{"text":"Awesome meal last night. Waiter Marcus did a wonderful job putting together selections for Karen and me. The Black cod was wonderful, rock Shrimp tempura bowl, and ceviche both fabulous!  She loved the matsu martinis (2)!!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and amazing service, it is a must visit every time we are in Vegas.  The wait staff is so knowledgeable and you never feel rushed or that you are asking too many questions.  As sake novices we asked a lot of questions and Benji our waiter, was a wealth of information and extremely attentive.  We don't mind the expense of the food since its prepared impeccably and oh so good."}
{"text":"Impressed by the decor but the food not so much.  I guess I a sushi snob.  I'm sure the one in NY is 10 times better.  I would hope so for their sake."}
{"text":"Awesome !!!! I'm a real Japanese. But the foods here are really awesome !!! Definitely you will not be disappointed here !! I believe so ! Come here when you have a chance to come to Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"Oh my god this place was loud.  It seemed like it was louder then the casino floor.  But the food was really good, we had the Prix fixed menu and it was excellent.  If it wasn't for being extremely loud I would have give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a friend's birthday. Horrible HORRIBLE customer service.  We daddy down recieved the drink menu all of us got water except 1ginger ale and 1 sprite.  Now instead of us all eating together most of us was waiting on other food.  The lobster and shrimp head 3 shrimp 2 pieces of lobster.  So covered in mushrooms and noodles. When asked my waitresses what type of veggies are in it she said VEGGIES!!!   THIS was a WASTE of money.  Then we asked for spilt checks and couldn't even get that so amongst ourselves we had to figure out the split which the bill didn't include sales tax.  Our waitress never checked in.  We end up missing other arrangements due to this LACK of customer service skills.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Best misoyaki butterfish I ever had!  The sake, which I cant remember the name was also great.  I don't know why I have less of an issue dropping some $$$ on high end Japanese food than high end Chinese food.  Hmmmm...."}
{"text":"Absolutely 5 stars from the wait staff to the incredible food don't miss out on this culinary experience I've never had so many bites of divine food we actually did the tasting plates of nobu's best dishes - what he's known for . The cocktails were incredible also . We sat in one of the basket type booths I loved the whole experience here !"}
{"text":"Another one of the best places to eat in Vegas The sashimi is so fresh and good The butter miso cod is my favorite dish The lychee martini's are a great drink I also love the softshell crap, and the rock shrimp temura The wagyu beef is like butter, and comes out on a stone to grill for you The dessert shaved ice is also one of my faves"}
{"text":"Good little Japanese place. The food is nothing more special than what you would get at other sushi places, but the variety of sushi choices is a little bit more than others. The noise level is high and the the tables are not far from one another so keep your conversations to a minimum unless you want to share them with the people sitting close to you."}
{"text":"Best dining experience ever!!!   Request Chris as your waiter.  We ordered our food and definitely played it safe.   He made some recommendations and we ended up leaving everything in his hands.   Hands down best food I have ever had in my life!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to just get right to it. Don't bother to order the fried snapper ($100) Save your money for sashimi. Good lord the shashimi was fresh and melt in your mouth. Also, I LOVED the fried salmon skin salad. The dressing was perfectly tart and the textures all worked well together. I loved it was all leafy green so I feel like I made a somewhat healthy choice. The fried snapper, the waiters favorite, was good but after a few bites it was just overwhelmingly greasy. My mom makes an Asian version but with sweet and sour sauce rather than miso based sauce. It would only be worth ordering if you had a party of 4 or more otherwise it's too greasy for two to share. The service was great but we were rubbing elbows with a couple on a date. It was a little awkward esp when I'm with mom haha!"}
{"text":"Black cod miso is a definite must try.   Tip: Try to get a table if possible, if you sit by the sushi counter by a lonely guy he will tell you stories about how he's dating some celebrity performing in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"NOBU, you made me eat my words. I'm a huge sushi fan especially AYCE. So i never saw much reason to go here when I know it's going to over a hundred dollars for just me because of how much there sushi is. COMPLETELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!! OH my God, I wish I would have done it sooner. Even if you do it just once, just once it would be a worth wild experience. The quality of fish is the best I have ever had, and the Wagyu beef was the knock out punch. I wouldn't have thought to have tried any meat in sushi place, but on the servers recommendation we did. Overall just a fabulous experience, from the time we walked in till we left. The people that work there are top notch! Not understanding the negative reviews, comments that there is nothing special, or reviews from \"prego's\" who shouldn't even be eating/reviewing a sushi place to begin with since they can't even eat anything that's not cooked??? Bottom line skip the ayce a couple times and get in there and give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We got the nobu signature where they keep bringing you different courses to try. I think it was about 7 courses in total and we got to try at least 20 different items that way. At $125 I thought that was a good deal considering the prices on the menu. There was a sushi sampler, sashimi sampler, tartare sampler, 2 mains, dessert and more. Service was excellent.  The drinks were good too. The seating was cozy but I did drop a point from them because overall the ambience and design doesn't match the high priced menu. Especially the bathroom! 4 dingy stalls that weren't even that clean for that huge restaurant ! I'm sorry but if you want to be a five star restaurant you absolutely have to have the bathroom to match. All that space- they could have devoted a little more square footage to that and they need to upkeep it more often. It wasn't even that busy the day we went for it to be in that condition so early in the evening. Also, they said they were fully booked but we decided to give it a shot and walk by- half the tables were empty. So if you were really hoping to eat here and they tell you they are booked, just show up anyways."}
{"text":"I never appreciated sushi before eating here-amazing selection and flavor. We had a huge group and tried many items-all high quality and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Tasting menu was unbelievable and very nicely served and explained. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Nobu is easily my favorite place to dine in Las Vegas.  I've been told their traditional sashimi and nigiri offerings are fresh and tasty, but I wouldn't know, because Nobu offers up so many unique South-American influenced Japanese dishes that I only order from their special items.  I recommend you do the same; you didn't come to Vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?  The star of the menu is the Broiled Black Cod with Miso.  When you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  Also great are Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, New Style Sashimi, and Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing.    My rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't Todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, I could go more often to feast on the delicious food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best japanese restaurant I have ever been to, in regards to the taste of the food. Their fish does not have any fishy smell or taste whatsoever, specifically I tried the hamachi, smoked salmon, and seabass, all raw except seabass, melts in your mouth. Wagyu steak from Australia was really tender and cooked to perfection, on a hot stone plate.  I dont know what else to say but if you like raw fish this is worth a try at least once"}
{"text":"Fantastic Japanese food and of course sushi. Restaurant looks classy, but modern. Fantastic service.  Obviously a little higher priced than other sushi places"}
{"text":"Nobu more than lived up to its amazing Michelin star reputation. The Omakase chef signature meal where you set a price and the chef selects the dishes was better than I thought possible. I don't even remember the names of all of the dishes and forgot to take pictures of all, but it was one of the more memorable meals I've had in quite a while. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"If you have ever been to the Nobu in NYC..SKIP this one!! But if you are looking for a halfway decent sushi bar with a 75$ rib-eye this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and the food was amazing! We have been to Vegas so many times and have eaten at so many restaurants that most places are just good but not terribly memorable.  We visited this place on a whim and were amazed by the service we received. We had a customized menu and our server picked out perfect courses for us! She asked if we had any allergies or food aversions and then went through and suggested food courses for us. The most memorable was the black cod that we got. We will be visiting again on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Great service from our waiter, wish I remembered her name. She made sure our food was exactly what we wanted. She even brought out club soda when a friend spilled food on his sports coat. She also took a group photo of us. Food was amazing!! I recommend the lamb chops! So goooooood!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  I actually went to Nobu in NYC probably 7 years ago and I remember it being very good, but didn't recall how very good it is.   My wife and I went to the Caesars Palace location before a show the other night. Even at 6pm it was filling up quickly, so if you want to go at a more typical Vegas dinner time, make a reservation several days ahead of time. Or do what my wife and I do often, sit at the bar.   We shared two cold dishes and one hot dish. The yellowtail with jalapeño, and the dry miso snapper for the cold dishes. Both extremely good. The servers do a great job of presenting each dish with instructions on how to best enjoy them. For example, for the yellowtail, the server who brought the dish said \"the chef recommends a little of the cilantro on each slice.\"  Take their advice for sure.   For the hot dish we had their signature miso black cod. Wow. So good!  I really like how the cooks take so much pride in the presentation, and the servers take the time to talk to you about the dish.   Cade, our bartender, provided great service and he is the one who recommended what we got. He is an excellent bartender.   Sometimes we have all been disappointed by a place that has so much hype. Not the case here.  Put this one on your bucket list.   **Update**  Went again last night (9/8/17).  We sat at the bar and Toshih was our bartender. He was awesome. Had the Red Snapper, Miso Cod, Alaskan Crab Tempura, and an off menu Yellowtail special roll that Toshih recommended. All were to die for. I just can't get over how good the dishes are at Nobu. Truly one of the best restaurants in America if not the world."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat in Vegas!  EVERYTHING I've eaten here has been amazing!!  I recommend doing the tasting menu and the teppanyaki tables!  DONT come here if your on a budget!  Both times I've been my bill has been over $500 and  I'm not ordering bottles of Dom!  But I'll keep paying that because it's seriously worth it!"}
{"text":"Night number two was NOBU located at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Our server was younger and unpolished. The menu was overwhelming with choices and pricey. The three of us agreed on what we wanted and away we went. Out of what we ordered there are two highlights, the yellow tail with jalapeno and the Kobe beef. Again, none of the rolls were spectacular; in fact we sent one back because it tasted too fishy. I didn't feel it was worth what I spent, and felt I have had better sushi in Colorado and Houston!  FIND PICTURES ON http://jenn-uncorked.com"}
{"text":"We had a groupon for a four course tasting menu. It was incredible from the sushi to the rock shrimp to black cod it is something that should not be missed. A true culinary experience."}
{"text":"Highly recommend having them pair a highly satiable course or their choice if you are not on a budget. Amazing service!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot when I am in Vegas!! The food is phenomenal.... The experience is even better!! It is pricy, but what isn't in Vegas... not to mention it is absolutely WORTH EVERY hundred dollar spent... hehe. The service was exceptional both times that I have been to Nobu. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ate here twice this past weekend.  Both times we sat at the bar but ate a full meal.  The bartender/server was Cade both visits.  He was awesome.  He knew SO much about each item we were ordering.  He gave lots of suggestions too.  He explained how and why each meal is brought out at certain times (all palate related).  The atmosphere, food and service was all outstanding.  I will be back.  Definitely my new favorite restaurant in LV!  Highly recommend the kelp salad and sea bass.  We ordered many dishes and they were all outstanding."}
{"text":"Extremely amazing wagyu here. Best Wagyu in Vegas. We also had the black cod, yellowtail, and rock shrimp. Everything was really tasty, fresh and great presentation as well as customer service. I'm definitely returning when I get back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was impeccable. We were in Vegas to celebrate a good friend's 40th and staying at Nobu Hotel (separate review; wonderful experience). This was convenient and a great change of pace from the rest of our Vegas trip. This dining experience was fantastic; it was like an oasis in chaos. We had a group of 7 (I think a really great size for this dining experience is 5-7) and did the multi course omakase with the chef's daily creation menu. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. One of our party has dietary restrictions and the waiter was great about understanding just what those limitations were so the party member didn't miss out on any part of the experience. The dishes that stood out the most: the seabass, the lobster, and the yellow tail tuna. OMGosh!  I strongly recommend letting your server and the chef handle selections. Anytime we diverted from the recommendations, it really wasn't as good (definitely not bad, but just not blown away good like the rest of it).  Everything was impeccable and bursting with flavor. So delicious!!!  The waiter kept all the drinks flowing, was super attentive, and we never had to wait long for the next course. I highly recommend checking out this place!  Just give yourself enough time to truly enjoy the experience.  This is the perfect dining oasis in the chaos that is Vegas."}
{"text":"I've had the chance to eat at Nobu Las Vegas several times over the past several years.   While the ambiance is nice, and the food is good (not amazing), the service is too attentive (they are like used car salespeople, always trying to upsell.  Some people just want tap water.), and the food isn't anywhere near worth what they are charging for it.    Better options for Sushi in Las Vegas are \"I Love Sushi\", \"The Ka\", \"Sushi Fever\", or - if you are looking for the Nobu atmosphere without the hype, try \"Sushi Roku\", which has an amazing view of the strip.  The wait staff at \"Sushi Roku\" at Caesars Palace is far more humble and focused on service than \"Nobu\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here over a year ago, and had an amazing experience here. The food was remarkable and the service was stellar. We were served by a gent at the bar (Toshi), who really put the cherry on the whole experience. So, recently my colleague and I were staying at the Mirage and I had to see if I could duplicate the amazing experience I had sometime ago. Not only it an amazing meal and fantastic whiskeys... but Toshi, our bartender, was there and still spectacular. We had the Chef's tasting menu... outstanding! I highly recommend sitting at the bar. Great ambience, people and memorable experience! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Super expensive but holy cow that's some delicious fish."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in LV and we dined at Nobu's.  I have always enjoyed the food here, but the waiter will try to trick you when ordering.  It is pretty pricey at Nobu's as is, so when the waiter is trying to play jedi mind tricks when your order...thats just not cool.  Hamachi w Jalepenos my personal fav!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best meal ever! We were a party of eight and had one of the low round tables off to the side own. Waiter was a little vague about what we would be getting if we ordered the chef selection but once the course got rolling we were all hooked. We even had a few people with us who thought they were anti sushi.. they left happy and full! Best parts... the salmon dish... and the lobster..  Let it be known.. it is pricey.. but the food is well worth every dollar!   Few things to note.. tall people do not fit at the low table well Bc there is no where to put your legs. I wish the waiter was a little friendlier... when you are staying there for 3 hours and eating the most expensive selection on the menu I would of liked the waiter to introduce himself."}
{"text":"This review is for the Groupon $99 tasting  dinner for two. The food was mediocre. The yellowtail, the rock shrimps, the cod and a small selection of sushi were OK. Not what I expect from a Nobu restaurant. We had to order other things because the portions were ridiculously small. We ended up paying about $70 more. For the price we paid, it's not worth it because we could of gone to any other \"no-name\" Japanese restaurants and got better food for less. The service however was great!"}
{"text":"Yummers! Thanks to Chris, our waiter, and their Cucumber Martinis it was one of the more delightful, delectable dinners of recent times.  I attended with a good friend of mine who has ALWAYS raved about their cucumber martinis.  Each time I would go out to eat with him at ANY restaurant he would ask for a cucumber martini in hopes of finding a place that could make one half as good as Nobu.  He kept failing at that mission.  I was made to try each time he got one and always ended up chasing the taste with a glass of Rieslings or whatever I was drinking at the time.  I am, by no means, a martini fan.  That was until I FINALLY had a cucumber martini at Nobu.  If a drink could be described as refreshing and light, this would be the one.  I had 3 that night and would've had more if I wasn't in 5\" heels and thought I'd break my ankle if my drunky self tripped.  My friend, smartly left the decision of choosing items up to our waiter, Chris, and am I thankful to Chris's knowledge of the menu and checking in with us on what was to our liking and not.  From what I remember of the evening we had:  Spicy Miso Lotus Chips with Big Eye Tuna-Delicious Black cod with miso in a lettuce wrap-Delightful Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño-Awesome California Roll-Too full to eat Some sort of mac & cheese dish with shrimp-Underwhelmed  Not only did I enjoy myself, my food, my company, and my waiter, but it was a great place for people watching.  My friend and I spent half the time chatting about topics pertaining to us and the other half commenting on the people we observed and conversations we overheard.  I will DEFININTELY come back to Nobu when in town or when in a city one is located in.  Viva la Nobu!"}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY HANDS DOWN ONE OF MY FAVE RESTAURANTS and BEST DINNER EVER!!!   The ambience is beautiful, the servers are polite and nice, and the service is impeccable.  For drinks had the cucumber margarita which was actually one of the healthiest things I've ever had (LOL). The drink has barely ANY alc but it is such a refreshing cucumber purée with a fresh lychee and cucumber slice. Definitely felt more like a relaxing drink at the spa!   For food had the yellowtail sashimi which had the best ponzu like (with I believe a sake reduction?) sauce and the most delicate jalapeño slides to add a little kick to the smoothness to the yellowtail. Then had the lobster ceviche which was to my surprise, lightly seasoned which I didn't mind. It comes out unlike traditional ceviche and comes out drier with seasoned lobster pieces and onions on top of lettuce wraps. Next had their famous black miso cod and OMG OMG OMG -- moment of silence for this because this dish, both in the way the fish is cooked (perfection) and seasoned is impeccable. The fish is SO tender and soft it literally melts with the miso sauce it is paired with. I can eat this all day everyday.   Next dish was their shrimp tempura which is lighter and more delicate than traditional tempura pieces which is deep fried to the max. Came with three sauces and loved the jalapeño crime. Then came the SCALLOP skewers (yes I get scallops at every place) and definitely one of the better scallops I've had because it was soft but sturdy enough to capture all the natural flavored and substance of the scallops. Finished off with a small salmon roll!  For dessert, ordered the Japanese hazelnut doughnuts which was more like a lightly fried dough bread with hazelnut spread inside and came with a raspberry sauce and ice cream. I liked but didn't love this because the dough was a little dry but enjoyed experiencing a different version of doughnuts!!  DEFINITELY coming back. Worth breaking the bank for!"}
{"text":"I visited Nobu in NYC over 15 years ago and it remains one of the top two or three restaurant experiences I've ever had. our table of four and the waiter were completely in sync. he noticed what we liked, made suggestions, worked with us on wine and it was a 2+ hour transcendental dining experience. my expectations were set very high for the Vegas location. unfortunately, I was a disappointed.  the food was exceptional (except for one dish, details to follow). I highly recommend the Yellowtalk with jalapeño, toro tartare, black cod in miso and the squid \"pasta\", which is not really pasta but a fantastic bowl full of grilled squid and fresh vegetables in an excellent broth. there was a special of tuna carpaccio with truffle and crumbled almonds that was out of this world. a gigantic miss was the monkfish pate which tasted way too fishy and had a sauce that was way too salty. we couldn't even eat half of it, but to the server's credit, she took it off the bill  now, the reason I can't rate this higher...  I have never been afraid to pay excessively high prices when the food, service, reputation and atmosphere dictate it. I have been dining at top restaurants around the world pretty much my entire adult life, including Vegas. here, there is a premium added to the the price of everything and it's expected and part of the experience. however, that's not an excuse for an atmosphere that isn't in line with the food quality and the price.  our waitress was nice and seemed knowledgable about the food, but anytime we asked for a recommendation, she automatically picked the most expensive item in that category. not once or twice, but every time. it was uncomfortably obvious. there was little conversation about what we liked or didn't like so far, she just wanted us to order the most expensive things on the menu. very off-putting. our table for two was very close to the kitchen door and on the outside row next to a corridor where drunk, loud people were passing by. at these prices, a little more attention to the ambiance surrounding each table would have been appreciated.  dinner for two, with one cocktail each and no dessert, was $280 before the tip. I wouldn't say we were stuffed, just comfortable. we could have easily eaten a few more dishes but didn't want to overdo it.   as mentioned, an expensive meal is totally okay with me, and the food here was divine, but the experience is just not worth it. there a so many great restaurants in Vegas, at all price levels so we have no reason to return to Nobu. I'm glad to have had the chance to eat here, but was very disappointed."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS BY FAR THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE IN VEGAS. EVER. ALL OF US HAD A HORRIBLE TIME because the waiter/server made it ALL BAD. POINT BLANK PERIOD.  Their biggest problem...  WAITERS/SERVER  But let's go through food first.  Don't order multiple dishes w YUZU sauce, YUZU.. anything. You're tummy will hurt.  1. Yellowtail sashimi with Jalapeno w YUZU sauce. It's WAYYY TOO SOUR. YUZU is sour, but I think they could have done something, so that sourness was tamed. NOT worth $28. You can get great yellowtail, elsewhere for cheaper. And the slices were so freakin' thin. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!  2. beef, pork... skewers. These were actually really great, especially the pork. Very tasty. it's $$$$ for the price, but if you're there to dine, try it.   3. Tasmanian Ocean Trout w Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu soy. Good, but again, it's very small portion for $28... more trout please. where was my trout? did we get any trout?   4. Tamago. THE WORST TOMAGO EVER. IT's like salty sweet egg floury cake. NOT TOMAGO. it's more like cake-textured. Tasted AWFUL! NOT WORTH $8. It looks pretty because they \"stamp\" NOBU on it. BUT you're there to dine w your tummy, too. Not just your eyes.   5. Beef Tenderloin - Toban-yaki. not worth $36. Tasted blah, and portion is def not $36.   and we ordered couple more dishes.. but I don't recall..  Here's the SERVER/WAITER issue: If you're restaurant is a FAB restaurant w dishes that are $$$$$, watier/server should not be SELLING YOU or PUSHING YOU to get dishes. Our server/waiter kept pushing us to get all these dishes rather than... recommending. He KEPT saying we should order duplicate dishes when our group wanted a taste of different dishes. He pushed us so much, we got way too many YUZU incorporated dishes... and it was SO TART, SO SOUR... it ruined our appetite. We spent almost 2.5 hours just saying NO...We were asked \"ARE YOU SURE?\" so many times.. I lost count. Had the service been a little better... we'd enjoyed our meal.  We went to Nobu because of all the hype surrounding it. But I was thoroughly disappointed. Will not be making another stop ever again. Thanks, but not thanks.   Too expensive, too little food, too blah, too pushy..."}
{"text":"Although pricey this place never disappoints. salmon fresh and delicious as was their edamame. Girl friend loved their spicy scallops. Service A+ our server forgot his name (looks like kapernick frm 9rs) was awesome. Thanks"}
{"text":"Went last Thursday with 3 girlfriends. It was the first time for them, first time for me at this location. We ordered a few tacos, the jalepeno yellowtail, 3 rolls, the chicken skewers, and miso soup. The yellowtail was melt in your mouth just like it was in La. The tacos were VERY small and felt deceived a bit that the waiter did not warn us.  The spicy tuna roll and lobster rolls were excellent. The house special roll was not that special. The chicken skewers were just ok. The atmosphere, service and drinks were excellent."}
{"text":"Thanks to Nobu, I can't truly enjoy Japanese cuisine in my hometown anymore. I've been ruined and awakened at the same time.  As advocated by our very knowledgeable and professional waiter, we had more of an experience than a meal. The usual inquires were made about our tastes and any allergies, then the rest was in the restaurant's hands. I'm glad they took the wheel, and they did not disappoint.  We were served several courses, each topping the next, and as time progressed my friends and I were looking at each other wondering when we were going to hit the finish line. Needless to say I was quite stuffed at the end and so was everyone else.  The highlights of the night were:  -The Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, with a nice salty, citrus, and spicy finish to it. I wish I had asked for a second plate of it. -Miso Cod: Dear Lord, I don't know how to explain it. If I ever get framed for murder and end up on death row, I'll chose this as my last meal. I can still taste that sweet and savory sauce with that flaked  fish meat. Even the skin of it was amazing. -Sushi Platter- Needs no explanation, the rice was at the perfect texture, the fish was oh-so fresh, and i didn't even need wasabi to add to it. I wanted to eat it in its pure form. Simply delightful.  The Mochi ice cream was a great finish, but I was too stuffed to try. My friends thoroughly enjoyed it though, and I trust their tastes. I finished my cocktail and had an espresso as a pick-me-up before starting my long night exploring the town.  Overall, I felt the food, service, and drinks were all on point. It was also moderately priced compared to the other restaurants we dined at, and given it's in Vegas, I don't expect anything to be cheap. We were content with our bill while being cognizant of the service and meal we received. I extremely look forward to eating here again when I return!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best restaurant I've ever dined at.  This was my first visit to this location.  The atmosphere is relaxing and the tables are not jammed in, so there is plenty of space for privacy.    The food at Nobu always manages to exceed my expectations.  I always order the tuna tartare, which was fantastic.  We also ordered the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno and it was mind blowing.  Melt in your mouth good!  They do a great job of combining flavors that go well together but that I would not necessarily expect.    Despite being a large restaurant, the service was wonderful.  Our waiter was well informed about the dishes (and drinks) and the people who brought out our food explained exactly what everything was and offered suggestions on how to best enjoy the food.  My favorite is that they brought me a black napkin so I would not get white fuzzies all over my black pants.  This restaurant is pricy, but it is worth every penny.  If you skip alcohol and some of the more expensive menu items, you can keep your bill reasonable.  But the food is so good you will want to try everything!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is 5 star. There is no question, this will be a great tasting meal.  The service left a lot to be desired. I'm not sure if it was because we sat in the bar area and didn't have a reservation, or what, but the service was shockingly mediocre for a $300+ meal. We asked our waitress if we had ordered enough food, and her response was that we could always just order more. We asked her for a recommendation, and she couldn't give us one. The experience that she outlined when we sat down was not the one we received. We were told they offered a custom menu and would provide us recommendations for tastes and textures that would complement each other and our palate. But as previously stated ... when we asked for a recommendation we got nothing. Service was also slow, and the staff let dirty plates stack up on the table.   Great food. Underwhelming service for fine dining."}
{"text":"Ate here a year ago but writing a review now... went with a small group and the sushi was decent. My problem was that I was the only who orderd the sushi and got food poisoning!  Well that ruined my whole night and weekend in Vegas just sitting in the room going to the bathroom every 30 min. Safe to say I wont be eating at Nobu again. Went the next morning to let them know and they said \"are you sure it was here.\""}
{"text":"We came here with an online deal for a pre fixed menu. It had multiple courses including sushi and steak. It seemed mediocre and I was not impressed by the quality of the fish and overall dishes. The steak that came out in the end was too salty and had too much teriyaki sauce. But I guess, Nobu seems to be a fusion restaurant.   Other than food, the service was excellent and attentive."}

{"text":"The only decent place inside HR.  A forewarning though it's pricey. The tab runs high and quick, but it's Vegas and everything on the strip is a splurge. The sashimi plate was delicious! Fresh , fresh , fresh. The robata grill also offers bite sized appetizer and kabobs. The atmosphere is designed to look tranquil and down to earth - this is not a let's get drunk and rowdy type of place. But I'm sure they wouldn't mind a sake bomb or two. Good place for a date."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in THE WORLD.....  Yellowtail sashimi with cilantro, jalapeño and ponzu sauce is amazing.  Service is excellent..."}
{"text":"Nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good Japanese food.  A few quick notes about how to eat there.  1, I've heard the omikase is excellent. It's a safe way to try a nice selection of things. 2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. In general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. I have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when I go, I make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and I've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service. 3, the black cod with miso, and hamachi with jalapeno and ponzu are  musts on the menu. I also recommend the squid pasta, rock shrimp tempura, sashimi salad, and spicy tuna rolls.  The spicy tuna roll there is the best version I've ever had.  The black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish I've ever consumed. 4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. I actually sat next to Wayne Brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and Tiffany Amber Thiessen was there a different night. I can't say the same nice things about her that I mentioned about Wayne Brady.  All in all, a great meal.  And get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty."}
{"text":"I have eaten some fine meals in restaurants all over the world, but the whole experience I had at Nobu (Las Vegas) on Saturday night was the best of all time.   Arnold, our server, was not only attentive and kind, but his finite knowledge of the foods and sake (the region where it is made, the milling of the rice used, etc) was unparalleled and it elevated the experience of Nobu even that much more. He is simply stellar.   We had three each of cold and hot plates, two bottles of sake, the famed black cod miso, and the Kobe beef (flambéed at table).   And, since it was my birthday, a very special dessert with a gracious wish from Nobu.    Sincerely and without question, this was the ABSOLUTE BEST meal experience I have EVER had."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere without being too stuffy. Fahzhad (sp?) our waiter was excellent in helping us decide what we wanted to mix and match throughout the seating. Sashimi, all 3 kinds we had, were all excellent!!"}
{"text":"First of all, please choose the right Nobu restaurant.  You should be going to Nobu in Hard Rock hotel.   If your pocket book is a little tight this is not the place I would recommend you to go.   Cold Dishes:  Special: Toro (don't remember what he listed as the garnishes, but it is shown on my pics.  I think this dish was just a little salty. Once, you add all the dressing on top, I like to taste the fish, since it is fresh.) Kelp Salad 13 (this tasted so fresh, added just a little lemon on top of it.  Also, helped w/cleaning the palette for the next course)  Sea Urchin 16 (this is from Santa Barbara, CA which is normally where every Japanese restaurant from the west coast gets there uni from.  Hmmm..this just tasted like any uni I would have gotten at another bay area restaurant probably no more than 12.00.  Oh well, I do love my uni.   Hot Dishes:  Black Cod Miso 37  (this was cooked well and the miso glaze on top was just right)   Geez I forget the server's name, but he was really great!  Knowledgeable about his fish and the menu.  Very upscale and modern experience.  This is the 2nd Nobu location I have been to, first was in Hong Kong.  If you like fresh fish w/a twist of fresh ingredients, you just have to come here and experience the taste.  But don't come here if you are looking for affordable specialty sushi rolls, this is not that type of place.  This was the first time my friend had gone to this restaurant, she said it was the best Japanese restaurant she has ever been to.  I was so pleased to have taken her there 1st.  Hope they do open up in San Francisco soon!"}
{"text":"sushi, fish and meat were good, nothing spectacular, except for the prices, kinda wannabe high class for the hard rock party people scene, but some high rollers might dig that scene,  I didn't really think it was that great for bomb sushi!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by Nobu. $330 for dinner and we left hungry. And the service was incredibly slow. At least 30- minutes between courses.  The best part of the meal was the black cod. The sushi was just ok. We get better sushi in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Been loving Nobu forever & honestly, the Nobu Hotel is the best on the strip.  (Refer to my Nobu Hotel review)   Jono, our server & managers behind the bar... fantastic!  They are why I updated my four star Toban-Yaki experience to five.  Two totally different experiences.    Start w/ a large hot sake cause I promise many of these dishes are complimented by it.    In order of the BEST most consistently delish Nobu MUST:  TIRADITO SEA URCHIN:  Best in Las Vegas.  Creamy melt in your mouth fresh served on top of a thinly sliced cucumber.  Taste bud organism.  KING CRAB LEG W/ AMAZU PONZU:  Very lite tempura, doesn't overpower the beautiful succulent crab.  Perfectly cooked & plated so make sure to mix the whole dish up before devouring so you get the whole experience.  I usually get it w/ no red onion, just my preference when I'm not sharing.   BLACK COD MISO:  Melt in your mouth like butter.  It's flaky like seabass & complimented by the sweetness of the miso glaze. The signature glow stick looking garnish is a tasty radish so try it.  AHI TUNA MISO CHIPS:  A burst of flavors!  The ahi is so red & juicy it's like it was just caught & to pair it w/ a chip, wow!  Order it every time now.    YELLOWTAIL JALAPENO:  Lite fresh, thinly sliced & beautiful.   The Artichoke Salad, Seafood Soup, Kelp Salad & Octopus Sunomono are all nice starters or sides.  The Dry Miso Spinach Salad is an acquired taste, but it's good.    Rock Shrimp is filling so I never order that since their are so many other dishes & the SoftShell Crab on Watermelon is seasonal.    You can't go wrong w/ the sashimi ever & the fresh water eel is devine.    After my Toban experience, I never get anything from the grilled section & always ask for their signature dish cause the one at HR has a beautiful Yellowtail Red Snapper in Coconut milk baked & then fried.  I like that each one has a special that's off the menu.  The one at Caesars didn't really appeal to me."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had. Our waiter was super helpful in walking us through the menu and everything he suggested was delicious- the tiradito was a particular standout. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Open late for dinner! Yay!  Lemme start off with saying that I *did* like my food. But I am really getting sick of this fusion \"new sashimi\" crap. I know a lot of people like it. But a sashimi purist such as myself follows the, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" regime. However, new sashimi I tried and it was far from bad. I think it was a seared tuna something in ponzu sauce. I'm going to round up on my stars because it did force me to step outside my box and try something new.   Oysters were quite steep. $15 for three kumomoto oysters. My date didn't think that was steep at all; but them Manhattan boys don't love the dollar oyster nights that we love in the Bay Area.  Impressive, but expensive sake list. I didn't partake. And I wouldn't unless date wanted some too. Again, the prices didn't raise his eyebrows. My story about the bottomless sake at Coach in Oakland very much raised his eyebrows.  Food was as expensive as I would expect considering it was a sushi place in Vegas. But, hey, not like I paid, right? A conversation comparing sushi experiences in California to New York was certainly the most priceless part of the experience."}
{"text":"This has to be my new favorite restaurant. When you walk in you are greeted by everyone (they say something in Japanese that I couldn't exactly make out... probably saying welcome?) Was a bit caught off guard but I thought it was cute. My server which unfortunately I forget the name of was beyond perfect. Not only was he gorgeous ( ha! ) but he was knowledgeable but when I told him that I was a vegetarian he stood there and came up with options off the top of his head and was very tentative to us! His first recommendation was of a  soy sauce, cilantro, jalapeño, citrus tofu skin dish... literally my new favorite meal. The way the flavors burst in your mouth and dance on your tongue? Anyway the waiter was tall, with like light coloured eyes, with salt and pepper coloured hair  (if you're reading this at all, give this man a raise!) He is the best waiter I have ever encountered in my life. The whole ambiance of the restaurant is perfect! Very clean.  Everyone is tentative and kind! At the end I was informed that there is a Nobu in Manhattan too??? They will be seeing my face soon! Thank you Hard Rock Nobu!"}
{"text":"Peruvian and Japanese fusion is a fascinating one for me.  We came here with a big group of about 12-14 people and were told that the recommended way to dine was to have the waiter take down our preferences and then curate a menu with the chef based on those preferences and what we hoped to spend per person.  We ended up settling on about $120 per person, which got us about 8 dishes and a big platter of sushi.  I am glad that we did it that way, because I got to try a few different things.   Before I go into whether the dishes we tried were good, I must preface this with saying that after browsing Yelp - I really wanted to try one particular dish.  I really wanted to try the black cod with miso because of the way people rave about it in the reviews. Well, here am I to rave it about it some more.  If you come here and just try one dish, the black cod with miso has to be the one. It is the most tender, delicious fish I have ever eaten at a restaurant and has ruined me forever for these types of dishes at any other japanese place.  Also, an overall note about this place is that because of the peruvian influence, the dishes are a lot more citrusy than what you would get at a typical japanese place.   Here are some of the other dishes we got:   - Shishito Peppers: these were to start. Shishito peppers are shishito peppers and these were done well. Nothing particularly special about shishito peppers to me though.  - Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno: Not bad, good quality sashimi, like many of the rest of the dishes, more citrusy than typical japanese food. Some in my party were not fans of the citrus flavor, but I really liked it.  - Snapper with Dry Miso Crumbles, Garlic Chips, Yuzu: I was a big fan of the garlic chips and the fish combination for this one. I would recommend this one over the yellowtail sashimi if you're choosing a sashimi dish because of the unique flavors. - Rock tempura shrimp: This dish was not very special - it's basically fried shrimp. If you're coming to Nobu, I would recommend getting other things.   A few of the other dishes were also sashimi type dishes, all with a citrus flavor.  We also got a few beef dishes (one with truffles and one topped with fried onions), which were both quite good.  Finally, they gave us an assortment of sushi (and we also got the toro nigiri on our own). The sushi was pretty good but not super notable."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Nobu portion of Caesars, which was so nice! Definitely my new favorite place to stay in Vegas. The restaurant equally matched the hotel in what you'd expect. Quality. Phenomenal Service. Chic Ambiance."}
{"text":"We have been to multiple locations of Nobu and have been royal fans of chef Nobu and his restaurant; we even went to his very first restaurant in Beverly Hills. Food and drink menu are pretty much the same as other locations. Food was good as usual. Unfortunately, our server ruined our experience here. She was not very attentive and thoughtful and didn't come to us often enough for working at a high end restaurant and for the money we spent here. All the bus boys and the servers who brought our dishes were great though! We ended up giving them a big tips rather than our own server because she was not on the Nobu standard.   For the food and the service we received from the bus boys, I will give this location a 3 star review."}
{"text":"So obviously if you are going here you know what to expect. We had a great experience. Our server was one of the ones who went to open Dubai, so we were well taken care of. He did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15P) and kitchen closing (11P), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. So we were prepared. Of course, if you are spending Nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. But that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list.   I have been to Nobu Next Door in NYC, so this was a different experience.  Onto the food; We jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced for sashimi. We ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the Nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off).   From there we also had the Yellowtail with Jalapeno, as always. Then we had the lobster ceviche, and a couple lobster tacos as well. Both good and the lobster was great.  Make sure you get the Black Cod with Miso in lettuce. Awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.  If you haven't been, go!"}
{"text":"Nobu at Caesar's Palace is ok.  The cooked dishes are all really good.  You can't go wrong with the Miso Cod or the Black Bean Sea Bass.  The lobster is any preparation style is quite tasty.  And it's nice because the Nobu chefs take out all of the hard work of actually getting the delicious meat out of the lobster shell for you.  You just pluck and gobble.  The only thing that I thought was really NOT good was the fried uni.  Yuck.  The sushi and sashimi is just so-so.  The servings are really chintzy.  Slices of the fish are so thin that you can see through them.  The toro is very sinewy and veiny.  Not melt-in-your-mouth awesomeness.    But the part about Nobu that I really can't stand is the pretentious attitude of the wait staff.  We were greeted with, \"Have you ever dined at Nobu before?\"  When we replied in the affirmative, we were further pushed with: \"Really?  This one?  Here in Las Vegas?\"  Like, come on, really?  Why all the faux snobbery?    You need to watch the upsell though, at Nobu.  They are notorious for it.  You order one thing, and the waiter will tell you, \"If you like THAT, then we've got THIS thing that's NOT on the menu--and you're gonna love it.\"  What they fail to tell you is that the new thing that they're trying to hawk to you as at least double the price of what you originally had planned on ordering.  HAPPENS EVERY TIME."}
{"text":"Been here 2 Times. dissapointed.  I ve Been to tao Dubai & losangeles & Compared to them.   Skip this One & go to TAO"}
{"text":"Lawd. This was worth every penny. The precision, thought and care that goes in to these dishes is pretty amazing. Came here for a date night and had an amazing time.   Note - portions arent huge, so you might have to order a couple of dishes. But thats great because you get to try different things  (sushi is excellent there) and you leave feeling completely satisfied but not full at all.   Dark, quiet ambiance adds to the overall tone of the evening."}
{"text":"For the love of God (if such a thing existed): Eat. Here.  Don't go here for just sushi or tempura, which are all excellent. Go here for the chef's creations.  A meal here at least once a year is in my prenuptial.  If you cannot afford to eat here, seriously consider a loan. Seriously."}
{"text":"Went there again and had the kobe on the hot rocks and this Y2K sake... yep, that's the way to go!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nobu Vegas two or three times, all were fantastic. In each case we had great staff that helped us pick dishes or simply brought what they recommended and the results were off the charts good. These guys have a huge menu and a ton of stuff to offer that isn't printed on the menu, I really think the best way to do Nobu is turning it over to your server to make recommendations. My crew is pretty adventurous eaters although there are limits, that lets us try just about anything. If you are more conservative about seafood and sushi I think it will be hard to get much out of Nobu.  And yes, it is crazy expensive. Crazy. There are lots more affordable meals in Vegas and probably at the Hard Rock itself. There are lots of better price performers in Vegas.   Nobu is great and it is expensive. But isn't total excess exactly what you are looking for and why you are reading this review for your trip to Vegas? If it isn't, there are lots of alternatives."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine here. Great food, great service, great ambience. This was my third time, and each visit has been consistent in all aspects of the experience from food quality to service.   I came here this time with my family whom hadn't had a Nobu experience before, so we decided on the signature Omakase as way to try the 'greatest hits.'  It was superb. The sequencing of the food, the pacing of the food, the care of preparation and presentation... Spot on.  The signature Omakase is a very 'safe' choice to dine... it's composed of classic and popular raw and cooked dishes... nothing too exotic, but perfectly prepared. I personally prefer the chef's daily and specialty Omakase as it tends to be a bit more adventurous... but nothing I've had is very far out tbh... just delicious and consistent.   Great as always."}
{"text":"Turned away at 10pm. Hostess said they were closed. Not professional. They seem to be a bit snooty. Too bad. Could have run up a big check."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Las Vegas. Heck, we love it so much we got married here! We go at least once a year, and generally stay 3-4 days. Our routine has always been to dine at our longtime favorites (Craftsteak, Mon Ami, Mesa, etc) and to also try a new place or two. Nobu has always been on my \"to try\" list, so I made sure to call a few weeks ahead of our trip to make a reservation. I am so glad that I did! Nobu is probably the best Asian centered dining experience I have ever had. The food matches the visually stunning dining room in both presentation and taste. Our server was incredibly helpful, going to great lengths to make sure our orders matched our dining tastes and expectations. I especially enjoyed the black cod miso, rock shrimp tempura, and scallops in spicy garlic sauce. I am pregnant, so I did not get to experience their world famous sushi, but my husband and dining companions assured me that it did not disappoint.   For the reviewers who complain about Nobu not being a good value, or that they left hungry...Nobu is not the type of restaurant you go to for value. It is meant to be a culinary experience. You should only go if you can easily afford it. We spent about $175 per person on our meal, and left with zero regrets. We will be going back to Nobu for another great dining experience first chance we get!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with Nobu. We dined at their Hard Rock location with 4 people last night and our expectations were not met. It's not that the quality is bad, but for the money you spend you simply expect more.  For starters we had the new style salmon sashimi and the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi. Both were very good. However, the rolls we ordered afterwards left a lot to be desired.   The ambience could also be a lot better. The design reminded me more of a Japanese ramen kitchen."}
{"text":"let me say  I m a big nobu fan. we visited nobu in london, dubai, LA... this nobu just opened. we called around 4pm to make reservation for 7;30-8;00 they told us they are booked out :-( i was so disappointed so after a while the girl on the phone found a table for 6. so we were a lit bit stressed but ok.when we arrived the restaurant was not busy at all. regarding it is pretty big maybe 8-10??? tables were occupied. so i felt like ok why is this restaurant booked out??????????  hosts very nice & cute girls service was nice, attentive & ok nothing special what i didnt like was that our server tried to convince us to take the 7 course i think tasting menue for 190$. first of all if a restaurant has so many single items why should i pick a preselected menu??? i dont get it...   anyway we ordered some sushi & maki rolls. all very good. but not wowed me for that price 10-15$ i think per roll...sushi ws yummy but overpriced they charge per piece!  we ordered the trout it was excellent 28$ our fav dish for that night by far!!!!!!!  we had miso soup7$,  edamame 7$ & shrimp tempura both ok not wow  tempura lil bit soggy for my taste not crunchy enough and again way overpriced 28 $ i think i dont know any more   dessert bento boxes i had this dish in every nobu but never was so disspointed. the cake was too molten not really baked well. the green tea ice cream sooooooo ridic tiny it fitted on a tiny table spoon. are u kidding me for 15$?????? the 2 blueberries ,1 rasberry just a single joke. we ordered cocktails kumquat something 16$ was good we finished around 8;15 with our food & guess what still not packed & overbooked so i have no clue why the girl on the phoe sold us that restaurant as soooo OMG busy on a sunday!!!! night  anyway the bill for 2 was so ridic high that we will not go back. sorry but its vegas   there are so many great restaurants why should i spend $$$ here????   u should overthink it."}
{"text":"If someone told me I only had one more place to eat at... Id choose this place. If you go ask for Chris! He was phenomenal and helped us get the best dishes. We did the \"Nobu experience\" and I couldn't pick which one was my favorite because they were all so amazing."}
{"text":"Nobu was a delicious dinner that was well worth the price!  For the first course I ordered the miso soup which was a pleasant surprise; it was very flavorful and tasty compared the the salt water flavored miso i've had in the past.  Next I had the black cod which is their best selling dish and it was so good! Must try if it's your first time at Nobu, the Nobu style fish and chips were very good and had a light lemon flavor which really went well with the sauce.   Last of all I had the sushi which is the only reason this review isn't 5*s, It was bland and really nothing special which I disappointed about. The California roll's snow crab was flavorless and the roll tasted mostly of cucumber. The yellow tail scallion roll had a similar issue except the scallion was all you could taste, I was expecting more from a place like Nobu and was really underwhelmed."}
{"text":"OMG absolutely the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas. Took my dad there last night and it was absolutely fabulous. Not your everyday sushi bar. It's the place you go to on special occasion.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here New Years Eve to celebrate!  The service was outstanding! more attentive than NOBU in Japan which I had a pleasure of experiencing on a work trip last month. Thank you (??? ??? ?????) so much Adrienne. The Ambiance is great, dim lighting lighting makes for a very romantic evening for diners. You might get louder or more obnoxious dining group sitting perhaps close by which can negatively impact the atmosphere, but no way to really control that and after all we are in VEGAS! We could not decide what we wanted to eat and decided to just set a budget per person and let the server bring us whatever her wonderful self thought would wow us.(Adrienne DID AMAZING!!!)  1. Edamame / Shishito Peppers: I rarely eat shishito peppers but these were fantastic! not hot ( guess I got lucky since I can't deal with HOT ) and a little sweet with the sauce. Edamame? its Edamame.......  2. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño and Cilantro The Cilantro on with each piece was interesting but complimented the flavors greatly. I really enjoyed this and would order this again next time.  3.Live Scallop: Thinly sliced scallop served in the tiradito-style with peruvian flavors of cilantro, spice and Japanese fusion elements. The abductor is also thinly sliced on the plate, giving contrasting flavor and texture. Although good I enjoyed the Yellowtail more than this dish. On a side note... Did someone spill the Yuzu on this dish? little overwhelming....  4. Black Cod Miso in Lettuce Butter Cups: This was one of my favorite dishes of the night ( Dessert got the number one spot sorry). This is a must eat dish and I will return to experience this one again! mmm my mouth is watering for this one right now. I would suggest to tone down the sugar.  5. Kurobuta Pork Belly Skewers and Chicken wings:  The pork was also one of my favorite things the whole night but at that time I haven't had any dessert yet. Amazing Kurobuta Pork Belly that was braised to absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfection, although a little fatty, but people tend to enjoy the fat so I can't complain.   6. Toro Blue Fin and Salmon which was actually two dishes. I really enjoyed the Toro more than the salmon maybe due to the fact I dislike salmon in raw form. I believe both of these dishes were so so, I rather eat the fish plain. Although to give it justice each piece had amazing flavor with different textures from the fish, capers,wasabi and garlic chips.  7: King Crab with brown sugar? and cherry tomatoes and shiso leaf:  Truthfully I would not order this dish If I were to come back due to the fact I can go to many Vegas buffets and devour crab legs for hours. This was nothing to write home about.   8. Sushi Platter with California Roll, Uni that was so fresh I could eat it everyday, Yakitori Unagi, And Salmon. Everything was great except the rice... this was a let down... it was hard and dry. I am surprised at the sushi chef for making nigiri with this rice.  9. Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki: This dish was great but after eating a ton of wagyu in Japan your palette gets you and you end up craving that melt in your mouth amazingness you just don't have with any other type of beef. Maybe just stick with the Uni! haha......  10. Beef Carpaccio: What can I say? this is as good as it gets people! eat it! enjoy it! Although if you are looking for good Beef Carpaccio District One on Spring Mountain and Jones has some killer Carpaccio.  11. Fried Rock Shrimp something something something: Well it was shrimp... it was very well presented and came to the table in a rock pot still sizzling. Lets just go to Hot N' Juicy Crawfish.   12. Assortment of Desserts:   The desserts just kept coming, honestly this was what I came here for and If it wasn't for my brother and friend I would of just ordered every single dessert item on the menu and that would of been it. 4 courses of desserts after all the entrees had finished. The highlights included a cucumber shaved ice to die for with Yuzu syrup which they pour on the ice at your table with fresh berries, young coconut and cantaloupe sorbet did I mention it had STAR FRUIT ON TOP!!! I haven't had starfruit since I was a child living in Hawaii. Second was a Special New Years Eve only Sizzle in your mouth palette zapping of amazingness dessert it was Fuji Apple and champagne semifreddo (what word was that?) with apple cake crumble with POP ROCKS, yes I fucking said that right!!!! It had pop rocks in the cake crumble what dessert have you ever had with pop rocks plain genius! that's not it! It also had freeze dried kiwi and pineapples with dulce glaze finished with champagne foam and apple chips. They really should keep that one on the menu. Third was Pear Toban w/ gingerbread stout cake w/ poached pears in orange syrup w/ toasted cinnamon ice cream and candied black walnuts, this one was a warm \"homey\" dessert but not the highlight it was presented very well on a clay looking pot wit"}
{"text":"Walking up my GF was in denial so in my own amusement, I had to say \"No-BOO\" this is All for You!!...ha  Not much else can be said that hasn't been said about this reputable restaurant. Obviously, you feel an energy walking in considering the surrounding of people winning and losing but the ambiance inside is alluring. This is not a casual Vegas strip mall restaurant and people dining in want to see and be seen.  Our waiter greeted us including a boisterous welcome from the Chefs. We ordered the specialty dishes; Yellowtail Jalapeno, White Fish Sashimi, Rock Shrimp, and Tuna Crispy Rice (Yum and Delish)!!  We sat at the bar and enjoyed admiring the chefs feverishly preparing dishes and asking lots of questions. Service was first class and quality of the food is undeniable.  Concluding this note, I'm salivating for sushi"}
{"text":"Our waiter was exceptional and they were so helpful with my dietary restrictions. The shaved ice desert with acai was my favorite. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally got to experience Nobu and it was just an OK experience. The Peruvian-Japanese fusion of food that came out to our table was delicious but it didn't give me the wow factor. The service was really attentive but really and I mean really slowed down towards the end. Our waiter had attention to detail down. The dim lighting was adequate, but there was something about this place that was intimidating. Yes the tables and the space just didn't make sense, everyone is to close to each other! I mean they charge an arm and a leg for the food but they can't provide space and a little more privacy. I fell for the hype. This is why I can't give Nobu the badass seal of approval. Moneywise for Peruvian Japanese fusion look elsewhere, you won't be disappointed. Will I be back to retry the experience? Eh Maybe."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good service was bad, I left hungry. Money could be well spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was in town for my daughter's 21st birthday celebration. I have eaten at Nobu at the Hard Rock hotel in San Diego and it was amazing. I'm from So Cal, so logically, I want to eat at one of my favorite places when I'm visiting in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the experience in Vegas was completely different then SD. My friend and I went down to the sushi bar around 10:00 pm to eat some fresh rolls and my favorite, rock dynamite shrimp. I was amazed that everything came out in less the 5 mins. Afterwards, I felt like I was chewing on sand. My stomach started to hurt and I felt violently ill. My friend ended up with the same symptoms. I called Nobu to tell them about what happened and our \"ill\" experience and no one ever called me back or even acknowledged the issue. I would not recommend this restaurant or location when you are visiting in Vegas.   An update to this review... My friend spent three days in the Desert Springs Hospital due to food poisoning. I tried calling the manager George Lypton as well as going into the restaurant to update him on my friend's condition. I was supposed to be on a plane and return to Cali, instead I had to extend my stay resulting in more hotel fees and airfare loss. I received a very unsympathetic voicemail that George turned the incident over to his insurance. He doesn't know my friend's name, her number, etc. she was taken by ambulance via a 911 call and he couldn't even follow up on her health or mine? DO NOT eat at NOBU unless you want to be hospitalized!"}
{"text":"We didn't eat a full-on meal there, just some snacks really before the night out -- so I might revise this later. The quality of the food was really high. However, there were not enough servers. I think I would have gotten faster service from the Pony Express. And all we wanted were some sake bombs. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and I I expected a WOW but just didn't get it. I ordered hamachi sashimi and 2 rolls and the rolls were tiny for the  cost. The hamachi was great but the rolls were just OK."}
{"text":"One of by best friends from LA was raving about NOBU in Hollywood so we found ourselves at the Hard Rock and decided to drop by and have dinner.  The hostesses are friendly, and the servers have great knowledge of the menu items and offer great recommendations.  We decided to order the Lobster and Shrimp Salad, Seared Kobe Beef platter, and the Salmon Caviar.  All great dishes (see my photos), but portion size is small so if you like to eat alot...this is not the place for you!!!  Your better off at an all you can eat sushi place!  All in all this is a special place to celebrate a special moment with friends or a significant person!  Overall, a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night with my buddy's bachelor party group. Since we had a suite at Nobu, they seated us right away. Although it was expensive, the sushi was delicious and plentiful. The house saki was also very good.  I would highly recommend this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Chef Nobu is a master and his food exemplified that. Or server customized our order based off of his expertise of the menu and with what we told him our likes/dislikes were.  Portion sizes are smaller and price is high however, the quality food is out of this world.  Definitely worth trying at least once!"}
{"text":"I reserve 5 stars for the best of the best. Those who really go the extra mile with every detail in food preparation and service. Nubu sets the 5 star standard for me.  Just going to list what we had and all are amazing.  Jalapeño yellowtail sashimi  Monk fish pate A5 wagu steak. Just get the minimum amount you can order because it's super rich.  Lobster tempura  King crab Black cod miso Get reservations a week in advance. If you are one or two you can probably squeeze in the bar without a problem.   Not cheap, but you should already know.  Our bill with drinks for 5 was $1,450 with tip."}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner here last week, and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  Our waitress was awesome - she was great at guiding us to the best dishes with the best balance. We ended up ordering everything ala carte, although there are lots of options of how you can order or price your meal.   We ordered the Blue Fin Toro Tartar and the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno from the cold dish menu - all were nicely seasoned and accompanied by various things.  We also had the Salmon New Style Sashimi, which I loved - it was probably one of my favorite dishes.  The Hamachi Kama from the Brick Oven Dishes section was the best that I've had - even their ponzu with their daikon was great.  From the same section we also tried the Baby Vegetables for our veggie intake, and I loved the grilled flavor that the veggies had.  From the Nobu Hot Dishes section, we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and Akadashi Soup.  Another one of my favorite dishes was the Pork Belly Miso skewer from the Kushiyaki menu - the flavors and texture were well done!  Overall all the dishes were very well seasoned and well cooked.    All four in my party were very happy with our meal, and we were already talking about returning to Nobu on our next trip to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Every part of our experience with Nobu was amazing. The atmosphere and the staff, that seemed actually happy to be at work, set a perfect stage for the real star, the food. Victoria F. was our waitress and I have to say, she gave of some of the best recommendations I have ever had. She was smart, fast, personable, and honest. Try this place out and definitely request Victoria if she is working."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Second time here and both times gave me nothing to complain about.  Food is absolutely impeccable. My favorite dishes include the wagyu gyoza, the toro tartar and the prime filet with teriyaki sauce. Flavors are truly a cut above most fine dining menus.  Service could not have been better. Arnold was my server last night and he had superb knowledge of the menu and every item I questioned.  This spot is a new regular stop on my Vegas trips."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and it's more of a 'fusion' style. I feel their 'strength' is the use of different sauce to add more flavor to the food but sometimes it becomes too overwhelming that you don't get the chance to appreciate the freshness and texture of the raw material itself. It's an OK place for date or small group hangouts, but I wouldn't come back just for the food itself."}
{"text":"This was really enjoyable beginning to end. The service was great. Our server took our likes and dislikes and brought us amazing dishes every time. I'm sure everything here will be good. The Sake was truly served hot, some places it's warm not hot, and was good. Overall good experience. Will eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a go every night kind of place for the regular joe... And I felt like the server treated us in a way that made us feel like we didn't belong. That was one of my only downsides, a pretty big one though.  The ambience was like a fancy bar meets sushi. They say they're a Peruvian and Japanese fusion. I had the black cod miso which is supposedly the signature dish. It was good and you can definitely taste the freshness. My party ordered a sushi dinner and few other rolls. Right when you bite into the rolls, the nori itself tastes different than just your standard nori. Food was no doubt good, although I wouldn't say it was to die for either.   I think if I didn't feel like a second class guest, I would've enjoyed the food more, but overall, I would probably give this place another go, but not unless it was for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Last night if you ordered the $150 omakase menu they donated $50 to the people in Japan. Great food for a good cause. The restaurant was packed (on a Tuesday night) and the service was perfect. Totally attentive and choreographed without being annoying. My husband and I split the $150 omakase for two and ordered two other specials to go along with it and it was a feast. Our favorites were the yellowtail special, the lobster (split and restuffed with panko and chili), and the monkfish liver with caviar. But it was all good. Amazing ingredients, beautiful to look at, and nothing that we could ever come close to making for ourselves at home."}
{"text":"I am not a fish eater by any means and Nobu has turned me into a fish lover! Of course this is the only place I will eat it but everything is amazing and so mouth watering. My mouth is salivating as I write this. We have been here several times and have ate and drank our way through the menu and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Place is nice.  Popped in for a few drinks, very pricey. Spent $30 on 3 drinks that did not have enough alcohol in it.  Sushi was great!"}
{"text":"BUT WAY overpriced for what it was..........WAY overpriced.  $300 for two people and we had one drink, I think?  She might have had two.  Food and service excellent but for that price I have had some exquisite meals..........and this one wouldn't reach that category.  I know it's fairly new and famous but really?  $300+??  And that wasn't for the most expensive meal.  Prix fixed menu pricing at different levels and some ala carte pricing.  So you CAN spend more.  Menu includes everything from soup to appetizer to dessert, along with main course obviously.  Desert fantastic.  Our chef was a bore compared to one at table next to us.  He was nice but NOT entertaining as he should have been.  He did answer questions as to recommendations and explained food choices.    Located in Ceasars and the newer Nobu hotel.  I say try it once IF you can afford it and want a japanese Teppanaki style dinner but I will NOT be back for a second experience at this price.

{"text":"I have to admit, I love Nobu so I may be a bit biased! Ate here twice on last visit to Vegas and great as usual. I try to flyways sit at the bar and service is always too notch. Gotta start with the Yellowtail sashimi w/jalapeño appetizer! If you want more than the basics, ask for the secret or chef's menu - that's where the really good stuff is! Just do it!!"}
{"text":"NOBU!!!  WOW!!!  Let me start by saying I am NOT a sushi eater.  Gross!  Well, my friend and my husband went to Nobu at the Hard Rock in LV.  It was the most unbelievable experience ever!  We had the A5 or something like that.  They brought out at least 9 courses including dessert.  Our waitress was Adrian and I think when the food is spectacular and service goes above n beyond it just makes the whole experience that much better.  My favorite fish I think was yellowtail.  All of the raw fish there that I was served was very thin and delicate.  Nothing I ate was fishy or slimy.  I even had the uni.  If you're a sushi rookie then Nobu is the place to start.  Keep in mind too, you get what you pay for.  This is not a cheap restaurant.  Be ready to drop some money.  The manager Kenny who was on duty last night even came over to see what I thought of their restaurant.  I live very close to the Malibu location and cannot wait to check it out!!!  This is my new fav restaurant!!  Don't forget to try the Wagyu Beef.... It just melts in your mouth and the texture is like cashmere, weird huh??  Trust me.... You'll have no regrets!!!  To the staff at Nobu LV:  thank you everyone for the excellent service and I'll definitely be coming back every time we are in town.  Ask for Adrian to be your server!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is super good, try the sushi, skewers and the steak. Good wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Came in for my friends birthday last Saturday night and our server Jonathan was awesome. He helped us pick out everything from drinks to starters to dessert. And everything was sooooo good! The yellowtail sashimi and the blackend cod was awesome!! This place is perfect for special occasions. But you need to expect to spend at least 100$/person, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Can we say PRETENTIOUS?   First impression: reservation was confirmed via OpenTable, but somehow the hostess said that our reservation was not there. She looked around (the restaurant was about 10% filled) and hesitated, then said something along the lines of \"I suppose we can seat you anyway\"  Waiter: talked out of his ass. SERIOUSLY. This guy had no idea what he was saying!!! He tried to sound extremely educated in food once I told him I was a huge fan of Nobu and that I had all his cookbooks and loved them all. When describing the lobster risotto, he said \"and the way the chef prepares the risotto with the wakame and the seaweed....\" HI. wakame IS seaweed. \"the mirugai and the giant clam we call geoduck...\" HI. can you be any more redundant? Don't try to play fancy foreign word games with me like I have no clue what you're saying. I flashed my best smile everytime he came to word vomit. He had good intentions, but it was borderline offensive that he tried to add in japanese words as if we didn't know what they meant.  PROs: the staff is very attentive, very quick to remove finished plates so that the next course can be served. We never had to ask for a refill of water because of how attentive the wait staff was. The food was good, albiet pretentious... (I would never ever pay $30 for five paper-thin slices of hamachi with little slivers of jalapeno and overly acidic ponzu again), The menu was innovative, modern, and divided into clear categories to help you order a little bit of every category. The wait staff is very helpful with describing dishes, recommending dishes, and answering questions you have about the menu.  CONs: again, extremely frou frou Japnese food. The price is not reflective of the quality of food. $40 for a tiny amount of risotto served in a fancy big plate that looks like a bowl... PLEASE. The black cod was not fresh-- it seemed like the miso was attemting to cover up the slightly old taste of the black cod... The ceviche hurt my masseters. I probably made the ugliest little puckerface from the acid in the ceviche $35 tiny bowl of ceviche. I'm fine with paying good money for good food, but honestly, Nobu was a let down. If it's tiny portions, at least make them SPECTACULAR tiny portions. Spectacular it was not.  We left hungry, and went for a real dinner afterwards. Sorry, Nobu. Maybe we'll try another one of your restaurants, but definitely not Las Vegas."}
{"text":"GREAT meal! All of the sushi was excellent and the seabass with miso is a must have!"}
{"text":"First an foremost, save your money.  This place, carefully orchestrates how to take as much money out of your wallet in the shortest amount of time.  Even the simplest items are so overpriced, that I walked away feeling taken advantage of. While the food is good, it is not great.  Plating is pretty, but food is sparse.  Here is where I went wrong. No menu ordering.  The waiter gave us the option to set our price point per meal and he would pick the courses.  Feeling adventuresome and wanting to be cool I said yes, opting for middle of the line $100-$125 per person pricing.  Yes you read that right.  The first course shows up in 2 minutes and 3 minutes later the next course shows up.  I ask the waiter to slow down and he acknowledged my request.  Yet in 5 minutes, another course shows up.  It would not all fit on our table.  The barracuda was just ok (who serves barracuda?).  Finally the 5th course shows up.  It was a Cod piece on butter lettuce.  It was fishy and just not good.  I sent it back, and when the waitress asked why she laughed.  I looked at my better half and we could not believe that she did that.  She did tell our waiter who fairly promptly came over to inquire.  I explained our dissatisfaction and his response was \"some people feel it does tastes fishy, but it is fish\". I pondered talking to the manager but felt it better to discuss it with our waiter.  He did apologize and told us he was absolutely going to take the dish off the bill.  Should not have had to ask, but he needed to  to be much more proactive, considering each course was about $50.  I am glad we took the approach we did because he was a nice guy who really just forgot how much money we were spending.  And we were spending an average amount in this place.  Total bill for 2, which included a couple of glasses of wine each was $345 plus tip.  Ouchy, even in Vegas."}
{"text":"The deco was nice, the service was good, the food was ok. We had the 7 courses tasting menu.  The waiter did help me selected a wonderful beer to go with my dishes,   With the prices on the menu, I might have expected too much. The black cod was as good as its reputation. But others are ok, but not great. However with the coupon discount it was fine, a good deal."}
{"text":"This is a very trendy dining option for Japanese food. It is pricey, as all trendy restaurants with famous chefs are...but it is worth a visit simply because of Nobu himself.  The menu options are plentiful, but the food is served tapas style, with small plates and not much on them. However, the food is flavorful and always fresh.  Make sure to ask the server for the more popular items. You honestly cannot go wrong with any of them. The sake is also good and worth  the few extra dollars on your bill.   Don't expect to be full though when you walk out of the restaurant...unless you spend a jackpot sized amount. This is a great place to start your meal...but if it's the only thing you eat all night, you may find yourself a bit tipsy if your next stop is a local club!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was excellent.  The reason the place doesn't get 5 or even 4 stars is the service was NOT on the up and up.    I went with 5 other guys celebrating a friend's last days as a bachelor.  When we arrived we were told by our waiter that \"we don't have printed menus, but tell me what types of things you like and I'll customize the menu for you\".   Odd...  This should have raised a red flag right there.    \"Well, obviously we'd like some sushi.  That's why we're here.\" \"Any non-sushi eaters?\" A couple of guys raise their hands... \"Yeah, bring out a chicken dish or something else non-seafood.\" \"Okay, I'll get you guys started.\"  The waiter started bringing out food one platter at a time.  Lobster Tail salad...  Kobe Beef Carpacio (something like that)...  Some kind of tasty dumplings...  3 complete fillet mignon dinners...  and after a break...  2 HUGE platters of sushi!!   When all was said and done, we had been brought enough food for probably 10-12 very hungry people!  Our \"customized\" menu for 6 people consisted of 5 large platters of food PLUS 3 complete steak dinners.  When we questioned our waiter, his response was \"Well that's what you said you wanted.\"  We certainly did NOT want enough food for 12 people.  By the time the sushi came out, we were all stuffed... and this was a group of 6 guys that can really eat.  Of course, we were charged for all of this excessive food that ended up going to waste.  The bill was $1200...  $200 bucks a head.  I don't think I would have had a problem paying $200 for dinner, it was the fact that I had to pay for all this extra food that was unnecessary that bothered me.  To add insult to injury, as we were leaving the restaurant, a table was being seated right in front of us... all the diners had menus in hand."}
{"text":"Consistently spectacular.   One of the best restaurants in the country.   Best just to have your server design the menu for your party.   Little more expensive, but you shouldn't come here if you're looking for a cheap meal.  This is a true culinary experience."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular. Every single dish was amazing. I came here for a late dinner with my colleagues and we opted for the Omakase Nobu Signature menu because the waiter mentioned that our group would probably easily spend $125 per person anyway if we ordered a la carte.   The omakase menu is basically a tasting menu. I forget how many different dishes it consists of but it was a good amount to get us all full. My favorites that stood out the most was the black cod miso, shishito peppers, and the hamachi in yuzu sauce. Those three would have to be my top favorites out of the course but every single dish was amazing and there was no complaints whatsoever.  The only thing that would've probably made the experience better was if the food came out at a more timely manner. In the beginning, the food came out everytime we finished a plate and then there was a wait time of maybe 20-30 minutes until the next dish. Then it came out back to back for 2 dishes and we waited another 20 minutes for the last one. Because we didn't know how many courses were being served, we kept assuming that was it and nothing else was coming out. I think the wait time would have been okay if the server checked up on us and updating us on the status to let us know what we do have more dishes coming out and just explaining more of what the dishes were.  Would've been a 5 stars for me if the service was up to par with the quality of the food. Normally I don't like to eat at restaurants in Hotels, but Nobu did not disappoint. I highly recommend! It is pricey so I'd suggest going if you just won some money at the casino or to celebrate a special occasion. It's a real treat."}
{"text":"First time diner @ Nobu: Came in a week ago with a friend without a reservation. The host was very nice and explained our options for the time we were there. We chose to sit at the Sushi Bar....MISTAKE.   The bartender (male) was obviously very busy and they appeared to be short staffed. It wasn't until midway through the meal did the manager or superior start to assist with the bar crowd. The bartender was very abrupt with us regarding our questions about specials or menu items. We were very specific in our order and he did not right it down. It then came out wrong and the bartender processed to argue that we had not ordered what we received. This created an awkward feel so we ate, paid the check and went to another restaurant for the rest of dinner.   The restaurant is beautiful and the staff seemed nice, but this was certainly not the experience we expected for the price point $$$$$. With all of the options Vegas has to offer, I will likely not return. -NPR"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best experiences that I've had at a restaurant. Our server recommended a few things and went over every dish in full detail. He was very informative about the history of the restaurant to the types of food that pairs well with drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food.  Food was average; it didn't wow us. $$$$ pricing as such one would expect it to be more impressive. We went for teppan and had mixed sushi for appetizer. Toro was $22/pc.; expensive and it's no better than what Benihana serves. A la carte grill we had like crab legs, wagyu, shrimp, scallop, lamb, foie gras were all decent. Again, just the food cost us about $250+/person, so I was hoping at least one item would wow me but none.   -2 stars for our server.  I wish I could remember his name. That night he served our teppan table and another party sitting next to us. Water glasses and tea cups went empty a few times and had to ask for refill, but this didn't bother me as much as the fact that each refill took 10 minutes to happen (not to mention the server sent busboy to assist us). I saw our server attended the other table frequently, pouring sake (which we ordered a large bottle as well), refilling their tea/water,  and checking on them on the food. Perhaps the server didn't find us fun enough to be around, but we did enjoy our chef and we tipped him well after cooking for us. The server only came by when we asked for the bill and spoke to us FINALLY when he thought we didn't give any gratuity. Honestly, I really didn't think he deserves a penny. The tips we left were for the busboys who served us the entire night.  The food we had at other Nobu's such as Malibu didn't wow us either, but we had a great server and made us feel welcomed. Our dining experience here did not meet any expectation, and I hope it was an isolated incident. But overall the food does not worth $$$$ and with such pricing, there are plentiful options elsewhere in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been to Nobu in Los Angeles and I found this Las Vegas place to be just a pretense of a restaurant. All show, no substance. I don't mind paying money to get good food. I do, however, resent being exploited with a celebrity chef name and being served simply bad food. Servers are nice, manager was apologetic and sincere. However, there are too many other legitimately good restaurants to give this another try."}
{"text":"Clearly a sad experience.  I expect nothing but perfection from the Nobizzle.  And I would be willing to accept 4 star performance from his executive chefs.  But my V'day date was simply flat on all fronts  The sushi was OK at best.   The appetizers were flat.    The dessert was probably the best thing/  After dropping over $300 dollars I was seriously disappointed.    If you are a casual sushi eater, or a collector of brag tags then Nobu is for you.  If you are looking for flawless execution and Sushi raised to a new level save your money, you'd get better sushi at Bachanal"}
{"text":"Ohforgodssake - cut the crap!  It's small, it's too freakin' loud, the tables are too close together, and I'd like to punch the all-too-cool waiters in the head!    Don't even get me started on the host who shouts \"welcome\" in Japanese whenever he walks someone to their table.   OK, now I feel better.  Proceed to the review:  We were told that we could only sit at our table for an hour (WTF?) and could not order the chef's tasting menu, which was basically the only thing we wanted to get , mostly because the menu was so large and complicated it made us all tired and confused to read it!  The server told us she would bring us several dishes, but not the full tasting menu.  Well, several courses, 4 beers and 2 bottles of wine later, I guess we had spent enough money to keep the table since it was waaaayyyyy past our allotted hour.   The food was pretty incredible - kumamoto oysters with caviar, wonderful fresh sashimi, tempura, rock shrimp with some type of amazing sauce.  I think my favorite dish was also the most pretentious - duck that was cooked over hot river stones and then finished off at the table with a splash of courvoseour that was then set aflame!  $750 for four and we were still hungry enough to stop off int he VIP reception area of the Bellagio on the way back and polish off the desserts they had laid out."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few sushi restaurants including Nobu at Hard Rock.  The quality of the fish was good.  I noticed a little variation in the uni though.  All the basic sushi like yellowtail, albacore, salmon and tuna were good including the the amberjack, Mackeral and sweet shrimp.  The one thing I really noticed is the lack of skill in the sushi chefs.  Their hands were clumsy, slow and awkward.  I'm surprised that such a name like Nobu showcases such subpar culinary skill.  For half the price, I can go to sushi roku and have a fabulous meal with skilled culinary masters."}
{"text":"Best meal I have ever had period. They made our 10 year anniversary special everything they brought out was better than the next. The black cod miso was to die for.Thanks for such a special dinner. Chris was awesome thanks again for making an already special night even better..."}
{"text":"The Best Ahi and Yellow Tail!"}
{"text":"They avoid giving you the menu, try to sell you as much as they can. Extremely over priced! The food wasn't that great to begin with. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to the Nobu Miami Beach, Nobu at Atlantis (Bahamas) and the multiple Nobus in NYC countless times. I have to admit, I held out on the Nobu Vegas because it was in the Hard Rock...silly, I know.  Nobu is so fabulously consistent, I love it. Our order:  -Lychee martini -Sake -Wagyu dumplings -Edamame -Salmon sashimi -Yellowtail jalepeno roll -Miso black cod (FAVORITE) -Rock shrimp (Second Fav) -Lamb chops (BEST BITE, exclusive to the Vegas location, and wow are they good) -Dessert: mochi ice cream and chocolate cake  The restaurant was busy for a random Tuesday night but service was very good. I really liked our waiter. He recommended the lamb chops and I'm glad he did. All the food was delicious.   Yes, as other Yelpers mention, Nobu is pricey (for 2 of us our bill was just under $350) but the food, service and ambiance were great.  Definitely coming back soon xo"}
{"text":"I will have to say after visiting quite a few sushi places in las vegas i left Nobu underwhelmed. The food was good the decor was ok..my opinion is for the price there is just as good and better in las vegas beyond the hype.."}
{"text":"Ever eat at Nobu?  First time 2 nights ago...... no need wasbi and soy sauce.  Missed pics of a couple other dishes..... Got carried away diving into some awesome dishes. Imagine frying a bag of baby spinach drain nicely add a perfectly cooked snapper... crispy skin,  medium rare inside.  And how about some crispy miso and a light sauce.  Great dinner!  Excellent service!  Missed his name,  but you can't miss him....ponytail, beard, tattoos...stands out amongst all the other servers.  This guy gave us a description of each sashimi on the 14 piece chefs selection.  He made great suggestions.  You can tell he's been there for awhile.  That's a valuable employee.  Hostess booth needs an attitude overhaul! Lead person's attitude carried over to her underlings.  If first impressions are everything management needs to fix this immediately!  Never underestimate the long term affect this may have on the business. I expect a smile from someone at the hostess desk when I give my business to a higher end restaurant.  After all this isn't McDonald's."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi with a modern twist but still retains authentic Japanese art of creating sushi.  Umami can be experienced here!  Foodgasm :()"}
{"text":"Don't go if you're pregnant.  75% of items are starred with an asterisk, which means it came with a warning about eating raw and undercooked food (even the hot dishes.)"}
{"text":"Beautiful interiors. Decent service -- I appreciated our waiter helping us decide on which plates to order and realistic serving sizes. Good quality food.   But ultimately for the price I would rather eat somewhere else that has a better \"foodie experience\" (by that I just mean food that is truly unique to the location). I feel like I have had similar quality/tasting meals in California for less cost.   Everything in the photos were a perfect amount to share between two people (Vegas date night!)."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying if you are a fan of sushi/sashimi Nobu is an absolute no go. We ordered the Premium Sashimi Dinner, 2x Uni, Miso Soup, Edamame, Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalapeno, Pork Belly Skewers, Rock Shrimp Tempura and Vegetable Tempura. ALL OF IT WAS UNDERWHELMING.   They brought out the Miso Soup that was lukewarm and tasted like it came from a packet. The Edamame tasted like it was previously frozen. The Yellowtail Sashimi did not taste fresh, it had more of a ceviche texture. The Uni did not taste fresh, in fact it was extremely bland. The Premium Sashimi Dinner came with 3 pieces of otoro that was cut into blocks and throughout the entire piece had a membrane intact that was near impossible to chew through. Rock Shrimp Tempura literally is fried shrimp doused in a mayonnaise textured sauce. The Vegetable Tempura was some of the worst I've had. The only thing that had decent flavor was the Pork Belly Skewers but at $15 for 2 of them, I've had MUCH BETTER.   Our server seemed really pushy in trying to sell the A5 KOBE that they charge $38/oz and you have to get a minimum of 6oz at a total price of $228. When I seemed disinterested in ordering that he seemed more disinterested in waiting on our table. Needless to say I'll never be going back to this overly trendy extremely overpriced excuse for a Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I love love love the Nobu inside Caesars!  Pro-tip: reserve a seat at the teppan-yaki table. You can still order sushi and everything else there as well, and it's just a fun, sexy experience. Most recently I was here with a friend and we ordered a couple rolls, lots of nigori sake, and split the tasting menu. I'm so glad we decided to share because it was SO much food:  -sea bass -lobster tacos -rock shrimp -shishito peppers -tuna tartare -wagyu beef -chocolate lava cake  The chef also sent out some other fun items, I can't remember what they were...one was a white fish, but everything was incredible! My favorite bites were the rock shrimp and sea bass. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Sometimes food can be an earth rocking experience, and that sometimes, summarizes every single visit I've ever had to Nobu.  There really isn't much I can say at this point that can convince you this is one of the finest Japanese restaurants in the country. 400+ Yelp reviews, and almost all of them are 4 and 5 stars.  I will just leave you with some advice:  1. Don't come here drunk. You will leave with a bill that is closer to a G. You may not enjoy it as much either. 2. Order the Black Cod Miso. Hands down the best dish that I've ever tasted. 3. You can come in a large group, but groups of 4 are best. They serve small plates. Intimate dining at it's best. 4. Service is solid, be sure to tip well. This isn't the Outback or Chili's. Don't treat it like your typical Vegas fare. 5. Yes, it's a chain now. It never used to be. But the quality hasn't skipped a beat. 6. Go to Nobu in every city you visit (if there is one). 7. Make a reservation.  Follow these rules, and you will have one of the best dining experiences of your life.  Be prepared to spend some coin. It is worth it.   Peace out."}
{"text":"Over-rated and underwhelming. I understand Nobu has the name and is trendy, but it honestly falls flat. The sushi rolls are flavorless, taste dry, and are small portions for the price. The black cod didn't fall a part easily- it was actually firm. The prices are just ridiculous for what you get. I'm shocked and very disappointed. There are so many great restaurants in vegas and to waste a night, money and calories on this dinner is a shame. The waiter wasn't apologetic that we didn't enjoy our meal. He just kept defending the quality and making us believe we were wrong. I live in LA and have had some of the best sushi- fresh and flavorful. I've had better luck at a hole in the wall for a fraction of the price. This menu needs a facelift, new flavor profile, fresher fish, and better presentation for the price. I rather go to Zuma at Cosmo! That's a memorable  sushi dinner in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Dinner for 14 here for a work event- I didn't know their sake is made just for them, that was interesting. We did the $125/head Omakase and had everything from tuna with rice cubes to sea bass lettuce cups served warm with a ginger sauce.   re ambiance, can't beat it : we had a round table in an alcove so it felt like we had a private room - They took care of the folks at the table who were not fish lovers, they had multiple backwaiters keeping us watered and plates cleared. They also responded so kindly when we had two latecomers due to a mix up in communications, and smoothly incorporated them into the table.  I would highly recommend this for a business function, these are professional servers who read the situation and responded accordingly. Well done- the only bad thing is that there's no way that receipt's going to get through finance and be reimbursed- $2500 after tip.I'm not sorry!"}
{"text":"Yes its hyped. Yes its good.   Gorgeous people place."}
{"text":"I recommend ordering a bunch of stuff and just sharing as a table. Great service, great food, great quality. My husband got up to go to the restroom and left his napkin on the table and within 10 seconds someone was there folding it up nicely for his return.   Very very pricey, like $700 later pricey. But glad we went.  *Japanese sushi chefs ( hard to find around here) If the hostess is going to greet guests in Japanese, please teach them proper pronunciation. Some of these girls are just down right offensive sounding, like a dying robot... its one word, learn it."}
{"text":"After hearing about Nobu for years now, I finally decided to have dinner here since I was staying at Caesar's Palace. My husband and I love sushi, so we thought this would be a real treat since it's hyped to be the \"best sushi ever\". We were left really unimpressed. The rolls we ordered we good, but not special in any way. I wasn't blown out of the water. We also got some skewers, beef and shrimp with the sauce that wasn't teriyaki. The sauce was good, and I did enjoy the shrimp, but again it didn't seem special. Nothing to write home about. Aside from the subpar food, what left a sour taste in our mouths was also that they had asked us if we were celebrating anything when we booked the reservation, and I said it was my husband's 30th birthday. Nothing was done for us at all, the waiter said \"oh and happy birthday\" when bringing back our check after already taking our card. I definitely don't expect singing, since it's a fancier place but no small single person serving dessert? Like they can't afford that? What's the point in asking what we are celebrating if they don't do anything? Also a $3 fee for a side of spicy mayo, which seems weird but ok. I felt like we were treated poorly since we weren't ordering alcohol and stuck with water, they acted like we couldn't afford to be there or something from the moment we said we were fine with water. Overall, I wouldn't be back and don't understand the hype at all."}
{"text":"Ate at Nobu in vegas last night and what an amazing experience we had.  We had the omakase experience, started with cold dishes to warm entree to heavy appetizer and finished off with a few of their special desserts.  Starters: japanese red snapper sashimi with dried miso, olive oil and yuzu; red snapper sashimi with jalapeno and cilantro; scallops and black cod miso lettuce wraps; pink snapper with pineapple and tomatoes. For warm dishes: Chilean Sea Bass with some crust and tenderloin beef braised with nobu sauce on a bed of south american yam; shrimp tempura presented in 3 different sauces.  To finish off the meal, chelf sent a platter of 4 special desserts.  Always make room for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were staying at the Hard Rock and wanted something to eat, but didn't want to go to the strip. We had already went to Nobu Next Door in New York and thought that the food was mediocre, but why not give it another chance?  Again, the food was ok. We had the specials that the waiter recommended. The dishes didn't at all impress me. Another miss. However, the cocktails were delicious! Especially the cucumber one, so refreshing!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this place had so much hype that it would take an inhuman performance to live up to it.  Here's the problem: you make great food, you even try innovative things, but you hire amateur servers who hound your customers who are probably paying about $100 per person at a minimum. I never thought I'd make it through a chef's tasting menu in so little time.  If I didn't know it were such a pricey place, the decor would have been the same as any other sushi restaurant with the exception of the stones they give you for chopstick rests."}
{"text":"Zen, classy, and excellent food. The environment, the family style meals, quick service, and succulent flavors of every dish made the dining experience definitely worth the price. The Miso Black Cod is a must try! We weren't a big fan of the green tea ice cream but the shaved ice was the perfect dessert to end a meal."}
{"text":"Wowza, Nobu is fantastic! I visited with a group of co-workers during a recent business trip to Las Vegas, and was lucky to have the opportunity to eat here.  We ordered a little bit of everything, as is the Nobu method, but the stand-outs were the peppers, many variations of edamame, sashimi and sea bass. AND, the black cod was TO DIE FOR. I could eat the black cod everyday, for the rest of my life, and be very, very happy. Order it!!  The staff was incredibly knowledgable and helpful, and when my wine refill was clearly not right, they corrected it in 5 seconds. The environment is cool and cozy, and I would love to go back - hopefully when we return for the same event next year!"}
{"text":"I finally was able to try Nobu and had a great time.  This isn't just a restaurant it's a true dining experience that is great for a working dinner or with friends.  This is one of the few places I've eaten where it all looked great on the menu and exceeded all expectations when served. The service is great and the ambiance is amazing, this is a place you must try at least once and worth the pricey menu.  I strongly recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"Very very good. Hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but I thought the Omakase was good value for $100. I went with my parents and they also ordered the Omakase. The waiter tempted us with the $150 Omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at Nobu, we went with the cheaper Omakase. The dishes (as best as I can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)  1) Toro with Spicy Miso and Caviar - Wow, definitely one of the highlights of the Omakase. Super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. OMG so good. There was an interesting tiny Japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.  2) Hawaiian Red Snapper Sashimi - Very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . Not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.  3) Kampachi and Tasmanian Trout Sashimi - Super exotic and tasty. I didn't even know what Kampachi was until I looked it up. Apparently it's Hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the Kona coast of the Big Island. The trout was also very good. It looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. Served with a nice miso-based sauce (I think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.  4) Black Cod w/ Miso - This dish really did live up to the hype. I was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the Omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 Omakase since it's a very popular dish. OMG so good. Such delicate flavors and texture. Amazing. I normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. The cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. Wow, this is a must try if you come to Nobu.  5) Beef Tenderloin w/ Shiitake mushroom and asparagus - I didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. It was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. It is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.  6) Nigiri Sushi Platter - Delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces I normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. Tuna (best I've had in awhile), Japanese snapper, Aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. Mmm  7) Miso Soup w/ Clams - Pretty standard miso soup with a few clams inside. The clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. I cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;P  8) Flourless Chocolate Cake w/ Green Tea Ice Cream - A generous portion served in a cute bento box. Nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. The cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. Yum!  A pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. I thought it was good value to try many dishes, but I haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. Many tables around us also ordered the Omakase, as I heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. I over heard a table of French tourists behind us ordering California rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. Sigh, what a waste.  I would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. The rest is basically traditional Japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at Nobu. Service was good, polite, and attentive. It was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. Weird.  The decor is basic, but nothing too special. The sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. My parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. When we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. Ten minutes later, they were ready. Better to come early though, or your Omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. Ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.  I think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. Otherwise, nearly flawless.  If I ever return for a special occasion, I will definitely need to try the $150 Omakase. With the economy in shambles, I kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. Fortunately, my parents picked up the tab tonight as I had paid last night at the Painted Pony. Maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like Gray's Papaya. ;P"}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi chain. Top notch quality fish/dishes and pretty pricey. But who cares when you're on the strip; expensive is expected. :P   Nobu stands out from the rest of the sushi chains because of their creative entrees. Based off their Chilean Sea Bass and Black Cod dishes, I'm quite impressed and have confidence that any of their dishes would be a good pick. These dishes were well prepared and were not drenched in sauce. Their raw fish tastes as if it's fresh from the ocean; definitely close to what you can get in Japan. However, the quality of their fish is what closely resembles Japan not the restaurant itself as their menu, interior decor and waitstaff is like any other American restaurant."}
{"text":"The server and chef were very accommodating to our time crunch with a show to follow dinner.  Still managed to squeeze in a few drinks,  saki and some of the most creative sashimi we've ever had."}
{"text":"Reservations were easy through open table.  Confirmation sent via email.  Server was experienced and could recommend menu options for every appetite and food issues.   All staff friendly.  Clean food and restaurant."}
{"text":"It was a mixed experience at Nobu Las Vegas.  Personally not a fan of the Hard Rock location.  Service was attentive and friendly but I can see why some may think the service borders on rude and snooty.  When you order something, they definitely try to upsell a fancier item.  It can be a little overbearing.    - lychee martini was delicious and strong - black cod with miso - mmm mmm!! knock out! highlight of our meal - yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno - very tasty indeed - toro carpaccio - recommended by our server.  was tasty with shaved truffles but the sauce was a little too overpowering - toro and scallion hand rolls - meh, nori wrapper was a little chewy, had to tug a bit with each bite.  for an establishment of this caliber (supposedly michelin 1 star rating 2009), I thought this was a major no no.  the best establishments make sure the nori are well kept in a wooden box to maintain the right moisture level.   overall enjoyed dinner but would not plan to dine here again when back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. The service was great. The food was hit or miss, but mostly good. The seafood dishes were really good (miso black cod, tempura, sashimi), but the sushi was ordinary and the wagyu gyoza were not worth the money. The meat inside the gyoza was a large dry meatball and the wrapper fell part and was hard to bite through."}
{"text":"Just had dinner and cocktails with my husband and was completely amazed but the wonder staff particularly Toshi. He was knowledgable and kind we would definitely recommend coming here we will most definitely be back for the delicious food and wonderful company! Thanks again Toshi for the wonderful time."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. My casino host would always make res for me to eat here everytime im in town but the last time i was there on labor day weekend it was terrible. I always get the same thing the lobster salad, miso cod, rock shrimp tempura, yellowtail jalopeno, and lobster tacos. This last trip, the only thing that tasted like it should was the lobster salad and yellowtail. Not what I was expecting from a chain nobu. I have even eaten at the san diego location recently and they have gone downhill also. Bummer because I really use to like this place. Maybe ill give it one more shot before i cut this place off."}
{"text":"You're in Vegas, you happen to be staying at the Hard Rock, and suddenly you have a craving for some amazing sushi, well then you're in luck cause Nobu will come to the rescue.  I'd never think Vegas and Sushi together but after having dinner there, in my mind they will always be related.  Really some of the best sushi I've ever had, oh and they have Asahi on tap that tastes like pure deliciousness.  I have yet to find Asahi on tap around here that tastes anything like it did that night.  If you feel like spending some money (which I'm sure you do if you're in Vegas), then make sure you check this place out."}
{"text":"For some reason no matter what city, if there is a Nobu I end up going to it. (tough life) There is some special draw about the food and the execution that get friends or coworkers to want to eat at a Nobu. The atmosphere is always special, encouraging a good conversation, people watching and banter with the staff.  The food used to be extremely special when it first started in LA. But as the years have past other restaurants have caught up and copied Nobu's menu.  The food in Vegas is still top notch, with fresh fish, inventive sauces that accentuate the food and great sake.  The price is very expensive for what you get but at the end of the night it is about the whole experience.  My favorite dishes are: toro tartare, hamachi sashimi with jalapenos, and the fried rock shrimp with cream sauce.  Inside scoop: do not get the free for all omakase where the waiter pretends to customize the menu for you.  This is not like the places in Tokyo where the chef stares deep into your soul and magically delivers the menu of a lifetime.  Instead here they are just trying to run up the tab."}
{"text":"massive fan.  this is the original one in vegas, and it is every bit as good as the ones i have tried elsewhere.  every nobu has its own off-the-menu items.  the one that i tried this one time was barracuda.  and it was amazing.  if they offer it, definitely try it out.  the rest of the review can be found in my other nobu reviews...the food is consistent across the board."}
{"text":"new style sashimi is where it's at, it's the business. it is one of the best tasting things i have eaten. it is what i would like to have as part of my last meal on earth. unlike any other sashimi i have tried. we had shrimp and scallop new style sashimi, and it was sweet, succulent, yet unctuous with the oil drizzled on top. i can't really do it justice with my description, but the peruvian influence i think is what shines through and takes it over the top. it's just something you have to taste and savor to grasp the profoundness of it, especially if you appreciate the pureness of sashimi like i do. the omakase is spectacular, serving portions are not generous, but you get to experience delicate and exotic ingredients and flavors in a nice intimate setting. sea urchin and abalone are also to die for, but they do run out of the abalone rather quickly, so you may want to inquire at reservation. i also encourage dining at the sushi bar if you are flying solo, the sushi chefs are very friendly and knowledgeable and can recommend the fish that are very fresh and good that night."}
{"text":"Good food and  service ! Everything  is good but you better know your spending limit ! Because when the check came don't' look surprise !"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Japanese food I have ever had.  The food was amazing and the portions are small, but the flavors explode in your mouth.  If your a vegan, just let your waiter know and they can make a menu just for vegans and it's so so so good!  Our waiter was amazing and should be an example of how every waiter should be.  We will definitely go back!  I was surprised at the cheap chopsticks as well as someone else posted, but it's ok, they give you a cool rock to reset them on!"}
{"text":"My experience here was amaaaaaazing! Had reservation set for 7 people and we got to sit along the sides of the restaurant that made it semi-exclusive. My whole party opted-in for Chef's daily creation omakase ($175). It includes items not listed on the menu consisting cold dishes as starters, hot dishes from the grill, soup and nigiri. An alternative omakase will be the Nobu's selection for ($125)... this one, you won't be able to try the daily chef's special. Since we're in Las Vegas... I lived by the motto \"Go Big or Go Home!\". So, without any regrets... $175 it is!  If you refer to my pictures, those are the items served to me that night. Everything was blasting with flavors I've never tried elsewhere. I was blown away.   The omakase already comes with dessert, but we decided to add the shaved ice for all of us to share. It is huge and definitely enough to share among the 7 of us.  Besides the food, the cocktail menu has pretty good mixtures of alcohol and ingredients. I got to the try Grapefruit on the Rocks and Sidecar. Both are very good! And of course being a restaurant that serves alcohol, they have wine, beer, and hard liquor as well.  Totally would recommend this place to anyone. I know they have other locations also so wherever you are... if you see a Nobu... GET IN THERE!"}
{"text":"Nobu is my fave chain restaurant. this wasn't one of my fave locations. I feel the decor was not up to par with other locations such as Nobu 57, Nobu Berkley or Nobu in west Hollywood. the food and service on the other hand are always top notch. They had my favourite wine (joh.jos. prum) which they seem to only have in 1/2 of their locations. The prices at this location seemed to be on the high side. $40 for 2 pieces of toro sushi, which is usually a staple for me but i decided to pass on it)  Food Yellow tail Sashimi with Jalapeno  Nobu style tacos- beef and tuna beef tataki Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki- yummy toro and scallion roll  I would highly recommend any of these dishes"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price. Cocktails were complex and delicious. My husband had the lychee/elderflower martini, I had the Rada--both delicious. We had a seafood only meal, our friend does not eat meat and every course was flavorful and unexpected. The lobster tempura sounded a little off but was AMAZING! We thought we were too full for sushi as the last course, but the food was so wonderful, we kept eating!"}
{"text":"I will start this review with this: we live I. Vegas and have been to many of the restaurants on the strip. It takes a lot at this point to really get us excited about a newly visited place. Overall, this restaurant was a huge hit. Service perfect, food amazing! We dined out for my brother's birthday & tappanyaki is his favorite, so we reserved one of the few tappan tables. Started with all different cocktails from their specialty menu, I had the martini w/ lycee, very good. Appetizer - Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalepeno - I wish we had ordered more! Of the 4 choices of pre-set menus, varying greatly in price, we all ordered the menu w/ scallops and wagu beef. Overall, the full menu was great, but the beef was so good, so perfectly cooked, we ordered another round of it. The chef less than half-way though the dinner asked us if we'd like him to slow down a bit (I do admit, we talk a lot and take our time eating), which was very much appreciated. Loved the experience, though obviously expensive. We plan on returning soon. Thanks to all for making my brothers birthday ridiculously enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Cod miso was the Best dish. Most everything was good except the scallops and sauce were too salty. Lobster noodles was a nice relief of the immense flavors the other dishes had.  Salmon sashimi had too much sesame oil. But otherwise good. Yellowtail jalapeño was amazing. Paying so much, I expect a lot. So that's why I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Truly disappointing on several levels.  The quality of the fish was simply not that good.  I'm not even comparing it to Sugarfish (highly recommended), but merely to local LA places like Brothers Sushi in Woodland HIlls.  When I'm paying Nobu prices, I expect better than Woodland Hills sushi, know what I mean?  The portion sizes were, frankly, skimpy.  I will credit them for serving a real Salmon Roll, whereas many sushi places use pieces of meat that has been broiled/burnt, this was real salmon skin, just like the good places do it.  The prices are really astronomical...and given that they all buy their fish from the same place(s), pretty ridiculous.  Hey, I've had sushi in Japan with businesses, and even paid for it one time -- a vertiginous buying experience that will affirm to you that Amex truly does have no credit limit on your card -- so I do know good and even great sushi.  This is not it.  The service was, and I'm not sure if this makes sense, but obsessively and (worse) aggressively obsequious.  This guy would continually hover over us explaining to us how (and exactly) whatever we wanted would be taken care of by him of the sushi chef.  Very intrusive, and I realize now it was the exact opposite of the very non-intrusive servile style found in sushi places world wide."}
{"text":"This is a horrible place. Expensive, bad tastes and makes you sick! We had seven dishes from cold to hot. All taste either super sour or super salty. The only ok dish is white rice. It costs 180 per person! Afterwards me and my husband all had very bad belly pain and diarrhea! Avoid avoid avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"Food 4-star Service 4.5 star Ambiance 3 star  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and Black Cod with Miso are truly rave-worthy. Sushi was fresh and sake delicious. Had an excellent server. Decor is surprisingly non-descript - much prefer the decor of Nobu in Midtown by far. Ambiance was fairly toned down, perhaps due to off-Strip location."}
{"text":"The sushi was awesome, the yellowtail with jalapeño and the scallop sushi were amazing. The attention from all the staff was excellent everyone was great. They really pay attention to their customers not just your server but everyone one there. Thanks for making my big 40 bday special.  Although I didn't pay for dinner, I did see the prices and thought they were a little too high, but it's vegas."}
{"text":"I finally got to check out this location in the Nobu Hotel in Caesar's Palace! The restaurant is spacious and packed!  I definitely suggest to reserve in advance. There's a lounge/bar area, the main restaurant, and in the back there's a room where the chef makes food for you on a hot stove.   The fish quality was amazing at this location. We tried a few new dishes and some of the old ones like spicy tuna on crispy rice and the regular nigiri.  Some of the new dishes that we tried were the soft shell crab roll, king crab ceviche, white fish sashimi special and king crab tacos.  The tacos I didn't love as much, but the rest of the dishes were amazing! I would come here over and over again! Also the cucumber martinis are my favorite! A must try!"}
{"text":"It's a wild scene, the place is always noisy & filled with people. The music that plays over the speakers is always very interesting & I can't say anything negative about the food. Each dish is always perfect.  I love everything about this place & yes it's pricey but you truly taste & see what you're paying for, it's of the finest quality.  The cocktails are also amazing with a lot of interesting flavor combinations & I would highly recommend the pineapple martini & miso glazed cod which are my two favorite things on the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to. Great atmosphere, amazing service. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi, salmon skewers, black cod miso, rockfish with the creamy sauce and bento box desert. These are their most popular dishes and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been to this place many times. If you like Japanese food, this is the place to go. Just remember don't order the sushi items as you can get those anywhere for much less price. When you eat at Nobu you need to get the cold and hot dishes ONLY! A few of my favorites: squid pasta, miso cod, hamachi tartar, spicy crab and finally don't forget the bento box for dessert."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I love Nobu, however I will never go back to the one at Caesar's Palace. When I approached the hostess stand I wasn't even greeted. When the hostess finally acknowledged I was standing there she looked up once with a smirk on her face and asked if we had a reservation. I said no and from there she proceeded to tell us the wait would be approximately 30-40 min. I was fine with waiting as we were walk ins and it was clear the restaurant was extremely busy. The part that I couldn't get over was how terribly rude the hostess was while taking down our information. Absolutely zero eye contact and the ugliest attitude I've ever encountered. About 25 minutes go by and a couple sits down next to us. They did not have a reservation and the reason I know this is I overheard them talking about not having one and the gentleman told the lady he was with not to worry and That he would get them a table right away. He goes back up to the hostess stand and spends a few minutes there and he was correct. Got them right in. I couldn't believe it. They had just got there, had no reservation just like us and got right in. Once that happened I went up to the hostess and asked why she sat that couple before us. She proceeded to tell me they had a reservation which was a complete lie. By this time I was upset and definitely called her out on her lie and asked that we too be seated. She was happy to argue with me and told me she hAd nothing available and that if we wanted to eat there we would have to continue to wait probably another 10-15 min. I went to sit back down then noticed a bunch of room at the sushi bar. I walked over and grabbed the first two seats and sat down. The hostess ran over and told us that we couldn't sit there and that we needed to move to the other side of the sushi bar. By now I was furious and seriously couldn't believe what I was hearing! I told her I preferred to stay right where I am and she insisted I had to move because in her words \"it's not sanitary to sit there.\" That was a first. The table wasn't even dirty and the only things that were missing were two set ups. I told her if the table was dirty then to send someone to wipe it down and I preferred to stay right where I'm at. She then told me it was against Health code and I had to literally laugh in her face because I'm sorry, that is complete and total BS! We ended up moving because all we wanted to do was eat and leave. All this girl did was be rude and argue with me from the second I arrived. It made my dining experience the worst I had ever had and I couldn't wait to just eat my food and get out of there! The hostess should be the face of the restaurant and if I were the manager of this restaurant I would definitely get rid of that girl. She clearly doesn't enjoy her job and doesn't belong in the hospitality industry. I'm glad I'm a local and from now on go to the Nobu at The Hard Rock Hotel. The staff at that location is extremely friendly and the food is actually better as well. I will NEVER go back to Nobu Caesar's again!"}
{"text":"This ambiance is five stars. The staff is great.   The yellowtail with jalapeño was delicious--highly recommend.   Seaweed salad was nice --two of the seaweed was fantastic the other two very salty.   The lobster tempura was too big (zuma is the best for this dish).   The flourless chocolate cake was delicious.    Overall great."}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal, but still left hungry after spending $200 on dinner for two. Something about that just seems so wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The Japanese Waygu beef was completely....and totally...out of this world. Spicy Tuna/Scallop rolls are also as enticing. I've had many-a-sushi, this places was certainly of the best.  Wonderful service, wonderful atmosphere. It's Super Bowl weekend and everyone was ready to party...great for large groups.  Upscale restaurant, but in no way stuffy!  Love!"}
{"text":"Nobu is pretty awesome! I'm be of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Yes, I know it's overpriced but honestly it worth it!! The service and quality is excellent. Me and my friend were sitting at the sushi bar and the sushi men who took out order was knowledgeable about the menu items and gave us the best food experience. Their food is amazing! Try it! You won't regret!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try Nobu after having an amazing experience at Morimoto in Philly.  I was not disappointed.  We arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  Upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    The atmosphere at Nobu is much different than Morimoto...Nobu is more lively and trendy.    They have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  We started with the oysters and the lobster ceviche which is served in lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting.   For our second course we chose the creamy spicy crab and the rock shrimp tempura in butter ponzu.  The creamy spicy crab may be one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  At the end of our weekend I asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about Vegas and he responded without hesitation \"Eating creamy spicy crab at Nobu.\"  Not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the creamy spicy crab.    We chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) and yellowtail scallion.  Each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.  For dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  Our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   All were amazing.  The service was outstanding throughout the night.  The meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at Morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  In the end I felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  Including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  I do have to add that it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  When I made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  I'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in Vegas, and especially at a place like Nobu, but I do not like it when I go through the effort and others don't have to."}
{"text":"Really great meal; attentive staff, creative flavor combinations, and the semi omakase style make it a great adventure if you want to let your server drive the meal!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my sister & it was easily one of the best dining experiences I have had in years. If Chris Brannon is working, ask for him as your waiter. You won't be disappointed. It was our 1st time here & he explained how to have the dining experience of YOUR choosing.  Sis had the Black Cod Miso which was delicious. I was in the mood for the whole Maine Lobster & it was perfect. Last but not least, we had Otoro which was just as good as the sushi I had in Tokyo 2 months ago!  Yes, it's expensive but we felt it was worth it! You only live once. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the Nobu in NYC. I've heard that it blows Vegas away. However, we went on a Friday and dropped serious coin on average sushi. The fish seemed fresh. The sushi rice was dry. The apps were average. To bright inside to fit a 'hip' feel. Never again."}
{"text":"This the best place i have been to, i visit here about 2 years ago and till this day i still remember the Otoro (Fatty tuna) It was truly a orgasmic experience in my palate. It just has been the most delicious thing i have ever eaten in my life. The Best $42 dollars for 2 pieces of fish ever spent. Will do it again anytime! i had some rolls and they were also outstanding.  I wish i could write more about this place and hopefully i will get to sooner than later. but for the time being i highly urge you to try the Otoro(fatty tuna) in this place. Guaranteed it will be well spent money!"}
{"text":"Crazy expensive for disgusting Japanese food...they just will be robbing you as much as they can....save hundreds of bucks and go to a local out of strip place...we we're 5 people and all of us didn't enjoy any plate....margaritas happy hour 20 bucks...."}
{"text":"We ate at several higher end places while in Las Vegas. I loved all of them except Nobu. I was really disappointed. I had some shrimp tempura. It was over cooked and just nothing special at all. We had the Black Cod , everyone liked it. We bought the lobster too. It cost $75 and it was not good at all, in fact I thought it was terribly over-cooked and the sauce over powered an extremely rubbery lobster. Sorry, I wish I had liked it ."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience. Brought some guest from out out of town here last weekend. Unbelievable presentation! The food, service, and overall experience was over the top!"}
{"text":"I've been dreading this review I'm about to give..  Looking back on the experience, I probably shouldn't go to Japanese restaurants to be turned on, or blown away. My climax with sushi was 3-4 years ago, now I get bored with it. I'm more of a NEW American/French food lover.    First off, the server wasn't very informative, so I talked to another server passing by, she actually gave me some good guidance. We ordered a wide range of items, going off their recommendations. We started with sashimi yellowtail with jalapeños. Of course it was good, Yuzu makes anything rock, and fresh raw fish does it's job well, no help needed. Second was the lobster ceviche. I found it boring, uninspired, bland. Sorry.   Third was the new style sashimi, salmon. This was by far the best. Slightly cooked, warm sesame, miso sauce. Delish.  Main courses were the black cod miso,a restaurant favorite, but not my favorite. I just kinda ate it, without having any real feelings for it. I was just thinking ok, maybe the next plate will be better. Creamy spicy rock shrimp tempura, I had two pieces and decided it was time to order a freakin sushi roll and call it quits. I'm hungry and not so impressed. Thank god I wasn't paying.  I ordered the nobu roll I believe, it had ahi tuna, yellowtail, avocado, scallion, masago.  I didn't think I'd have to get a roll to be happy and satisfied, oh well..     My only recommendation,  the new style sashimi."}
{"text":"My bf and I loved this place. Our experience was amazing! If you come to Nobu, don't expect the full experience by ordering off a couple items on the a la carte menu. Do the omakase and get the full experience. We did the omakase $225 a person and honestly thought it was worth it. The quality of the fish and the different flavors were amazing. Their seared wagyu beef and foie gras miso soup was delicious. The service was also wonderful and each dish was described in detail. I would definitely come back and try it again since they change their omakase every so often. If you want to get your money's worth, omakase all the way."}
{"text":"$24 for 3 tiny oysters and $44 a bottle for hot sake?!?!  No thanks, I'll pass. Go to Social House at the City Center and do the tasting menu there.  So much better!"}
{"text":"The best and greatest meal I've had all year! Everything from start to finish was exquisite and delicious. The service was impeccable and outstanding to say the least.   We will be back in January for the hubby's birthday! Amazing is an understatement!"}
{"text":"NOBU. . .Narcissistic. . .Outrageous. . .Bracing . . .Unconventional.  These are just a few words that come to mind after I experienced Nobu. Because really, you don't dine or even eat at Nobu . . .you experience it with all of your senses. Yes, it is expensive, but what do you expect? You're in Vegas, a city that thrives on the temptation and transiency of money.   It is glaringly obvious that the chefs at Nobu approach sushi and food like art. From the flawless presentation of each plate to the masterful blending of the phenomenal flavors, dining here is like watching art unveil itself. I tasted unique creations at Nobu that I have never tasted before anywhere else, nor will I probably ever come across again except at this restaurant. Every time a new plate arrived at our table, I felt like applauding (and in many instances, we did). I can not even begin to describe the parade of culinary wonders that we experienced. There was hamachi sashimi with jalapeno, kobe beef carpaccio, marinated cod lettuce wraps, and a wide variety of sashimi and rolls that blew your mind (to name a few). Each was an explosive fusion of the Far East and the rest of the world that stimulated your taste buds. They also have an impressive selection of flavored sake that only serves to emphasize the aromatics of the food.  Not only is Nobu candy for your soul, it is candy for the eyes as well. Don't be surprised if you dine next to an unshaven Justin Timberlake, bitchy Paris Hilton, drunk Vince Vaughn or bald Britney Spears. Just remember to play it cool, you are at Nobu after all."}
{"text":"Awful if you are vegetarian!! They will treat you like a second class citizen. Didn't even get a side plate like the rest of my party. Soooo hungry!! Don't come here if you are veg!!!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. When I saw the $99 Groupon plus the 20% off Groupon was offering plus my wife's B'Day to celebrate there, I knew the stars were aligned.  Could it live up to reputation? The food: The Groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. The meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. A very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. The first course was yellowtail tuna with jalapeno and cilantro. The tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. It was very tasty and different than yellowtail that I have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. Things got even better after that. The next dish was rock shrimp tempura with a creamy spicy sauce. Wow, was that good! Not like any tempura I have eaten before. Very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. And the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. A great dish. And a huge portion. By its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. This was followed by the Alaskan Black Cod with Miso. Another outstanding dish. The fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a California roll. This was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. Last course, dessert. I photographed the plate. A beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). The food rates 5 stars plus. The service: As soon as we were seated, our server, Albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. Throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. They made us feel very welcome. Our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. The table was cleared promptly. The food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. The service was 5 stars plus. The ambiance: The restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. However, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. We were there on a Monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  But our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. If the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. Not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. At best, 3 stars for ambiance. Value: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. I would do it again in a heartbeat. But I would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or I would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out)."}
{"text":"super yummy.  definitely go with the omakase dinner.  you won't be disappointed.  the sake sampler was nice too.  the best part was the kobe steak that came out on the flamin' rocks.  felt it was slightly overpriced (hence the minus 1 star).  i'd still come back."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but it's vegas. Miso cod - EXCELLENT. Rock shrimp - very good. Hamachi jalepino - needs uzu instead of whatever they use."}
{"text":"we had a group of 17 for dinner here (yes, 17 ppl!) and they did a set menu for about ~$100 a person.  It was quite good and there were definitely 2 or 3 dishes that were very memorable but the rest were good but not amazing.  Great service, very accomodating, and overall really fun and tasty experience."}
{"text":"I have reviewed Nobu locations before. Here's another. We celebrated my birthday here and his restaurants continue to to have the most outstanding staff that we've encountered. The food is very good with new takes on traditional sushi and other Japanese dishes, but it's the attention to training and detail that makes the experience so great. There's lots of Japanese restaurants but very few here reach their level."}
{"text":"More like 3 1/2 stars.  I've been to the NY and Miami ones, and this is 2nd behind NYC.  Good food and service for the most part.   Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - yum, though presentation was better at NYC Rock Shrimp Tempura with Ponzu and Chili Pepper - yum Crab ceviche- yum Creamy Spicy Crab - doubt this is authentic but if you love mayo like I do...yum Washu Beef - served New Style - like a carpaccio drizzled with sesame oil - yum  This is where I would take points away: -The space is not that impressive for the prices -Bathroom being way back out in the casino.  Every food establishment should have a convenient place to wash your hands! -Uni was so--- not fresh,  It was bitter!  Though as soon as I mentioned it, the waiter took it off our bill.  I'm just surprised a place of this caliber would serve anything with poor quality. -Though I expect the specials to be pricey, it would be courteous to mention to a party of two that one of them is $120!"}
{"text":"Nobu is AWESOME. I've never been to a Nobu before until this past weekend when I was in Vegas for a bachelorette party. The decor inside the restaurant was pretty nice. Service wasn't too bad, but it could have been a pinch better. Felt like our waitress was spread out a little too thin and trying to cover too many tables, but when she was around, she gave us the time and explained things pretty thoroughly.  My favorite dish of the night was the Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno (I normally don't like raw fish, but this one was freaking awesome!), lobster salad (I normally don't eat fields of green salad, but this was an exception!), miso black cod (very yummy), the bento box dessert was great (esp the chocolate flourless cake which was very soft) and the mango caramel ice cream dessert. The ice cream was lighted flavored mango and there were caramel bits in there that was just great. Probably my favorite dessert that I've ever had.  Overall the food was fantastic. Definitely would head back to Nobu again next time I'm in Vegas. They're opening one closeby and I'll be definitely dining there in the future."}
{"text":"I wish all of my meals in Vegas were this good.  I don't even know where to begin.  The Yellow Tail sashimi with jalapeno that I was allowed to taste was delicious.  I could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  Thankfully being with the group I was with that wasn't allowed to happen and I enjoyed several other items from the menu.  For myself I ordered the Chilean sea bass with a dry miso rub, the lobster ceviche, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  The sea bass had a very mild flavor although the dry miso was tasty.  I think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  The lobster ceviche was great and I could have had a couple more but I held off so I could enjoy my entire meal.  The uni was good, although I don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  I'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  At least I hope so.  The surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. It was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  With a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  I really should have gotten at least one more order.  I was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  All were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time I eat at Nobu.  For dessert I had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  The popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the Yelp events I've been to."}
{"text":"Incredible sushi and cocktails at this restaurant in Las Vegas! Nobu is always so consistent with their level of quality and service! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Acclaimed celebrity chef Nobu Matsuhisa has a restaurant in every continent.   There are two high end sushi joints here in Vegas. This location not as swanky as the one in Caesars Palace  nevertheless is a signature restaurant for the Hard Rock Hotel and a little more casual than 35 Steaks next door. The elegant dining room with Bamboo thrown in the ceiling and minimal décor in a Zen sort of way it's warm and inviting.  To start the yellowtail sashimi was superb, delicate sensuous .The crispy tempura rock shrimp drenched in a yuzu spicy sauce over salad greens was tangibly addicting. The picture of the Black Cod in miso should be posted as the Wikipedia definition of umami simple, savory and sweet accented by a pickled ginger shoot. The sushi was ordinary but respectable fresh. A nice little green tea ice cream for dessert to complete the Nobu experience. The staff were friendly professional rock stars. If you want to feel like a baller the groupon deal is the way to go and you be treated to a nice multi-course adventure by one of Japan's best chef.  Kampai."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went to Nobu this past Friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. We had very few disappointments. They sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  Lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of Japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  We split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant Nigori Sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. The small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing.   The first course came out quick and cold. A chilled patty of Toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped with caviar, served with a baby silver spoon.  It was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  The caviar was not memorable.  An A+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. Next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  Pretty good.  Next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  My buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the shrimp head and the dressing.  I will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head.   Then started the hot plates.  First was the ever famous Black Miso Cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  A small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  Flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  My friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  Next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. Beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as I would like.  My buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  The dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  Try not to get the grease on you.   Next was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam miso soup. We got a piece of red snapper (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and sea eel which was the most tender fall apart sea eel I have ever tasted.  The sushi rice and soup fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea ice cream.   This just put the nail in the coffin.  We were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.    The restaurant closed at 11pm on a Friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  Next time I'm in vegas I plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  This was the $100 omasake.  The $150 would have added some kobe beef and lobster here and there.  We were very happy with our choice.  I think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price."}
{"text":"i read all the reviews in our room (at the hard rock, no less) before deciding to eat here for dinner with my sister. i was curious to try out the black cod that a lot of people were raving about.  started off with salmon nigiri (salmon was buttery and excellent) and pomegranate martinis (too weak; tasted more like koolaid). we shared the black cod with miso and the baked creamy crab. the cod was rich and buttery but the sauce was just a tad too sweet so i had to scrape it off the skin. if we had rice, i wouldn't mind at all. the crab was delicious and there was huge meaty chunks of it. however, the creamy baked sauce was a little on the salty side--again, a bowl of rice would've fixed that problem. the service was alright and the decor was fab."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome and we were about to pay the bill and a giant cockroach the size of my fist crawled under our table.  The manager was called but we never even got an apology.  Opted to pay at the front desk and we got the heck out of there!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing the space advertising the coming of Nobu in Ceasers Palace for a few years now.  This past summer it finally opened and I'm happy to say the wait was worth it.  The meal is server in courses and there wasn't one dish that I thought wasn't truly amazing.  The waitress was extremely helpful in describing the menu items and making recommendations.  While on the high end of my dining budget, I have no regrets.  The food and atmosphere made for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"This isn't just a restaurant - this is an EVENT First of all, let me say that I screwed up my reservation date and the Nobu staff was very gracious and understanding. They got us in without a problem. The entire evening was incredible! The feeling of the restaurant is contemporary and stylish, yet warm and romantic. We decided to try the tasting menu, it was $125 per person, but worth every penny! My husband and I tried things that would have never crossed our palate had we not opted for this choice. I believe it was 8 courses, but I kind of lost track after four. I really enjoyed the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos, salmon tartare with caviar, cod (their signature dish) and the dessert of molten lava cake and green tea ice cream. For drinks I had the Dalia and the Mango Passion, both were delicious, but the Mango was my favorite (It was recommended by our waiter). The drinks were kind of pricey at around $17. This is probably not the kind of place you would go to every week, well maybe you would if you can afford that kind of thing. Our bill with tip came to about $400. I would highly recommend it for special occasions and for Vegas tourists that want a truly unforgettable experience!"}
{"text":"We ordered Omakase style to get the full experience of Nobu. Every dish was beautifully presented, very clean and unique. The fish was extremely fresh and our waiter Billy was knowledgeable and friendly. The ambiance was wonderful and for a Tuesday evening got pretty busy. There were several smile bites but I left wanting more, I could have definitely eaten more. But ultimately you pay for the reputation and experience. I would absolutely come back but this time I would order off of the menu versus doing the Chefs Selection Omakase style."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the world.  I live in the east coast but have been to Nobu in Caesars palace 5 times.  I have also been to Matsuhisu in Beverly Hills.  Nobu has the best fish and best bites of food that I have ever experienced.  Salmon bellly is the best bang for your buck on the menu.  Uni shooter is the first thing I get all 5 times I have been.  I generally stay away from the meat selection because its so pricey but last time I dined there I got a ribeye that was out of this world.  Do yourself a favor and eat here any chance you get."}
{"text":"Was here with a party of 8.  Asked them to serve us up an arrangement of their finest food...they delivered!  Salmon & tuna dishes were amongst my favorites."}
{"text":"Food: My newly fiancee ordered the black cod, crispy rice, salmon sushi, beef new style and eel roll.  The black cod was pretty good out of the things we ordered.    Food rating:  3.5/5  Service:  Service here is pretty good here, kind of expected at an upscale place.  Service rating:  4/5  Price:  Kinda varies but expect to pay about $20 per item.  Overall:  I was hoping the food here was great, but nothing that we tried really stood out.  The food was prepared very nicely but just tasted slightly bland."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!  Yellowtail, salmon, etc. sashimi melts in your mouth...big fan of the sushi salad, spicy miso lotus 'Chips' with tuna, and had to order more of the shrimp w/ main lobster with spicy garlic sauce!    Great service, our reservations were all set. Considering the restaurant was packed - food came quickly after we ordered.  Pricey, but here you get what you pay for!  I would definitely eat there again..."}
{"text":"The hype about the Miso Black Cod is true.  Tasty.  Melts in the mouth.  $23 for it is reasonable.  However the Blue Fin toro with caviar is not worth $32.  It was good but the price is a little over the top. Check attached photo.  I love the sea urchin and eel but then again  I really love sea urchin and eel regardless where I eat them.  Our waiter is always disappearing. The busser was more attentive than our waiter.  The experience was just okay for me I guess.  It just makes me appreciate other jap restaurants owned by japanese with japanese waiters more."}
{"text":"Order the chef's tasting menu  - outstanding! Soft shell crab is the best ever! You will surely drop a pretty penny, but the food is excellent.......the scene ain't too bad either."}
{"text":"I have so many great things to say about this place. Gladly don't know how or where to begin. Nobu any place in the world serves The Best sushi and this location was just as staggering. The staff attends to you like no other. Service is so quick and painless. Every single item on that menu is a must. From little king crab tacos to Japanese red snapper to the simplest item like miso soup is party to your Taste buds. Items are small portions and priced accordingly but I assure you it will be money worth spent. If you are staying at Cesar's palace and You are as such of a Sushi fan then this place is your home. Oh and dress to impress if it's a date night, place is rich and chic!"}
{"text":"We stayed with the sushi menu the entire night and we were blown away!  We had our favs and the sushi chefs had theirs - all were stupendous!  One of the best meals ever....  Go for it while you are there.... try the items you have not seen or heard of and you will be knocked back in your seat.  Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his staff know their way around design and execution at the sushi bar.  World class as far as we are concerned second only to Sensei in Kihei, Maui.  P.S. We were so excited to try Nobu's in Los Angeles that we brought friends...ouch! What a disappointment.  The sushi was so-so and the service blew major league chunks."}
{"text":"Really not up to Nobu standards. This is the 3rd Nobu I've visited and each time have had a fantastic meal with excellent service. The food on this trip was largely OK (missing something compared to other Nobu meals but I can't put my finger on it) but the experience and staff were terrible.   Long story short, after a long standing reservation, we walked into a half empty restaurant and were literally seated at the worst table in the place. After asking to move or find a more comfortable spot at one of the 20+ open tables, we ended up essentially being told no and taking a seat.   The waiter didn't help much. We're much more into the cooked side of the Nobu menu (they have a lot of non-sashimi and sushi options) and have always found a helpful waiter who guides us the right direction. This waiter had no time or desire to do so.  All and all, certainly not returning to this Nobu nor would I recommend this Nobu as a true Nobu experience. Long story longer, this Nobu also offers room service to the Caesar's hotel. Nobu should focus on quality and not over extending into non-essential business ventures."}
{"text":"My first time at nobu. Amazing cod miso dish. The banana dessert was amazing. Drinks are delicious And the service is top notch. Got some Rolls and shashimi. I can't wait to go back to the one close to where I live in NYC. The setting was so nice. We sat in a private booth it was great. Wasn't too noisy. It's a must try for sure."}
{"text":"This is my second time dining at Nobu. The first time I went was in Malibu. The Nobu at Caesars does not compare in quality nor atmosphere.  Nobu Malibu is hands down 5 stars.  I would give this one three and a half stars.  Would look for a more reasonably priced sushi place next time with good quality."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has 2 Michelin stars. I think giving it one for the Cod and service. We did enjoy it a lot anyway and the waiter was nice and informative. We gave him a $100 per person budget and he brought us a chefs tasting menu for 4 people. That was good. The soufflé didn't hold up so giving them only 4 stars"}
{"text":"Server was great with lots of options and choices to meet everyone's taste.  I am not a big seafood and fish person and this is the place to learn to like both...and all the courses were very good, including the beef Toban-Yaki andt the white firsh Tiradito.  This is my second time at Nobu and the place in Honolulu is still the favorite for me!  That was a 5 star, this I give 4."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Nobu, I really did. The miso cod was dry and tough. The sushi was bland. The ambiance and service were great, but I can't justify spending that type of money for mediocre food. I may still give Nobu another go and try other dishes."}
{"text":"A Horrendous Experience I need to begin by saying that I have been to Nobu restaurants in over eight locations worldwide.  I was at his first USA restaurant in NYC shortly after it opened.  I have always had an excellent experience until I dined at Nobu in Caesar's with two co-workers.  Yes, it is pricey...everything on the Vegas Strip is pricey and price was not the issue. Not being served your entrée was the issue.  I sat patiently while everyone was eating their food...there was a gap of about 15 to 20 minutes between when the first person's entrée was served to when the second person received theirs.  So, we all assumed my entree would arrive in the same time frame. So, I sat there...waiting. Our server was nowhere to be found.  Finally, when everyone else had finished their meals our server finally showed up and I inquire about my food status.  She looked shocked and said that it might take a bit longer. In the meantime she offered me a sushi roll...promising me that it would take 5 minutes to arrive...20 minutes later the wrong roll arrives.  I ate it anyway.  20 minutes after that an entrée was delivered to my table...the wrong entrée.  15 minutes later, my entrée does arrive....cold.  No apology from the server.  However, she did make a point of telling us that the entrée was removed from the bill.  The manager was called over, who again did not apologize and truly he did not care that I was leaving his restaurant without eating but did volunteer to take a whopping 20% off the bill.  Therefore, we all left Nobu with a bad taste in our mouths and me with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Food was stellar. The Black Cod lettuce with miso may have perhaps been the single best food item I have ever eaten. It had sweet, spicy, cold, hot, crunchy, soft all in one bite. Amazing. Sadly, the two beef items we ordered Medium Rare came out closer to Medium Well. Inexcusable at these prices. The final dish we ordered took over 40 minutes and service took a nose dive after first few courses. Again, this is inexcusable to spend $800 for five people and not get stellar service."}
{"text":"Einfach zuviel erwartet . Das Essen hat mich nicht wirklich geflasht. Preis einfach zu überhöht für das was dort gebotet wird"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to dine anywhere on earth. I make sure I dine at Nobu everytime I visit Vegas (which is quite often). They have lots of \"signiture\" dishes and they always have a \"new\" or \"special\" item or two on their menu. here's a little secret, they have quite a few other \"signiture\" items that they do not even place on their menu, be sure to ask your server about a few of the great items not listed such as the black miso glazed lettuce cups. The place has an up-beat vibe, modern decor and great music playing, also some of the best people watching in town. It's also VERY common to run into celebs dining there as well. It's a little bit pricy, expect to pay at least $100 per person with a couple of cocktails each(that's prob on the low side to be honest), my last visit cost me over $700 for 3 people but worth every penny, I have paid more at other places in the past for FAR FAR less. As with most any place Fri and Sat evening are their busiest, reservations at peak dining hours 8:00-10:00pm on these nights usually book up 3 weeks in advance so make sure you plan ahead.  Side note; I have eaten at both the Nobu in LA and Miami and neither of them compare to the one in Vegas, I'm really not sure why??? I would give LA 4 Stars and Miami 3 Stars. If you had a mediocre or bad experience at another Nobu give the one inside the Hard Rock in Vegas a shot, you will be delighted."}
{"text":"Anyone that has read my reviews know how much I love all NOBU's across the country. I have eaten at several NOBU's around the country so I figured why not give the newest one inside Ceasars a try.  Pretty much the same menu as the one on the other side of town with a couple other new additions I spotted on their menu. I tried a couple news things but still love my old favorites, the miso glazed cod lettuce cups, the yelowtail jalepeno sashimi, the dry miso swordfish sashimi and the Wagyu tacos. Great atmosphere, great service and great food, but my favorite NOBU is still the one inside Hard Rock across town. This location is much more convienent for anyone staying on the strip.   Pricey but worth every penny, we spwnt about $150 a head including gratuity but we ate like kings. I highly recommend Nobu."}
{"text":"Had the omakase and it was wonderful. Food was plated beautifully, and the service was impeccable. It was a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Oh my!!!!! Gave the waiter our budget and let him roll with the pickings! Amazing! This was roughly 125-150$ per person. Not including the amazing drinks.   Love the atmosphere:) Highly recommend reservations!   Miso Black cod was delicious and melts in your mouth.   Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño was my favorite.  Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a Nobu fan and generally enjoy visiting locations in different cities. The food and service here are par for the course - I sampled some perennial favorites, including the rock shrimp tempura, crispy rice, new style sashimi, and miso black cod, and all were executed without issue. Service was attentive and friendly, and the interior design is evocative of the old Tribeca location.  However, the restaurant location/setting was disappointing and poorly representative of the brand, to say the least. I have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to open up a Nobu at the Hard Rock Hotel; it would seem that their target demographics do not intersect at all. This is the only Nobu I have been to that has deemed it necessary to post a dress code at the entrance, which only helped minimally.  And rather unfortunately, the restaurant itself does not have bathrooms; one is forced to exit into the casino area to use the public restrooms, which feature needle disposal boxes."}
{"text":"Made reservation for two people on a Friday at 9:45. When we arrive we were greeted and seated right away. I forgot our server name but she was super attentive and nice. We started with two orders of ungi, four Toro, and one order of Hamachi. All were really good. Not as fresh as the Nobu in Oahu but it was still good. For our main course we got the 6oz Waygu, Lobster (special of the day), and the Alaskan King Crab. Love everything except the Crab Leg. For 75 I was expecting a bigger leg than the one we got. It looks like they went to the Buffet in Caesar and took one of the crab leg and put some Uni. I did like the sauce.   Our second visit here we ordered the two specials of the day which was the Toro w/ 7yrs aged soy sauce and truffle oil and the Bone In Rib Eye Waygu w/ fried onion and truffle oil. Now these two dishes is worth coming back for. The Toro was so soft and buttery! We had two order anther 6 pieces because that's how good it is. About 6-8 pieces was around 100. The Rib Eye was 6oz and was filled with fried onions. I like the flavor but it did get salty after 4 bites. This dish was about 100 too. We wanted to try another dish so we decided to get the Black Cod Miso. I know Nobu is known for this dish so I didn't understand why it came out super salty. I ate the Black Cod in Oahu and it wasn't this salty. I'll skip on this dish while dining in this Nobu. Our server nick name is Columbia and he's was amazing!! Such an amazing host and explained everything on the menu to us. They were 1 hour from closing and he still made sure we had the best experience at Nobu."}
{"text":"The one word that I can say to describe Nobu is \"inconsistent.\"  We've had great experiences here and some not so great.  The mushroom soup here and the spicy seafood soup are absolutely to die for.  Our server was excellent - attentive, friendly and helpful.  The decor and ambience are delightful.  However, we ordered the seafood specials - Toro sashimi and salmon belly.  They were both pretty good.  The skin on the \"crispy\" salmon skin roll was soggy and the pieces were much too large.  We ordered a bottle of the Nigori unfiltered Sake to complement the meal - a good choice but the $70 price tag underscores what Nobu is about .... $.  Our total bill came to about $300 (which was about what I expected) but I was disappointed yet again by many of the little details.  As an example, Nobu uses cheap bamboo chopsticks very similar to the ones you get at Panda Express.  On this occasion my girlfriend got a nasty splinter in her finger that made it very uncomfortable for her to eat.  The EMTs at Caesar's Palace came to help us remove it but they are not allowed to handle tweezers and/or needles so we had to settle for a bandaid.  During this entire incident the manager came by once and then scurried away.    I've got to say that there are many dining choices at Caesar's Palace, LV that are far better choices than Nobu (unless you just want a bowl of soup)."}
{"text":"Even though you have to walk through the disgusting Hard Rock casino to get there,  this is one of my favorite Nobu locations. It probably has the best atmosphere out of all of them.   There's just enough room between tables without feeling squished, and it's not so big that you feel it's empty or cold.  Even though I love the new Caesars location, I still think I might prefer this one if I'm with a more laid back group, or if I don't have any dressy clothes."}
{"text":"It's Nobu - there's no need for me to say that it's 1) delicious as hell, and 2) expensive as hell.  Our server was fun, the atmosphere was great, and the decor is amazing. I couldn't stop looking around. The place is HUGE!  Super easy to find in Caesars. Enjoy, and don't forget to order the spicy tuna with crispy rice."}
{"text":"Nobu expanded their small space!  The obscure entrance is now seen from the Casino Floor.  The Hard Rock pool is supposed to be expanding & Nobu took full advantage of that, by using some of the original acreage.  Yay, Nobu LV has a lounge AND bar now!    STILL no POTTY.  *2/13/09 Omakase pics are up & ready to be viewed*"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars but.... Service- perfect. Got seated immediately even without a reservation. Our server was absolutely amazing and had such great genuine recommendations and conversations with us.  Food - perfectly cooked, presentation was absolutely beautiful. Portions, really lacking. For the prices the portions were really meager."}
{"text":"Delicious feast!  Way better than Blue Ribbon.  So much fun...such good food.  We tried a little bit of everything.  My favorite was the wagyu beef and the nigiri."}
{"text":"Amazing meal!  From the service to every part of the meal, it couldn't be better!  Due to allergies, they created a custom tasting for me that was spectacular while allowing my husband and son to enjoy regular food!  Everything was to die for!  I never knew fresh sushi could taste so good!!"}
{"text":"Nobu was amazing. This was the first place i had dinner upon arriving to Vegas. The food was so delicious and the presentation was great. It seemed to be pricy though. The drinks were really good as well. The place seemed a bit crowded, but we had reservations."}
{"text":"This was the most expensive meal I ever had, but it was also probably the most delicious. Three of us shared an eight-course menu crafted to suit our dietary needs (they are very gluten free friendly) and preferences. The fish and scallops were so incredibly fresh. The only negative is they should go easier on the finishing salt."}
{"text":"Ok, I realize that I am in Vegas so the bill was understandable. Like my friend always says, money doesn't mean nothing over there. We spend like we're ballers and the place for ballers is Nobu. The decor was a little weird, but nice. I went there sorta late so they sat us at the sushi bar. I'm glad I did because the sushi chefs were nice and accommodating. The sushi was delicious but expensive, the raw scallop was especially good. I also got the beef dish, I forgot what it was called but it came in a sizzling plate. Now this was the bomb. The miso black cod was also the bomb.  The food was cool, the sake was good, but the service wasn't all that great. The sushi chefs were great, but the waiter seemed to be serving the more baller lookin folks and ignoring us. Took us awhile just to get water and even longer to get our sake. For the price we paid , it was almost unacceptable. But since we ordered most of our food from the sushi chefs, i cant complain......"}
{"text":"NISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.  NO body.  Especially at restaurants.  So if you want to offer a ginger infused lychee martini.  And it tastes like the vodka that comes straight out of my freezer.  Well . . .   It SUCKS.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.   And if you want to offer Mackerel on your sushi menu that's as stale as the Talk Threads on Yelp.  Well . . .   It's UNACCEPTABLE.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.  But if you offer. . . tiradito and lobster and oysters and sashimi and black cod and lions and tigers and a baby gorilla (it's Vegas, baby.  Vegas) . . .   that break-dances on your tastebuds and plays the drumline on your tonsils.     Well . . . It gets it's ass sent to my dancing buddha belly.  Happy buddha belly.  5 Stars.  A couple mishaps that got sent back to the kitchen and off the check.   But the other food more than made up for it.  Including the baby gorilla.  And the excellent, good looking service.  And about that check.  Well.  Shocking.  Stabbing.  No that's not my heart.  It's my wallet exploding.  So  . . . 5 Stars to my boyfriend for always knowing that I'm always better at being a drama mamma than ever paying for dinner.    (Okay!  So I had to wash his underwear for a month.  It's Vegas, baby.  Vegas)  NISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY."}
{"text":"It was a great experience to visit the Caesars Hotel . The Service is good and friendly and well prepared. We tried the Japanese Wagyu strip steak and the Japanese Australian Ribeye . Both of the Wagyus were extremely Amazing!! The Exective Chef showed up to our table he was a really nice guy . We had a great time at Nobu restaurant!!Thank you Chef Chris we will defiantly come back to see you!!!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and the lounge area near the bar. Very attentive. Love the miso cod and bento box dessert like most people here. Best thing was the spicy martini although the waiter said every cocktail was great (my fellow diners disagreed)."}
{"text":"Hmmm, good fish, good food...but at what cost? I went here with my cousin and we had a nice meal with the obligatory beers and sake. We each dropped $150, and I left hungry. Can I get a \"Fuck You?\" It's understandable but annoying as a local when a gourmet chain restaurant charges way more in Las Vegas than in other cities.  Didn't eat any sushi rolls, instead got some non-roll items like Tataki where they basically cut up some fish, splay it out in a circle on a plate all fancy, add a smattering of scallions, drizzle some ponzu-type sauce atop, and charge you $25.   I guess it's worth it once in a while, but NOT the kobe beef dish. We'd been told the kobe beef was phenom, so we ordered reluctantly after seeing the price: $20/ounce, 4-ounce minimum. $80 for a SMALL beef dish? Yikes! Maybe it wouldn't have hurt so much if the beef was good (great would've helped), but nope -- the beef was just some regular-assed beef, not particularly tender or flavorful. I kinda wish I'd used the $80 for something worthwhile, like a Tarot reading. At least I would've seen the future, bitches!"}
{"text":"Eating at Nobu has spoiled me, and has set the bar high for expectations for future dining experiences in Vegas!  Four of us went to Nobu with the intent of \"going all out\", trying some of their best dishes, and we were not disappointed.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is fairly casual, not cramped, and the decor is simple and warm.  There are perfect settings for larger groups or intimate dining experiences.  Something that made our experience so enjoyable was our server, who provided some great recommendations after we told him what type of dining experience we were after.  He was also able to provide us with some equivalents to some favourite dishes from Nobu in SanDiego.  Favourite dishes, in no particular order:  1.  Wagyu beef- we ordered 10oz, and although quite pricey, totally worth every penny.  The presentation at the table, of the beef on hot rocks and flambeed at the table was followed by the most melt-in-your-mouth beef you'll try this side of Japan!  2.  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno- I might have to use melt-in-your-mouth many times during this review.... the yellowtail was so delicious and included 6 pieces on the plate.  Although not a large portion, each little bite was satisfying!  3.  Rock Shrimp Jalapeno- the sauce on the rock shrimp was so flavourful, with a slight spiciness to it. It was served over greens which were perfect for getting the last its of the sauce from the serving dish.  4.  Black Cod Miso-  this perfectly cooked fish falls apart at the slightest touch, and is infused with the wonderful, slightly salty miso flavour.  Other dishes that were quite good included the red snapper***, and the seafood soup.  The only dish that was disappointing was the salmon belly*** which was the waiter's recommendation as it is a favourite dish at Nobu.  It wasn't as good as the yellowtail or snapper, and it seemed way overpriced at $50 for 6 pieces.  We did order some sushi rolls, which kind of seemed unnecessary after the other indulgences we had just had, and they weren't anything special compared to other good sushi restaurants.  Some reviewers balk at the Nobu prices, but I think people need to consider what they're looking for before they head to Nobu.  If you're looking for high quality food, tastefully presented, and a high end atmosphere, then the price is worth it... maybe only once a year though!"}
{"text":"My group came here and we chose the omakase option.  The server was awesome and the selection was amazing.  The dishes were so inventive and they included a number of their signature dishes."}
{"text":"For a moment, I felt like I was in Japan again.  This was one of the best meals I have ever had.  Started with raw oysters and they were perfectly sweet and seasoned with a vinegar and onion mixture.  The new style sashimi is perfectly seasoned and tender.  The shishito peppers were fantastic.  I had the black cod miso as an entree- it was really lovely but be prepared for the sweetness of the miso.  It threw me off a bit but it was really nice.  The tobanyaki beef was amazing.  We finished with some rolls and they were all fantastic.  I love this place- wish there was one in Denver!"}
{"text":"Nobu Las Vegas.  We are Nobu hotel guests and would yelp the restaurant as follows:  Very expensive $300 for 2   Restaurant was crowded and ambiance was sort of average.  Mechanical service (waiter was dull / no personality.   Food runners struggled to speak English).  Everyone rushing around.  Other yelp reviews addressed the tiny food portions.  They are all correct.   I was not able to understand all the hype about this restaurant.  It wasn't really that special.  I don't see us coming back.  JAF, Newport Beach"}
{"text":"Ridiculous prices but that is to be expected...it's Nobu.  The yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño is the best thing on the menu 5/5.    The uni is super 5/5     Rock shrimp tempura with the creamy spicy sauce 5/5  Do yourself a favor and order the mochi ice cream...our whole table raved about the coffee flavored mochi 5/5"}
{"text":"by far the best japanese food i have had here in the states other then in Japan itself....waitress was very friendly and helpful.  My wife and i got the Omakase Nobu specialties and the 6 courses we received were amazing!  They even had Anago which i have only been able to have in Japan and it was very close to what i ate in Japan.  Would come back here again, price doesnt matter, well worth it.  thanks again Nobu Las Vegas for an awesome 5 year wedding anniversary dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was different but very good and rather expensive.  We had a party of three and we each shared some of the dishes we ordered . They weren't very big though and  we all had very big appetites. Service was exceptional we had a very attractive waitress who was extremely attentive to us filling water glasses and drinks. She was also flirting a lot with us and was wearing a rather low cut dress which left  little to the imagination when she would bend over to fill or water glasses she was almost exposed. Needless to say she got a really good tip. LOL  By the gentleman that took us to dinner there. My only complaint was that is was a bit noisy and that the portion sizes could of been bigger for what we paid for the meal. We still were hungry when we left from there."}
{"text":"The food and service were not worthy of a $$$$ price tag. The glowing reviews of this place led me to book it for my boyfriend's birthday but it was seriously the most overpriced food and worst service I experienced in Vegas. I regret the decision to come here so much.   1. Tuna Miso Chips. This was a slice of raw tuna served on what equated to a not so crispy waffle cut potato chip garnished with some greens and a sauce that did not go well with the tuna.  2. Miso Black Cod. This was the LEAST worth it dish of all. Everyone raves about this dish and I was expecting a nice sized piece of black cod but what I got were 4 TINY appetizer bites. The cod was good but why serve this on a random bed of butter lettuce garnished with the same white noodles in the center as the tuna miso chips. Serious lack of creativity.  3. Hamachi Kama. This was the best dish of all four but that is not saying much. The fish was at least tender.  4. Joyce Farms Chicken. The chicken was tender on this but I did not like the sauce.  5. Dessert. After the fails above, did you think I was going to be stupid and order dessert?  Don't come here expecting good food or good service. The server would ask us how the food was and before we could answer he had already turned his back on us to talk to the table right next to us. This place is a joke. The Chef Nobu name does not mean anything here. I cannot believe so many people think this place is amazing.  Have you ever gone somewhere and wished you didn't? Nobu was one of those places for me."}
{"text":"This was my second time dining at nobu inside Caesars palace in Vegas. The first time we did the chefs tasting menu right when it opened and it was a 5 star experience. This time, we did teppan. It was good but not the best teppan I've ever had. I think my favorites of the night were the sashimi yellowtail with Cilantro and jalapeño and the teppan beef. The California rolls were very fresh and good. The teppan cook was great; our waiter however, was less than excellent. Our pot was out of sauce when they brought it to us, I had to constantly ask for water and he seemed annoyed with me when I asked questions about the menu. I didn't care for their garlic rice either which is something I normally love. They add egg to theirs and you can't taste the garlic. They also didn't do tricks like most high (and even lower end places do). Not sure if we will go back the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Nobu since 2010.  Every time I come to Vegas I eat here. It is always good and one of my favorites. We ate their last night before Journey concert. I wanted to give this review because of our waiterJeffrey. All of the service was good from everyone, like it has been in the past, but Jeffrey was one of my favorite waiters of all time. His enthusiasm was contagious and his recommendations were spot on. We had my favorites yellowtail with jalapeño and the black cod miso but the wagyu beef tacos, salmon new style and trout were exceptional. Great experience."}
{"text":"Muy decepcionada de esta comida.  Los ceviches súper pobres y de mala calidad.  Muy costoso para lo que traen los platos .  Espero mejoren."}
{"text":"I've noticed a trend at a lot of the \"nice\" sushi restaurants I've been to recently - the cooked food will be good while the sushi is at best average.  I came here for a work related dinner. They basically did omakase for the table. The cooked food was generally good - the black cod miso in a lettuce wrap stuck out. The wagyu beef that you cook on hot stones was fun but it wasn't something I'd be jumping to try again - it got annoying when the stones started to cool down.   When it came to the raw fish, there was little difference in quality when compared to an average SF neighborhood sushi place. If anything their spicy tuna and california rolls (which they included in the omakase) were noticeably subpar - and they definitely used imitation crab meat for the CA rolls. Maybe decent sushi is an accomplishment out in the desert but I don't see why it should be as expensive as it apparently is (I didn't see the bill but the people taking us out did a double take.).  Adjusted for the price there are lots of better options."}
{"text":"This is probably the best meal I have ever had, and I like good food. I am not picky, however and every thing sounded amazing so we just asked the waiter to bring us different items until we were full. Truly the best meal ever! Great wait staff, delicious depth of flavors, great sake... I might move in and just sleep in the booth. We even ordered a small side of rice \"or I'm going to end up licking this delicious sauce out of the bottom of this bowl...\" And the waiter laughed at my bad jokes! Winning! The only downside was the mediocre wine selection and supercalifragilistic expensive sake... But the cheapest bottle (65) was unfiltered creamy deliciousness!"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried Nobu as we have been to the NYC location several times and always enjoyed it. The black miso cod is fab, service was great..ask for a recommendation on the sake as there is one too many to pick a good one from. Attire is very dressy but, nice as it keeps the vegas douchebag chic out."}
{"text":"Having lived in LA for the longest time, I have always heard great things about Nobu. So the last time I went to Vegas, I have decided to finally give it a try. I ordered Nobu's omakase menu and it came with 9 courses of a variety of Japanese fusion cuisine. The portions are huge. My friend and I tried really hard but still couldn't finish the last 2 courses. However, I would have to say I wasn't impressed with the food overall. Comparing Nobu's omakase to Morimoto's omakase, I think Morimoto win hands down, in terms of decor, service, taste and presentation."}
{"text":"Extremely pricey, small portions but very tasty little dishes.  5 of us hungry guys seated and ordered the 7-course chef's choice.  We had Bluefin otoro, Maine lobster, Rock shrimp, Scallops, King crab, Sablefish and Barracuda just to name a few. Everything was very tasty although the whole tempura lobster was a bit plain for my taste. The otoro was absolutely divine though.   The bill after tip came close to almost $1000 including three bottles of seltzer water.  We left with empty stomachs. We assumed they don't serve regular water at this swanky spot. Our server was a nice guy, knew his stuff but found him speaking too fast and not very personable.    We also sat next to Amir Johnson of the Boston Celtic's and his girlfriend. We chopped it up a bit with him, very chill guy, and he knows how to use chop sticks!"}
{"text":"Lives up to its name and reputation. Pricey. Great service - helpful and abundant resource. Finding Nobu itself was pretty confusing even though I stayed at Caesars Palace for 5 nights and thought I knows my way around.  Again it was a great experience - after all a restaurent co-owned by Robert De Niro has that name and a distinct reputation. Kapeesh!!!!"}
{"text":"The red snapper special dish was outstanding, with a oil sauce, tomato, and garlic chips.  The house special roll had 5 types of fish plus avocado.  Definitely, as good sushi as you'll find."}
{"text":"Didn't make it down to the resto when I stayed here last year, hey, who would if you can get it delivered to your room?!?!    Service: A bit uppity, like they are doing us a favor by serving us.  I also don't like getting handed off from one server to another without an explanation.    Restrooms: Yay for being semi-close!  So many restaurants have facilities in common hallways.  Interior: Basic Nobu design.  Nothing special really, chairs and tables are not the most comfy.  Fantastic: -Yuba New Style Sashimi, wonderful, luscious -Field Green Salad, generous portioning and with the ginger soy dressing -Uni and Oyster Shooters, loved, fresh and balanced -Miso Cod in Butterleaf, off menu, always a favorite -Pork Belly Miso, meaty with just the right amount of melt in your mouth fat -Yellowtail Belly SASHIMI, wow, best fish of the evening -Shaved Ice, SO freaking good, something I will order EVERYTIME, perfect   Good: -Toro Tartare with Caviar -Tacos, didn't like the shell, greasy and thick -Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster, good pasta, it's from a package, lobster a TAD underdone -Salmon Belly Sashimi -Otoro, connective tissue, but still melted -Butter mochi dessert, became an afterthought b/c of the shaved ice  Terrible: -House Special Roll, wow SO much rice and it was gummy.  Gross.    Some really good and memorable items.  You will probably get sticker shock and expect to get hungry later.  Nobu dining is definitely something you pay a premium for. Thank you for opening up this location so I don't have to schlep over to the Hard Rock anymore.  I abhor that place."}
{"text":"We ordered the omakase which was $125pp for 8 courses. Everything was delicious but I was extremely disappointed that they gave us miso soup as one of the courses! I didn't pay a butt load of money to drink miso soup!! Was it not for the miso soup this would have been a 5 star review.  Other than the miso soup mishap every course was fantastic. The drinks were really great as well. I had one of the cocktails that had yamazaki in it and it lasted me the whole meal because it was a pretty stiff drink."}
{"text":"Our food was amazing but we were very upset by our waiter's method. He asked us what we liked and how much we wanted to pay per head.  We said $100 per person. There were six of us and he continued to bring dishes all evening without ever saying anything. When he brought us the bill it was DOUBLE our limit - $1200!!!! Yes, we had drinks, but not that much!!! He totally scammed us and what could we say then, when we had eaten the food? Terrible terrible practice.  Never again. Order off the menu every time."}
{"text":"I read the reviews while waiting for the server to come and introduced himself to us.  Placed in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, this place mixes the traditional Japanese seafood restaurant with some urban flair.  This place was pretty darn expensive, but I guess when it comes to fine dining, anything goes.  Thankfully with my appetite, one entree was good enough with white rice. I had the sauteed eggplant, while my friends had other dishes with some sake on the side. Had an asahi beer too.  The ambiance was never quiet, but it fit the bill.  The tab came out to over $100, but I guess it works for them.  The service was spot on, and the server automatically poured our beers without asking into a cup.  Thought that was pretty regal.  Other than that, I wouldn't say it sucked.  But yet, it didn't give my seal of approval either.  Granted that it was expensive, I could've used the money for other things, like gambling."}
{"text":"Had to come here due to recommendations from friends and family. The crab dish was delicious and the second one was unbelievably overpriced and tiny. Overall, this is a pricey place and next time will try the good old rolls. But then again, is it worth paying so much for plain rolls?"}
{"text":"We could never get reservations whenever we were in New York so we decided to jump at the chance to go to the Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino (There's also one at Caesar's). And the food lived up to all the hype as every dish was an orchestra of flavors and perfectly cooked/sliced proteins.   For instance when biting into the barracuda sashimi you first taste the tartness of the yuzu which is then overcome by the fattiness of the fish and the bread crumbs and finally you are hit by the small crunchy garlic chips.   The wait staff is very attentive and they ask that you simply answer a couple of questions about preferences and price points and they then come up with a tasting menu. We gave them no restrictions and what came out of the kitchen for about $120 per person was amazing.   Our impromptu tasting menu included two of Nobu's iconic dishes -- miso-glazed black cod and the jalapeno yellowtail. Like the barracuda, both of these dishes also had several flavor profiles developing on the taste buds. There were also several other dishes and a full plate of sushi, each of which would be the best in almost any city.  Our server, I believe she said her name was Ti, was also a highlight as she showed an honest exuberance and pride in the food that she was serving, which made us even more excited to try it.  For drinks, my wife had a respectable cucumber martini and I had an interesting version of the Sidecar -- an Old School drink but with yuzu being used to create the tartness.  One warning: The dining room is not the quiet, reverential temple that many high-end restaurants foster. There is an energy to the place which befits the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel."}
{"text":"Can a server ruin a wonderful and delectable food and occasion? The answer is a hard yes, unfortunately.  My wife and I chose Nobu to celebrate our anniversary and we were very excited about that.   We come in and order drinks - just the usual martinis. Just as a reminder I asked Victoria F, the server, if the hostess has communicated that it was our anniversary. She appeared courteous, although I sometimes sensed some annoyance from her part. Maybe she had a bad day. And it just went on like that for the whole night, never checking in (she was just not around and reachable if we needed anything). And to put the cherry on the top, I understand it's more of a courtesy than a rule, but it sucks to see that the table next to us got something for their celebration and and we just got a yellow smile and a \"again, congratulations.\"   Can't say I should come back here if that's the type of treatment we will receive."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I'm often very wary of Japanese restaurants.  Don't get me wrong - I love sushi - but don't eat fish.  Part of a vacation, a good friend (a meat-eater and self-denied foodie) found this place as our go to for a serious Las Vegas food experience.  He had lived in NYC and eaten at that location - and knew that the Hard Rock location had a lot to live up to.  It didn't let either of us down.  In fact, it was so good, that even at $100 per person we seriously considered going back the next night.  It's been some time, so in all fairness I'm having trouble remembering the specific ingredients in the dishes, but know that each course was a sensory experience.  Some were for touch, some for smell, most for sight, some for sound, and ALL for taste.  The flavors were incredible - hitting many of the core flavors in every single bite.  Sweet, salt, spice, hot, cold, acidic, creamy - just writing this makes me want to jump on a plane tonight to try to catch the last seating.  And the sake!  Oh, the sake :)  If I were to knock off even 1 star, it'd be because it's a little ways off the strip - at the Hard Rock.  So if you're totally strip-centric, maybe not your best bet.  It also felt a little cold - we definitely were not seated at the most comfortable table, but none looked uber posh.  And of the 6 courses I was served, one felt sub par.  But believe me - the level of service, the quality of ingredients and the expert preparation made this one of the top 3 meals in my life."}
{"text":"Hamachi, jalapeno and cilantro sashimi... with special soy sauce.  OMG.  The staff... sorta snippy.  The price - astronomical."}
{"text":"Came here with 6 people during a weekend trip to Vegas. They seated us right away even though our entire party wasn't there yet. They took a very long time just to get our drink order. We had also sat there for at least 20 minutes before they even brought the food menus. The menu is very complex, so it would have been nice to be able to review it from the moment we sat down. Once we did order, the food came pretty quickly and everything was delicious. Just a warning if you order any of the tacos off the cold dishes though, they are the smallest things I've ever seen. They were good, but the waiter was pushing family style and there was no way to share those unless you ordered 2 per person. The gyoza dumplings, black cod miso and rock shrimp were especially delicious. It was very pricy but it's Vegas so I wasn't surprised by that. There are so many amazing restaurants to go to in Vegas, I'm glad I came here for the experience, but will try some others next time."}
{"text":"Delicious fish~ fresh and great quality. However small portions and it's pricey. The server seemed irritated that I did not want to order a $300 bottle of sake."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm not a big sushi or cooked fish person. But after visiting this restaurant, I now know how good fish can be. The service was on point, but the seating was a bit uncomfortable. I'm a tall guy and the booths weren't made for a person with my frame. Other than that, I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"In my many years of going out to eat, this was the WORST restaurant I've ever eaten at!   BUYER BEWARE - they will try to SCAM you into an expensive bill!!!!!   My friend and I sat down starving asking for a menu. The waitress asked us if we've ever been there before - to which we answered no. (I'm sure this is where she knew she could get us.) She then tells us that they don't do menus here. She continues by saying their menus are 'vague' and 'hard to understand'. It is her job to find the best items for you on the menu and bring those to you. She starts by pushing 2 sashimi  items and then says she will serve us with a hot dish and then something else (I stopped listening and cut her off). I told her very straight and to the point that we were only interested in rolls. Again....she told us she is bringing us the 2 sashimi. Honest to God, she would not take no for an answer!!! Finally, we agreed because it felt like we were arguing with her and it was putting a damper on our night. We then insisted that we do NOT want the hot menu - we only want rolls. Again, she starts pushing it on us. I've never seen any restaurant so pushy!!! After she brought us the 2 sashimi rolls, I started to panic what the price of these were because something felt shady. Again, I insisted on a menu (for the like 5th time). She brought the menu and the menu was NOT hard to understand or vague - she completely lied to us!!!! And....you will love this....those 2 items were $60 plus tax and tip and we didn't even like them!!! I asked to speak to a manager about this and the manager refused to come over and refused to even reduce the price of these over priced dishes that were forced upon us. We ended up ordering some rolls and I've got to be honest, they were horrible! I'm so perplexed how anyone could give this restaurant a good review? The ambience was below average...food was awful and the service was deceptive - not to mention the prices here were insane!!! Honestly, we felt like we had been scammed! It ruined our night. I really think they know most people eating their are tourists and will never be back. Therefore, I believe they try to scam you into paying for expensive dishes and then once you get the bill, the manager refuses to reduce the price. If you look at previous reviews, other people have gone through something similar. BEWARE!!!   The next evening we went to Koi and OMG...I can't believe the difference!!! They had the most amazing sushi, beautiful ambience and the best service! It was my birthday and they brought over a free cocktail and a free desert. Nobu would have charged us for that - probably double the normal cost!!! In addition, Koi's sushi had all those amazing sauces - where Nobu doesn't believe in sauces - which is part of why their rolls suck!"}
{"text":"Very classy place with great customer service. We came here to eat some sushi and sat at the sushi bar. The food is really good, but very little portions. We basically ordered everything, ha.  We ordered the beef tenderloin, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, shishito peppers, yellowtail jalapeño rolls and the House special roll.  Also topped it off with salmon and tuna tacos, which where excellent!"}
{"text":"Freaking Nobu. It's just so good. Possibly my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Every bite is an explosion of flavors, most of which you've never tasted. However, be prepared to spend at least $100-200 per person. At the very least. Regardless, I keep coming back.   What to order: The signature tasting menu is the best deal at $125 and has more mainstream appeal and tastier options IMO than the daily special for $175, which is for the ultra adventurous aka eating a whole river crab in one bite - shell, claws, eyes and all. Next time I go I'm going to have the waiter help me pick my own custom tasting menu. I think that's the play because you'll get everything you like and nothing you don't like.   Ps: Make reservations"}
{"text":"This is excellent. We went twice during a recent trip to Vegas. Our first visit we were luck enough to sit at the bar and got to watch the sushi masters work! The fish was fresh and delicious, rolls were well balanced and prepared. The service on our first visit certainly left something (okay, a lot) to be desired, however.   Our second visit was better, with a server who was knowledgeable and friendly. Again, high quality, fresh fish, and some great creative rolls. The price is certainly up there, but not the most expensive place for sushi on the strip. We look forward to going back again and trying omakase (chef's choice) - seems to be the best option!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our Christmas dinner here since we spent xmas in Vegas and wanted to go somewhere fancy and dark lol. We did all sushi--it was ok, definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"The service was top notch here! We let our waiter set the menu and he did not disappoint! The Kobe beef was mouth watering! The place definitely lived up to the hype!"}
{"text":"I loved Nobu at Caesar's! We went without a reservation on a Friday night and were seated immediately. Even better...our seat was next to The Weeknd's table (star struck...don't judge me). Our waitress was fantastic. She recommended the Omokaze style dining and the Lychee martini. Yummmmm! Try the Rock Shrimp, Miso Cod, and Jalapeño Tuna roll. To die! Loved Nobu so much that I'm going to the one in Malibu when I get back to Cali."}
{"text":"Did not try the food because the server worked too hard on selling me instead of describe food entrees. He was a nice guy but I wanted to have dinner not a timeshare presentation. Thanx for the water."}
{"text":"Having experienced Nobu in London and New York, we were looking forward to this one, and they did no We had the vegetable tempura as an appetizer, along with miso soup. For our main we had The Black Cod Miso and Sea Bass with a side of rice.......both of the fishes were tender, flavorful and succulent.  For dessert We had The Whiskey??? (Sorry can't remember the full name) would of loved that served in a different container   so to of been able to enjoy all the layers at the same time.  Note, stick to the cocktail menu, for cocktails, the bar staff were not trained  to conjure up cocktails of there own"}
{"text":"We made a reservation and went there on a Friday night, the food was great and novelty, very impressed"}
{"text":"Service is ok for a high priced restaurant. We're very disappointed with the food to be honest. Most 'novel' 'Japanese' dishes are actually Chinese: the salmon sashimi used the same spices and sauce of Chinese steamed fish (????, the wagyu gyoza is EXACTLY Chinese beef potsticker (???even the same sauce and spices. Other than that the rest dishes taste ok but not enlightening."}
{"text":"02/25/2017 I brought my wife and  friends here for dinner before going to the Bon Jovi concert and this place is awesome. The food is delicious from the appetizer to the dessert and of course the cold sake! Not cheap but 100% worth it!!! The service is second to none! Our beautiful server Amber is great !"}
{"text":"Ok food, good service but consistently got the orders wrong. Way over priced. Don't even try and order the wagyu, $75 for a sliver of meat = outrageous!! You are paying for the name and whatever gold digger drags you there."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is dynamic and food is delicious!  I ate the spicy crab, lobster taco, king crab taco, and 2 spicy scallops hand rolls.  A classic whiskey sour for a drink started the meal right.  Service was fantastic.  This was my 2nd visit and I will come back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a  big fan of Asian fusion, but the food at Nobu is superb! This place uses very high quality ingredients and serves really fresh fish.  Recommendations:   -Order things that aren't on their menu! Ask for the specials, most of their decadent food isn't on the regular menu. -Miso marinated black cod, my favorite! It's savory sweet and done perfectly. -Yellow tail with jalapeño, I could seriously eat 10 orders of this.  Don't order the sushi rolls, they aren't anything special and not worth it."}
{"text":"My first and second visits here were hands down 5 stars. The food was delicious and interesting, and the atmosphere was pleasant. My third and possibly last trip was mediocre. They have opened up a new club at the Hard Rock, and the crowd was a bit too loud and lively for a fine dining restaurant. Their foie gras was delicious, but their sushi wasn't as good as previous trips. If I go again, I'm likely to stick to their hot dishes."}
{"text":"In case people don't know, Nobu is the restaurant chain of a chef, Nobu Matsuhisa who has starred on that Food Channel show, \"Iron Chef.\" He has brought the gourmet \"New Japanese\" cuisine to the world. This place is very expensive...but the taste is extraordinary. The Black Cod with miso melts in your mouth. Every dish is a work of culinary art. The service at the Las Vegas restaurant is excellent. They constantly make sure everything is clean, and ready, glasses filled, and your needs are met. The bill for 6 of us was $270 before tip, so this is costly, but not too over-priced. It is definitely an upper echelon restaurant. The Las Vegas venue is situated in the middle of the Hard Rock Hotel and is therefore several decibels too high. If you eat there frequently you are going to lose your hearing. That is why I give it 4 stars. I can imagine this restaurant outside of the Hard Rock Hotel will be more pleasant. If you're in your 20-40's you'll probably give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm still blown away with the dinning experience my friends and family had last night!   Nobu is pretty well-known since so many celebrities love to wine-and-dine here, so I was super excited to have my Vegas experience, especially since we already enjoy going to the Malibu location!  Because this restaurant is SO popular, it's highly recommend to put in a reservation...My brother made reservations for a party of 6, 2 months ago.  After arriving 15 minutes late due to Strip traffic, the restaurant was understanding and still got us seated pretty quick. Our Suhricka was absolutely on point last night and for her customer service alone we want to give 5 stars, thanks girl!   Time to get to the main attraction, the grub. So the idea for this restaurant is to order multiple plates to share amongst the table, tapas style so by the time you leave your comfortably full without feeling too stuffed.  Everything that we ordered last night was ridiculously delicious. Things like yellow-tail, which I normally wouldn't eat, I tried and loved it!  Definitely stepped out of my comfort zone with a lot of the dishes, and I'm so glad I did! Please refer to my many pictures and feel free to hit me up on any further information about a specific dish. Like I said, everything we order was delicious to the starters, main entreès and to dessert, ALL AMAZING!   Book your next dinner here, you will not regret it!  Trust!"}
{"text":"As you read my review, please keep in mind that I don't like Las Vegas, significant dislike for everything about this town - I think it's important to know people's biases...i'm  here for business, and being a fan of sushi, decided to give it a try.    Of all the options on the strip, this is a good place to eat tasty sushi: compared to SF of Oahu, this is just average.  The pro: the fish is very fresh, the service is attentive, good recommendation for the \"specials\" The cons: expensive, the wait is long, and the drinks are rather small for what you pay.  Don't expect to have an deep/quite discussion...the atmosphere is rather night clubby, with a lot of volume.  It's what I expected, in Vegas."}
{"text":"We heart Nobu!!! We just went to Nobu in Vegas last weekend and it was amazing! The food was superb. OMG, very very tasty! We loved the Black Cod, Yellowtail Sashimi w/Jalapeno & Lobster Ceviche'. Every thing our waitress suggested was so yummy. It was orgasmic as my friend kept saying, LOL!  The portion sizes wouldn't be enough for very man guys I know but, for 4 girls it was perfect. It's not a fancy-shmancy restaurant like I thought it was going to be. It's more casual and not to over the top. Love the warm inviting feel of the bamboo décor. We will definitely be going back the next time were in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here for a tasting menu offer.  Was not sure what to expect.  Generous portion, excellent food, incredible service and a great atmosphere.  They also offer $25 corkage.  The sashimi and lobster tempura melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I like Nobu, I really do. But, they seems to be everywhere and now there is a Nobu Hotel in Las Vegas. Huh? And they keep multiplying. It needs to be special and innovative to charge what they charge.   We had the yellowtail and the rock shrimp with a two piece eel appetizer plus some wine and like that...$200 was vacuumed out of my pocket. No huge jolt of holy crap, what did I just eat? No life changing bite of unbelievableness!!! And it should be! Please Nobu, don't become Shake Shack.   The service was ok, just a tad soulless. Kind of all about more and better wine.   The space seems to be smaller and maybe I'm just bigger. It's pretty as they all are, I just want this kind of food to really step up and grab me. Then you can have my dough. I'm easy."}
{"text":"7/2: Nobu Hard Rock rivals Yellowtail @Bellagio as my all-time favorite restaurant. I've been here one previous time and I don't remember much, but nothing bad. I just kept comparing it to my favorite, which is kind of unfair. However, this time was different...very memorable in a good way.   My server Gordon and his waitstaff team's service was amazing! I had the locals tasting menu ($75) and it was worth every penny. Every dish was cordially described in just the right amount of detail before being served. All questions were answered in a friendly manner. The atmosphere was very nice and classy as well. Beautiful decor.   -Kobe Beef Taco (as an appetizer, separate from tasting menu)...best taco ever! beef was soft and moist  -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno (best sashimi i've ever had by far! so soft and fresh. price tag aside, i could go for 10 of these plates! though that might be too much of a good thing) -Tuna Sashimi Salad (love it. best tuna ever)  -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy (best shrimp ever...you're getting the point! i didnt know shrimp could taste this good)  -Black Cod Miso (this and the yellowtail sashimi were my favorite dishes...high praise for these 2 seems to be the trend based off of many reviews. definitely no disagreement here. best fish ever! if you are ordering one item, i highly recommend it)  -Assorted Sushi and Miso Soup (basics but pretty good. large scallops were added to the soup. unique taste and interesting twist compared to standard miso soup. delicious!)  -Dessert (strawberry, vanilla, green tea mochi ice cream)...all were great. not really a complaint, but a variety of desserts is preferred. im sure they would be amazing like everything else as well.  Thank you Nobu, for one of the best dining experiences ever. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nobu was in Las Vegas was delicious, however, I feel like my mother and I were totally taken advantage of. First of all, they charged me for more waygu steak than we actually had--the reason I know this is because I took a video of the steak being lit on fire on the rocks). Also, when I ordered a bottle of wine I thought it was the cheapest on the red wine menu and I told our waiter that, however, somehow I got a $330.00 bottle of wine. He asked why I chose that wine and I said it was because that was the cheapest. Why did he not correct me? At the beginning of dinner we were looking at the chef special priced around $300 each--which we were more than willing to spend, we are foodies and we have no problem spending money on good food. After speaking to our waiter though, he persuaded us to go with a menu that the chef would put together for us. He said that we would get more \"bang for our buck\" and we would get to try more of the menu. He asked us questions and depending on our preferences--that is how the meal was created. Since he said we would get more bang for our buck, we went with this option rather than the $300 chef special. BIG MISTAKE. After a beautiful dinner, we got a bill of $1,300.00. Yes you read that right, $1,300.00 FOR ME AND MY MOTHER. I was full, but not thirteen hundred dollars full. I will never be going back to Nobu and feel we have been totally taken advantage of."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were doing well in the casinos so we decided to treat ourselves to dinner at Nobu! Each of us had been once before at home in Waikiki.   We had no reservations because they were booked, but we were able to walk in and be seated immediately at the Sushi bar.   We decided on the most expensive Omakase (chef's choice) meal. There were  some options for Omakase. You could choose between a pre selected menu by Nobu for $125/pp or the literal Chef's choice for $225/pp. We opted for the $225.   Of course we started with drinks! I chose the Pinot Grigio (they only offer one and it is an Italian wine at $14/glass). My bf opted for the Peanut Bourbon and Jelly which he describes as smooth and slightly sweet.   I can't quite remember every single item we were served but, I took pictures of every course and will try my best to title them respectively!   There were about 6 courses that ranged from 2 pieces to several mini dishes within the course. They also included an ocean salad dish, a foie gras miso soup and dessert. The variety of fish I can rememer we were served were: otoro, Japanese baracuda, and akamutsu. There were different cuts of different grades of fish so there were definitely more than just 3 types. In addition to the salad, soup and several sushi courses we had: Japanese oysters, Maine lobster, and Wagyu (grade 5?).   Although they ask us at the start of the meal if we are on any time constraints, our only gripe was that the time between courses was very long. Our meal lasted about 2.5 hours. We think it was bc we chose the literal Chef's choice not the pre selected chef's choice.  Service was excellent, each time we left the table they refolded our napkins and they were constantly clearing our finished plates and wiping our area clean for the next course. The sushi bar didn't seem like that tight of a squeeze until the woman seated next to me kept bumping me with her purse, elbows, and arms as she spoke very animated with arm gestures. We were able to scoot away from her because there were some empty seats to our right.    All in all, it was my first time trying Omakase and I was completely satisfied. I'd definitely shell out the cash to do it again for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"So disappointed.    I have had many yummy meals at Nobu London so was surprised when the food at this location just didn't live up to standards. The fish was fresh, but badly cut. Seriously?! In a Nobu - badly cut sashimi!  Everything was over-sauced and heavy handed and totally wasn't worth the $600 for three of us (just 1 cocktail each!).   Best thing about the night were the cocktails and the amazing service.   You can do SO much better, Nobu!"}
{"text":"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS..... BLACK COD WITH DRIED MISO LETTUCE WRAPS =FTW!  My family decided to go a bit fancy and tried Nobu at the Hardrock in Las Vegas and I have to say, \"WOW!\"  The food is amazing!    I have learned that at places like these, you know you are going to spend money.  So, why not eat the \"speciality\" things they are known for rather than food you can always get at another restaurant.  So, I ordered the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno, the Salmon Tataki with Cilantro Dressing, Lobster Ceviche, and my FAVORITE THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD= the Black Cod with Miso lettuce wraps!    OMG!  This fish was AMAZING.  I didn't want to stop eating the lettuce wrap and NEVER wanted it to end!   (I know it sounds very sexual but once you have this dish, you too will feel like you had a sexual encounter in your mouth!  -THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!)  I say if you ever have that one night when you want to go fancy while your in Vegas and don't mind spending the money and want a VERY delicious experience, you need to go to Nobu at the Hardrock!    Once again let me say this again!   YOU HAVE TO TRY THE BLACK COD WITH DRIED MISO LETTUCE WRAPS!"}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant, I wouldn't say excellent. We order a tossed salad, good for two people,we also got the Teriyaki Chicken. It was very good, Organic chicKen. It's good enough for two. Lastly my husband got 4 pieces of Tuna Nigiri. The food was good, portions were small but the chicken is good enough for two."}
{"text":"I have been to Nobu at many of their locations.  The Nobu at Hard Rock Cafe Las Vegas is still my favorite. As I do at any Nobu, I ask the waiter to order for us, while I inform him of what type of dishes we prefer most.  I ask for more sashimi, yet, I want to try anything that the chef thinks I must try!  It was a great adventure, and I need to go again on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Service was top notch, everyone knew what they were talking about and knew their food.. by far hands down best sushi I've ever had. You have to try it"}
{"text":"Nobu is on the top of our list for sushi and seafood in Las Vegas. The staff is on point every time and all have been very knowledgeable as to the details of each offering on their menu.  We have several favorite dishes here, however my personal favorite is the dry miso whole Maine lobster, just excellent!! The trout, eel, salmon, and lobster ceviche are at the top of our list as well. Make reservations or you may be relegated to the bar for your meal."}
{"text":"Tasteless apps for 40.00??  40.00!!! And the waiter tries to order FOR you! Joke - who actually eats this??  Priced out of control - even for out of control Vegas of 2018  Nowhere near worth the prices.  One saving grace was the desserts which were creative and tasty - unlike the food."}
{"text":"Nobu definitely qualifies for some of the best sushi I have ever tried. Keep in mind that if you're thinking on ordering your basic California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, etc.. it'll be a waist of your money. Some of the things I tried were the Miso Black Cod, Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño & Barracuda sashimi...all were amazing by the way.  Don't forget to try their saki as well, a bit expensive but worth every penny.  I've eaten here twice and I can see myself coming back for more."}

{"text":"Warning: TL;DR. At last I got to experience the great food that Nobu has to offer! You have no idea how excited I was to try out one of the many Nobu restaurants. And let me tell you this, this was definitely THE best fine dining experiences I have had (And I have been blessed to have quite a few). Yes, it is super expensive. But people, come on, see the Yelp $$$$ sign and go through the menu because they do list prices before you decide to dine here. Expect to pay anywhere between $100-$150 per person.  Our experience was wonderful right from the get go. We had reservations for 2 at 10PM on Saturday, 1/30/16. We planned on dining here after catching a show, but we got out of the show sooner than we expected. Since we were staying at the Nobu hotel, it was convenient to just walk up and ask if they could seat us earlier. Ashley at the front desk was helpful and did get us an earlier reservation and called us about the same. Our table was phenomenal. We got one of the booth like tables, with a view of the bar and virtually every other table. This was perfect for people watching while enjoying our meal ;-) Amber was our assigned waitress for the night. And she definitely contributed to making it great by making recommendations and good ones at that. She wasn't pushy and explained things when we had questions. And we had a few, given that the food at Nobu is a Peruvian Japanese blend. So, it's not just sushi, sashimi and miso based items, they also have tacos with a Japanese influence and ceviche. I also found out that Tiradito is basically a ceviche as well! Nobu doesn't really have very many warm sakes on their menu. They aren't known for their sake. So, if you are a sake connoisseur, head to barMASA instead. We ordered the only warm sake they have to offer. But it did hit the right spot. We also ordered sake based cocktails. I ordered one was with coconut water and my husband with Japanese whiskey (Yamakazi). Unfortunately, the cocktails were unimpressive.   We didn't opt for the Omakase style dinner or the family style dinner. It just seemed like a lot of food for the two of us. If you are a bigger group, you could opt for either one of these. We opted to order off the menu straight. Between the two of us, we tried: Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - This is the BOMB. the Yuzu sauce was perfectly complementing the sashimi. And the sashimi basically just melted in our mouths. Be sure to add a leaf of cilantro on top of the jalapeno and bite it all together. Flavors just burst in your mouth. Shishito Peppers - These are a must order at Nobu. The sesame sauce atop the peppers adds a wonderful flavor. We ordered 2 of these! Scallops with Wasabi pepper - This dish was a bit underwhelming. It's more gravy style and would probably be fantastic with a side of rice. But it is something that I can make at home. Not worth forking the monies on. Uni Nigiri - Having lived in SF and experienced fresh uni here, I had my expectations of what it should be like perfectly set - creamy avocado like without the fishy taste. And I kid you not, the uni at Nobu lived upto my expectations. It was perfect! Order this for sure. Big eye tuna nigiri - My husband ordered a piece of this and it just disappeared. Vegetable tempura - Now I am not a sushi/sashimi snob. But after you've consumed sushi and sashimi with seafood, the vegetable option seems like a downer and a sheer waste of money. But my husband still wanted his veggies. And the tempura here is perfectly fried and not oily at all. Spicy Scallop roll - I didn't taste much spicy or the scallop. The green onion flavor overpowered the rest. It tasted great overall. For dessert, we ordered the fried banana with sesame ice cream. This just hit the spot!  I think more than anything else, what impressed me was the service we received. Everyone from the seating hostess to our waitress to the food servers and the manager on duty, everyone was extremely courteous and very attentive. I do want to check out the other Nobu locations. But overall, we had a great experience and definitely a night to remember!"}
{"text":"[Michelin Star #11]  Night one of my three-day Vegas Michelin dining binge brought me to Nobu.  The occasion:  friend's birthday.    Upon arrival, we were led through a crowded dining room full of boisterous patrons drinking sake and beer to a table at which we were rubbing elbows with the parties around us.  First things first:  this place is not where you want to go for an elegant Japanese meal, but it is perfect for bigger groups.    When our waiter arrived, he took our drink orders, then instead of announcing any specials, he told us that for a group of our size, he \"strongly recommended\" that we do family style.  He said it in a tone that left no other option.  Of course family style makes sense, but it seems to me that an establishment with Nobu's reputation (and Michelin star!) should be far more accommodating to its patrons.  But I do understand that it is likely difficult to navigate one's way through such a crowded restaurant with the myriad of plates that accompany most Japanese meals.  My group opted for the omakase.  We were brought a nice variety of both hot and cold dishes, raw and cooked.  The highlight of the meal was the miso black cod.  The dish was placed in the center of the table, and following this was an unanimous chorus of approval as we each tasted this delectable morsel;  definitely umami.  I also enjoyed the nicely seasoned yellowtail sashimi a great deal, but it wasn't the best yellowtail I've had by far.  The rest of the dishes were less memorable, but still well executed.  The final few courses consisted of rolls whose fish to rice ratio was unreasonably high - yeah, I could tell they were trying to fill me up.    Were I to rate the food alone, Nobu would be a solid four star establishment.  But Nobu is a Michelin rated restaurant, and I'd like to rate it by Michelin standards.  These places, in my experience, don't pack their diners in like sardines, and especially don't have patronizing waiters.  I enjoyed my experience at Nobu, but the enjoyment was more about the company than the restaurant itself.    I've been told that Nobu's other locations are much classier than the one on the Vegas strip.  If that's the case, then shame on those Michelin guys for giving this particular location a star."}
{"text":"I walk in this place and say \"PLEASE do not hand me a menu\". I know it like the back of my hand.  I have been here several times over many years and cannot get enough of the \"new style sashimi\".  I get the white fish and salmon, delish!  Very thin sliced fish served in a warmer than room temperature sesame oil sauce sprinkled with chives. Now it's on to the yellow tail w/ jalapeno peppers.  Melt in your mouth!  Next is the popcorn shrimp, not too breaded, crunchy and that sauce...yum!  Chilean Seabass is next up- buttery, tender and the flavor is indescribable.  Black Cod w/ miso sauce- perhaps my favorite dish. It's done right!  And believe me, I make this at  home, it's hard to find a miso paste that has the right balance so not to over power the fish.  So yeah, this is an expensive place to dine but I am never disappointed.  I am not a big portion person, if you are, you'd hate it or go broke here. I love the quality, care and presentation of every dish here.  Wine list is good and cocktails are imaginative.  Service is always good here and if you don't take my word about the aforementioned menu options, the wait staff is happy to recommend and explain the dishes in great detail."}
{"text":"Best Nobu I've been to in the Nobu family.  I had the omakase which was a true treat. Deducting one star because it was so expensive! Our bill was over $500 for just 2 people but we had some pretty incredible dishes.  The portions were quite big too. I left so full! I highly recommend the omakase - such a fun experience and a great way to try all the best dishes."}
{"text":"Love the service and sushi are melting....heavenly. They took care of me 100%. I walked in, and the server offered a chef choice selection. All I needed to say was how much I wanted to spend. Wow, I am missing this place already:)"}
{"text":"As always, the food at Nobu is fabulous. What wasn't so fabulous was the ambiance of this particular Nobu location. The tables have a plywood look/vibe and the chairs are so uncomfortable. Everything looked worn and tired. Our server was energetic and informative, but the service was beyond slow. We went a half hour between each course! No joke. Those kinds of delays when you are in an uncomfortable seating arrangement make everything so much worse. We won't be back to this Nobu location."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent sushi!!!!!!!!!! Fresh and delicious, recommend sitting at the sushi bar for better service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food here.  We had a table of 6 and did the Chef's Daily Creations, with the Wagyu....   Every single dish that came out was amazing.  We had a large variety of their signature Sashimi dishes, Wagyu beef, Shrimp tempuras, lobsters with truffe and butter.  There was a very large selection and variety brought out.   Everyone was full when we finished.  Our server was outstanding alos, She kept things fun, and the food moving. Everyone had a outstanding meal and enjoyed it fully."}
{"text":"We ordered our food Omakase, with very satisfying results. We were served several sashimi dishes, a tasty sushi platter which included blue fin tuna, a very rare ribeye steak in a sweet and spicy sauce and quite posibly the best black codfish I have ever had. Desert consisted of a shaved Figi ice covered in various fruits and almond ice cream. The resturant had a pleasant atmosphere and a friendly staff"}
{"text":"Stupid expensive. Completely overpriced. $22 for one piece of toro. $60 for a lobster salad. Dinner for 4 with NO alcohol $900. Never again."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time of day, but the overall fare was too salty for my tastes... The black Miso Cod was good, but much of the remainder left a rather neutral impression.  Particularly unsatisfying was an order of crab sautee.  Salty, heavy and indelicate, I cannot offer this place high marks.  Better were the sashimi selections.  Again, my primary complaint was that it still seemed like the flavours were heavy handed."}
{"text":"Ok, so if you know me, you know i love NOBU!  It is a small place, the wait staff all look like rock stars, even if they are faking sexy accents (I swear the last waiter I had went from Spanish to Brazilian to Puerto Rican throughout the course of the meal, but he was hot, so I didnt mind) anyway, as I said about the Malibu Location and the San Diego Location and the LA Location.. my recommendations are:      * NoBu Ceviche Tacos      * Yellowfin Tuna With Spicy Miso Chips      * Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno  and pair with Conundrum if they have it... or sake.. YUM"}
{"text":"Our waiter hooked us up with recommendations. One of the best meals I've ever had in my life. Plus we sat at table right across from the man himself Chef Matsuhisa!! Very well done Nobu and staff I'll be coming back in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I gamble at the Hard Rock pretty frequently so have been afforded a number of comps here. It's definitely better than your run-of-the-mill sushi joints with a bunch of Americanized rolls but others have really stepped up their high end sushi game (e.g., the Nobu at Caesars, Blue Ribbon at Cosmo, Kabuto on Spring Mountain, etc.) which has left Nobu just average among that set. Certainly if you're in the area and have a comp (or a business account) you could do much worse but that shouldn't go your go-to high end sushi place anymore."}
{"text":"Oh My! I need to extend my next stay in Vegas! I am not sure just one meal here will be enough... We arrived a little early and decided to try some drinks at the bar, that was a good idea! The drinks were innovative and our bartender was fast and friendly and a good football fan, can't go wrong with that!  I had asked for a more intimate table and they honored our request which i really appreciated. We had an excellent server who suggested we try a menu that he would put together for us (I think it was $170/p??) and it was absolutely fantastic. He interviewed us first on what kind of dinner we were hoping to experience, our favorite flavors, how willing we were to try something new etcetera. And after that the courses just kept coming. Not one of them where anything but a gourmet dream. The yellowtail sashimi was one of our favorites, oh no wait the Rock shrimp was unbeatable, or actually I will go with Wagyu Gyoza to be the one dish you h a v e to have when you go here. Because going here you should! Usually Im pretty good at taking picture proof of my reviews but looking back at my phone i realize I was just too busy eating..."}
{"text":"Top notch, every time. The sashimi is always fresh. I have gotten the seafood ceviche three times now and it has been consistent in its taste, quality, and presentation. Service is on point, my water was refilled pretty much after every sip. You wouldn't think fish would be good and fresh in the middle of the desert, but it really is!"}
{"text":"Omakase - let the chef blow your senses. We ate items that weren't on the menu!  Fish couldn't be any more fresh.  Meat dish was better than any Kobe I've ever eaten.  The sake...order most expensive bottle, ridiculously smooth and only made for Nobu.  Service was exceptional besides the fact they were all hot!  I'll be back, I know I will!"}
{"text":"One of best meals I've had in my life. Pricey but worth it. Soooo worth it. I will go back again when I win money in casinos!"}
{"text":"Nobu in Caesars Palace offers an intimate setting with great service. I came here for a special wine pairing dinner. The food and the service was stellar. I enjoyed the cod and the sauce; that was one memorable dish.The Lychee Martini prior to dinner tasted great too. All the dishes were spectacular! I am not a wine expert by any means, but the Japanese wines were just o.k and not amazing. Overall, great and unique Japanese cuisine in an intimate environment."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Its a japanese with peruvian influences cuisine. Everything was very fresh and the squid pasta ( no pasta in the dish) is something to die for. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This is a review of the groupon deal dinner.  The Skinny: fusion Peruvian Japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the Groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. So you can imagine what I have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).  So here's the deal. We spotted the Nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".  We went and were seated prompty. Our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. We ended up getting in addition to the prix fixe an order of their vegetable tempura to round out the menu. The specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so I passed on those.  Starting with some simple edamame with Maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.  Course 1) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. Although I have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. My only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.  Course 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. I was despondent when I realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.  Course 3) rock shrimp tempura: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. I think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. Flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.  Course 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! Overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. I have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.  Course 5) vegetable tempura (added to the Groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. The batter was slightly spongier than what I like. I think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could add as much/little we wanted.  Course 6) normally this would be mochi ice cream except it was my birthday so I got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea ice cream. All of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.  Perhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. However time has made his dishes appear quite dated. The signature dishes of rock shrimp tempura/yellowtail jalapeño sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. Given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, I cannot recommend this place given the Groupon price let alone full price. Although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review."}
{"text":"First of all, expect to pay a high price for the \"hype\" but nothing more! I had the lobster taco which tasted nothing like a lobster but more like a chicken?!!! and ya you're paying $9 for a finger size taco per piece. I also had a spicy tuna roll which to be honest tasted like the ones you get from a grocery! ended my meal with their most popular dessert, the vanilla miso tart... well nothing special it was fine!   save your money for a better place!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, but we don't recommend going hungry, unless your company is paying for it.  Presentation of the food was beautiful and the flavors amazing.  Barbie portions were under whelming.   Our waiter was snobby and pretentious.  The tables were a little to close, with us hearing the  conversation of the \"gentlemen\"  at the next table. Manners needed work and less alcohol.  Patrons aside, it is a beautiful restaurant with stunning dishes, just incredibly expensive."}
{"text":"The food was creative and very high quality. It was executed and presented beautifully. The service was very precise. Overall a tremendous experience.  I enjoyed the subtle yet poignant latin influence. It can be a bit pricey, but I believe it's one of the top restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Cod was good as expected but other dishes paled in comparison to NYC. beef dumplings were not worth the high ticket price"}
{"text":"It pains me to score this so low, but our server Dave, made the whole experience bad. Rude, uninterested and absent during our meal. Was a complete child when we asked for a split bill.   The food is legit, Dave just sucks. ..."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. Better than I expected. Came here with my boyfriend on a weekend trip to Vegas and I would definitely come again.   We had never been to Nobu before so we just asked our waiter to recommend dishes for us. This turned out to be the best idea because the things he recommended were bomb.com.   Must tries:   -Yellowtail w/ jalapeno -Black cod w/ miso -Japanese red snapper Dry Miso  -One of their Signature Dishes - forgot the name, but you can see the pictures on their website... they were like 5 pieces of medium sliced tender beef things accompanied w/ peruvian potatoes and topped with a tasty sauce.   On the $$$ side, but honestly if you try the right things, it's worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and another couple of cool people went to Nobu before the Queensryche/Scorpions concert.  What an AMAZING Experience or Culinary Art. Tara and Thom ordered the $125 \"Nobu Signatures\" that's where our server asked some questions and proceeded to bring them smaller servings of (some of their) Signature dishes.  First for them. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño* (and recommended cilantro leaves). I stole a piece and OMG!!  I lost track of some, but another highlight was Pepper Crusted Black Cod. I've never liked cod before, but this was special. The char was perfect. I had the best mushroom soup and Tenderloin of Beef* cooked perfectly. Eating pre-sliced steak with chop sticks is classy.  Anne had the Organic Chicken and we both chose the Anticucho sauce as the marinade. Stick licking good.  Bottom line is this place is Fantastic. The service is exceptional. A swarm of friendly team players keep you over satisfied. We had a meal that we will never forget with great friends.   Thank you Nobu"}
{"text":"Ok I admit there is a lot of hype around this restaurant and after trying it out at LA I can say I wasn't too impressed. BUT I decided to give this another try in Vegas and man am I glad I did!!  We were a group of 4 and quite hungry. Kind of a bad mix as you're walking into a notoriously expensive japanese/sushi resto. Now if you're going to dine here this is how you do it.  Don't waste your time ordering a la carte. Give your knowledgeable server a maximum $ amount per head and let him design the menu for you. We were ready to shell out a bit and spend about $100 each excluding alcohol which in the end was the perfect amount to leave completely satisfied. You can tell him a few things for direction (like we had to have the miso cod!) but let him bring out dish after mind blowing dish and you just sit back and enjoy your company. They carefully explain everything that is brought out and whats great is because you are eating the exact same things you get to share in the same experience.   We also ordered a 60 ounce bottle of Sake and ordering drinks was also something we didn't have to think about for the rest of the night. Our glasses were constantly refilled until the end of our meal and it actually was the perfect amount of drinks for the entire meal which lasted about 2 hours in total....  I can't say we had one thing that wasn't absolutely delicious and unique!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Wow, I must say this is the best sushi I've EVER had in Vegas and I'm a pretty tenured sushi eater.  The quality of fish here is phenomenal!  You get that melt-in-your-mouth sensation with every bite.  It is pricey, but SO worth it.  I found a groupon for dinner for 2 for only $99.  What a steal!  I highly recommend buying that option if you are curious to try the best sushi in Vegas for a good price.  My favorites on the groupon menu were the yellowtail/jalapeno sashimi and the salmon nigiri.. Mmmm."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Nobu.  My favorite location is still in Malibu - but I've been to the locations in NY, both Vegas locations, Bahamas, Malibu, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Diego. My dream still includes hitting the Tokyo Nobu and the Monte Carlo Nobu...  This location is new - anytime I was in Vegas, I would hit the Hard Rock location and it was awesome. It's smaller, more intimate in nature and the servers are hot and usually have accents.. (a plus)  This location is great for larger parties though, we had 60 people in our group and they had a room that accommodated us nicely.  Huge round tables with \"lazy susans\" were situated in partiality secluded nooks that were open to the center of the room where more rounds and one long table were setup. This allowed us all to move around and mingle but kept the over all noise level down. It was both a big party and an intimate one.   They also have a dining room for dates and small groups that has some great nooks and intimate little areas to talk and be with that special someone over some sake and sashimi..  The bar is very cool and they have some awesome cocktails to try. I had something I  loved but unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of it.. it has an orchid on it though and is served in a martini glass.. so describe that if you love sweet drinks with a little bite!  My favorites remain the same:  Yellow tail with japapeno Black cod Sashimi Tacos and the Kobe on a hot rock  See you there!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it very much. They took me on a culinary journey of flavors. Definitely a big treat eating here.  Nobu sidecar, I still think about it.  I wish more restaurants would employ an omakase menu.  Sit down, and let me feed you my best.  That way you can experience things that you never thought you would try.  Everything was excellent, sushi, sashimi, wagyu ...  I am salivating."}
{"text":"Place was clean. Wait staff was attentive. Ambiance was beautiful and sushi/ other food was okay but way overpriced for the value. We ordered the steak waggu and lobster tacos but I'm sorry they were not tacos. They were bite size nibblets for whatever a taco was supposed to be there . And $9 and $7 a pop I expect a taco not a cheese it-yes that's about the size of our tacos!! Sushi was fresh but again it was average nothing over the top. Nothing to write home about. We also ordered the chicken skewers -they were okay but it was bite size ... not worth the value!"}
{"text":"Trying to find a good restaurant to dine in, in Vegas was tough because there so many to choose from. So my brother suggested to try Nobu inside Caesars palace, and it was a great experience for us. We got the course as we like to try the chef's specialty and it was very delicious especially their wagyu beef very juicy. The plating was very creative and the staff member we're very nice and helpful. Would love to try their locations in Malibu according to my brother it a nice place with an amazing view by the ocean. If you like fine dining like me it's a must try."}
{"text":"I was really excited for my reservation at Nobu during my last trip to Vegas.  I eat sushi about three times a week, and I was amped to eat the best of the best!    I was sat at the sushi bar.  It took over 15 minutes for anyone to come and give me a menu, and then I was left again for an absurd amount of time before my drink order was taken.  The \"supervisor\" at the sushi bar kept having to pull random waiters to come take my order throughout the night.  Needless to say, the service left much to be desired, although I will say all the waiters, when they did eventually come,  were very nice.  The next disappointment was the fact that I ordered a sashimi platter.  I expected a beautiful plate of fresh fish that tasted as good as it looked.  Honestly, the presentation was nothing beyond anything I would get here in Chicago, and the taste was fine, but definitely not anything I would put above my other favorite sushi restaurants.    Struggling with the fact I was not satisfied with my sashimi, I ordered the mushroom soup.  That was very good with many different earthy mushrooms in a clear broth.  I did like this.  Still not sent over the moon though, I asked the waiter for a recommendation for a hot dish.  He recommended the king crab tempura.  It was good, however the sauce was extremely overbearing with acidity and it is presented that the crab is sitting in the sauce so there is not much control over how much you can use.    Overall, I was disappointed with not only the food I received, but it was extremely overpriced.  Not to mention I spent way more than I intended just trying to find something to make my experience what I expected!  Maybe I ordered wrong, or I caught them on a bad night, but this is the taste I was left with."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner here during my girls weekend in Las Vegas. The service is very good. The servers pay attention and my water was never left empty (which doesn't happen most of the time). The lychee martini was very good, the alcohol was not overpowering with just the right amount of lychee juice. We ordered:  1.  the oyster shooters--- my first time trying this dish and it went down so smooth.  2. Yellowtail with jalapeno- fish was very fresh and the sauce was light and flavorful. This was very good!  3. Steamed Cod- This tasted just like sea bass. The fish was fresh and very meaty. Lots of flavor and very moist. It was garnished with pickled ginger- this was the best ginger I have ever had!  4. Steamed Seabass- After trying the cod, the seabass did not compare. It was served in a bowl with a soy based sauce- garnished with enoki mushrooms and bok choy. I didn't really care for the sauce. I felt that it took away from the flavor of the fish.   Overall, the food was very good. Would be a place I would go back to again on future visits to Las Vegas. If I had to recommend one item on the menu from what we ordered, it would be the Steamed cod."}
{"text":"The only reason for the one star is that the greeting staff was quite pleasant and was able to get us seated right away but that's where the experience went from good to quite crappy, the waitress was stuck up and snobby , and It got even worse when we decided that we did not do the recommended Family style dining and then her cocky attitude just turned annoying when we asked her to split the bill in half and she refused.(come to find out it was so she would get her set gratuity for parties over six even though she sucked as a waitress) then we ordered and the food was ok but EXTREMELY small and overpriced ,a just a heads up go here full or you will leave hungry like we did ,after a $600 bill for 7 people we went to white castle spent $25 more and the food was better and friendly service ..."}
{"text":"Fun, unique atmosphere! I loved the lychee martinis and variety of sushi rolls. It's important to make reservations for this place or expect at least a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Nobu = sushi heaven!!! Went to dinner at this Cesar Palace resturant with 9 coworks. We opted for the chef's choice dinner and it was freaking amazing! 7 courses selected by the chef. My personal favorite was the yellow tail sashimi in ponzu sauce and jalapeños. The fish was so tender, it melted in my mouth. There's a reason Nobu is a sushi lovers mecha, but expect to spend at least $125 a person."}
{"text":"Came to this location around my birthday, and was not that impressed with all the rave reviews I have heard, and read about the place. Situated in the Hard Rock Hotel, on a night there were more industry people here from a convention drinking up beers and having what I deem fusion food.   One of the dishes that stood out, tempura uni, as it was definitely interesting on the menu, and the price was about right, until it came to the table as one piece, and the rest was vegetable bits. I know you are supposed to be high end, but don't tease that way. And uni should only be eaten raw and fresh, as it was a waste to deep fry this sucker, and practically turn it to goo.  I felt like I was at a bar & grill then I was in a high end restaurant the day I was here, as it felt like an \"industry night\". The dishes that came to our table were nicely presented, for the price your paying, I guess some art work must be done to the plate to be able to charge you.  It is an experience, and maybe I was here on an off day. Harder to get to as it is off the strip."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals my fiance and I have ever had!  We dined here for a combo celebration - our engagement and my birthday, and the experience was PERFECT!  Sarika, our server, was attentive, knowledgeable, and totally on top of everything.  Neither of us had dined at a Nobu before, so outside of our knowledge of standard sushi rolls, this was a completely new culinary experience for us.  Sarika guided us with everything, accommodated our dietary restrictions, and ensured we stuck to our budget and time (we wanted to thoroughly enjoy our dinner but also had a show to catch afterward).   The food was absolutely delicious, and the cucumber martini was the perfect accompaniment - all of the seafood was so fresh, the sequence of dishes presented was perfectly balanced, and we left super full (which can be tough to do when it comes to tasting menus/tapas style menus).   The service was also incredible.  Sarika was the best, but so were the several other people who ensured every detail was accounted for from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.   For anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or just a reason to splurge, Nobu will NOT disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding and that extends beyond the food.  A large group with several people having sushi for the first time and 4-5 with dietary restrictions.  Our server at this dinner in late June (Andrew I think) was superb.  He managed to help me craft a meal to meet the tastes and needs of everyone and also the price point that our group wanted.  In short the wonderful food was matched by the strong effort to please a less than easy table to manage.  I've visited another Nobu location and the strong reputation is earned in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok, it's cheesy of me writing the 278th review of this place, but it really is worth it. If you like sushi and unique infused vodka and shots, this is a wonderful place for respite while in Vegas. We went her on the bachelorette party, all loved their food, staff bought us a round, decor was chic! A great experience."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of that new style sashimi!  We ordered the ama ebi version and the ama ebis just melted in your mouth... I am still thinking about it.  They only get 4 stars because we had a late seating (only time available) and they wouldn't serve us the omakase anymore.  I had been to Nobu in NYC twice before and in my view, omakase is the only way to go when eating at Nobu."}
{"text":"WOW!! Absolutely amazing. Bar none this place is outstanding. The Tazmanian Sea Trout is the best in the world!"}
{"text":"the black miso cod got me. i loveeeeeee it. the ambiance was beautiful. i wish i came more hungry to try everything else. BUT OMG their flourless chocolate molten cake with the green tea ice cream (bento box) TOPPED the night. the best i've ever had. i wish i didnt have to share it with two other girls....hehe.  I would def be back here in the near future."}
{"text":"One word: DELICIOUS.  Honestly, what more can I say that hasn't already been said.  Go. It's incredible. Fresh. Delicious. Amazing. I left full and very, very happy. :)"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Japanese restaurants we've tried! it's distinctly Japanese and playfully modern as well!, all around delicious with a friendly & helpful staff!"}
{"text":"No offense to anyone but this is the most overrated and overpriced sushi place I've ever been to. I've had better sushi from Costco."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I'm a sushi convert but when we saw this travel zoo deal - 7 course deluxe menu - for $159 we knew we had to jump!  I wish I'd gotten our waiter's name because he was phenomenal - really enhanced the visit to unforgettable.  The food was insanely good. Meats like butter, roll and pieces innovative and delightful, mushrooms fragrant and cooked through, and the dessert - don't even get me started. We spent a bit extra and tried all three pieces that made Chef Nobu famous and indulged in some Japanese craft beer as well.I can't for the life of me use chopsticks (better half a pro) so I was embarrassed to ask for a fork but he was totally cool about it, unlike some ramen places in Austin, TX.  Lovely atmosphere, lovely waitstaff, amazing food.  (plus I got engaged here so yay! They gave us special truffles and keepsake rocks that hold the chopsticks.)"}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day Sunday and everything was EXCELLENT! We had the 6 course meal for 2 and each plate was better than the last! I don't really know what the heck we ordered but everything was great. The Lychee Martini was so good we ended up ordered 4 drinks each. Unfortunately due to the \"sauce\" I forgot our servers name but he was awesome, I know he was a Vegas native though."}
{"text":"Just had my birthday dinner here and I couldn't wait to get back in my car to write this review.  This is my 4th time at Nobu we always had a great experience with both food & service but today the server was just HORRIBLE!!!  I never order off menu because I usually get experienced servers that recommend dishes to my party. Today On my Birthday I expected the same type of  treatment.  Our server seemed annoyed when he spoke to my party when I asked him to recommend something special off he recommended. Eel roll, crab roll..... I kept asking him to recommend specials I wanted more effort from Him I obviously sound like I know how to eat and that's the shit you recommend me? I even placed an order for toro & black truffle carpaccio to give him an idea of the kind of palette we have. He was obviously did not know the menu well himself & had a bad attitude about it.  The food was good as usual. I really enjoyed the toro with black truffle but then he turned us off by telling us it was from a can. Service is everything & Columbia (servers name?) really killed our mood tonight. For a $900 dinner including tax & tip  I expect nothing less than EXCELLENT food & service. I Myself have almost 20years in f&b experience and over a decade in hospitality industry and today SADLY Nobu did NOT deliver. We all left unsatisfied and honestly a little upset. On the receipt it says our servers name was \"Columbia\" I probably won't be back again unless Nobu Changes up the menu & comes up with different dishes with more variety & hires more  experienced polite servers and may I also mention my parents are 7 star elite members for Cesars...."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious!  The first time I went to a Sushi Place and didn't have any rolls or rice!  We didn't order but had the waiter bring out their best dishes and everything was absolutely amazing!  The cod wraps and crab and rockshrimp were my favorite as well as their signature yellowtail and jalapeno dish.  They put together a spread of their desserts, so got a little taste of everything.  Oh and had the best Riesling ever!  I will post pictures of their best dishes!  And even though the chef was busy, he did come out to greet us which was really nice!  I would highly recommend and want to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food!  We were seated immediately (we made a reservation early in advance because this place packs quickly after it opens at 5pm) and our waiter was very friendly and informative. He patiently explained all of the menu items, and seemed genuinely interested in helping us pick the best foods on the menu.   My family is all very picky, but all of us walked away extremely satisfied. The Black Miso Cod is possibly the best fish I've ever had in my entire life -- so moist and flavorful. I also truly enjoyed the salmon skin sushi roll and the bento box dessert.   This is an expensive restaurant, but I would highly recommend if you're looking to treat yourself."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about my experience at Nobu at Caesars palace and I think the entire group I was with would agree.  We came in for a bachelorette party on a Saturday night.  Our table decided to trust the fate of our entire meal in our servers hands, which did not disappoint.  I think it was around $115/person but our group loved every single dish we were served.  The drinks were also good.  I wish I remembered our servers name so I could give him credit, he was awesome!  He also told us a Chicago location was coming soon so looking forward to my next visit to Nobu when it becomes local for me!"}
{"text":"Sucked!!!!   Honestly I don't remember how the food was. THIS WAS ONE OF THE LOUDEST PLACES I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!!!   That's no joke, a very unpleasant experience. When we were there, you could either yell, or not talk at all. I think you can only imagine what I did, I only talked when I placed my order. I'm so glad when we left this place. I'm not a big fan of Vegas, we went here one night when staying in Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went for the $95 5-course Groupon.    Restaurant decor and ambiance were beautiful.  The drunk guy passed out on the table next to us provided some decent entertainment until he was escorted out.   The first two courses were delicious...simple sashimi and sushi samples.  Excellent quality fish.  The much raved-about rock shrimp and black cod courses were pretty disappointing.  The shrimp was slathered in a mayonnaise-y sauce that probably should've been a side dipping sauce.  So creamy.  Too creamy.  Took all the finesse out of what could've been a delicated, beautiful shrimp dish.  However, if you love mayonnaise.  Then you'll like it.   The miso cod was good for a bite or two...but then was just too sweet.  Almost sweeter than the dessert that followed...which was pretty yummy.    So overall, it was OK.  If you want good quality and a full stomach for a decent price, I'd rather go to Wicked Spoon, Bachannal, or one of the other higher-end buffets."}
{"text":"Five star service with three star food...overall, I am still a fan. Heather provided some of the best service we have ever had...even though we basically closed the place, she cheerfully took the time to answer all our questions, provided amazingly attentive service, didn't rush us, and pretty much made our day. We didn't even order any booze.  We had the $125 omakase dinner...Heather arranged it so that one of the courses would be the Wagyu course (ordinarily $38!!! an ounce). The food was for the most part OK...I guess I can't really taste the difference between regular neighborhood sushi and that from fish that flew first class from Japan in a Louis Vuitton tank, and presumably was massaged, fed first growth Bordeuxs and truffles and foie gras. I mean, holy moly, that sushi was expensive! And, it must be said, one course was probably the least plesant thing I have ever put in my mouth...I'll pause here to let that sink in a minute. The halibut sashimi had raw okra...wow...who was the genius that decided to use raw okra??? Have they ever tasted that??? One bite and I could feel my mouth fill with mucous (from the mucin in the okra)...the more I chewed the more mucous was produced...ugggh. It felt like some hocked a loogie in my mouth. I literally could not swallow this...I had to take a big swig of water just to get it down my throat. Whew!  After surviving this, we were served Nobu's signature Miso Roasted Black Cod...this was the first time I had tasted this iconic dish, though I have had plenty of imitators. I actually felt that it was undercooked, as it was still translucent, and a touch too sweet. The biggest disappointment was that my \"fillet\" was loaded with bones. The second disappointment was that about one minute after the cod came out, they brought out the wagyu tataki. Since this was basically the price of gold and was cooking its way to oblivion on the hot stones, we had to switch our attention to the beef. Now this was amazing...having never had true Japanese Wagyu before, I was surprised at how much it tasted like foie gras...literally melting in my mouth. Now THIS was well worth the cost.  The miso soup tasted like, well, miso soup. The desert had green tea ice cream and a bitter chocolate cake...it was kind of...gross.  The shock we received was when we received our check...Heather had comp'd our Wagyu. She explained that she had noticed that I had picked aside a lot of bones in my cod, and that my wife didn't even have a chance to eat much of hers because the Wagyu was brought out too early. We hadn't even mentioned anything, but Heather had noticed and taken care of it. Wow...I was speechless. This was going above and beyond.  Overall, I  found the decor and setting to be wonderfully elegant, in a Japanese minimalist sort of way. What was surprising was that the service was not stuffy or pompous in any way. In a way, this was the best \"bargain\" of our trip!"}
{"text":"Ok, that was such a good meal. This is what great food is supposed to taste like. Everything I ate was 3 dimensional-full of multiple flavors.   Get the tacos-any one of them- they are all phenomenal! The sushi and yellow tail tuna was surprisingly excellent (I usually don't like raw fish-at all).   Come and eat here soon and enjoy a one-of-a-kind experience!"}
{"text":"Hubby's review is 2 stars.  Here's what he has to say....  Food was slightly better than ok.   Prices were too fucking expensive!   Would never go back.     Here's what I have to say....3.5 stars  I'm a lot more wordy than hubby so get ready....  Our waiter was snooty.  The prices are beyond outrageous.  The menu was extremely complicated.  I am no Japanese dining expert, but I've eaten at my fair share of Japanese restaurants from fine dining to hole in the wall and for the life of me I could not figure out how to order off of this menu...even after asking the waiter a barage of questions.  It didn't help that we were dining with 2 other couples, one of which did not want to be there, and half of the other couple didn't even like Japanese food...don't ask.  I digress.    The food we did figure out how to order was pretty damn good.  The rolls were good, the tuna sashimi fresh and delicious, the tempura was cooked perfectly....and the chili beef and teryiaki chicken all very good.    But the 2 best parts about Nobu for me were the Belini Martini's (I had two to kick off my night of martinis) and the Bento Box dessert.  The dessert was absolutely heavenly.  A flourless chocolate cake filled with a warm ooozy chocolate sauce topped with fresh raspberries and served with a scoop of green tea ice cream, it was one of the best desserts I have ever had!    It's too bad hubby says he won't go back. I think if we had ordered differently and accepted the fact that it costs a small fortune to dine here, we might get to a good solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Over priced food that is just totally made up. Considering who amd what Nobu is, this place is truely a disappointment. Service in general is okay but food comes out in the strangest order.  The 2 times ive been here ive had my order arrive last and everyone is waiting in me. Considering what i order should come first, its amazing how im last to get any food.  My most recent visit i had an order of miso soup which i had to asl for 4 times and didnt arrive until we paid the bill.  Dont be fooled by the name. This place is certainly low standard versus any other high cost food place.  The food itself is nothing special and looks rushed as if the kitchen just cares about turning food out."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here, it's fun and delicious. One of the top reasons I want to go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"First off, I must say that the waiters and staff were freaken awesome. Our waiter was super cool and friendly. I liked how with every dish that came out, our waiter would explain what was in it.  I would recommend sticking with the sushi. Hubby and I got the Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki along with our sushi, and for something to be like $44-55 I would expect it to me amazing, but the dish was alright.   GET THE BENTO BOX for dessert. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"There's a Groupon for Nobu?!! Whaaaat!?! Yes, believe it! I had purchased a Groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. And my BF was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. It was actually perfect timing that this Groupon became available because I was going to be in Vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* Anyways, I made reservations for 2 at 6PM online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. The Groupon can only be used at the Nobu inside the Hard Rock hotel. There's also a Nobu inside Caeser's Palace. Once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in Japanese! The decor inside was really nice and elegant. I really liked the bamboo wall they had. I also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder.   Ok onto the food! So we started off with some edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. Next came the best sashimi I had ever had in my life! Its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. The flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. Yumm!!! I can probably eat like five more of that dish. :P The next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the shrimp tempura. I was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at Japanese restaurants. The dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. It was rich and creamy. And the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. Next came their black cod dish. My BF absolutely loved this one and I can see why. It was so flakey and cooked to perfection. The fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. Next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. This dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. But it was still tasty. And lastly we got our dessert! It was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. OMG...so good!!! The green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. The cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 desserts because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. The chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. Overall, everything we tried was excellent! The reason why I subtracted 1 star was because both my BF and I felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. Otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. I'm so happy to get to try Nobu for the first time! =) So go get your Groupon, while it's still available peeps!!"}
{"text":"Nobu is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to get Japanese cuisine.  I've been here several times (Dinner, after hours/ Lounge hours) and each time was spectacular. Call us crazy but we went here after having a large dinner elsewhere.. we always make sure to squeeze in a \"second dinner\" when in Vegas. Why not right? They had a prix fixe type tasting menu tempting us but we were way too full from our \"first dinner\".  What I've ordered at Nobu (for two):  -Nobu's Sashimi Bar (We opted for the 4 pieces option for $45..worth it!) (Choose Three or Four of the Following): Tai Dry Miso, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Fluke Tiradito, Salmon New Style, Sashimi Salad, Albacore Umami Sashimi, Kumomoto Nobu Salsa  -Nobu 'Takumi' Burgers Truffle Aioli, Crispy Shiitake,Onion & Foie Gras $18 each (Delicious, but small, almost like a slider. However, we both thoroughly enjoyed ours.)  -Nigiri (5 pc.) Chef's Selection $30  -Sashimi Moriawase Chef's Selection (5pc) $30  -Soft Shell Crab Roll (Masago & Avocado) $16 (We added another order.. simple but good!)  -House Special Roll; Mixed Fish $17 (So simply, yet so delicious!! We ordered three orders of this roll.. Yum!)S  -Spicy Tuna Roll (Tuna, Scallions, Creamy Sauce) $12  -Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head (Ama Ebi) $8 (Had to add another order!)  -Shrimp Tempura Roll $12  -Salmon Roll $9  -Dessert - I can't remember what we had, but I know we enjoyed it even after being stuffed.  I really should start writing down what I order because I always find myself forgetting a few when I do my reviews...  Overall, the food is up to par in my honest opinion. We always get seated very quickly, the vibe is fun, the food is delicious, and the service is great. I can't wait until we go back...."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi! Delicious (but strong) cocktails. Comprared to the rest of the Hard Rock Hotel, this restaurant felt like a clean oasis.   Although there wasn't an official GF menu, our server was aware of every item on the menu that would be ok and also brought me a side of gluten free soy sauce.  We paid an uber fare to venture off the strip just to try the sushi here, which I cannot say I would be willing to do again since Koi on the strip is so good too, but it's definitely a good option."}
{"text":"It's my birthday and I figured I would treat myself to World Famous Nobu.   I asked to sit at the bar. Out of numerous seats open along the bar, the server decides to sit me at probably the worst seat in the entire restaurant...right next to the servers entrance. Ugh! Servers standing outside staring at me eat, constantly people walking behind me, can hear conversations of servers standing inside. No bueno.  Next, the price. Oh wow. Triple the price of the place I went just the other day in marina del Rey and I guarantee it's more fresh. This fish tasted frozen and thawed. Absolutely unacceptable if you are charging 25-30 for a single roll.   I guess I had my personall chef but the guy could hardly speak and I'm sorry, I'm the customer. I'm not going to force myself to speak Spanish. The chef and the server were disagreeing on ingredients, too. That's a bad sign.   No one seemed to have any personality. Everyone is so rushed to get things out, I would rather them take their time and get it right then to rush a 60 dollar meal. But, for some reason there's 9 chefs right in front of me with time to look and stare at me when I eat. Ugh ugh ugh.   I could go on but there's just too much.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Possibly the best dinner experience of my life!. Ambiance decor food and service was perfection...everything we ordered came out quickly and our waiter anticipated all our needs. This is just a must try when in vegas!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try their Omakase dinner...they had two tiers.  $100 & $150...(i believe those were the choices, but i could be wrong).  We chose the $100 tier and I'd have to say it was quite impressive.  Granted, I may not have been sober enough to give you all a FULL and indepth description of each dish (there were about 7 dishes all together), but from what I recalled...each dish was exquisite.  We also had other friends who had ordered a la carte dishes and they were not disappointed either.  I'd say, if you're ever in the mood to splurge for a night of good Japanese cuisine...come and check out Nobu.  They don't fall short of \"delish\""}
{"text":"We have heard rave reviews for Nobu and we have a favorite Japanese restaurant that we love in Philly back home (Double Knot). While the food was very good it wasn't as good as back home. The server gave some great recommendations and we enjoyed everything. The cocktails were amazing."}
{"text":"We've had some fantastic meals here.  I personally think the food, atmosphere, and service are spot on and well worth it (sadly, especially compared to the Nobu in our hometown of San Diego).  Couple stories:  Last weekend I dropped one of my chopsticks accidentally.  No joke, in less than 30 seconds not one but two waiters were there, each with a replacement set.  I think they actually heard it fall rather than saw it.  It was so slick and fast we were genuinely a little stunned.  And my wife had a cough.  So a cup of green tea was sent out in case she wanted it \"to soothe her throat.\"  Sweet touch, and impeccable service."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5, I was expecting a lot from this place but nothing wowed me. We had a party of six and picked the $225 per person omakase.  The service here is awesome you can order each dish as you would like or tell them what you like it/give them a price range and they will bring whatever they think you will like best. I was very full by the end of the meal could barely eat the last couple dishes. I also like that there are hot dishes and cold dishes. My favorite thing there was the carpaccio so yummy! At the end of the days good food great sake but it was expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"15 years ago I went to nobu in Malibu and I had a good memory of the place.. tonight with a lots of expectations I went to try the omakase.. to be truthful was a mistake since sushi was very regular and without any chefs creativity as far as preparing goes.. we dropped 400 .00 for two people and left unhappy!! If you compare omakase with la's sushi bars you will never like this one.. any how live and learn !! Service was fantastic young guy by the name Taylor was our waiter and he did fantastic job.. and the girl who made our reservation this morning was very professional and sweet."}
{"text":"Wowed by Nobu. Everything was super fresh, beautifully prepared and delicious.   Great drink selection. Started with the pina tini. Vodka, pineapple and lime. It was SO good! Not too sweet, perfectly strong. Just right.   Next up, their signature black cod miso. Holy moly it was like no other piece of fish I've had. Flaky. The flavor. Omg. A must try!   New style sashimi next. Salmon was to die for. Thinly sliced salmon with just a touch of some sort of sauce and green onion. So fresh. I inhaled it. Unbelievable.   I tried the rock shrimp, both spicy and mild version. Very tasty, but not earth shattering. The scallop roll was insanely hot with jalapeño, wasn't wowed with that. And the California roll was just ok.   Their rolls are nothing to write home about. Stick with their signature hot and cold dishes and share. Love the detail and freshness of everything here and the vibe. Will be back!"}
{"text":"For my 25th birthday I wanted nothing more from the group of friends that accompanied me on this trip, than a nice sit down dinner. I chose Nobu based on New York's location and Philadelphia's Morimoto restaurant, but ended up being very underwhelmed. The black cod was a standout as is the case in most Japanese restaurants, straight from the ocean fresh, with a flavorful miso sauce. My seafood toban yaki was disappointing though, my favorite dish at Morimoto just didn't live up to expectation at Nobu. The broth was super salty and the quantity of seafood was just sort of lacking.  Overall the restaurant has a very hip and trendy vibe, our waiters were friendly and attentive without being overbearing, but all in all just a \"blah\" experience for a 25th birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Fresh fish but way too over-priced. Overall, the location, environment, food all are decent."}
{"text":"Finally there is good sushi in Vegas. Same menu as Nobu everywhere else. Solid, tasty food, tip top venue & a fun evening overall. It may not have the view of Nobu Malibu, but the food was arguably better & the bill was the same."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, and I can't complain. It doesn't hurt, that your friend is a Sous here. Seriously, it doesn't hurt.  Every time I come here, I don't even get to order. The only thing I hear is, \"this is such n such. It's a such n such sauce...etc etc\". It's great!   As far as the food goes, everything I've had was pretty spectacular. Even the Kobe pot stickers, made from scraps of Kobe, are DELICIOUS!  The wait staff is super doting, friendly, and prompt. I can't say how great the service here is, but it is high-regarded-establishment.  I'd recommend this place to anyone, that wants great Japanese cuisine!  The only thing I dare not say, is the seafood is \"fresh\". I mean, you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"There is still better \"purist\" sushi out there, but for creativity, Nobu is still at the top of the list.  I enjoyed an arrangement of raw shellfish centered around a solid brick of Himilayan rock salt.  The instructions were to place the fish on the salt for a couple of seconds, then remove and eat.  I have seen this on Iron Chef, and the result was quite tasty.  Uni was nice, o-toro was very high quality but the winner of the evening was the yellowtail collar, which I am not sure was on the menu.  The collar is just fantastically flavorful.  I did not see the bill (it was a business dinner) but I assume it was a bit over the top.  Nonetheless, I love being able to stumble out of Nobu and head to the Hard Rock bar to drink more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  We go here every time visit Las Vegas.  Food is expensive but well worth it.  My favorite dishes here are the lobster tempura, japanese wagyu, and pork belly kushi.  I amazed at the flavors of every dish that we had.  The Wagyu was $228 for 6 oz. but perfect.  Worth every cent.    I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Nobu is over. When I need teeth to chew my sushi it's awful. Overpriced. Waste of time. Perhaps cooked dishes were good but we just had sushi."}
{"text":"First visit, loved it!  Initially the menu seemed a little hard to digest, did we want to share family style or go solo, then we considered the set menus.   We ended up going with the Nobu classics omakase dinner and it was 8 courses of sheer delight.  The set menu was majority sushi/ raw fish preparations with a few cooked dishes (one fish and one beef), a soup and a lovely dessert.   Service was excellent and well balanced between efficient and friendly.   This menu was $125 a person so not a bargain bite spot. However considering the setting (glam casino Maine dining) and the amazing experience it felt like a good value. I was getting full about 2/3 of the way through the courses and everything seemed high quality, perfectly prepared and bursting with interesting flavor combinations.   Now having tried everything I might zero in on a couple dishes, but honestly the variety and fun of the small bites was something I would do again."}
{"text":"Hmmm Nobo. Do the Prixe-fix and be surprised.  Awesome experience. Will do it again next time back in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The staff was very attentive and informative, explaining each item in detail. We chose to let our waiter choose our dishes and gave him a price point we were looking to spend per person. Every item was amazing. The swordfish sashimi with jalapeño and black miso cod were definitely favorites."}
{"text":"Ate at Nobu last night.  Was thoroughly disappointed with the food.  For the price, the portions were very small.  The cut rolls were mostly rice and the sticky rice with spicy tuna was too greasy.  (The tuna was good though).  The worst part was that the waitress tried to shame us into ordering more food.  I understand the upsell but she was trying to make us feel bad.  We saw right through and couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Great food and great ambience. We were a group of  12 so we got a table in a private area. The sushi was so fresh and tasty. We also ordered the steak and lobster which was amazing. The lobster comes in its shell, half open and the steak comes on a set of hot stones, so it's still cooking when it comes out! They were super delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to eat here for my Birthday on a Saturday night expecting a 5 star experience only to be disappointed with the horrible service. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered the chefs tasting menu for 125 each. The courses came out about every thirty minutes. We had to continually remind the staff that we were not receiving food. Very inattentive and disorganized staff. That being said, the food was very good. The fish was fresh and the plating was spectacular. The depth of flavors and uniqueness of the courses was appreciated , however they  forgot the miso soup and served it at the end of the meal. We will not be returning to Nobu's. I receive better service at Nathan's Hot Dogs. Boo Nobu!"}
{"text":"By fast the best sushi sashimi I've ever had!!!! I couldn't rave enough about the food. Just as good as Beverly Hills. I will with out a doubt return. The tuna tartare with caviar was to die for as well as the pork belly with dry miso. 5++++"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. this place is amazing. Pricey, yes but the quality is AMAZING.   I had the following (Ones with the '*' are a must have)  - Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno * - Black Cod Miso * - Squid 'pasta' with Light Garlic - Akadashi Soup - Shrimp Tempura Roll* - California Roll  Let me just say, I went in there not liking raw or cooked fish. This experience completely changed my mind. My waiter insisted that I try the Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno and the Black Cod Miso. I had a YOLO moment (yes I said YOLO, I know, I'm very cool) and went a head and ordered it. I always thought that raw fish would be very fishy but, this dish was so fresh and expertly prepared it had no fishy taste and a very nice buttery mouth feel. Then the Black Cod Miso had a very buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The flavor was very umami with the caramelized miso and the saltiness from the cod.   The Squid 'pasta' with Light Garlic was very creative. The squid very much well resembled a pasta such as an Orecchiette or a Cencioni shape. The vegetables did not fit in with the Japanese/ Peruvian influence theme but over all, it was a great dish. The Soup was full of flavor and the seaweed was a nice touch.  They say that their sushi is not their specialty but believe me it was phenomenal. Since it was my first night of having fish I did not want to try all of the raw sushi so I stay with what I liked, Shrimp Tempura and a California Roll. They were both amazing.  This is a must go to restaurant if you are in Vegas. The atmosphere is trendy and it sets a cool dramatic mood."}
{"text":"Great place! the food was  good,and so was the saki. The deep fried whole fish with the sauted vegies was awsome. Some of the fish for the sushi i don't think it was that fresh.(being a chef helps knowing whats good or not). The prices were on the very high side. Hope they give bigger portions."}
{"text":"This place was fucking trash, they do explain the menu good, but they dont tell you how much the portion of the food you get. All in all I do not recommend this place at all, its a ripoff and the food does not get you full. I do recommend this place if you want to waste money, the sushi dinner was $60 and it came with only 6 rolls."}
{"text":"I wont go into details of everything we ordered, but one of the rolls - blue fin tuna roll did not have a fresh fish in it. I was disappointed and appalled that something like this could happen at a restaurant of this class. First of all fish inside was cut in little pieces and covered in some sauce which is strange because when I order blue fin tuna roll I expect it to be executed as a regular tuna roll, but with blue fin tuna. The rest of the sushi and rolls were fine, but nothing was exceptional. Their drinks are served in very small glasses, but at least they are tasty. 5 star to a bar personnel. The atmosphere is also nice, relaxing, but fishy blue fin tuna at Noby is too big of a disappointment for me to return there anytime soon."}
{"text":"(2.5 stars) I almost dread writing this review because prior to our dining experience I expected to give it 5 stars, phone home to my momma to tell her how great it was and then fantasize about the food for weeks until our next special occasion, however, that is not the case.  We were greeted by 3 sweet lovely hostesses and seated promptly when we arrived. Perhaps one luxury of being a local is being prepared with proper dinner attire and getting a baby sitter but I guess for some that's asking a bit much. It almost felt like Olive Garden with the casual outfits and all the children. Even the service staff uniform is black tshirts which is much different than the white long sleeve button up shirts that we are used to in most fine dining restaurants.  Dinner was $470 for the two of us including gratuity. We enjoyed our meal but it was nowhere near orgasmic (can I write that?). Keep in mind we like ponzu, my husband actually loves it but this was overkill. We had a shrimp and lobster roll that was great, mixed cerviche that was the highlight of our meal and tartar which was  ground up beyond recognition and somehow swimming in some sauce, a large sake that we only finished half of (don't order large unless you're an alcoholic, a party of 4 or a conisouer of sake), smoked salmon which was the equivalent of warm locks on rice, yellowtail that was good, the house roll that was also just good and a few other \"good\" items.   Our server seemed like a nice guy but he wasn't exactly smooth in his deliverance and he wasn't very personable. He was in no way deserving of the 15% we left him but it's basically against my religion to leave anything less. I couldn't tell you his name to save my life but I can certainly compliment all the food runners and the bussers. They were very detailed in their explanations of the food and quick to get rid of used plates.  It's probably too late to say long story short but Ill say it anyways, long story short it's \"good\" food, very pricey, small portions, loud and more of a happy hour atmosphere than the fine dining experience that I thought it would be. I could have gone to AYCE in my yoga pants with my 2 year old and have been just as happy so I doubt we will be back because we love Sushi Samba at the Palazzo much better for a fun sushi/Peruvian dinner."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and had a great experience. The place is beautifully decorated with cloud paper lights and basket weaved birdcage seating...very Zen like but wouldn't have expected any less. Ive been to the Miami Nobu and was equally impressed. Our server was great, very engaging.   We got the squid pasta donburi which had the most tender pieces of squid. You mix everything together and the garlic soy and seasonal veggies (asparagus, shitake, squash, broccoli) really came together well. Add a little oshinko and mmmmm mmmm.  We also were ecstatic that they had the bento (only offered sat/sun for lunch) which includes all their signature dishes including the miso black cod and the creamy/citrus rock shrimp tempura. A good \"bargain\" to try out a variety of things. The bento also included sushi but I was not that impressed as the nigiri were tiny and salmon roll generic. All lunches include miso soup and pickles is an added bonus.   This is one of the better sushi places I've been in Vegas and a must try if you want to spoil yourself."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place. Have been to the one in Tribecca in NYC. This one was equally as fabulous. I'm a sucker for a nice atmosphere and a great cocktail. Win, win here! Highly recommend. The sushi was delicious."}
{"text":"Decent sushi but honestly doesn't come close to Oyaji in Outer Richmond or even Sushi Ran in Sausalito. Although, the price is very similar..."}
{"text":"Last minute, we decided to go to vegas and made reservation for Nobu the next night. It was our first time so we went for the omakase 175 dollar one which included cold and hot items. It was definitely enough food and the variety were great. The presentation of each diah was amazing. I would recommend this place but it is definitely  pricey. We sat at the sushi bar and our sushi chefs were great and explained each dish even though they were super busy!"}
{"text":"If you like authentic sushi and sashimi, then this is your restaurant.  All of their fish is fresh and flown in daily and they have many varieties, including exotic ocean fish you would never find in a typical America sushi bar.  Make no mistake, you will pay dearly for this fine selection of sea treasures, but if you're a hard-core sushi lover you won't leave disappointed.  Just bring plenty of cash or your platinum card."}
{"text":"Came here for the Restaurant Week Tasting Menu. Service was good, food was not bad if you never had Japanese/Peruvian type of cuisine. Since I'm a local here in Las Vegas, I've had food like this much better for the price I've paid. My wife was very disappointed because she always heard about the name Nobu but didn't live up to her expectations. I told her Chef Nobu were one of the first ones to introduce cuisines like this in North America, but since this is 20 years ago, we haven't seen any innovations."}
{"text":"Nobu is of course an amazing restaurant, brand, culture, experience, meal and entrepreneurial experiment.  With reluctance, -1 star because: (1) A lot of this food seems to be relying on salt as a crutch; (2) The oven-baked king crab leg was so spicy as to overpower the natural flavor of the sea urchin and the crab itself  Nevertheless, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I first discovered Nobu when I lived in New York City years ago. Since then I have eaten at many Nobu across the nation and around the world and their food and excellent service remains consistent and delicious. My latest experience was with the location at Caesars Palace where we had a party in the Nobu suites and Nobu perfectly catered our lavish party. So many delectable and scrumptious appetizer dishes to choose from that I completely forgot to take pictures since I was too busy stuffing my face.   It is definitely consider high end fine dining on the strip so you must expect to pay the price. Nobu is not a place to dine if you are on a budget."}
{"text":"I am out of praise. I am drained of \"wow\". While dining at NOBU, I used every iteration of \"OMG\" and \"This is amazing\". \"Superb\" describes the ambience. \"Excellent and attentive\" describes the service. \"Outstanding\" covers the description of each and every dish we sampled. \"Absolutely perfect\" was uttered after not one, not two, but three dishes. \"Unbelievable\" captured the entire evening. We made a reservation, a good call on a Saturday night, and were seated at a comfortable booth. Nobu's interior is lovely-mushroom-shaped lanterns float above the dark interior and low light creates an intimate dining experience. The table setting is charming, with a rock to prop your chopsticks upon. Our server gave excellent recommendations throughout the evening, and his first was my drink-a mango passionfruit concoction which was sweet and dangerous-zero taste of alcohol. A delicious start to the evening. We ordered edamame, which had delicious salt sprinkled atop. It was good! And then the fun began...we had SO many dishes, each outshining the next. Tiny tacos were the first to arrive. I popped a tiny lobster taco, and it was superb. Crisp shell with amazing lobster and a creamy sauce (we ordered another round of tacos later because they were splendid). Then the yellowtail with jalapeño, a signature of the restaurant. Outstanding. Heat from the jalapeño and clean, cold perfect yellowtail made for an amazing dish. Rock shrimp tempura was a huge hit-we ordered the standard sauce. Light and crunchy tempura with a buttery and tangy sauce, an absolute star  Later in the evening, we ordered the Chilean sea bass tempura-another hit. It was buttery and paired with a lighter sauce (ponzu, maybe?). That sauce was flavorful and interesting and so worth it. Pork belly skewers were next on the list. Incredible. Out of this world. So well-flavored and crisp on the top and melty (\"melty\" is not a word, but NOBU took so many of my adjectives that I am reduced to making up new words), creamy, flavorful goodness. It was a winner. And then-the black cod. Everything about it surprised me. It is a large piece of fish, and our group tentatively began pulling pieces off and using our chopsticks to break off segments. It is slippery, so I definitely struggled But once I got it situated and took a bit, I was floored. So buttery, so flavorful, so rich, so decadent, and so unmatched. It is a must order. Just glorious. Phew-I am reviewing our meal in the order we ate each dish, and I need a moment to bask in the glow of the black cod before moving on. It was a masterpiece. Okay, I'm ready Right after the black cod dish, we shared a simple salmon roll (cut). Honestly, I was not expecting much, and this roll surprised me-it was incredibly flavorful. After that second round of tacos and the sea bass tempura, we ordered dessert The doughnuts were suggest by our server, and they were great! A well-made donut with creamy chocolate, a rich berry sauce, and ice cream dusted with hazelnuts was a perfect way to end a perfect evening. I had high expectations for my first Nobu experience, and Nobu surpassed those expectations"}
{"text":"On Saturday, I called this place to reserve a table for 5, but they said they didn't take reservations & that it was walk-in. My friends & I decided to dine here anyway before we went to XS. When we got there, the host says that it was an 1-1.5 hr wait & that we should've RSVP! I couldn't believe it! I told her about my call this morning, but all she said was that she was sorry for the miscommunication. My friends & I were hungry & irritated, but we decided to wait anyways because all restaurants probably had a long wait time since it was dinner time.   Before I start commenting on the food, please keep in mind that my friends & I are a huge fan of sushi & Japanese cuisine, so we've eaten at numerous sushi joints & had high hopes for this place since it was expensive & well-known.   I understand that sushi is an expensive experience overall, but this place was a big disappointment. We started off with a few cocktail drinks recommended by the waitress & some oyster shooters (yummy!). As for our dishes, we ordered the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño (fresh, but mediocre), which was recommended by our waitress as one of their signature dish. Next, we had the wagyu taco (meat was soft, but it came in two & was REALLY small). As for sushi & sashimi, we ordered the scallop sashimi & salmon belly - both of which are super overpriced for $6-7 per piece & the cut wasn't even that big, tuna cut (tiny & nothing special) & the house special ($17 for nothing special). The rock shrimp was just fried battered shrimp mixed in with spicy mayo. The only dish that was good was the black cod miso - had a sweet glazed taste.  Coming here, we've already expected to pay $100+/person, but we expected the food to be superb. Overall, this place is expensive for mediocre food that I could've eaten elsewhere for half the price. No thanks."}
{"text":"In the hip Hard Rock Hotel, Nobu is a scene and a place to try if your wallet is willing to go along. The fish was excellent, and the simple flavor pairings made it a unique experience. I had a \"cold\" dish with sashimi along with small sprigs of fresh cilantro. It worked.   It is defintely worth trying for a special occasion. For me, it  was celebrating my friend's engagement."}
{"text":"I must say....this place blew me away. From service, ambiance, decor, to food; this place is top notch.  Disclaimer: Do not expect to have a cheap meal here. The prices are high, but you are paying for the highest quality - in everything. So know that you are going to shell out more than normal for an amazing experience.  The decor and ambiance are great. Nicely lit. Easy to carry on a conversation. Place is great for big groups too.   Service: Impeccable. Our server was named Marcus. He is the best out there. The group I was with always request him and I now know why. We didn't have to pickup a menu, he did all the ordering for us. He knew if someone had an allergy to something and made accommodations for them. Complete stud. The other waiters and staff were also very attentive. Drinks and waters were refilled constantly. Plates were replaced after each course.   Food: Amazing!! Small tapas style portions for sharing. Quality and flavor were out of this world.  We ordered:  Edamame - good  Shishito peppers - sauce was great for these  Yellowtail with Jalapeño- Amazing!  Palm salad with Jalapeño - Ok  King crab legs - soo good  Salmon Belly Sashimi - Amazing!  Black cod lettuce wraps - Good   Wagyu Beef Tacos - The best thing!!!  Some sort of fish taco - really good!  Chicken wings - Sauce was amazing!  Tempura King Crab - Amazing!  Lamb Chops - Amazing!  Wagyu Beef - Amazing!  Doughnut Dessert - Amazing  Shaved ice dessert - ok  Cookie shortbread dessert - ok   Overall - this place is amazing. Food is so good! Quality and service are amazing!"}
{"text":"The inflated prices aren't worth it...It's not that the food isn't really good, just that you can get the same quality and better in town at a better price.  If you find yourself here the signature items are typically very good.  I'd go with the: Miso Black Cod Yellowtail Sashimi Pork Belly Salmon Sashimi  The Fried Rock Shrimp is fine if you like fried rock shrimp, but it's really just a money-maker for them and I'd avoid it if was ever eating here again.  Nobu is a solid 4 stars for food & drink, but for the price it's an easy 3 star place in my book...and this from someone that routinely enjoys paying inflated Strip prices for excellent quality food & drink."}
{"text":"If someone were to ask me where did I have the best meal of my life (so far), I would say it was here at NOBU LV.  We got the family style sampler here, and I have to say that every dish that we had was made to perfection. I do not have any complaints what so ever. The sampler is very filling as it includes about twelve dishes ranging from seafood to steak, and all packed with amazing flavors! You can tell a lot of care and consideration goes into creating these dishes, and that they only use the best and the freshest ingredients. If I were to describe the taste of Nobu with one word, it would be \"beautiful,\" like I've just devoured art.   The service here was great as well. The servers were nice, friendly and very attentive. I love how they describe each dish right before they place it on the table. I also like the decor. It looks like jellyfishes are floating on the ceiling, LOL, but it has very modern classy feel to it.   I'll have to admit, we did choose this place because of the lyrics to \"Jumpman\" by Drake and Future, LOL. \"Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates. NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU I just throwed a private dinner in LA!\" Glad af we did though.  Coming to Nobu definitely added to this Vegas trip being the best trip with friends of all tiiiiiime. Aug 2016."}
{"text":"Arriving in Vegas for the EDC weekend and being a \"foodie\" going to Nobu was a must. Having planned the trip about a year in advanced, we also made the reso for Nobu then was well. Without a reso I wouldn't even suggest trying to go especially a weekend as busy as EDC.   To be clear and honest I walked in with little to no expectations considering the name and brand have been around for so long. We opted for the Omakase for $125 per person which came up to about 161 after tax and tips.   When we got the first course we were left underwhelmed thinking the portions were going to be consistently this small. We were wrong. Having this mentality made the experience of dining here so much better as we thought we were going to be leave the restaurant hungry and wanting more.   The service given to our table was amazing as very single course was explained in detail and dishes were brought out to the speed of our table, nothing was ever rushed and or unexplained. Waters were never empty, and dirty dishes were always taken cared of.   The entire meal was about 8 courses and my entire party left full and satisfied, both big and petite eaters being in the group. If you have a chance to check out Nobu I suggest anyone to as although it is rated with $$$$ the value of defiantly there. This meal was probably one of the more memorable ones in the trip.   TL;DR IT WAS AMAZING WALKED IN WITH NO EXPECTATION WALKED OUT FULL AND WALLET SLIGHTLY FULLER THAN EXPECTED."}
{"text":"Spent the evening at the sushi bar and the cook made special creations for us. It was sublime. Oysters and tiny deep fried crabs were the highight.  See the pics."}
{"text":"The food is good, but at fantastic prices. For the cost per item I was expecting mind-blowing. I tried a few of the things other reviewers here really liked, but none of it was that great.  I don't mind spending the money once in a while for a fantastic experience, but this wasn't it.  On the plus side, the fish was of high quality and very fresh. The presentation was very nice, and the service was good (but not fantastic).  I was able to walk in for an early dinner without reservations and get a place at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations due to both the food and the service.  Andrew was a phenomenal waiter and took the time to customize recommendations based on our tastes.  The Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño and the Scallop Tiradito were incredible.  We also had the Black Cod Miso (good), Rock Shrimp (good but would order something else in the future) and the Chocolate Bento Box (was a great compliment to the wine).  A Vegas must-do!"}
{"text":"After a long exhausting day at Spearmint Rhino and blowing my savings account there, we decided to feast at Nobu.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by beautiful ladies who caught our attention which made me wonder is the food as good as the women here?  Our waiter was very kind and very informative.  I just wish we had one of the beautiful ladies as our waitress.  It was our first time there so we really didn't know what to get.  The waiter recommended getting Omakase which is like a 8 course meal.  The food was pretty good, the fish we had was amazing.  However, our tab alone on Fiji water was $80 lol.  I don't think they even offer tap water which is a scam.   Every time the waiter poured Fiji water into our cups, I was cringing in pain.  At one point our waiter spilled some Fiji water on the table which made me want to scoop up that precious water.  Overall, the Nobu experience was pretty good but was it worth $170 a person....I would have to say no.  I rather take the $170 and spend it playing more Blackjack or Spearmint Rhino."}
{"text":"Why does this place get such good reviews? Second visit; it's mediocre at best. Rice is almost flawless, however -- it's just a disappointing presentation and lackluster taste. Service is quite good, however."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time with a group of friends.  The waiter asked us if we wanted the \"Nobu Experience\" (which pretty much meant allowing the waiter to order whatever he wanted until we hit our budget) - we said sure.  The cooked food was really good and the sushi was okay.  The price point per dish was definitely a little on the high side so expect to empty your wallet if you want to walk out full.  They also have an interesting variety of drinks so be sure to check that out."}
{"text":"First we went here when it was crowded, the noise level was deafening. The servers were good, but constantly apologizing, it took over 1 hour to get served, the meal was not any better than your below average Japanese Restaurant.  I had heard so much 'hoop-la' about the restaurant in New York, and was so disappointed I talked everyone into going here. When I got my steak it was drowned in sauce and cold.  Save yourself $100 and go to another place."}
{"text":"We stopped by Nobu two nights ago and had a wonderful dinner.  We arrived and were seated at a booth....the decor of the restaurant was fairly trendy with an Asian/bamboo wood theme.  Based on the many yelp reviews we ordered the yellowfish with jalapenos, black cod w/ miso, lobster tacos, rock shrimp w/ 3 dipping sauces, the house sushi roll and the bento box desert (warm chocolate w/green tea ice cream).  Each item was outstanding.....great unique flavors for each dish.  Our favs were the black cod w/miso and the rock shrimp.  Super yummy!  Nobu rocks with a hit!  A cool Michelin Star Restaurant in Sin City!"}
{"text":"See it as an experience not as a Restaurant  Yes...when you look at the prices on the menu you get shocked. Well...my advise is that if you really wanna try this place ... set a price in your mind, communicate it to your waiter when you arrive and enjoy the experience.   My first time here I was very excited and although I was prepared to pay around $150 per person when you really think about it you start imaging what the hell is worth so much money!. Well we decided to don't look at the menu and we made an arrangement with the waiter....he would bring 6 different dishes inside our budget of $300 a table (2people).  Here is what we had: - Yellowtail with cilantro and jalapeño: good fresh  - Tuna belly sashimi beautiful: explosion of flavours  - Salmon belly: awesome....not as diverse and tasty as the tuna but still great - The black cod: This is his famous dish and OMG...the smell, the presentation, the flavour this dish has a PhD work behind it. Simply amazing!! - Shrimp tempura: ok and filling but not a special experience...you can find it easy anywhere in other sushi spots.  - The sushi Platter, assorted sushi very fresh but again nothing special. - The Dessert was very presentable and with great flavour but something that you can easily skip if you are not a fan of sweets. You'll not be missing much. - To note that the drinks are highly expensive and nothing special. Overall it's an interesting spot for the experience and I would come back here just to seat down and have the cod dish! Other than that of course the quality is high but not worth the abusive price they ask for!."}
{"text":"3 Stars - Reminder - 3 Stars isn't bad.   OFF THE BAT  The two most DELICIOUS bites on the menu is. TORO (OTORO? = Fattiest part of the Tuna) Covered in gold flakes, cavier, and truffle. The comparable bite is the WAGYU BEEF. Literally those are the two most delicious things on the menu, and trust me we tried over like 40+ different bites. I say bite because from the picture you can tell everything came in small bites.   AMAZING WAGYU BEEF. If I remember correctly its from Miyazaki Farms http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/swxj-AxPnXoD5_a7hVA8jg/o.jpg  Cool Story: Kobe advertise in America is actually Wagyu Cows. There's lots of farms that mixed Wagyu Cows with Angus Cows. Angus Cow Rib meat is very comparable to Japanese Black Wagyu Cows. In Japan Kobe Beef are just Wagyu Cows and Kobe, Matsuzaka, and Ohmi.   Nobu sells it by the oz and its 38 dollars per oz. In LA its around 30 dollars for 2 oz in most restaurants. At the grocery market it varies from 3-6 dollars per oz depending on cut.   Possibly the best Toro I have ever had http://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JM_eSP6vsBuYRgTIVKs2kQ/o.jpg  Very Very Comparable to the one I had in Japan at 5AM caught that day.   If you get it A la cart I think its around 28-48 and its definitely worth a try.  Coming in 3rd place for OUSHI UMAMI (Taste and flavor) would have to be the Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi.  2 x Omakase Signature (By Chef Nobu and its the same everywhere) (125$ Here ) Chef's Omakase (Head Chef's own menu tasting) (175$)  http://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FKK_at23v2Q-w4yccShJcA/o.jpg  Prices are Post Tax add 50 for Tip  The rest of the meal was okay. Of the meal I think the only low quality fish was the Big Eye Tuna from Hawaii that was still fishy. The Aji (Jack Fish) was tasty and the Salmon was amazing.    There is a huge Variation of fish. From Steel Head Trout that looks similar to Salmon but much more lean (and chewy) to Black Cod sashimi and Fluke. A lot of the reviews mentioned the Miso Glazed Black Cod - For me it was too much flavor, like too salty. It looked pretty though. The Miso Black Cod part o the Nobu Signature Omakase however the fish for the Signature Omakase which I believe was Umami Sea Bass was MUCH MUCH Better. It wasn't too salty and cooked perfectly.   Note: My meal was not de-boned correctly  Here's a picture of the fish bone they said was a bamboo from the chopsticks http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GFMwo0PKZNpCd6ndk6-EXw/o.jpg You can see there's still meat on the bone!  Manager Silva was a little patronizing but he did remove 50 dollars off the meal for the fish bone. (Mentioned EMT because the fish bone I chomped on punctured my mouth) - Makes sense right? I try to eat sushi the way it was meant to be eaten, 1 bite and I chomped on it. He offered a free bottle of Champagne which I did decline which is a super nice gesture. Although I totally understand his situation as he wants to crowd control their high standards.   Interesting Note: The group next to us ordered like 6 California Rolls.   Ending Notes: For 350$ You kind of expect there not to be fish bones in your sushi. Service by Jay was spectacular. He was very attentive and accommodating. Food Servers really explained the dishes well. The Variety is nice and overall the experience is a good one.   P.S. The Hostess was a TOTAL Bitch. Reservation was for 6pm and I tried to be seated at 5:45 and she made up some B.S. lie that she cannot sit me because her employees aren't in until 6. I would understand if it was busy at that time but it wasn't. But that's not why she's a bitch, just the overall interaction was very rude.   PRO ASS TIP: If you want to try a majority of the menu, get both Omakase because you literally get to taste like everything worth trying."}
{"text":"I love Nobu, although I shouldn't.  The food is just SO good that you have to forgive rude service and ridiculous prices.  Truthfully, the service hasn't always been rude, but I have had two experiences that were less that desirable during the last five times I went.  Let's knock out the negatives really quickly.  Once, they lost my reservation.  No big deal, but they acted like they were doing me a favor by providing a table 45 minutes later.  Whatever.    The other thing was pretty funny actually.  Some people would be bothered by this, but I laughed.  Once, I took a client who had a bit too much to drink, I guess.  When we were seated, he was looking at the chopsticks that were balancing against a rock and asked the waitress if the rock was intended as a tool to get her attention.  She didn't laugh.  Instead, she chose to tell our entire table, \"Not unless you want me to spit in your food.\"  Not too professional for such a highly regarded restaurant, but then again he was being a dumbass.  On to the food.  Yes, it is amazing.  No, I cannot tell you why.  Everything I have ever tasted here was exceptional.  The price is the only negative.  The toro nigiri is to die for even at $20 a piece, or whatever it was.  I once ordered three Kobe beef appetizers for a group.  I guess I should have asked the price first because they were $180 each!  Good news is that they were delicious and expensed.  I also recall having some tasty sea bass here.  Nothing has ever disapponted.  The location is inside of the Hard Rock Hotel.  It isn't very large, so be sure to have a reservation in advance.  Sitting at the sushi bar is also a fun experience, which I definitely recommend at least once."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!  We were seated quickly when we arrived at 7:30.  The restaurant was packed even for a week night (given all the conventions I shouldn't be surprised).  The service was great.  The waiter was informative and always around.  We had the chief's sampling menu that cost us about $100 each.  There were 8 dishes total including dessert.  Each dish was very tasty and innovative.   We didn't order any alcohol only sparkling water.  Our bill came to $250.  Steep!!  Here is what I don't like: (1) Loud music.  I am starting to sound old. I couldn't hear my husband at all during the whole dinner.  (2) Close promixity of the tables.  I can hear other people's conversation. I need my space!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Nobu in LA and had very good memories of it. I came here with my family and 3 of us got the chef's omakase and 1 person got a customized omakase. A lot of things that came out were drenched in sauce ... especially their hamachi sashimi with jalapeno, which was swimming in ponzu sauce. Their sashimi salad had too much dressing on it. Their black cod was buttery and delicious but again, too much sauce on the outside. If you're serving good fish, don't ruin the flavor!!! You have to complement it and bring out the flavor, not kill it. Other dishes were pretty good but the ones that stick out in my mind are the ones where I had to make a scrunched face when eating ... not a good sign."}
{"text":"Amazing service, delicious food.  I must say though, the sashimi plates here were SO good. I could eat it all day. The nigiri was just OKAY. I've had better at local AYCE sushi joints around town! The Blue Fin toro, Jalapeño Sashimi, Surf n Turf they set ablaze right in front of you! These lettuce wraps, black cod or sea bass? Delicious nonetheless! So so SO good!!!"}
{"text":"Why one star? Because of the price. We had a party of 10 and it was about $200 a person. What happened to these place. No Japanese staff or even a Japanese person making the food?  They try to get you by doing this family style thing. It is so Americanized. They actually had crunchy rolls as a course. Are you F'ing kidding me?  Presentation is not worthy of a $200 per person place. Everyone eating there was Caucausian, and there were not Japanese patrons. This has become a glorified Bennihana. Except that you will PAY PAY PAY here"}
{"text":"All the dishes I had which weren't rolls (kobe beef carpaccio and the Yuzuscicle desert among them) were amazing!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at 5 or 6 Nobu's around the world, the omakase here was excellent and by far my favorite Nobu experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good sushi - no surprise.  I do not particularly care that they add jalapeño in so many of their roll choices.  Service was great and it's a good business place to eat/meet."}
{"text":"ok seriously there is no better sushi but Nobu at C Palace. I crave it and whenever I go to Vegas that is where I eat first. Cant wait to go back...."}
{"text":"Perfection.  Come here.  Don't complain about the prices.  You are getting excellent food for your money.  To be honest, you don't need to waste time anywhere on the menu aside from the page with the fresh fish (nigiri and sashimi).  If you choose to order anything else, I recommend the black cod sliders in butter lettuce cups as well as the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño.  Back to the important stuff... We got the following nigiri:  Albacore Aged blue fin tuna (HIGHLY recommend) Japanese red-eye snapper Japanese golden-eye snapper Chu-toro O-toro Sweet shrimp (with the fried head... be brave and do it... it is delicious!  Make sure you bite off all of the spikes first or you will cut your mouth!) Yellow tail Yellow tail belly Mackerel Scallop   Service was excellent.  Sit at the bar for a show.  Sushi chefs made it all the more better and are masters at their craft.  What are you waiting for?    P.S. Eat a few pieces of nigiri for me when you go!"}
{"text":"Service and food were both amazing.  Must have: Black Cod with Miso and Yellowtail with Jalapeno.  Wasnt too particularly thrilled with the Maine Lobster, but everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"I was honestly disappointed when I came to Nobu. My highly anticipated reservation was on a Saturday night at prime time. Some would argue ... what did I expect? After all, it is SUPPOSED to be a fusiony Asian cuisine / Japanesey kind of place.   I suppose for that, they're okay, but they're not so creative that it blows my mind, although it certainly blew my wallet.   I didn't feel great value eating here, I didn't feel like they had fantastic service, or were amazingly impressionable. Or personable. Or anything really. I just felt like I went to an expensive restaurant to eat a meal. This is actually a far cry from my experiences elsewhere on the strip. Yes money is the reigning king in Vegas, but it doesn't mean you can get away with just anything if you have a name.  I would pretty much pass, because it's kind of just a fancy, to be seen place. Not really great for food, drinks, or if you want to have a good time."}
{"text":"I really was going to only give 1 star, but the quality of the food keeps me from doing so. Maybe we should have done the tasting menu because we picked multiple dishes from the menu, paid over $100 per person and everyone felt like we had nothing to eat. The reviewer that said something was the best bite of food he had ever had was right - everything was a bite.  We liked what we ate, there just wasn't much of it for the outrageous prices. The service started out a little overpowering, but in no way helpful.  It was like they were telling us to order items, but they didn't know why we should.  The lighting at our table was very dim so reading the menu was more like guessing. Quality of the fish was excellent, I never felt like we were eating anything less than fresh - I just didn't eat anything that stood out."}
{"text":"Every time we're in Vegas, we head directly to Nobu in the Hard Rock.  Loved our dinner and our evening.  Our server Aaron was VERY knowledgeable and fun.  Had to quickly get our fix of the Yellowtail Serrano.  It did not disappoint! I could have ordered 2 more of these and been in heaven.  The Rock Shrimp Tempura is also a favorite.  We also loved the ceviche.  Seriously, EVERYTHING was delicious.  We tried a few different Sakes at our server's suggestion and enjoyed those as well.  We were celebrating our Anniversary and they commemorated it with some Mochi Balls on a special plate with a candle.  Nice touch Nobu!"}
{"text":"This is upscale at its finest. This place makes you feel like a superstar a-lister! Fine food, amazing service, rare bourbon, who can ask for more? A must see when in Vegas . Definitely a top three restaurants for me!"}
{"text":"Wow, the food was amazing and the service was superb. I was expecting Nobu to be good, but it was so much better than I expected.  Every dish was excellent. Cold dishes: scallops...this was so good my husband drank the sauce that was left on the plate sashimi salad-greens with veggies and some sashimi, the salad was very cleansing on the palate and very good. Yellow-tail with hot peppers cilantro with sauce, this was combination was so amazing.  Hot dish: black-cod, the sauce was so good paired perfectly with the fish.   Sushi-spicy Tuna roll with avocado. The best sushi roll.  Sake paired excellent with the whole meal.  If you can get Chris for a waiter, for he was fantastic!! With his great expertise he guided us to perfect dishes to order, explained the dishes well and gave background on each dish. He was attentive, but not overly attentive by not stopping by too much. He was always there to answer questions, get us drinks etc. I have never requested a server again before, but when I go back in January to Nobu I will request Chris, he is that good.  Yes Nobu can be expensive, but it is worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences of my life. I made a reservation here with my wife for a nice dinner during our Vegas trip. Nobu had a stellar $50 per person tasting menu with a portion of the proceeds going to charity for restaurant week.   Highlights of our dinner included the jalapeno yellowtail, black cod with miso, beef tenderloin, and wagyu beef tacos.  The grade a5 wagyu beef was insanely tasty.   For dessert, the white chocolate pot de creme was creamy and delicious.   In addition to the food, the staff was attentive without being overbearing. They explained each dish as they brought them out and were polite and knowledgeable.  This was definitely a highlight of our trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Drinks were delicious.  great flavors and combinations.  get the one with the coconut water!   food was alright.  pricey.  got some items to share and some nigiri/rolls. crispy rice spicy tuna was delicious.  cubes of rice fried to crispy perfection.  top that with some tuna and its a warm/cold contrast in your mouth.  cute presentation too. miso cod lettuce wraps were super tender with the butter lettuce, they literally dissolve in your mouth. nigiri were fresh and tasty.  one of the best fresh water eel nigiri Ive had.  exterior was crispy and inside was moist and meaty.    overall a good, but expensive, meal on the strip."}
{"text":"I was staying at ceasers for a conference and decided to check this place with some colleagues. Our server was great and knowledgable. We did the three courses cold plates, hot plates, and then sushi. I would return next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Me: \"Hi! Nobu?! Can I make a reservation?\" Nobu: \"How many is in your party?\" Me: \"Err...12?  Can you accommodate us, tonight?\" *crossing fingers* Nobu: \"See you at 8 o'clock, tonight.\" Me: \"Whew!\"  Trying to make a reservation for 12 last minute is Las Vegas (of all places) is crazy.  Leave it up to the boys, and nothing will get done.  Lesson learned!  Anyway, NOBU!  Where have you been all my life?  This is by far one of the best dinning experiences--hands down!  Our waiter asked us how much we wanted to spend per person and built a menu based on our dollar amount.  The first course arrived, and the boys made a comment of how they would have to hit up a McDonald's since the portions were so small.  The courses got better and better as the meal progressed.  When the check came, the waiter stayed under our budget (with alcohol) and the boys left with full tummies.  Thanks, Nobu!  I'm definitely looking forward to dinning here again.  P.S:  SIX WORDS: BLACK COD WRAPPED IN BUTTER LETTUCE!"}
{"text":"With so many great Japanese places to chose from on the strip, I was sorely disappointed with nobu in Caesars when we ate there tonight. Ambience is great. Place was not packed but scene was great. Food was good, code was good but service was slow, really inattentive, some items were missing. For a 670 dollar meal between four, we expect a lot more."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and expensive but worth the money. Al was very professional and the service was awesome. DO NOT EAT Here  If you are cheep!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan.  Their MISO BLACK COD was DIVINE.  Yellowtail Carpaccio (I think that was what it was called) was amazing as well.  MONKFISH PATE was so damn good.  Their sushi is alright, nothing crazy to rave about as I live in Vancouver and we have lots of great sushi up here.  Otherwise, definitely somewhere you'd wana try."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband. Jay was our waiter. We gave him a price point and a few pointers on what we like and hate. He chose our dishes. Each dish was more amazing than the previous. The flavors were just incredible.   Deep fried edamame, scallops with dried miso, yellowtail and jalapeño, NOBU tacos, surf and turf and much more......   This location is much better than the hard rock hotel spot. Big and gorgeous. Nice ambiance. Drinks were stiff and delish. The service was impeccable.   I have no complaints and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Travelling is incomplete unless met with great sushi, in my case at least.   I arrived in Las Vegas, jet lagged after partying my tail feathers off in Hong Kong for two weeks. And since I had Nobu while I was in Hong Kong(which by the way, was amazing like always) - I thought I'd skip the visit to Nobu in Las Vegas and save some money.   But my boyfriend was very sweet and surprised me with a RSVP to Nobu the night we arrived, so I dragged myself out of bed, dressed up and headed up Nobu.   I've been to Vegas twice before, many years ago, but never had the chance to try Nobu. It was about a $15 cab ride from Mandalay Bay to Hard Rock, and when we arrived - we found the restaurant well hidden in the back of the entrance. The ambiance was nice, but nothing compared to the decor in Nobu Tokyo or Hong Kong. Venue was small in comparison as well.   The food was great, check out pictures of the sushi/appetizers from that night.   If you are new to Nobu, here are a few recommendations from that night. Otoro Nigiri - $38 Sea Urchin - $15 Barracuda - $40 Monkfish Liver(Ankimo) - $30 Squid Pasta - $20  and pair them with the Nobu beer! By the way, Nobu beer costs $15 each in San Diego, but costs only $8 in Las Vegas - don't know why, maybe the higher demand for beer allows them to lower their price?  All and all, Nobu Las Vegas was great....but...  I wish I didn't have to say this, especially since I have such a bias for Nobu - but the staff did not treat us the way a $250 bill deserves. It was probably due to the fact that we were a young couple, and didn't look like we had hundred dollar bills in hand to \"rain\" on the waiters. But either they were blind, or the fact that I was carrying an exclusive limited edition Louis Vuitton bag from Japan meant nothing to them.   Waiter made no effort to create a conversation, rushed us from start to end, took five years to refill my hot green tea, yet five seconds to take the American Express off my boyfriend's hand. The waiter also talked to me as if I had never heard of Nobu in my entire life, he even questioned how I had known about the Nobu beer(since I ordered it without advertisement). At that moment I wanted to whip out the photo I took with Chef Nobu himself in Tokyo Nobu on my phone, but I thought, even if I did that, what does it proof besides the fact that I am dying for everyone to know that I met Chef Nobu, and that the waiter is an asshole?   Maybe I was being a little harsh, but I have certain expectations from a restaurant who plans to charge me $250 minimum for dinner. Since those expectations weren't met, I am ranting on Yelp.   If you want better service, try Nobu Tokyo or Hong Kong."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for the first time. We all decided to get the Nobu signature omakase for $150 per person. This comes with 7 courses plus soup and dessert.  I looked at a lot of reviews and pictures before going and it didn't look very filling so we ordered 2 of the yellowtail sashimi appetizers and were planning on ordering more food after we finished the omakase. Man were we wrong! We were stuffed and all of us can eat a lot too! So unfortunately we did not order anything else after the omakase. I don't remember the names of most of the dishes but most of them were good. We didn't really care for the shrimp dish. It was just okay, nothing special. The miso cod was good but very salty. The beef was very tender, even the well done ends were very tender and seasoned perfectly.  If I had to pick my top 3 favorite dishes, they would be our 2nd course (the radish wrap, surprisingly very flavorful), the toro with caviar on top, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño. The yellowtail just melts in your mouth and has good flavor. The toro with caviar tasted a little weird to me at first, but after my first bite it was really good. We were stuffed by the end of the courses and then we got a bowl of miso soup. That filled us even more and to top it off, we got a bento box dessert of chocolate molten lava cake with fruit and green tea ice cream. I usually don't order desserts at restaurants since I don't like sweets but this was the perfect sweetness, not too sweet.   The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because of their service. I don't remember our server's name, but he took a good 15 min before he came to take our drink orders. Then another 15 min to take our food orders. We're all in college so maybe he thought we weren't going to tip him well? Not sure. But we still left a good tip. He had a big smile when he saw it. Our waters were not filled as often as we wanted. My friends with soft drinks got them refilled when they still had half a cup remaining...also the food was a 4/5 for us. There was too much ponzu sauce or whatever it is they use. It was overpowering on almost all the sushi dishes. I like to taste the unique flavor of different fish. Also, we wanted all sushi dishes but that wasn't allowed according to our waiter. Next time we would probably order just sushi a la carte since we don't want any hot dishes. But we probably wouldn't go back for the price we paid. You can get sushi that's just as good or even better for a lot less off the strip."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the food is absolutely delicious.  Everything my party of 6 at was fabulous and made my tastebuds do happy dances.  We had so many things, that I couldn't even tell you everything we tried.  My major complaint - we let the server order.  It's great if you don't know what you want, but the guy ripped us off so badly we wanted to cry.  He saw a party of 6, instant gratuity on a check, and ordered us pretty much the most expensive things on the menu.  When we got the tab, we almost died out of shock, surprise, and instant regret.  I understand that the servers need to make money, but seriously - don't purposely rip your customers off.  I could hardly enjoy such a delicious meal after paying the bill.  Such delicious food can be expensive, it's high quality and reputation can warrant high prices, so my complaint isn't in the cost of the food, it is instead of the ethics of this particular situation.  Not to say that every server here would do this, but to each his own I guess."}
{"text":"Now that I know this place is owned by Robert De Niro, I will NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the excellent amazing taste flavor at Nobu. Service was excellent. The quality of food they serve here is bar none really high standards and you can taste it with every bite recommend this place. Keep in mind pretty pricey"}
{"text":"Wow. This place was so good that my new hubs and I dined here not once but twice during our week long Vegas weddingmoon at Caesars Palace. The menu can be confusing, so as a first time diner you'll be well guided by your knowledgeable and kind server as we were both times. It is a tapas style Japanese restaurant but there are plenty of options if you'd prefer not to do all shared plates. Both times we got the rockshrimp tempura in the creamy sauce-SLAMMIN.com They have regular edamame or the more fun and tasty kind which is tossed in a slightly spicy curry sauce topped with crushed peanuts. Get the fun kind. The nobu style tacos are little bites of heaven which you will dream about. They are only a bite size taco-literally one bite-but they will change your tastebuds lives. We tried the raw tuna, lobster and crab ones. So fresh. So good. Uhhh so gooood. The black cod was another dish worth mentioning, cooked to perfection with a sweet glaze. Some tasty sushi rolls included the spicy tuna, and both yellowtail rolls, one with scallions another with jalepeno-little kick but yum!! While it is certainly not cheap here, it really wasn't unreasonably priced. Plus, you're inVegas, things are more expensive. Luckily at Nobu the splurge is well worth it. Kinda wish we could go just one more time but DE is super far away from Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is like a museum inside and expensive as hell, but oh is it worth it.  If you love quality, beauty and tasteful Japanese food, this is the place.  My hubby and I always like to go here if we are going to happen to be in the Vegas area and are never disappointed.  We even got to see a few celebs here and there.  The Tony Gonzalez passed right by me and I almost fainted.  hehe  just kidding hubby.  The rock shrimp is to die for, the sushi is perfect, even the little river stone they give you at the table to rest your chopsticks on is perfect.  This is definitely not your average Japanese restaurant so if you're looking for an experience, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The tasting menu was actually filling and of course delicious. It is a a very long dinner which took about 3 hours all in all due to so many people doing the same tasting menu. They did run out of desserts which took the longest 45 min to get the desserts to our table but over all our server and the entire staff was very helpful and pleasant."}
{"text":"Nobu is a swanky, chic Japanese restaurant located in Caesar Palace. Like Vegas itself, the décor of the restaurant is to invoke a \"larger than life\" sense of wonder. From the oversize light fixtures inspired by Japanese tea whisks to the columns of bamboo, the design of the restaurant transports you to another world. The service is attentive as you would expect at a high end sushi restaurant.  We did the chef tasting menu. Each course was brought out like it was an act in a theatrical production. The plating was masterful. Some of the standouts include the sushi, sashimi and black cod. The sushi and sashimi were fresh a beautifully crafted. The black cod miso that is marinated and broiled melts in your mouth. Make sure you leave room for dessert.  If you are a sushi lover, you cannot go wrong with Nobu. It is pricey, but you are paying for an experience - not just a meal."}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:06pm .... Reservations were for 10:00 pm ..... We walked up and realized our reservations were cancelled. The host went to talk to the manager by the name of PATRICK ... He came over and let us know that the chefs had put all food away. I am just confused on how it could have hurt to pull out food and accomodate a guest of 3. The manager proceeds to mention how they haven't had any guests in an hour so they packed up fast. I wad trying to figure out what did that have to do with the price of tea in China, and furthermore what that had to do with us. He made it seem as if that was our fault that they had made no money in the last hour. This is so sad, I am in Vegas all the time. I have eaten at every Nobu there is ... I.E. Nobu Malibu, Nobu Hollywood, this is ridiculous. Certainly not the way to treat paying customers. Patrick needs to ge taught a thing or two about customer service. How is he the manager. Wow Wow Wow...... I can't think of any reason he would cancel our reservation, and tell us we couldn't sit 6 mins past our reservation. The only thing I could think of is because we were BLACK .... So Sad in 2017"}
{"text":"Nobu is very good. But...as others have said, it is pricey and it adds up quickly if you're not careful. My husband and I tried the Nobu style tacos (chicken and vegetable respectively), I got the vegetable skewers (kushiyaki) and the tofu toban-yaki, and my husband got the free range chicken dish with the spicy sauce (can't recall what it was called). He tried a midrange sake recommended by our waiter, and I got a glass of the plum wine. I was 100% happy with everything I ordered, except the skewers. They were 50% onion. (I don't know about you, but I don't eat big hunks of onion on their own.) That being said....the eggplant was delicious and the Peruvian corn on the side was very good. The tofu toban-yaki was amazing! Delicious broth and plenty of tofu to fill me up. We were too full to try some sushi or dessert afterward. I'd probably go back, but maybe with a big group and be more willing to really splurge on a variety of things. Just a tip--they tell you that they serve food in a certain style so that you can try everything together, but that doesn't work if you eat different foods as we do. In hindsight I would have asked them to bring food out together in courses. And a warning--I'm sure it's great fun to let them design a menu for you, but it's also probably VERY expensive! :)"}
{"text":"We had a bachelorette dinner here with 5 girls and it did not disappoint! We did the tasting menu where they give you an option to spend a certain amount per person and send out items based on your preferences. We wanted to stick with seafood. Everything was AMAZING! Our waiter knew exactly what we wanted and kept helping in to ensure we were full and there was enough food. I would go back here again and again. It was pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"you must be tripping if you think this restaurant deserves 4+ stars. how the hell can you justify $20+ for seared hamachi with jalapeno? It's the same damn dish served by 50%+ of the other japanese restaurants out there, except it's $10 more expensive!  The quality of the food isn't bad, but it sure isn't on par with a Sasabune or Sushi-Zo. And there's nothing innovative about the menu at all that you cant get from most other japanese restaurants, so quality is really a big weighing factor here!  I get that there's a certain premium that you're expected to pay to dine at a prime location in Caesars, but they are literally bending you over the table, pulling down your pants, and....well, you get the idea.  The service was pretty good, so if you are looking to have dinner in a nice, upscale restaurant, and don't mind paying exorbitantly for decent food, then by all means this would be a respectable choice. But just know that you can very easily take a cab 10 min off the strip to any number of japanese restaurants that serve same or higher quality dishes at 1/3  ~ 1/2 of the cost.  I was browsing through a yelp review while i was there to see what to order, and i actually saw a reviewer sitting at the table next to us who gave the restaurant 5 stars. She was eating some maki rolls by nudging a roll with her chopsticks...onto a spoon, and then eating out of the spoon. Her bf is a lucky, lucky man...."}
{"text":"Nothing will top this not only sushi but food experience. Talk about fine dining, great and customer service!!   I was staying at at the hard rock as a random Vegas trip vacation and decided that night Nobu will be the kick off to my birthday month :)   Luckily it was a Tuesday night so my date and I didn't have to wait. We sat, he got a Japanese beer and I endured in a Lychee Martini (my favorite)  I saw toro on the menu and I was set.  Toro tartar was amazing! Also toro sashimi and we got a few more delightful dishes. I would go again! Now I must visit the la location!! This place made my Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutley love the food, atmosphere and service at Nobu. I'm in Vegas often for business and Nobu is always on the itinerary."}
{"text":"This was THE most disappointing dining experience.  I have been wanting to experience Nobu for years.  Our server was lazy and not attentive.  He did not bother to explain any dish and bypassed having any menu discussion and order for our entire table.  Half of our group did not agree with this method of ordering but the server proceeded regardless.  We tried to intervene but he had already placed orders for us.  Each round of dishes were dropped and barely identified.  Tastes were decent but the quality was no where near the price range and lack of front staff professionals.  I feel cheated by our horrible service and lack of any effort.  Never again will I eat here"}
{"text":"Orgasmic experience.  Butter lettuce salad. Watermelon tempura soft shell crab There are so many favorite dishes I can't event think right now!  It is just so good. An experience.  Make reservations to go hear! Ask for Jonathan, he is always our server... I almost don't want to give his name out so we could keep him all to ourselves."}
{"text":"Food:  Top notch with excellent presentation.  The Toro Tartar in Wasabi sauce and Black Stone Shrimp were stand outs.  The nigiri and miso soup were actually a little disappointing and were at or below average.  Service:  Excellent.  Very fast and attentive the whole time.  Always came to clean the table between courses and keep my coffee topped off.  Price:  Surprisingly, the fixed price menu was pretty reasonable.  Given that three of us spent only $375 including 4 beers, 3 x $100 Omakasas, and extra orders of the shrimp, I thought it was very fair relative to the $250 we would have spent at any other good LV restaurant.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places ...  Tuna jalapeño with yuzu, black cod and sushi are absolutely my favorite items on the menu.  We tried three items not on the menu this time.    1. The tuna belly with truffles was a splurge, but unique and worth trying.  2. Scallops with uni butter were delicious, but not as \"special\" as number one.  Probably wouldn't reorder.  3. New York strip ...  Nothing special.  Not sure why we ordered steak in a sushi place.  Tried two sakes ... Both were not the top end, but we're really great and enjoyed by all.  Caesars is definitely a more convenient location, but think I like the feel and vibe at the hard rock better.  Always an amazing meal here.  Servers were pretty knowledgable, however I did feel they were constantly looking for ways to recommend the most expensive alternatives ... They also made a mistake and triple charged me for a 60 dollar menu item.  Suspicious ... But they fixed it."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. And when we found out there was a Nobu here (see my NYC review since I had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! I was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there.   The decor is similar to New York's Nobu, but not as big and not as nice. The service is not as good but it's Vegas so oh well.  We ordered:  Peach Martini and Lychee martini - very good but strong.  Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce - This was fucking good. One of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (See below for Kristine N's review). They prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! It was GREAT!  Lobster salad - Of course I had to order this! I love the salad dressing.   Miso black cod - The cool thing about Nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. This was fantastic and sweet.  Chilean Sea bass w/ mushrooms - The bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not Chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. It was still very good though. YUMMM.  Squid pasta - I love the squid pasta here. Complimented w/ asparagus. I love asparagus!  Rock shrimp tempura - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. Yummy.  Bento box - flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. This was better than I remembered from NYC. It's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. It was great, and gooey in the middle.   Mango caramel ice-cream dessert - A light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.  One of the girls and I are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (See below for Kristine N.'s review!) That tells ya something! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because I hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)  It was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. By the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.  Yay, for Nobu!!!"}
{"text":"The review is for teppanyaki.   Service: I took off one star for reservation. I made a reservation online for 8pm and requested for teppanyaki seating. When I arrived, I was informed that the chefs wouldn't be available till 9pm, so I had to wait. I wish they could call me in advance to let me know, instead of telling me when I'm already there. But once we were seated, the service was excellent. attentive, efficient and friendly.   Food: we opt for the $190 and $280 set. Both were great. I'm glad we didn't order the same set, so we got to try a little bit of everything.   $190 set: loved the Japanese A5 Wagyu, King Crab Tempura, XO chicken fried rice (liked the chicken more than $280 crab fried rice).   $280 Set: loved the lobster, scallop with uni, Foie Gras (the best!), Foie Miso Cappuccino. Didn't like the crab fried rice, was a bit fishy somehow.   Loved the bottle of sake as well.   Bill came about $700 for 2 people, but it is worth it :)"}
{"text":"You say they have a groupon for $95? Plus an additional 15% off?!  Sooo totally there.  It was worth it! $145 value (I manually calculated it...lol) Amazing 5 course tasting menu that caters to 2 and they are all standard sized portions. Not to mention, everything was insanely scrumptious! I would buy this exact groupon over-and-over again if the opportunity arises.  I've been burned by groupon before, where the restaurant would shamefully treat us like second-class citizens. Nope, not at Nobu - they treated us like VIP from start to finish. We were also celebrating our anniversary that evening and our server and all of the top-notch staff, made sure we enjoyed ourselves. We felt extremely taken care of (plus it was a busy night for them.)  Complimentary to start the unforgettable evening:  + Sparking voss water - bossy!  + Extra plump and sweet, steamed edamame with delicious crunchy maldon salt - savor every morsel  Accompaniments:  + Freshly brewed soy sauce. The flavor was smooth and refined + Fresh wasabi paste - talk about a head kick! Also smooth, bold and wonderful flavor + Crisp pickled ginger - perfect palate cleanser. Not overly sweet or sour, just right  5 courses:  //Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and cilantro// $25 You better believe it's better than butter. Enjoy a little piece of cilantro in every bite, to brighten up all of the flavors.   //California roll & chefs selection nigiri// $44 Tuna, fluke, salmon. Flip them, enjoy fish-side-down and let the fish just melt on your tongue. Each fish was extremely fresh, sweet, and delectable. Also, I never thought I would say this, but even the simple CA roll was scrumptious! The sushi rice was cooked to mouthwatering perfection. I was so upset when it was all gone.  //Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce// $24 Extra crispy and battered to extreme perfection. The addicting crunch makes it so wonderful. Subtle spices and perfectly creamy. Make sure to eat it with the spicy arugula and sweet baby greens underneath - they really add in another dimension of flavor!   //Black Cod Miso// $37 The dish that put Nobu on the map - Black Cod Miso with pickled ginger root. Sweet, luscious, and sensational. The fish was prepared with extreme precision.   //Bento Box// $15 Happy anniversary written in beautiful script using white chocolate sauce, with a warm molten chocolate fondant cake garnished with berries, shiso syrup, scrumptious green tea ice cream and a surprising, rich expresso soaked tiramisu topped with a Nobu emblem cracker. They were all beyond perfection. I can firmly state that Nobu also has desserts down to a delicious science.   Nobu offered us an unforgettable dining experience and such a romantic anniversary, we are already looking forward to our return."}
{"text":"This place is honestly the best restaurant I have EVER been to! Although the price is sky rocketing, you are definitely paying for the quality AND quantity. I came with a party of four and we did a customized menu where we paid $100 per person and told the waitress our favorites and dislikes in sushi, beef, and rolls. There is about 7-10 dishes that comes out and with each one you can tell them your preferences. After eating MAKE SURE YOU GET THE DESSERT! It's included anyways! And they top it off with an amazing passion fruit shaved ice with guava sorbet dessert. This place is MUST!"}
{"text":"As vegetarians always encouraged by Japanese, Indian..restaurants, they usually have spices well-placed, cooked perfectly, and this did not let us down.  We started with the Yuba - They boil soy milk, in an open shallow pan, a film or skin forms on the liquid surface. The films are collected and dried into yellowish sheets known as tofu skin. They cook it with ginger-soy sauce. So delicious! ($18)  Along with a glass of Merlot ($16) and a glass of Layer Cake ($15). Both great, a bit pricey but hey, it is Vegas.  Spinach Salad with crunchy miso ($17) and Shojin Tempura (mixed vegetables - $16) -WOW great flavor on both.  We enjoyed all of it, our waitress was attentive, polite and helpful. The music was fun and not. Too loud. The environment just a bit dressy, a few folks in jeans."}
{"text":"Why you should go to Nobu LV:  1. Cause everyone needs to go to Nobu once in their life...why not Vegas 2. The calamari pasta is outta this world. A must have. BUT, don't let me set your expectations too high. 3. Overall experience is  warm, satisfying and sorta exciting - hey, it's Nobu.  Why you should not go to Nobu LV: 1. If you're going to Nobu, you're either a foodie, looking for a trendy spot or from Japan and need your rice (like the table next to us). Well, while the food is pretty darn good, I heard the other spots - Honolulu, NYC etc have a hipper vibe. 2. You want to save money to eat during the rest of your trip. We gorged out and ended up spending at least $150 each.  3. You want to stick on the strip. While the Hard Rock isn't very far, it'd be cool if Nobu was in the midst of the chaos. On the other hand, maybe it's off-strip locale protects it...not sure on that one.  In any case, try it. You won't regret it. At least you can say you been to Nobu - like I basically am in this review."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is a little pricey but the menu and service make it well worth it. If you're going for sushi in Vegas this is the place to go."}
{"text":"ONE of my very favorite sushi restaurants... here is what I love.. No res.. The staff was instrumental in working us in amongst the planned and organized with reservations..ITS Saturday nite enroute to Tao, we opted to take the cab to Nobu.. and do a sidestep of Tao for Nobu... AND that is because my friends and I were looking for primo sushi.. having told you my nite in Vegas as it unfolded.. I will now get to the review! Feeling a bit clubby in our dresses, stillettos and all of our long hair.... WE decided to sit at the sushi bar (I admit I would hate if my clan showed up with the 'here we are' attitude on Sat nite wanting to be seated amongst the mix AND now, dammit!)... The chef was entertaining and suggestive of many sashimi choices and sushi options... he just said, 'hed take care of us', and the rest followed.. amongst sake... and many, many varieties of sushi/sashimi between my group.. I didnt have one thing that I didnt love!  Pricey.. maybe..worth it..Absolutely..  AND now to Tao.."}
{"text":"Was seated hour and a half after reservation. Got food to table an hour after that. Service sucked. Food was average, not worth price.   When asked by the bus boy (not the waiter) how the meal was, I replied not too good. His response to that was 'not too good huh?' and then 'where are you staying? I can hook you up with some club passes, I know a guy.'   Never coming back. Try Morimoto's, food, service, and experience are top notch and not run by clowns like this place."}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I've ever had.  Sushi, drink, dessert, service, everything was perfect.  It definitely lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Nobu, is a must stop whenever i'm in Vegas. This is the best sushi you will ever taste and the service and ambiance is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Excellent!, Excellent!  Everything was perfect. Let's start with the service our waiter was the best I've had in a long time. He was friendly and super attentive. He spent time to get to know our tastes and make menu suggestions. Our glasses were never empty and he was extremely aware of my wife's allergies and accommodated her. The drinks were amazing the Japanese whiskey menu was extremely deep with several price points. I had the martini that was made with bellevadere and saki served with cucumbers. It was so good light and refreshing and paired well with the sushi. Since this was my first time at Nobu I opted for the waiter to choose my 7 course meal for 125 dollars per person. I was not disappointed, all the courses of sushi were very unique and super fresh.  I can't recommend this place enough it's worth every dollar spent because you will never have a unique dining experience like this!"}
{"text":"The food and service are both excellent but the price is really in the stratosphere! Sashimi heaven at a high price."}
{"text":"Terrible experience in terms of price and service. First at all the food is not autentic at all. After living 5 years in Japan I can tell it. Second too overpriced for such bad sushi (rolled in very fast way \"?????\") and not tasty miso soup. Probably server forgot my order so that's why it took more than one hour to get my simple salmon roll. Definitely I won't be back again. I could have a great buffet for the same price and not be so hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi experience I've had on the Las vegas strip so far and I've tried many of them out here.   If you can you should sit at the sushi bar instead of going for a table, you get your own personal sushi chef giving you their expert advise on how to enjoy their creations.   It is pricey, but lets keep it real what isn't pricey on this damm strip? If you can splurge a little for sushi, I would suggest you do it here.   My Lady and I ordered the \"Sushi Omakase\" which is a chef's choice of 14 pieces of unique nigiri sushi.  It averages out to about $10 per piece but it was well worth it. So good!"}
{"text":"Nobu is possibly my favorite restaurant in the entire universe! I've been to three locations; the one in Malibu being the best because of its location overlooking the ocean. The Nobu at Caesars Palace however, is a close second.   The ambiance is relaxing. The lighting is dim without being too dark. I'm always impressed with how quiet it is even when it's really busy. It's refreshing to not have to yell across the table to have a conversation.   The food of course is to die for. Every dish is a work of art. As a photographer and visual person, I tend to eat with my eyes first. I usually get the same thing each time but occasionally branch out and try something new.   If you can't decide what you want it's always fun to let the chef choose for you. Just tell them the types of sushi you usually gravitate towards and they bring you a feast!   I recommend the White Fish Tiradito. The sauce is tangy with a little bit of a kick! Also try the Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna. The presentation is genius. The crispy rice comes in little cubes that act as serving trays for the tuna. The tuna is reminiscent of a mixture of ingredients you might find in a spicy tuna roll, but of course the quality is totally amplified."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Service is amazing the waiter is always around and reachable. The food that was recommended to us by the waiter was phenomenal. We had the yellowtail with jalapeños, chicken, and spicy tuna rolls (ask for crunch) and they were all amazing. This place is worth the money especially if you are in the mood for something super tasty."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but the service is horrible. My waiter could not remember our order. After the meal was finished, he finally brought out my wife's steak. They also consistently forgot to bring drinks. Great name and good food, but they fell short today."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my bf's birthday, and it was a great experience! I know there's one in BH, but that's too long of a drive for me, so when we went to Vegas, we had to try it.   Overall, I was truly impressed by the great service we received. The explanation of each item that we ordered by the waiter was amazing. The sushi was delicious and of course, fresh. There was one that totally stood out to the other dishes we had, it was their grilled fish. I can't recall which fish it was, but it was so moist and it litterally melted in my mouth.   Although very pricey, I would totally recommend this restaurant, especially for any special occasion. Overall, we had an amazing time!"}
{"text":"The decor was very nice. I didn't get to try much of their sushi/sashimi selection. I wasn't a fan of their sautéed, cooked dishes. I heard great things about the restaurant but wasn't very impressed when I tried it myself."}
{"text":"Great food! but the service... absolutely horrific I've been to locations in LA and Malibu and never have I experienced anything like this! it was my cousins birthday and a party of 6. of course we expect gratuity on the bill, however, what you don't expect is for the waiter to ask for your ID after the fact your credit card has been ran for a $500 bill! who does that.. then I go to the bar for cocktails after dinner & the bartender automatically put 2 other persons on my bill with out asking! then when one party asks for their bill he trys to say he cant split? well who the heck said we were on one bill!!! we all approached the bar 30 minutes apart... How rude!! You assume because we are all black girls?? I cant!! Ive spent too much money in Nobu to be disrespected.."}
{"text":"Perfect end to our epic Girls Vacay!  I want to give a special shout out to our server who rocked (pun intended). The service was phenomenal!   Our theme of the weekend turned out to be LMFAO's 'Sorry for Party Rockin' and when we told our server he let us keep our zen rocks, get it? Rocking! Aw, good times.  Must haves: - Black Cod with Miso  - Toro Sashimi (Shout out to our waiter who helped me trick my friends who were squimish about trying fatty Bluefin tuna belly. He told them it was compliments of the chef. After they fell in love with it we told them the truth and enjoyed a good laugh about it.) - Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - Spicy Tuna Rolls  - Dessert: The chef's tasting platter was so yummy that someone swooped on a part of mine. They even put candles on it for the girls birthdays.  I would also like to note that the presentation of dishes was extremely entertaining. Their descriptions are as magical as the flavors. I want to give a special thanks to the server who served Jessica H.'s dish with such an amazing description that it left the entire table wishing we had ordered chicken teriyaki.  At this point I must admit that our two large Daigijo sakes prevent me from making any other recommendations. I can honestly say that the food and service were amazing and the tab was worth every penny. I cannot wait to go back or perhaps try the NYC location.  Side Bar:  Bathroom situation: I hated that the bathroom was outside the restaurant and is shared with the not so lovely patrons of Rehab Day Club. At least Hard Rock was nice enough to install a syringe disposal.   On the bright side we also found out that Nobu will be opening a location at Cesar's Palace, which I think will be a much better fit for this fabulous culinary experience.  The table next to us was doing Omakase style. So jelly, it looked amazing! When I go to the Cesar's location I will be doing Omakase."}
{"text":"Nobu was nogood. The vegetarian fare was far from flavorful. Tobanyaki tofu was basically strips of tofu (unfried) in what looked like butter and soy sauce (was on the edge of being fat-grossed out). Todu itself having no flavor, the dish was unimaginative to say the least.  The vegetarian sushi was tasteless, textureless. Maybe i am not a sushi connoisseur but local stores, whole foods, trader joes, have better tasting veggie sushi.  Kushiyaki with vegetables with a peruvian or chilean i cant remember was very good. Finally something with flavor.  As i have come to notice, nonindian chefs dont understand vegetarian foods are not like meat, seafood where the meats have their own flavors and spicing them actually detracts from intended flavors. Vegetables really need additional help with spices. Even some salt in the sushi would have made it better.  It is a dimly lit place where you struggle to read the menu. And all of the above nearly rocked $60. Waiter was pretty good."}
{"text":"So I'm a BIG sushi fan and this was by far the best I've ever eaten.  The black cod with miso is like fish candy, and the yellowfin with jalapeno was probably my favorite dish of the night.  I'd also highly recommend the toro roll if you're into rolls. It was incredible.  The only dish I didn't care much for was the fried rock shrimp but the overall meal was still out of this world."}
{"text":"Nirvana - pure nirvana. My taste buds were happy, I was very happy.   My BF too me here (my first trip) for our Saturday Night Dinner. We knew when we walked in that we were having the Omakase. I truly cannot pick out one single dish that I liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. Our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. Though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. My only sadness with the sake is that I can't buy it anywhere since it is made for Nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???)   Course 1: Kumomoto Oysters, wrapped in smoked salmon with osetra caviar, served with endive and asparagus in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet AND spicy? Oysters? What is not to love?)   Course 2: Shima Aji Sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (I'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!)   Course 3: Bluefin tuna sashimi topped with garlic puree and sliced jalapeno, served with jalapeno emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! You know I like spice in my life!)   Course 4: Tasmanian trout trout and seared sweet shrimp sashimi salad served with mache, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only I could find this in DC)   Course 5: Pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in yuzu soy sauce   Course 6: Grilled washu beef with eared foie gras, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction   Course 7: Soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - HUGE); Loved the little enoki mushrooms in it!   Course 8: Sushi: One standout for me - salt water eel with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil and lemon together. Wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). Not that the other offerings weren't good.   Course 9: Dessert. Panna Cotta (I think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was AWESOME!   Final: Three types of fruit sake. My favorite was the ginger.   I have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again."}
{"text":"Not a bad Japanese - Peruvian restaurant. We had two of the multi-course chef specials. The ingredients were great, presentation decent, and creative preparations ok. I would have much rather had a regular entree from one of the grills in the middle of several large tables. We weren't offered this option, so it may be something you have to specifically request."}
{"text":"Most amazing sushi restaurant that I've ever been to.  This is a new location inside of the Caesars Palace and it's absolutely amazing.   We came with a small group of people and had great selection of food and beverage.   If your visiting or live in Vegas then this is a MUST"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by this restaurant.  I ordered a yellow tail sushi roll, a margarita cocktail, followed by a blue fin tartare with some ossetra caviar.  The drink was good, the yellow tail roll was average (anything you would expect from your local strip mall sushi bar,) the tartare dish ($51) a little bit larger then the size of a silver dollar with something on top that resembled caviar but was nowhere close - the real ossetra caviar is famous for very distinct and succulent kernels.  What I got was something squeezed out of a paste tube on top of raw tuna - yes, yummy!  The bill came to over $100 including tip and I left very hungry and feeling completely ripped off.  Even by Vegas standards this was highway robbery.  Shame on you, Nobu!"}
{"text":"No doubt that their fish is fresh and high quality but it was way overpriced. The signature black cod was great but it wasn't good enough for its price. I'd recommend to try their sushi/sashimi and cold appetizer  only, that's the only way to get your money worth. And drink before you go, buy your own sake because their house sake was whopping $44 for 12oz."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!    The ambiance is very soothing and almost makes you forget that you are in the loud bustling Caesars Palace. The bills came out to about $90 per person, but I can honestly say that is 100% worth every penny. This is the type of restaurant that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime.  I had the black miso cod and the pork belly skewers.  Every single bite completely melts in your mouth. In a single word... Umami.  The servers here also were great at pairing drinks with your order to maximize the flavor profile.  To end my meal, my server recommended the chocolate cake with green tea bento box.  I am by no means a sweet tooth. In fact, I actually do not like sweet foods... But OH MY GOD!  This was the best ending to my favorite meal ever. I can confidently say now that this is my new 'death row meal'!  I left the restaurant completely satisfied, yet wanting to return back even though I was already full.  No matter what it takes, you must come try this amazing restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the food and service both times were amazing! My friends and I went with omakase (chefs choice) and each dish was delicious. Our servers Adrienne and Thuy explained each dish and or drink perfectly and all the other servers made sure our dishes were clean and waters were filled. The manager and chefs came out and greeted us on both visits. I would go back again and I will always suggest my friends to go there. If you are a sushi fanatic, please visit nobu at hard rock!"}
{"text":"I'm speechless. Ironically, I have so much to say about this delightful restaurant. This is not Japanese food. Nor is it Peruvian food. Nobu is a cuisine all on its own.  Billy, our server, did a phenomenal job explaining the menu with useful information about anything from the exclusive sake one can only find at Nobu or the freshly juiced cucumbers for the pepino cocktail to the specially crafted plateware and utensils designed specifically for Nobu. He was friendly and trustworthy...which is good because we let him choose our menu.  I won't list everything we ordered (which is A LOT), but I do want to highlight the stars of the show:  - New Style Salmon Sashimi: perfectly fresh, expertly sliced salmon, dusted with sesame seeds, thin julienne of ginger, and splashed with yuzu soy. And then...wait for it....doused with a mixture of hot sesame and extra virgin olive oils. Wow. Just wow.  - Blue Fin Oh Toro Tartare with Golden Osetra caviar: Need I say more? The finest part (the belly) of the finest tuna money can buy topped with decadent, salty sturgeon roe. This is all set in a stringent wasabi-soy vinaigrette (which was so good that I slurped it up after the tuna was gone).  - Black Cod Lettuce Wraps: We also ordered the famous Black Cod Miso which was, of course, melt-in-your-mouth divine. But the manager also brought this interpretation out for us to try. I must say that THIS preparation is the way to go for such a richly fatty dish. The light herbal freshness of the butter lettuce mellows the unctuous richness of the almost stew-like texture of the fish. The thin slices of ginger cuts through the sweet-saltiness of the miso. I can't say enough about this preparation.  - Japanese A5 Wagyu: Cooked on hot stones table side, flambeed with brandy, served with a cracked pepper teriyaki and some seasonal roasted vegetables. I really don't need to say anything else about it. It's true Wagyu: the best beef you can find. Fatty, flavorful, rich. Chef Nobu's genius shines through again by serving it with such an impishly simple, yet perfectly balanced sauce. The veggies were perfectly cooked and delicious as well. Also, the rocks are placed on a bed of kosher salt. I like to take some of that and sprinkle it on the meat for a little added texture and seasoning.  - Tempura shrimp roll: simple and perfect. The rice was balanced, chewy and seasoned well. What really stood out in this lovely morsel was the perfectly blanched asparagus: delicate, crunchy and beautiful bright green. I've eaten this roll a thousand times, but never has it been this good.  - Finally, we have gotten to dessert. The shaved ice was light as a cloud and the mango and green tea syrups that were served along side were tart, sweet and succulent. The best part about this dish was the little bites of fruit and mochi hidden beneath the surface. It was the kind of dessert that got better with each bite. The bento box, however....HOLY CRAPOLA! Again, I've eaten molten chocolate cake a zillion times, but this one takes the...well...cake? I'm not usually one to rave (or even care much) about dessert, but I've never eaten anything as delicious as this. This is THE best dessert I have ever eaten. White chocolate sauce, white chocolate shiso syrup, green tea ice cream and whatever those cookie crumbles are holding the ice cream in place worked so unbelievably well together.  I'm tired of writing. I'm sure you're tired of reading. Go to Nobu. Go there now. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"All-around delicious. Very popular and bustling. Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, delicious. Rock shrimp tempura with spicy sauce, delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant does it right. Service is attentive but unobtrusive. Ordered yellow tail with jalapeño. This dish was sublime! Mixed cerviche,miso cod, and waygu potstickers were also great. We ordered various sushi rolls to round out the evening.  Modern design, good spacing of tables and carpet to mute sound allow you to have conversation with your dinner companion without shouting. I was there for a conference and my other friends had the same excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Went on a solo trip to Las Vegas and stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  Thought the Nobu was a little out of place there as I had been to the Nobu in New York, but decided to give it a try.  Ordered a serving of the sake, some black miso cod (apparently a Robert DeNiro favorite) and the Omakase.  Chef Tetsu-san made me an amazing meal tailored to my wishes: mainly Uni and Toro compositions.  And the great conversation with the two entrepreneurs from Jersey beside me made the evening even better.  Definitely would give it a try if you are staying at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambiance. How did it get stuck in the hard rock?  The yellowtail and jalapeño rolls were very good, and the bento box finished the meal perfectly. We did swap out the green tea ice cream for milk ice. And it was GOOD!"}
{"text":"Make reservations because this place gets busy !! And there's a great reason as to why.... the food is AMAZING !!  I had several sushi rolls and hand rolls which were all wonderful. They were not that large, so I was definitely still hungry, but the prices were almost double what I normally pay for sushi.  A couple of the girls ordered the tasting menu which can cost anywhere from $110-150 but was definitely worth it !! You get about 5 sushi plates, 4 dinner plates, and dessert. The portions aren't large, but after all the different items you do get to eat you will definitely be full.  The service here is excellent. Our waiter knew the menu like the back of his hand and each plate that came out he explained what was in the dish. They were very tentative with our drinks and was always making sure we were enjoying our meal.  Next time I will definitely come back to try the tasting menu"}
{"text":"Nobu used to be the shining star 10 years ago when these babies started popping up all over the US in fancy-pants areas like Malibu but since that time other Japanese chefs have come into play and the glamor and innovation of the Nobu chain has faded.  The good news is that you can still come to Nobu and get a great meal.  If you want to feel satisfied you will still drop a lot of $$$.  Perhaps stop by the convenience store on your way over and fill up on a candy bar before eating here to avoid the full financial exposure.    My friend and I ate here before seeing Guns N Roses play at The Joint on a Friday night.  Most weekend nights will see Nobu booked up at least until 9PM.  It is open seating in the bar area but this area is tiny.  Nobu strictly enforces their dress policy so no swimming trunks.  It is dinner only so if you are hankering for Nobu at lunch sorry Charlie.  My favorite things were their pop rock shrimp, sea bass and fresh salmon sashimi.  Their hand rolls are pretty awesome too.  We split a bottle of cold sake that was excellent though a bit overpriced.  Our waiter was a complete snob but I will let that slide.  I highly recommend Nobu for a tasty sushi dining experience."}
{"text":"For a few hundred per person, Ive had better sushi, but it was still good eats. I actually preferred their hot dishes better (the black cod is like butter)."}
{"text":"Very good place if you are into sushi with a flare of fusion. Very trendy, a little too small in my opinion, but well worth it if you have a couple of bills to burn. Decor was your typical hip sushi joint. Dark subtle tones, nice dishes, pebbles to lay your chopsticks, and bamboo decorated everywhere. Service was awesome as they were very friendly, attentive, and informative. The servers went into great detail of each dish that we asked about, how the fish is cut/prepared, cooked, marinated, blah blah blah. My favorite dishes here were the chilean sea bass over buttered lettuce, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. A table next to us ordered rock shrimp tempura in a spicy sauce, so being the food envious kind of guy I am, I ordered one for our table...unfortunately it was the worst dish we've had here as the sauce used was too overbearing and salty. it was a creamy spicy red sauce similar to a dynamite sauce used in other sushi joints. For some reason, it just didn't go well with the texture of the rock shrimp tempura. Other than that, Nobu was a great experience and would definitely come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"I really really don't get the hype over Nobu. Yeah, the decor is beautiful, the presentation of the food is great, it's always filled with fun people and it's in the Hard Rock Hotel (one of my favorite hotels in Vegas)...BUUUUUUUUUUUT the food is waaay overrated. I'm Japanese so I think I have a pretty good idea of what good Japanese food is. This wasn't it. Sorry."}
{"text":"Horrible Service & You DON't Get What You Pay For!!! They say its \"Family Style\" ...Only If You Order 6 If The Same Thing!!! Way Overpriced!!! Takes Forever To Get You Food!!! NEVER WILL GO BACZk!!!"}
{"text":"Very over rated. I consider myself a sushi connoisseur. I eat sushi more than I want to admit. This place strongly suggest to allow the waiter to \" have the chef come up with a custom menu for you based on your tastes. What a joke. I watched our waiter closely. He didn't speak to a chef once and simply racked up a massive bill for my 3 colleagues and me. The food was good but a dinner for four at $286 per head was a joke. I could have taken 8 people to the finest sushi in town for less. Stay away it's just not close to worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times.  All times was spectacular! The first time was my birthday celebration, the chilean seabass was to die for!! Melts in your mouth. The second time my best friends boyfriends company rented it out for a 50th anniversary event.  They had models walking around with spray-painted gold outfits, open bar, open bar sushi, great great party! And several other times I went with friends.  The fatty fish sushi was melt in your mouth deelish!! I love the ambiance, food, and the service was great."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week and the menu looked great. There was 3 of us so we were able to get all the selected items. However, there weren't many pieces to share. We left hungry but it was for a good cause. The staff was on point and friendly."}
{"text":"Omg omg.  So amazing. Don't come here unless u got $$$ to spend. The teppanyaki menu starts at 90$ . The steak and chicken was like heaven.  Oh my. If I was a millionaire I'd live here. The service is impeccable and the ambiance is amazing. Love it"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Nobu in Vegas and once again I was pleasantly surprised. It started with our waiter, very friendly and helpful. He even asked what budget we had and offered to choose our entrees for us. I only had 2 must haves: The Halibut sashimi with jalapeno slivers on each slice.. yummers! I also love the tiny tacos (no idea what is in them but they are scrumptious). Everything else was great from the kabobs to sushi rolls.  Another thing I enjoy about this place is the list of beverages. We only had cocktails but they have several sake cocktails that are oh so tasty.  The menu can be overwhelming so I suggest you ask your server what he/she recommends so you get to taste the best of the best Nobu has to offer.  Atmosphere is very Vegas, dark and loud. Don't be surprised if you get hit on!!"}
{"text":"Nobu! Nobu! Nobu! Nobu! Nobu! Nobu! The Barrel aged old fashioned and sidecar were amazing drinks! The sushi rolls were very good and the jalapeno yellowtail was delicious! By far the best part of the meal was the blue crab hand roll, unbelievable! Worth the hype and the price!"}
{"text":"let me preface this review by saying that i am NOT a seafood lover. i dislike the fishy taste and smell. so when my friends wanted to do dinner at nobu during our visit to vegas, you can imagine my skepticism.   with that said.................. nobu not only met but exceeded any expectations that i had! every plate that i had was DELICIOUS. everything was fresh, no dirty fishy smell. i even had sashimi for the first time! the way that they pair their foods, whether its the sashimi with a small piece of jalapeno on top and light drips of soy sauce, or the black cod miso (the waiter warned us that no soy sauce was necessary... he was right! the cod looked plain but was marinated with SO MUCH flavor) wrapped in lettuce... or the tempura shrimp with a dash of seaweed sprinkled on top.. AMAZING. i just LOVED the food, the decor, and the presentation of the plates in general.  now, nobu has definitely changed my view and taste (or distaste, at least before!) for japanese food. of course, nobu has also made me a friggin japanese food SNOB, but that just shows that even though their food is pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.  i would DEFINITELY be willing to shell out some serious dough to eat here again.. i wish they had one in the bay area!!!!!"}
{"text":"From beginning to end , this was a fantastic evening . From the hostess to the personalized treatment given by the entire staff, you feel like a king.  The meal was multi layered and relaxed, along with the fine Saki left me feeling like I had died and gone to heaven.  The food and service are both top notch. It is a bit loud, but a fun atmosphere. It is totally worth the price. Eat here next time you are in Vegas!  Best Sushi ever!!!"}
{"text":"I had been to Nobu a couple times in the past, good sushi, nice rolls, nothing that blew me away.  That changed this last time.  I went with a group of colleagues and rather than order off the menu, we had the waiter pick some dishes and have them bring them out and it was fantastic.  We had a variety of fish dishes, some sliced super thin with great seasonings, my favorite was one that had a great ginger finish to it.  If you get the chance to let the waiters pick a variety of dishes for you, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. Ebi sushi, crab ceviche, soft shell crabs on watermelon....all delicious. Our second time there. Costly but enjoyable."}
{"text":"A great experience.  Compared to Morimoto's, Nobu's flavors are more familiar and can be regarded as deeper.  Though I would say that Morimoto is more innovative and his flavor palette is wider, perhaps much wider."}
{"text":"I tried Nobu for the first time last saturday and it definitely impressed with both quality and the variety of items on the menu. This is probably one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas but be aware it is always packed so prepare to wait, especially if you plan to dine during normal dinner hours. It is even difficult to get a reservation unless you make one several days in advance. The prices are quite high, even compared to other Nobu restaurants but the quality is arguably also a little higher as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. While it is very pricey it's some of the best food I've had in this town. The tasting menu is the best way to go to sample lots of different things. We weren't disappointed with a single dish. The service was also good."}
{"text":"First time here and this was totally not what I was expecting I think I confused the name with some noodle place I saw on television. I  thought it was a noodle place. And this is sushi. I am not a fan of seafood unless it's shrimp.   We walked up to the hostess stand and this polite young lady with long hair asked us  if we would like a table or to sit at the sushi bar. That is when I asked if this was just seafood. She said no there is beef and chicken. I was relieved. The decor is very Japanese. Bamboo on the wall, the ceiling had the wood and rice paper feel. Which gave a dim light, made it hard on my eyes to read the menu.   Thank god for Adrienne our server, because I know nothing about sushi and the menu had me lost. She was really nice and helped point out some good food! The chicken skewers with teriyaki were ok. The beef skewers with teriyaki were delicious, the meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. Each order is $13. I ordered a side of white rice $3. The shrimp rolls were amazing crunchy warm goodness and I'm not a sushi person but this is really good. My boyfriend ordered the spicy shrimp and I got to try that it was good, had some veggies in it.   The servings here are tapas bar size. It's good food but expensive as heck."}
{"text":"You fancy huh? Yes.. I sure am.  I had a super disappointing dinner the night before (Classic tasting dinner at Michael Mina), and needed something to really make it up.   I came here for dinner with a really good friend I hadn't seen in a long time. We had both been wanting to try the famed Nobu for soo long, that when we got there.. the menu seemed overwhelming. So, we (ok.. he) decided we should splurge for the Omakase menu! And I'm so glad we did. There are too many courses to go over, but the most memorable were the tuna tartar with caviar, black cod and the dessert. SOO good!!  I'm so glad we went here for dinner.. The service was excellent, the decor was nice, and the food delish!  Definitely a great date spot.. teehee. :)"}
{"text":"So -- since her younger sister spent her birthday in London . . . actually, we spent my wife's birthday in Paris, but her birthday fell while we were still out of the country -- when we asked what she wanted to for her birthday, she quite matter-of-factly replied, \"Vegas, baby!\"  OK, so we're in Las Vegas again for our daughter's 12th birthday.  It's me, my wife, and our two girls.  These are girls whose preferred snack is sushi.  These are kids who grew up eating at places like Chez Panisse, Lalime's -- kids who the people at the Cheese Board know not only by sight but are on a first-name basis with.  These are Berkeley kids.  We go to Nobu.  We have reservations for a 9:00 show, so we make 6:00 pm dnner reservations.  If they had their way, they would have had us out of there by 6:15!  There were actually six of us for dinner, lined up with dozens of other people waiting for the front door to be unlocked promptly at 6:00.  We inched inside as part of the reservation conga, only to be shunted aside while they seated others who were in line behind us.  What?  Our table not ready?  THE PLACE WAS EMPTY UNTIL THEY LET US IN!  It's not like they had to wait for someone to leave before they could seat us.  We listened to the waiter's suggestions in terms of how he thought (the restaurant thought?) we should proceed through the menu.  The three adults order sake; the three kids ordered whatever it was that they ordered; and we all ordered food.  O.K., I do NOT believe that a place with the reputation of Nobu makes their sushi in advance.  I DO believe their sushi is made-to-order.  Honest, I do.  But the sushi, the soup, the soba, the hot plates -- it all came at warp speed, and plates were whisked away before I finished swallowing the last bite!  Instead of a relaxed meal where we could talk, drink, and savor some extraordinary dishes, we were given our check (not cheap) and practically rushed out the door!  I'm had more relaxing meals at In-n-Out!  In the drive-up lane.  Nobu?  No thank you."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find a restaurant that can handle a large group party and still maintain the integrity of the food.      Located in the notorious Hard Rock Hotel just off the Las Vegas Strip, Nobu is solid place, especially for those convention group dinners.  One part rock n' roll, with the dancers on poles in the lobby, and all the rock memorabilia, one part zen with wooden Japanese inspired interior, and one part subtle decadence with the most amazing Japanese meal that I've had in long time.    Here's what we ordered:   Hamachi with jalapeno and cilantro Washu Beef Lobster Salad with spicy lemon dressing Rock Shrimp Tempura - always a crowd pleaser  Black Cod with Miso wrapped in butter lettuce Fresh Lobster with shaved black truffle - show stopper ending Sake served in bamboo carafe and bamboo sake glasses  With all the Nobu's chains are popping up all over the world, and everyone saying, \"This is my favorite restaurant\" all the time, I dismissed Nobu for a while, but  after this meal, they are back on my radar.    Trendy, yet the food speaks for itself.  What a noteworthy and memorable meal.  I love that Nobu uses delicate sauces, that compliment the food, instead of masking it with salt and soy that most fusion restaurants tend to do.  Definitely an impressive meal for all our guests.  Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Dear lord, if you go here you must eat the black cod. Heavenly, as least for us.  Being in Vegas it seems to be overpriced though."}
{"text":"WORST service I have ever experienced.  If you want a snotty, impatient waiter to rush you through your meal, go here.  I've waited tables for several years before going into my profession.  So I know what good and bad service looks like.  This was definitely the POOREST service I have ever experienced in all of my travels.  My boyfriend and I ate here after seeing Elton John.  We did not feel like a large meal and were ordering sushi plates as we went.  The waiter was very impatient when we weren't ready to order the next round when he returned.  He was also impatient when my boyfriend didn't know which drink to get because they were out of the liquor for the cocktail he had picked on the menu.  Now seeing we were not ordering a ton of sushi cause we did not want a large meal, this seemed to tick off our waiter.  The crowning blow was when were low on our drinks and the waiter asked if we wanted another.  We declined.  He then suggested if we \"wanted to share a drink.\"  Really douchebag?  Really?  I was caught off guard and could not believe that I was hearing this.  If I was more on my game I would have asked to see a manager right then and there.  After that point the dude is lucky I didn't deck him.  The sushi was very good and interesting but the whole bad service experience from this punk ass snot marred the whole dinner.  With so many restaurant choices in Vegas, do yourself a favor and avoid this one.  Go to Craftsteak instead.  ....And to the manager who emailed us to resolve the issue.  A server that is this rude to a table is NOT one of your better servers.  Learn how to manage a service staff."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price.  We made reservations about 6 weeks in advance.  This was supposed to be the highlight of our trip.  We love sushi, and were really looking forward to being wowed by this amazing restaurant.  Our waiter was unhelpful and at times down right rude.  We ordered the Premium Sushi dinner, expecting 1) premium fish and 2) extra creativity.  We got neither.  No special sauces, no special presentation, regular tuna etc.  The lobster sushi roll was basically lobster salad.  We spent $300 on a meal that we could have gotten for $50 locally and enjoyed better service."}
{"text":"2008 Michelin Rating: One Star  Overrated, noisy, substandard food, and pricey.  I am utterly disappointed.  I guess I am coming to realize that famed restaurant does not necessary means good food.    one star for the only dish I think it's outstanding: the broiled yellowtail collar."}
{"text":"Great place for a date or girls night out!  Delicious!!!! Flavor flavor flavor!  Service amazing very attentive even when she got stuck at another table and we were rushing out to make our show.  I would recommend at least 2 hours for dinner to really enjoy it all. We did the chief tasting special... It is truly is a must!!!! It's worth the $175 per person trust me... Well unless you are use to mcdonalds type of food. Will be back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to Nobu a few years ago when I was in Vegas. My friend was hungry but I didn't really eat, just had cocktails. He raved about it so I decided to try it on my trip this time.   It was hopping and insanely noisy but my boyfriend and I got seats at the sushi bar immediately. He just drank scotch which he enjoyed while I had dinner. I got the Layer Cake Shiraz which is one my favorites and it pains me how much of a markup they have on it. It's insane, the pour is short, maybe only 4 oz so they can stretch the bottle and they probably bought it for $8 a bottle and it's $15 a glass. Kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth; I don't mind spending money but come on, that's just sheer greed.  I got the yellowtail and jalapeno appetizer, except it's not really jalapenos. It's serrano peppers and they put too much sauce on the plate. The acidity works well with the fish but since the fish is literally drenched in it, it's overpowering. I got two orders of the salmon belly and two orders of the aji. The salmon belly was awesome. The aji was also good but again, they drenched the nigiri in sauce, so much so that it completely fell apart while I was picking it up to put it in my mouth. I also got the crispy creamy shrimp tempura. It was yummy.   Finally, for dessert, I got the green tea royale. I almost laughed when it was brought out. It was the smallest dessert I've ever seen. Like it was literally 2 inches by 1 inch, a little tiny piece of cake with a teeny tiny scoop of ice cream. It was also weird, the flavors were odd, bubblegum ice cream with green tea cake. Separately they were good but together....not right.   The service also left a lot to be desired. Our waiter rarely checked on us and when he did, he seemed condescending, like he really didn't want to wait on us. I definitely wasn't full but I'd had enough. The bill came to $200 for shrimp tempura, four pieces of nigiri, a yellowtail appetizer, wine and scotch. I'm not sure I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is unbelievable, presentation is superb. I want to say a special thanks to the staff for making our dining experience memorable. A special thanks to Tori for her customer service, Shane for his style and humor. We love him as a waiter. And the management George and Patrick for coming by and making us feel so special and welcomed. Thank you Nobu staff."}
{"text":"Yes the food here is amazing but the service was horrible.   It was 5:30 on a Thursday night and the place was not busy so there was no excuse for poor service. We arrived early for our reservation and chose to sit at the bar. There were three bartenders and only 4 people sitting at the bar so again not busy. One bartender was just standing behind then bar as if he were a bouncer. We have been here before and to other Nobu's and our experience this time was very disappointing.   We ordered our meal and we know things come out a different times but this was ridiculous.  We received our lobster tacos first and they were amazing. My husband then received his miso sea bass and beef skewers together. I order the rock shrimp but they did not shortly follow my husband's food. My husband finished his entire meal and I was still waiting. We could hear the bartenders talking about my shrimp but nothing was said to us. I finally asked if my meal was coming out and they said yes. I asked when because at that point my husband had been done with his meal for more than 10 minutes. \"It's coming.\"  No I'm sorry we forgot to place the order or I'm sorry there was a mix up in the kitchen. No apology for the delay.   Customer service needs to be stepped up. Amazing food does not make up for poor service especially at these prices. At any other restaurant I would not have paid for my meal."}
{"text":"Nobu rocks. This is a Michelin starred restaurant serving Japanese cuisine in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Located in the Nobu Hotel section of the Caesars Palace Resort, this restaurant is high class and haute cuisine worthy of a full rating.  Please do not expect this to be a sushi bar. This is an insult to the chefs who include sushi as part of an amazing experience. This is advanced food with impressive and unique interpretations of Japanese cuisine. The wonderful staff will enjoy working with you to design a great night.  I had the signature omakase paired with the Nobu Sake flight. Nobu has their own sake breweries. My meal was a sensual experience in the classic sense with a combination of visual and taste experiences beyond description.  My meal included the classics. Hand roll. Sashimi Salad. Yellowtail with jalapeño. Miso glazed Cod. Sizzling Beef tenderloin. But the sum is so much more than the parts. Paired with the top notch Sake, the various courses created a wonderful dinner experience worthy of the steep yet reasonable price.  The only drawbacks are minor. Some casino noise can overpower the occasional tourist group wanting gourmet spicy tuna rolls with their merlot. It takes a long time for dinner too, so plan at least two hours for a relaxed experience.  I am so glad I experienced Nobu in Las Vegas. It was simply amazing to experience the many dishes offered and the overall feel and help of the staff. They actually were happy that I was happy making it a great night. Highly recommended and worth it!"}
{"text":"Nobu should add three letters to the end of its name: E-N-O.    The food here tastes better than McDonald's but worse than Chipotle, but I would rate McDonald's higher due to it being a better value.  We had the tasting menu and some sushi.  The Yellowtail with Jalapeno, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. The Black Cod with Miso and the Beef Tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  Everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  The sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  It's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  Then again, it's hard to mess up miso soup and theirs was the worst I've ever had (way too salty).  Service was good.    Our bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  So if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, Nobu is the place to go.  Or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  That's when you go to Nobu.    There are many reasons to go to Nobu, but edible food is not among them.  If you want good food, there are some great French options in the area, such as Le Cirque."}
{"text":"We go to Nobu Malibu quite often and love it- more for the cocktails and ocean front dining than anything. The Vegas Nobu had a different vibe. Lots of fun. Friendlier staff. In fact I wish that staff would teach Malibu a thing or two about graciousness and guest service. (Management at Malibu is amazing though).  Anyhow great atmosphere here. Sushi still incredibly fresh. Appetizers tasty to the point that honestly I could just do a few aps with cocktails and be happy! Still try the black cod miso and yellowtail sashimi. You won't be disappointed. I had to shave a star because with a reservation we still waited an hour and  there were kids at the next table raising hell which totally disrupted our meal- staff or patents said nothing. When paying hundreds of $$ fur dinner you shouldn't have to deal with that."}
{"text":"We got the the top level Omakase ($150/person Chef's Choice) and I will never forget it. It was the best dining experience I've ever had. First of all the waiter was very helpful, attentive, and delightful through all 10 or so dishes - they're happy to explain what everything is. The portions are small, so it's enough food that you can still eat it all. They will alter your dishes to your dietary needs (example: I can't eat shrimp - not a problem). It was extremely fun to see what dish was coming next from an assortment of cold, hot, sushi, and desserts. My favorites were the Nobu ale, the black snapper (yes black, not red), the Japanese mountain peach fruit, the green tea fudge, and the foie gras that just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"It's always been a ritual to come here when ever my friends and I are in Vegas. However I think some dishes are not as great as they used to be...The Creamy Spicy Crab for example was VERY salty and the Uni was just ok. The strong dishes this time around were the Washu Beef, Jalapeo Yellowtail and the Black Cod Miso."}
{"text":"I have been to Nobu probably 5 times over the last 12 years,,, for business meetings and such,,,. Even though I don't like it, no choice - but at least i don't have to pay...  OK, maybe the first time was fine. I didn't know much about Japanese food back then. So, sashimi with jalapeño/sesame oil, fish with some sort of Chinese sauce, and edamame were just fine.   However, as I get to know more about Japanese food, this place seems to be just so-so,,, especially for me,, i have spent a lot of time visiting Japan lately and now I think I know what is good and what is bad. (All my Japanese friends say Nobu is FAKE and it is all about Hollywood celeb and media who tries to hype this place up. I heard it is out of Michelin rating in Tokyo this year. And Tokyo store is the best of all Nobu,,, so, you know what this means).  I mean, sashimi is ok. Sushi is not that special - sumeshi (sushi rice ball) isn't that good. Good sushi rice ball is a little sticky outside and super soft inside with mild, almost fruity vinegar flavor. Good sushi never fall apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. It requires experience and technique. Or maybe they use cheap rice from California.  But for sure, sushi chef here isn't there yet. Maybe they aren't trained in Japan. Fake.   Anyway, this place is waaaaaaay overrated and overpriced. I give their food probably 3.5 stars,,, but the price!! WAAAY TOOOOO EXPENSIVE!  Is it romantic? Maybe yes for those who talk loud and keep spitting rice out of your mouth. Not for me. This place is LOUD.  I guess people go there to show off. Have you talked to your friends how much $$$$ you spent at Nobu? Listen to your mind. I am sure you have.   This restaurant makes you feel you are celebrity - and this is pretty much it is all about.  If you like to eat good sushi - get a cab and go to Kabuto. If you like these rolls and wired sashimi, go to Sen of Japan to save a lot of money. If you like to eat sea bass with black bean sauce, go to Chinese restaurants.   This ain't year of 2000 - we have lots more to choose in LV today. Get real!"}
{"text":"I might be bias because i really love jin sho in the bay area.  This omakase was just not as good as jin sho's omakase... it was very similar just not done as well.  I'm sure if I never ever at at jin sho's I might have given this place a better review...   We are never coming back here because there are a lot of other less expensive places in actual walking distance on the strip to go to and just not as good as jin sho."}
{"text":"Love the fact that this restaurant is located on the lower level of our hotel.  This place was packed for a Monday night. Since we didn't make reservation, we were only able to sit at the sushi bar or the lounge area.  We sat at the sushi bar, ordered a large bottle of sake and a few rolls to share.  I recommend ordering the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno. It's very refreshing and deliciously fresh. I even ordered it as a sushi roll. As for the hot dish, the chicken skewers were okay.   Overall, this is great place for dinner. A nice trendy place with good service & delicious sushi. The price may be steep, but no complaints here. Remember, if you want a table, make reservations."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and \"mother-in-law\" stumbled into this place after a long day of walking along the strip in the hot desert sun. We were desperate to find any kind of food, but what we found was an unforgettable eating experience. The waiters and bartenders were friendly, welcoming, and full of fantastic suggestions and advice. Every single course of our dinner was better than the last and when we were all finished, one of the bartenders gave us a free desert shot called a \"Scooby Snack.\" Thanks John and Toshi for making our night that much more amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh Nobu how I do love thee! I am your biggest fan. This is my favorite restaurant in the world!  This particular Nobu is my favorite. I've been to the San Diego, Hong Kong and Miami Nobu and the Las Vegas Nobu is definitely the best one! The waiters are very friendly and always recommend off menu dishes to me which I love!   This time we had an off menu roll that had salmon and asparagus in it. It is one of my favorites.   I love Yuzu on everything!!! Always have the yellowtail jalapeño and various other sashimi dishes. The crunchy rice with spicy tuna on top is my all time favorite! Of course you can't have  without some refreshing Sapporo!  Nobu never disappoints !"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was okay. We were promptly asked to leave after our dessert came. After spending $800 food/beverage, before tip , I was surprised we were told a larger party was waiting for our space. Needless to say, I won't return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. The first time I ate there last year in June during a conference and thought \"I'd fly here to eat\". Then I went back the second night. I've been back twice since then and it doesn't disappoint. In the 4 times I've eaten there I've sat in the bar 3 times. I like the casual vibe and the waiter remembered me from months ago.   We always start with the shrimp app that is deep fried and covered in deliciousness. I compare it to the bang bang shrimp at Bonefish, but Nobu's is better.   We had the miso cod again, and it was even better this time. We also had several roles. I wasn't blown away with the yellow tail and jalapeno, but found the tempura shrimp very good. We got the scallops in garlic sauce and they are incredible, soft, moist and the flavor is wonderful. I like to let the bar tender make some suggestions but the favorites are absolutely the shrimp, cod and scallops. Next time we will have to try something a bit different!"}
{"text":"Perfect for my husband's Father's Day dinner! Every item we had on the menu was 10 out of 10! We needed help with the menu as my husband and I have different tastes but our waitress handled both with our meal selections! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Was recently at the Hard Rock, and had that Omakase hankering.  Where else can you go in that situation?  No where but Nobu!  I have been to one in NY before, and this was as good or probably better, but maybe its just a more recent and therefore more vivid memory.  Well I went for the upper tier Omakase, and did not regret it.  All of it was great, and I highly recommend the Omakase particularly if you upgrade to the tier 2 dinner.  Wow.  The sushi was great too - one really stole the show and needed an encore performance for my table - that was the Barracuda.  Never had anything like it.  Sometimes I have dreams about those pieces of Barracuda.  The dinner was complemented with a Kirin Zero (alcohol free beer), and a ginger beer.  The drinks were outstanding. I have never had a Kirin Zero before, but will seek it out in the future.  If you are staying in the Hard Rock, or want some Omakase, hit it up.  You will not regret it.  Oh yeah...  Bring your Mastercard.  Because memories may be priceless, but the dinner has a price, and this one isn't cheap!"}
{"text":"Wow. I was seriously impressed with this place. This place ranks second to French Laundry on my list of favorites.   First- if you are a first time visitor there, I would recommend just ordering off of the menu. I am sure the Omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the Omakase.   Second- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. It's okay- but the other items are so much better. We saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste!   Third- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. Just a FYI if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. I also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. I would pass on these- IMO the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there.   We started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. Pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. The sheshito peppers were really good. They taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. My husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. My only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one!   So we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items:   1. Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - definitely get this- it was awesome!   2. The blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening   3. Chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce   4. Kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great   5. Lobster Ceviche- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming   6. Red snapper with dry miso - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming   7. Then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (CA rolls and Ama Ebi)- all which were fine.   8. We ordered the bento box dessert- it was ok- not fantastic.   Overall- the meal was great. The black miso cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. The Chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s).   We had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. The whole meal with tip was just over $300. I highly recommend this place. It was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of Vegas that was great."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with Nobu's main entree, hence this low score.  I ordered the black cod with miso because I loveeeee cod, but this cod did not taste like how it was described on the menu.  It was sweet, with overpowering sweet maple-tasting sauce, not what I thought of when I think miso soup. Anyway,  the sweetness was so overpowering I couldn't tell if I was, in fact, eating cod.  I had it packed and stored it in my hotel room's fridge because I just didn't like it.  In hindsight, I shoulda sent it back a la Gordon Ramsay style and ordered something else.  The yellowtail roll with scallion and the yellowtail with jalapeño was good. The salmon roll was ok.  Shrimp tempura was just two little pieces.  Disappointing and overhyped restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming of Nobu since our party of 13 had an amazing and unforgettable dinner on January 6.   We made a last-minute reservation on Open Table after learning that Morimoto was booked, and I am so glad that it was!    Our waiter, Michael, was excellent.  He was attentive, friendly and offered to order for our table.  He did not disappoint!  Michael chose a mix of raw dishes and cooked dishes, all of which were out of this world.  The rest of the staff at Nobu was equally attentive and helpful.  Some of our favorites were the rock shrimp tempura, crab tempura (OMG, the best), miso black cod, snapper with dry miso and the sizzling beef on a stone paired with lobster.  It was truly an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Nobu.  375 reviews and counting.  Although mine will get lost in the mix, here's my view.  Awesome.  I happened to have the opportunity to go with a chef-friend and several other guys.  He ordered quite a selection of items, and each was better than the next.  My goodness.  I'm actually a little speechless.  Everything was simple, but flavorful, and just plain perfect.  Go here, you won't regret it.  But why, oh why, is it in this horrible casino?"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 2 1/2 stars. I think that's more fitting. I've been there twice and the first time I had a pretty good experience. I went with a couple of girl friends, and we took our time, ordered several different things, and even had a birthday dessert brought to us. I remember our waitress being EXCELLENT and I don't recall it being crowded or noisy.   This past weekend, I went again, and things were a bit different. The sushi we ordered was not much better than cheaper places I've been and definitely not my favorite. I don't see where it was worth all the hype. If you're looking to try something new and out of the box, I think this is a good place to do it but if you're a fan of the traditional sushi that you can find anywhere, this is probably not the place.   This will most likely be the last time I go to Nobu...not because I HATED the food, but because I really dislike the clientele. Too many snooty drunk people, talking way too loudly. I couldn't even have a conversation with my friends. The waiter had a very heavy accent which made it near impossible to understand what he was saying. Not really his fault, but because of the loud groups of people nearby, it was pretty unbearable.   Like my friend said, it was just \"ok.\" I was expecting more and walked away more annoyed than anything."}
{"text":"Great waiters who discuss your likes and dislikes with you...just leave it to them.  Many small helpings of the most delicious food.  Decor of the restaurant is very basic but I could return again and again."}
{"text":"Another delightful dining experience in Vegas! Love the sexy ambience and cocoon-like round tables--very creative designing for ease of staff to deliver everyone's drinks and meals.  I ordered the wagyu and lobster tacos, an eel & cucumber hand roll, and black cod miso. My only complaint of this place is the size of the tacos--these things are barely finger bites, and for the price (and lackluster taste), not worth the $. I thoroughly enjoyed my black cod--the portion was HUGE, and the taste was excellent. Our table shared several sushi and sashimi pieces, which were fresh and tasty. The miso soup and their spinach salad are also great!  The food comes out fairly quick, the servers know the menu front and back, and of course the location can't be beat. However, I've had better sushi experiences, hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"After a few disappointing dining experiences in Vegas, we went to Nobu on the last night of our trip.  We were NOT disappointed.  We ordered the Omakase (literally means \"I leave it to you\"), which is a fixed price meal prepared as the chef decides.  It began with sushi (not americanized sushi with crazy sauces) that was incredible. Simple, but complex flavors, elegantly prepared.  We moved on to Nobu's famous miso black cod. Every bite was exquisite.  We moved on to the beef course, which was also incredible, before dessert.    If you're a sushi fan, this is the ultimate destination."}
{"text":"Great sushi, very fresh, very authentic.  The yellow tail sashimi is their \"signature\" dish, so get that.  They don't have a very big menu and it's a little pricey, but overall worth it for a nice dinner.  Try the dessert shots, they are delicious!  Oh, and great service.  The waiters are cute and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the fly a few weeks ago during a short trip to Vegas. We rolled in on a Saturday night around 8pm and there was no wait for the sushi bar even though the place was packed we were very quickly seated. Before I could even blink we had water in front of us and our drink orders were filled. The service was excellent, staff was friendly, and the sushi chefs were hilarious and very quick. Fish was excellent obviously. A little overpriced but it was well worth it.  Nobu is always on point!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location once before, as well as the locations in NYC and San Diego, but I came back to Vegas for the July 4th weekend and came here with a group of friends.  I was looking forward to it because Nobu is one of my favorite restaurants, but it was just our luck that the A/C at the Hard Rock Hotel was broken so it was hot and stuffy inside the whole hotel and restaurant... and then the gas broke so we weren't able to order hot dishes.  Our cold dishes were good, especially the yellowtail sashimi. (my favorite dish there)  We ordered a sushi and sashimi platter, but you can get good sushi and sashimi at most other places.  They offered us free shots of pineapple and mango cocktail, and the service was good for the most part, until they started cleaning our table and spilled water all over my boyfriend.  I would come back to this restaurant, but I will probably opt for the NYC or Miami location next."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 Stars for quality and price.  Black Miso Cod was definitely a 5, but I wish the skin was crispy.  As for the Fries, it was the best fries I've ever had even though it was $9.  Ramen was below average because the noodle were soggy and overcooked.  The broth was pretty good though.  I would definitely come back again as this place is cheaper than I thought it would be.  Maybe it's just Vegas cuz I'm sure the Beverly Hills location will cost much more."}
{"text":"Great fish poorly prepared by rookies... received Hamachi Belly so doused in Ponzu that the rice was soggy and so much Yuzu Kosho that you can't taste the fish.    Servers messed up all night, including the bill.  Sad rip off."}
{"text":"Sushi was so fresh.  My friend and I split a few rolls and a shirmp tempura entree in a creamy spicy sauce and a few other choices, but I can not remember their names....everything was tasty. For dessert we got the Apple Fritter Balls with a caramel sauce-a great end to the dinner!"}
{"text":"I love food, but it's only about once or twice a year I can afford a four-dollar-sign meal.  We did their lowest priced tasting menu--6 courses for a-buck-and-a-quarter.  The Black Cod with miso (their signature) was pretty much the most delicious thing I've ever eaten.  Really.  90% of everything else was awesome.  I thought the sushi course was pretty ordinary though--specifically the tamago (egg) -- my usual favorite.  Great meal, and great service too.  I should start doing this fine dining shit more often."}
{"text":"I don't yelp much but I have to now because Nobu is so awesome! Ate there for the first time with 2 of my girls and everything was amazing! The food was all awesome and filling but not heavy. The waiter knew that we were trying share a bunch a food and he brought everything out accordingly. Food great, drinks great, ambiance great, waitstaff great! Go if you're around the hard rock!"}
{"text":"The other Yelp reviews were correct!  If there were 10-stars, this would be star worthy!  Yes, the Yellowtail, Black Miso Cod (out of this world, BTW), and Tuna roll were spectacular.  I sat at the bar and my waiter was beyond attentive, helpful, and friendly. All of his Sake recommendations were spot-on.  I would definitely re-visit when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place and give it more stars but everything was just underwhelming.    My expectations were very high at the beginning.  To secure a reservation, I had to sign a contract, promise them my first born, and strictly enforce the men in our group to wear proper dining attire, lest we be turned away at the door in shame.  The decor and ambiance of the place definitely is true Vegas splendor, our service was friendly and on point.  Unfortunately the food just didn't do itself justice.    I will say one thing, the black miso cod was delicious.  The hamachi kama was soft and tender.  I have to give Nobu a hand for their hot dishes.  Unfortunately, when it comes to raw fish, it is hard to distinguish one great restaurant with another when both places buy quality fresh fish. (The only place that really blows everything else out of the water would be Tsujiki Market.)  I guess we were expecting a little more pow than just your average sushi restaurant here at Nobu.  The last thing that really sealed the deal was the spicy tuna roll.  Something just wasn't right about it and how hard is it to make spicy tuna?  Sadly, I wanted to be impressed, but instead I left disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place off my bucket list this past weekend. I must say, I expected a little bit more from such a notorious restaurant.  Perhaps this is frivolous, but I absolutely could not overlook the details of the interior. The ambience felt a little economical with the honey-comb paper lanterns that hung intrusively above the table space. The longer you stare at them, the more obvious the imperfections of craft comes forth. A little out of place for an upscale sushi restaurant.   Aside from the surroundings, the food was stellar. Quality ingredients, down to the seaweed which had the most pleasant nutty, briny essence, far more unique than the commercial brands that local sushi restaurants use.   Offering a wide range of items, the menu spanned from imported wagyu gyoza, ceviche, to meat skewers. Sushi was what tantalized me, therefore I sampled the Sushi Dinner consisting of 8 pieces of sushi and 1 tuna maki. The tuna was definitely revelational. I've never had tuna that had the taste and texture like the variety at Nobu. I've distanced myself from commercial tuna from as long as I remember due to the chalky and chewy texture, but at Nobu, the tuna tasted like a different species altogether--a must try!  I was a little confused by the salmon, which had a floundering texture, dissolving instead of melting in my mouth. It contrasted with what I was expecting and kind of threw me off guard, a bit yucky to be honest.  The rest of my platter was as expected. I quite enjoyed the octopus nigiri, which was soy-sauced and sprinkled with sesame. It had a satisfying bouncy texture and tasted balanced with the rice and freshly grated wasabi. Also notable was the mackerel. Unlike the commonly stringy and overly pickled variety found at other establishments, this mackerel was delicate and natural with muted acidity.   Our table of six had a fabulous dining experience embellished with great service and conversation. If I'm every in Vegas again, I'd definitely stop by again to have another round of sushi!"}
{"text":"A sushi place in Vegas automatically rings alarms in my head.  I thought they would overprice everything for average food.  Absolutely not.  This place had prices that you'd find anywhere in DC/MD/VA.  The only thing that was better than the quality of food was the quality of service.  Our waiter gave us honest recommendations, paired our foods with sake, and didn't even include gratuity on our party of 9.  Obviously we tipped him big time for all his work.  All the rolls were all amazing.  The Black Cod Miso appetizer was money.  I can't think of a single negative thing about this restaurant.  Don't be afraid to spend money here, and don't go to Vegas if you don't have money to spend.  This will be my go-to place whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Even though our reservations time was 5:30, our stomachs were still on east coast time, and I'm glad we went at this hour.  There were no lines, the restaurant was quiet, and we had an army of attentive servers doing their patrols to clear empty plates and refill drinks.  The service here is amazing, and when the place is emptier, you can really take your time and appreciate everything without feeling rushed, or crowded.  The hamachi-jalapeno appetizer was fantastic, although a little pricey.  At $30, it's half the price of an entire entree, but I'm glad we got it because it really shows off the skills of the chefs.  The balance of everything was perfect, and after tasting it, we knew our dinner would be great.  I usually do a-la-carte sashimi at sushi restaurants, but here, we decided to let the chef decide for us.  We got the sashimi dinner and the sashimi deluxe dinner.  They brought it out all on the same plate, so it was beautiful all together.  Both dishes were 12-15 pieces, but the deluxe came with better cuts of fish.  We got 3 pieces of Bluefin otoro with ours, but YMMV.  As a sushi snob, I always get fresh wasabi, but it which comes with the deluxe dinner - so make sure you don't order it twice - unless you need extra wasabi.  I had the flour-less chocolate cake and the green tea ice cream, which was called the bento box.  Both were delicious, and recommended by the waiter.  The green tea ice cream was very green-tea-y, which was perfect with the warm chocolate cake.  The only thing that was disappointing was the green tea.  It was very watered down, but you can't knock this place down a star for bad tea.  Do yourself a favor and make sure this is one of your first meals in Vegas.  It'll save you from even looking at buffet sushi later on.  Definitely a must-eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with Nobu. It took FOREVER for the waiter to get us a menu, order us a drink, and not to mention the prices are not really worth what you get. I was getting so fed up with how slow it was going, I was about to go across the hall to the steak house! When we finally got service, he was nice enough. Told us about the menu when he realized we had never been there before, and explained how it usually worked. We ordered sushi, which again, was OK, but not fantastic as I was expecting. I think some of the other people at our table had a slightly better experience, but I'll stick to what I know with food and that more expensize doesn't always mean better."}
{"text":"Fresh and safe food.  Prices were fair and had some amazing sake.  Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Top quality fish cuts however not much of a \"roll\" selection. The Rock Shrimp was ok but for $26 totally not worth it. I would not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Since they don't offer a 10 star rating I was forced to rate it a 5. OUTSTANDING restaurant experience from beginning to end. Ready? Let's go...  I was able to make SUPER easy online (Yes! ONLINE!) reservations via opentable.com. It took a total of 5 minutes to register an account, reserve a table and get a confirmation email (which is useful in Vegas) Too many times you will go to a restaurant and you'll get the classic line \"SORRY we don't have your reservation\" .. Will never happen with Nobu!   We came early so we started with Veuve Clicquot champagne cocktails at the bar (Yummy!)  After being quickly seated at our perfect table, we started our dinner off with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno  and a Chilled Bamboo (the large size) of their ONIGOROSHI \"DEVIL KILLER\" Sake.    During our time there we followed that up with lobster tacos/tuna tacos, a small order of their DELICIOUS Rock Shrimp Tempura with a Creamy Spicy Sauce, a variety of sashimi/sushi and a another *blush* Bamboo of their Devil Killer!  I've been a foodie since as long as I can remember. I worked in every position in the restaurant business from Busgirl to GM and I can honestly say that this is the best restaurant I've ever been in. Their famnily style service was classy and refined--but still fun and trendy!   The waiters gave us the perfect amount of attention, They bus their tables quickly without disturbing our conversation. Ours even gave us honest suggestions of what the best thing on the menu that day.  I wish I can do this every Friday, but it was my birthday weekend and we just splurged. The bill was about $430 with tip but worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I guess I really don't need to write a review since it really doesn't matter what anyone says people will continue to flock to this famous restaurant. But let me do one anyways for kicks.   We came here for a late night snack after shopping at the outlet. Made reservations for 9 pm - came in on time and the restaurant was packed still, but we were seated promptly at our table. At first glance I thought it would be ridiculously uncomfortable to sit at the low tables but they were very comfortable and fit the atmosphere well. Music loud and beautiful people everywhere(obviously me included) like a night club. The waitress came by, who (I must admit) was also beautiful, decided our menu for us. We told her what we liked and disliked and how much we wanted to spend. $150 for both of us I told her, she had to clarify and say each or for the table. Since the mid range omakase is like $200 per person. Trying to be cool and not look cheap - I told here we had dinner already, which for the record is the truth.   The 4 dishes came they were all excellently prepared and delicious (yes 4 dishes for $150 including tax and tips). The food runner different for each dish it seems explain exactly what we were eating and how to eat it.  The experience was great, from the night club like atmosphere, to the service and the food, one must eat a Nobu at least once in a life time to say they did it."}
{"text":"George the manager walked us through their menu for 15 minutes. I eat here regularly and the food is always great, but the personal attention was a huge plus. Thanks George! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"WOW...  I am completely floored at the utterly disgusting meal I tried to ingest last night with my husband. I am a person who likes to consider myself a huge food critic and fanatic, and was repulsed by my meal at Nobu in Vegas.  First, we tried the restaurants \"most popular cold dish\" the yellow tail with jalapeno.  It was saturated in soy sauce with a splash of rice vinegar. How is that in any way shape or form a dish worthy of being proclaimed a restaurant favorite. My 2 year old niece could have whooped up that concoction in her plastic kitchen.  As someone who is considered a culinary marvel by many of her friends, that was such an insult to my palate and my wallet.  Next, the toban yaki was so repulsive, I couldn't honestly finish my meal. There were two shiitake mushrooms, 2 pieces of shrimp, 1 scallop, and 2 pieces of calamari  in a hot pot drenched in sake with a pinch of brown sugar, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. WOW it tasted like the essence of Lysol. There were no complicated flavors and the presentation was so amateur, I felt utterly pissed that we trekked down to the Hard Rock for a meal unworthy of Benihanas...yes please note the sarcasm.  Finally, they brought out the beef tenderloin...my God it was at that point that we asked him to forget about our sushi and the rest of the meal, paid for the check, and walked out. They took a delicious, beautiful piece of tenderloin and threw it into a hot pot with the same horrid sake, soy sauce concoction as the seafood travesty.  Take it from someone who LOVES and ENJOYS fine dining to the highest degree - this place was horrendous! I give it 1 star because I have to actually rate it with something. I will never eat at another Nobu establishment for the rest of my life...and unless you feel like sitting in a loud club with layered seating, amateur service and food, head to one of the better fine dining establishments on the strip. I hear McDonalds makes a mean Big Mac."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Nobu. My favorite is still the one in NYC however the Vegas one was pretty good too. It was my first experience sitting at the sushi bar and I enjoyed it very much. The sushi bar chefs were all extremely friendly and quick at taking my order.  I found out after I ordered that there are certain appetizers that you can get half portions of.   Everything was fresh and the dessert was excellent. I got the shaved ice and it was much bigger than I expected. I would recommend sharing."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and tried some sushi rolls and was disappointed. I had high expectations since this place gets a lot of hype but I was not impressed. The rice in the sushi was way too mushy and I've tasted better, fresher tasting fish (we are spoiled living in Seattle). A friend of mine ordered one of the scallop stir frys which I tried and was very good, but not worth the price. There are too many restaurants to choose from in Vegas that I don't feel the urge to come back again but if I do, I will definitely avoid ordering any sushi."}
{"text":"Not pure Japanese cuisine, definitely Americanized, but really great for people like me who haven't completely embraced the raw fish thing but enjoy carpaccio and heavily flavored sashimi.   We ordered the omakase and all the courses were to die for. My favorite was the series of carpaccio and the buttery fish. I came here for my birthday with a group of 10 or so. Service was a little spotty at first, but they brought food out rapidly so I had no complaints.  Definitely pricey, but hey, it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Always love eating at Nobu! This was my first time eating at Caesar Palace location. Figured I would eat at Nobu while I stayed at Nobu Hotel.  Everything was pretty familiar like the other Nobu's I had. Nothing really special or different honestly. But I love that it's consistent!"}
{"text":"I would definitely come back here! Everything was amazing and delicious! I HIGHLY recommend the waygu beef and spicy tuna roll. Waygu is really hard to get made properly and this place hit it spot on! If you're looking for a nice romantic dinner in Vegas then this place is just what you need!"}
{"text":"*BE WARNED, THIS ONE IS A DOOSEY!**  Went here for my birthday - Bill: $350+ for two.  **I am not cheap ; )**  Nobu, you did NOT wow me.  Here's the bad: You are far too loud for fine dining.  \"Am I having a fine meal or am I in a club?\"  Because I don't know - and I'm really pissed off about that! I could barely hear the waitress with all her training explain the food to me. (and since you did not provide a printed menu for the Chef's Tasting Menu) - I had no clue what some of the things I was eating even were.  You gave me disposable chopsticks...and not the nice kind... FOR F's SAKE NOBU, ARE YOU JOKING? $350+ Dinner?  Pathetic. (said with Disgust, and Distain)  I even asked for better chopsticks and was told you don't have them. (You are a JAPANESE RESTRAUNT - I am stunned...F@%ing stunned)  Topper...After all the hype and the promise of excellent quality, food that will be remembered... I cannot accurately describe one thing I ate that night.  I am a Foodie.  The fact that I cannot recall one menu item can only mean one thing; Nobu, you aren't worth your salt.  I will never go back.  I will not encourage others to fritter a night away in Vegas that would be better spent in a fine dining establishment that is not having an identity crisis.  You guys have issues, and I am shocked at your overall rating.  Clearly being \"cool\" (and I say this with cheek) is enough to keep you in business in Las Vegas, (and apparently in LA).  If this exact restaurant were placed in San Francisco, or New York, you wouldn't last a year - The food critics would have your head."}
{"text":"Simply amazing best ever!!!   I struggled to give it 5 stars, I think I would call this a 4.5 star rating.   Its a little overpriced for what it is, they need to do more FOOD, I left hungry.  That shouldnt happen.  Service 98 out of 100.  Food 95 out of 100  Value 80 out of 100.   I think it was a little overpriced, but the quality was totally there!   I would definitely go again, and I think I would love it again, but it let me down just a little, after hearing all the hype.   I could go here once , or go to sushi mon 4 times, all I can eat, you know my choice on that one if I want sushi 4 times!     After the sticker shock, which I didnt pay so I dont care what it costs, the food was insanely good.  We had the saki, beers, and a feast of sashimi, shrimp, miso soup, and rolls.   My favorite was the lettuce wrapped black cod, oh my god, this was the BEST FISH bite I have ever had.  It melted in your mouth like butter from the fat and the protein - I am not sure if it was oil pan fried, or what, it was hot, but not too hot, but it had a little sizzle on it, and the glazed oil on it just added to the silky flavor.  I would go back there just for that!   The desert was a rhubarb molten love with ice cream over it, talk about yummy!   Tasted like strawberries to me, but it was perfect, I would have taken one more scoop of Icecream, next time I will ask.   I am sure they would accommodate.     5 star food at 5 star prices.      Decor was a little drab to me, I dont know what it was, it was classy, but too dark, the bamboo was nice, but I think they could use some LIVE FISH Tank in the place, maybe I missed something, the walkway in was nice, but the dining room was a little drab for me.  I think a splash of color would have been nice.   Anyway, I am nitpicking now and thats not fair to them.    Quality stuff, Incredible food, great dining room, great location at Hard Rock.  Highly Recommended.  Please bring your wallet, or someone elses, you will need it!     Also, be prepared for a late night snack later meal after, unless you are on a diet.    4.5 Star Overall, I likey!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here tonight, expecting 5 star quality and service. Although the food was tasty,the service and ambiance was a complete fail. We ordered the tasting menu, telling our server we were comfortable with approximately $200/pp, when asked. Expecting the sake pairing and food to be imperiled for what we were paying (approximately $500 for our meal). Being self proclaimed foodies, we researched this restaurant, among others, and decided it would be the one. We left after our second course, extremely deflated. Our sake and food was served with such a disconnect, we could not even enjoy it. Food was served without a sake pairing, 10 minutes later sake arrived, with no explanation. Horrible service and experience. We spoke to management, who profusely apologized and offered his card, but then expected us to pay $100 towards our meal. It was horribly insulting. We will never be back. We have dined at many 5 star Vegas restaurants, and expected the best service and quality from this as well. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, as expected (as I have been here before).  Tell me if you have ever heard of this before:  Our reservation was for 2 people at 8:00 pm on Sat night.  We showed up on time and were seated within about 10 minutes.  Each time we finished a dish, we ordered a new one.  At 9:45 the waiter let us know that  \"we apologize but we really need your table back.\"  I thought this was a joke.  I ordered dessert, and when it was served the waiter said, \"please take a minute or two and then we really do need the table back.\"  The waiter did offer for us to allow the tip to reflect the early exit.    Ridiculous, really."}
{"text":"Very good, but doesn't really live up to the hype.  The curse of being trendy, I guess.  That being said I enjoyed my meal each time I've eaten here and will return if its convenient, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my boyfriend and I dropped in for a late night bite. Definitely a fan of the decor and the service. Our waitress, Misty (name on receipt) was thorough and helpful, taking time to answer all questions and providing suggestions. The rest of the evening staff was equally as attentive and descriptive. Awesome team.   Now, food. Personally, skip the taco apps, nothing special to note there. The rock shrimp had a bit too much sauce for even that type of dish. DO go for the Chilean Sea Bass with dry miso. It's perfectly cooked in a buttery-citrusy sauce bed; the dry miso on top adds texture and will make your mouth water. A dish that is both simple yet complex on its own. Also, the uni shooter was absolutely delish, with the right balance of sauce and meat. I had a spicy acai cocktail which was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while!! Yum. I was too tired to remember what else we had. Wish we came earlier to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Nobu is actually Peruvian accented Japanese food, so it's Japanese and South American food, and it's meant for sharing. If you come here expecting Japanese food, it is not the place for you then. Peruvian food is actually very similar to Asian fusion food, especially cold and hot small plates, and cold small plates are the beautiful Nobu creations you should really try!   The ambience was pretty casual and relaxing, got seated at a comfy booth, started off with Badoit sparkling water, lemon drop martini and cold sake. Loved the cold sake container, it kept sake cold the entire time. We decided to go for Omakase, $225 per person.   Omakase courses:  Yellowtail jalapeño, spicy tuna crispy rice, salmon carpaccio with white truffles, whole Branzino with white truffles and truffle oil, mackerel sushi spread.   I guess because we went for higher price range so they made us a lot of truffles. To be honest I am not a big fan of truffles, but they tasted very good still. The whole Branzino was very delicious, just a little small for $125, I had a bigger Branzino for only $50 at a French restaurant the previous night. The mackerel sushi spread was my favorite, a few different kinds of mackerel fish, so fresh and tasty! Guess next time we will ask them to make us sashimi or sushi only! The cold dishes were all so yummy, the presentations were very beautiful too. Chocolate vodka dessert drink was bomb, loved it. The housemade hot sauce was amazing too.  Service was very friendly and attentive, food came out very fast. It was a great dinner, food was so good, but somehow I don't think it was worth over $500 for the two of us. Just keep in mind, try to order hot & cold dishes in both apps & entrees, that's what Nobu restaurants are famous for.   I still want to try Nobu Malibu soon, heard the views are amazing, if we were to spend that much on a meal, I would like some views too!"}
{"text":"It was Saturday night in Vegas, we wanted sushi, and Nobu didnt even cross my mind until my boyfriend made reservations for the same night. I quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and I am happy to say that I am ecstatic I did this, because had i not, I would have missed out on the Black cod with miso.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that I have ever tasted.   My BF and I shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!  Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno - DELICIOUS!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. I couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)  Lobster Ceviche - I have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but I wish we would have ordered something else instead. It was merely OK,  It just kind of tasted like cold lobster in lettuce - but hey, i love lobster so  its all good :)  Black Cod with Miso - OMG - I just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. It is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. I like how crunchy and  soft it is..  delicioso~  Shrimp tempura roll - your basic roll ..    Bento Box dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with Green tea ice cream) YUM YUM YUM YUM - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared with someone special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Will definitely come back - Loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.   But hey, theyre's always next time!!"}
{"text":"The food is tasteless, the service slow and the pricing outrageous.  If Chef Nobu is so famous, I have no idea why."}
{"text":"Went to Nobu on 02/18/2016.  We were greeted by three lovely hostess and seated promptly.  While the restaurant was empty, we were seated at a rear table near the kitchen entrance.  The waiter immediately suggested that he bring out two (2) dishes of his choice as an appetizer without showing us a menu.  I was versed in one of the appetizers from my own research and agreed to it.  Our waiter began by explaining the \"eating experience\" at Nobu insisting that we remove the menus that the restaurant prints and give him a price point so that he could begin the experience.  Having read multiple reviews about the restaurant I was prepared for this tactic and explained that we were not heavy eaters (true) and we preferred to review the menu.  He again suggested that a name a price point so that he could give us an experience, I told him $100/person.  The waiter stated that we could not get the experience for that price, I suggested he show us a menu so that I could choose my own experience.  The waiter returned and took our order, he made two (2) suggestions in lieu of what we wanted.  We took him up on one of his suggestions.  After taking our order, the waiter suggested we order more because he was concerned we would still be hungry.  I informed him that I could make that determination after we ate our meal.    The food was amazing and artful.  Our waiter lost interest in us after learning that we were not going to give him free reign for an experience.  We shared the shaved ice for desert (it was my birthday and my wife arranged that the chef put a birthday message on the plate).  The shaved ice was just ok.  The message is the food is amazing (5 Star Amazing) but the staff (2 Stars for being rude and pushy) is trained in sale tactics and up selling people (everything the waiter offered was the highest price point in each category).  If you want to enjoy your own experience, take the menu into your own hands.  We had a great food experience for a price point that we were comfortable with and left full, despite our waiters concern."}
{"text":"What a bummer - thought maybe this wasn't another bait and switch Vegas restaurant that serves bad food under the shell \"name\" of a great one, but damn this was probably the worst sushi experience I've ever had. First off - it's Nobu and it's pricey so at the least I thought service would be top notch but honestly Cheesecake Factory gives better service. Our waiter sucked knew nothing and was dismissive of us when 3 of our sushi dishes (we only ordered 6 dishes total) never came. The three we ate were really bad. Those tempura rock shrimp remind of a Trader Joe's pop in the oven version, only worse. Then to top it off - they charged us for 1 of th 3 dishes we never got and when I asked manager to take it off (after telling him food was horrid) he showed no concern about the food or terrible service and acted like he was doing us a favor by taking the dish off of our check. Don't waste your time or money at this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for her birthday started off with the wagyu tacos to die for which lead us ordering the wagyu steak min of 4oz well worth the experience I would definitely come here again food is life here."}
{"text":"Great choice if you like sushi and seafood.  Wait staff was very good.  Had the Yellowtail Sashimi to start and was incredible.  The rest of the meal was a continuation of that, nothing was less than excellent.   Of the restaurants in Ceasar's, this is by far the best choice."}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance in the private booths, and service was amazing.  As soon as we were finished with an entre, the plate was gone.  Seemed like there were about 7 different people working our table.  All around excellent experience.  I am addicted to the black cod."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance and exceptional service. We dined with family so we gave a budget and noted must-haves such as black cod, yellowtail, and softshell crab--this is the way to go to save time and enjoy being surprised!"}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting a Nobu Restaurant.    I did my research and read a lot of reviews prior to arriving, and really contemplated between order a la carte or going with their omakase.   The restaurant is pretty big, I wish we were put in a booth, but instead we were put at a round table that seats 4 in the middle.  We decided to order the 175.00 omakase and was told the difference between 125.00 and 175.00 is that 125.00 us based on items on the menu already.  The 175.00 one are items created by the chef that are not on the menu.    First course was king mackerel with sweet potato chip, fried shiso leaf, ginger ponzu sauce.   Next was sashimi salad with barracuda, Bonito tuna, amberjack (this one was soooo good), wrapped Japanese Daikon and greens with Nobu vinaigrette. Everything was so fresh, and the sauce was perfect. The little fried crab was super cute.  It tasted like crab chips but had the texture like chewing on eggshells.   Next Nigiri, blue fin tuna, butterfish, trout, uni and egg. All were superb in their own sauce.  Didn't need soya sauce.   Next sashimi, 2 piece of blue fin Toro belly (melted in your mouth) with caviar and 14 karat gold shavings.  Tako live octopus with rare Japanese mushroom with sesame oil.   Next was a course that needed our presentation.  It was a Himalayan salt block with fresh yuzu and 3 pieces of sashimi.  Was supposed to squeeze the yuzu onto the salt block and run the sashimi over the block a couple of times before eating.. I found it to be too salty, I didn't enjoy this course too much, it tasted better with just yuzu.   Next was Chilean sea bass with Bonito flakes and pressed rapini.  At this time I was getting pretty full already.  The fish was cooked perfectly and had a nice taste. It was in a ponzu sauce again, but went well with the fish.   Next was seared A5 wagyu beef with fried gnocchi.  The beef honestly melted in your mouth like the fatty Toro belly.  There were 5 pieces cooked medium rare and was really good.    Then it was an avocado chilled miss soup with king crab and tobiko.  This was very interesting, came in a small cappuccino cup as presentation, the tobiko added a nice texture and crunch to the soup, and when biting down on the tobiko, there was a sour explosion.  It was very nice.   Lastly dessert was Chai ice cream, blood orange Panna Cota, soya form, marinated Japanese pumpkin and shortbread. The ice cream was so good along with the short bread and soya foam.  The Japanese pumpkin was really sour and didn't really go with the dish.   Overall it was a great experience.  Got to try many different dishes, the service was great!"}
{"text":"I'm officially done with wagyu beef. First of all, I really don't know what all the fuss is about. Secondly, 38 dollars an ounce at Nobu with a minimum of two ounces is flat out highway robbery. I have absolutely zero issue paying for a dish where I believe the quality matches the price. The wagyu beef is just simply not that great. Also, it's dripping in this sauce that Nobu douses so many of their beautiful fish offerings with. I was really disappointed in the \"New Style Wagyu\" dish. Just don't get it. Trust me!  Other than that, some hits that I was pleasantly surprised with the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the toro collar. We also had the black cod miso which my guy deems the best fish we had in Vegas. We ordered sweet shrimp and uni since it's our standard way of seeing how legit or non-legit a place is. It turned out to be pretty decent, but we've had better. I don't know that I'll be visiting this place again, but it was a good experience, to say the least! Good, but not phenomenal...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to eat when I'm in Las Vegas. Nobu never disappoints and I'm looking forward to my next experience. Allow your server to choose unique dishes and listen to their recommendations. You have to try their Kobe steak. It literally melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Although expensive, this place was worth it.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  A couple of peeps did the chef tasting.  You get 8 courses with it. I thought the service was spot on.  Each server presented and explained the dish. No one's glass was ever empty.  Service alone was 5 stars.  No one had something they didn't like.  Lobster Roll-A decent amount lobster in the roll. Crab sushi-  Good crab Crab tempora- One of my favorite things here. Shaved Ice- You must try!  I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Nobu participated in Restaurant Week, and this was what got me in the door.  I knew it was a pricey Sushi place, so I always hesitated in going since there are so many off-strip Sushi joints near my home that are great and less expensive.  But the pricey-ness will deter me no more! I was very impressed with the service, quality of food and the Sake selection.    Some of the food items we ordered from the RW tasting menu were better than others.  Our clear, hands-down favorites were the Black Cod lettuce wraps, Scallop rolls, Beef tenderloin and the 2 desserts - Suntory Cappuccino and the White Chocolate Pot de Crème.  I'd go back for the Black Cod lettuce wraps alone.   They were sublime... absolutely melted in your mouth with a nice crunch and freshness from the baby butter lettuce that it was served in.  Mind you, you have to like fish because Black Cod does have a noticeable but pleasant fish oiliness to it... but it's so delicate and lovely that you just want more, more, more!  The most surprising dish was the Scallop roll.  I've had Scallop rolls in the past at other restaurants... but this was by far better than anything I've ever had.  This too melted in your mouth. It wasn't squishy but it wasn't chewy either.  It was the perfect, bite-size, morsel of yumminess.  The tenderloin... was tender and perfectly prepared... juicy with a slight sear.  We were not expected to be blown away by the desserts... in fact, I'm usually underwhelmed and don't normally order desserts at restaurants, but they were part of the RW menu so obviously we indulged.  I'm REALLY glad it was include in the RW menu!  They were desserts... so Yea... they were sweet, but they were not sugary-syrupy-sweet.  The \"cappuccino\" was not a drink... it was like a tiramisu but not.  I mean... it had layers like a tiramisu... where the bottom was a rich (but not too intense) dark chocolate cookie crust and then a layer of milk chocolate crème that was topped with a heavenly layer of whipped / airy whiskey foam.  And the White Chocolate Pot de Crème ... don't read the description as it really doesn't do it justice. Just trust me and the Amazing chefs at Nobu... this dessert is worth all the calories!  Light and Summery!  It's a complex white chocolate mousse with fresh citrus bits.  I know... that's not a great description but seriously... this is something to experience and savor each small spoonful slowly so that it lasts as long as possible until you are licking the dish. (I may or may not have done that. ha!) Troy (our server) was Fantastic! And helped us pick out a Sake to accompany our dinner. It was flavorful on its own, yet complimented our entire meal.   The food runners who present your dishes.... and YES, they present them to you... were wonderful and polite.  They position them before you and explain it before departing.  It's so nice to have your various courses presented to you and an explanation of how it was prepared and what's in it. And I'm so happy to learn that they will continue operating under the new Virgin hotel that will be taking over the Hard Rock. Net, Net .... we will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and the service to match.  This place was amazing, the food was as good as it gets. I will definitely be going back on my next visit. Unfortunately other places we visited weren't nearly as good at Caesars palace."}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the best dining experience I've ever had!  The service, atmosphere, and the meal itself were perfect. I went with five other friends during a Vegas bachelor party week and every one of us loved it. My expectations were far exceeded.  Make sure you try the Miso Black Cod because it's unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Expect to pay a pretty penny. $$$$. All dishes are Family Style, which are all extremely small portions. Cocktails were yummy, about $17 each but well worth the price.  Service was solid, our waiter was helpful. Food recommendations: -Yellowtail Sashimi with Cilantro + Jalapeño - $29  - (Off the Menu) Black Truffled Scallops  - $40 for 2 -Wagyu Steak and Salmon Belly Tacos - $13-$14   I personally liked the West Hollywood's ambience better, but this one was well designed too."}
{"text":"Came to enjoy some seafood and was not disappointed. I've been to the one in Qatar and wanted to compare the menu. It's vegas so it's obviously super busy, but our server was very knowledgeable regarding the menu. Not to mention friendly and stopped few times to chat. I like how the restaurant offered half bottle of wine, perfect for a couple who wants about 2 glasses each. Our reservation was initially at 830pm and I mixed up the time and arrived one hour before- and surprisingly was not turned away and was seated almost immediately. Nice music, the tables were well spaced out so we didn't hear other people's conversations. The booth was comfortable. Everyone time customers walk in the staff chime together and believe they all say \"Welcome!\" Of course in Japanese, huge guess but either way fun to hear. All servers wearing black and they truly are professional and meticulous when setting up tables and delivering food. The black cod was fantastic, soft white meat with delicious sauce. Tasmanian ocean trout was a nice surprise to see on the menu, well prepared with the skin nice and crispy just like I like it! The yellowtail/scallion sushi roll was simple but super fresh. Appreciated having a bathroom in the restaurant a lot of times you have to roam around the casino. Our server mentioned Nobu has a beautiful location in San Diego, would love to explore that location next. Delicious meal and great service. Highly recommend Nobu! Will not be disappointed just make sure you have your credit card ready$$$."}
{"text":"The food here was AMAZING! We've heard about Nobu from a friend of ours and decided to have our Valentines dinner here. Our waiter suggested 4-5 dishes for the both of us. So, we ordered the monk fish liver with caviar, tuna sashimi, salmon tartar, black cod with miso, uni and an order of the soft shell crab roll for the fiance who doesn't enjoy much raw dishes. The food and not to mention the presentation was incredible. We enjoyed each and every dish. For dessert, we picked the Bento Box which includes warm Valrhona chocolate souffle cake, shiso syrup, white chocolate sauce and green tea ice cream MmmmmMMmmmmmm. I'm so ready to go back and try more dishes on their menu."}

{"text":"Before the concert started at the Hard Rock, I had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. At first I thought that steak might be a good idea, but I love Asian food and wanted a great experience. My boyfriend and I walked into Nobu, a Japanese restaurant. For our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.  Their menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. We decided to go with a little bit of everything.  Our favorite was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. Their tempura shrimp and vegetables were great also.  Overall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. I can't say much about their food because I have to say that I've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, Well Being in the Box.  Although their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the Guam experience as we could get. It was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.  I honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. That was majority of our bill. I do believe that their signature bento box dessert was worth 14 dollars. It was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea ice cream was just like home.  If you want something other than tempura for your experience at Nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. For myself, a good Japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way I've had it in Japan and on Guam from top Japanese chefs. However, this was not the case, unfortunately.  I give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"pricey but worth every penny.  You just don't get this kind of food elsewhere.  As first timers, we tried the \"first timers\" Omakase and also the \"normal\" omakase.  The waiter suggested it in case we didn't like the normal version which is a menu made up by the chef, the sushi and entree item were not on the menu.  The \"first timers\" version was chef's choice but the items were also ones you can order from the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place.  kobe beef thinly sliced with a fine garlic sauce drizzled over it.........  I'm salivating just writing about it.  I go once a year and wish I could go 12 times a year.  Well, everything but the price tag.    Great environment, great service, great food and next to the best open bar in Vegas.   Ate at the walk-in bar last time and enjoyed it.    Strongly recommend reservations!"}
{"text":"I don't even know why I'm writing this stupid review.  You're gonna go to Nobu regardless of what I write so why the heck am I even bothering?  Why are you going to go?  I'll give you 3 reasons:  1)  REASONABLY WELL PREPARED DISHES The fish is usually reasonably fresh because they crank out so much sushi nightly that every day new fish really has to be brought in.  The sauces used for any fish or meat dish are well balanced, savory, & time-tested - no need to worry about overly salty ponzu sauces or overbearingly sweet plum sauces.  A couple of key dishes to try, to experience what I'm talking about include: -- Toro Tartar in Ponzu:  The ponzu the toro floats in is deliciously well made & is practically sipable after finishing the fish & the accompanying American Sturgeon caviar.  The ponzu doesn't utterly overshadow the delectable saltiness of the caviar which is surprising. -- Kumamoto Oysters:  If you're one of those \"these shells are so small\" types, skip this dish.  This is for those that appreciate truly flavorful & tasty oysters - not beefy, characterless ones.  With these oysters, you can also appreciate the different sauce pairings the chef provides   2)  THE \"IN\" or \"COOL PLACE\" TO GO Guys - there's a lot of talent here so wear the good jeans.  Not that you're gonna hook up during your meal, but I'm just sayin' - it's doesn't hurt having legs-&-heels all around you.  Additionally, if you've got the coin & you come with your boys, passing plates around to try different dishes is cool.  As long as, again, you've got the coin because per person, this place is a good $100 easy so a group of 4 with sake can eclipse $500 after tip.    Ladies- you're gonna get a lot of looks here & that's even before the sake goggles go on so if you're at ease with yourself enough to admit being the attention whore that you are, you're gonna love every minute of it.  Men constantly trot over from one table to another to \"say hi\" & guys without both style & money rarely bother going to Nobu.  3)  CONVENIENT Goin' to a concert at the Joint?  Nobu's.  Goin' to Body English at 11PM?  Nobu's.  Gonna hang out at the Circle Bar?  Nobu's.  Gonna hit the tables later?  Nobu's.  Nobu's is the defacto restaurant to go to now that AJ's has shut down, Ago is kinda 'meh', & Pink Taco is better if you're just leisurely screwin' around.  WARNING #1:  NOBU'S SAKE LABEL For sake rookies, please read:  Unlike most sushi restaurants, Nobu only has available his own sake label.  The sake behind Nobu's is actually the product of the Hokusetsu brewery in Niigata prefecture Japan, a cold but famous region of Honshu known for making ultra-refined but sometimes 'water-ish' & unpronounced sake.  If you want to get the most value from your sake purchase, DO NOT purchase the \"YK35\" or even the \"YK50\" for consuming while eating your other dishes, unless you plan on having just straight nigiri & none of those 'hot dishes'.  The fact is that the sake is so light & minimal in character that you won't taste any of it over your \"ponzu-laden tuna tataki\" & you might as well get something with a more earthy nuance like the Hokusetsu Onigoroshi which is much cheaper & something you can appreciate the taste of with a flavorful meal.  WARNING #2:  TOURISTY BAMBOO SAKE DECANTERS For sake snobs:  They're gonna serve the sake in one of those novelty bamboo tokkuri by default.  Have them serve it in something else that's glass or ceramic.  Due to the porous/fiberous nature of the bamboo material, I don't believe these tokkuri get washed adequately & I've experienced very high variance - particularly in the nose - between YK35 served in the bamboo versus ceramic, for example.  WARNING #3:  GET RESERVATIONS Tips to the hostesses won't matter.  If they don't have room, they don't have room.  Not even your host is gonna be able to squeeze you & your boys in if there's no tables available.  WARNING #4:  OMAKASE DOESN'T MATTER If you actually know something about sushi, you'll agree:  The $150 Omakase at Nobu is really not that interesting or creative, nor is it that radically different from ordering  straight off the menu.  I've been going to Nobu for business dinners since before Simon was built across from it (which is now Ago) & contrary to what some other reviewers are raving about, there's VERY LITTLE that's innovative about Nobu's sushi or sashimi.  They might change up the fish in their sashimi tataki dishes or add some caviar here & there but at the end of the day, it's all the same - because the chef's don't have much time to care, & some of them actually aren't all that experienced.  CONCLUSION: As sushi-on/near-the-strip goes, this is about as good as it gets.  Other restaurants may try to clone Nobu's dishes (like the toro tartar) but very consistently, the quality of fish/balance in preparation is what shines through @ the original & you'll only learn this with experience so go ahead & try others.  You'll be back.  4-Stars."}
{"text":"Glad I read many reviews before going to Nobu.  The rock shrimp tempura that so many recommended did not disappoint!...excellent stuff.... My favorite dish was the sea bass with balsamic teriyaki (hot dish) was one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had.   Although the rock shrimp tempura was great, the shrimp and vegetable tempura was disappointing, especially for 36 dollars.  The rock shrimp tempura is far cheaper and is much better.  The prices are high, but the service never disappointed, and the decor was also very nice."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the dessert. My friends raved so much about the Figi shaved ice they had the night before that they insisted we try this dessert the next night. Without reservations we were able to sit near the bar area at one of the circle tables which was very cozy.  Between 6 of us we shared the Figi shaved ice and whiskey cappuccino. I liked the show and explanation of our server who poured various ingredients on top of our figi shaved ice. But $22 for shaved ice? No thanks. It wasn't that spectacular enough to spend that much on this dessert. The cappuccino on the other hand was fantastic. It's small so I wouldn't recommend sharing with that many people. The coffee grounds in the dessert added a nice crunch and the overall taste of this gave me a jolt of energy for the night. It also came with this tiny square fruit filled chocolate."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience!  Was fortunate enough to be a guest at a dinner here and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. Of course everything is better when you don 't have to pay... but really the flavors here are unlike any other.  Nobu, for those of you that don't know, is a mix of Japanese and Peruvian flavors, which explains it's unique offerings.  For our dinner, we did not get menu's, the server asked what we liked and the chef catered the offerings to our tastes... the result was was absolutely incredible. (They do have menus though if you don't want to be surprised).  Some of the highlights of the incredible meal included: Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño Chilean Sea Bass with Dry Miso, or Balsamic Teriyaki  Black Cod Miso Sushi platter  Truthfully, everything was beyond perfection. I can't recall the names of everything that we tried that night but the chef did a wonderful job and I'd do it all again and again."}
{"text":"We went by the suggestion of our cool server and got the $100 Omakase menu for each of us.  I originally wanted to get the $150 omakase, but he advised me to start with the $100 one so that, next time, I could try the $150 and notice the difference.  He said that we would love that selection.  Well, I must say he was right on the money!  It was great! Highly recommend it.  Looking forward to seeing what the $150 omakase entails.....next year!"}
{"text":"Oh Nobu - Mi Amore!!    I've been to this restaurant countless times and it is always amazing!   After my recent visit I realized I have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  Here are some of my favorites:  Toro Tartare with Caviar - This dish makes me want to commit a felony.  If I were on death row it would be my last meal, I would definitely die happy.  As one of my favorite sayings on Howard Stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.  Yellowtail with Jalapenos - Always fresh and delicious!  I believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor.   Sashimi Salad - BAM!  The dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.    Kobe Beef Toban Yaki - I'm not a religious person by any means but I'm certain the heeled hands of Jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.  Of course you cannot go there without consuming a couple of their saketini's.  Why can't any other bar/restaurant get their saketini's to be this delicious??  They are alone worth a visit there."}
{"text":"If I could give more then 5 stars I would , We had he best food and amazing journey in hat restaurant ,  The taste the flavors the service was spectacular, The waiter explained about the menu and the chef and gave us food that was so tasty and accurate that it really touched our soul. The desert was amazing the best I have ever had , I recommend the vanilla muchi tart by far. I had never been treated so good in a restaurant in my entire life , Thank you guys for being so unique , specially I want to thank colombia our server. The steak was delicious the sauce was unbelievable and the combination took me to another level .   Boom !!!!!!! Bravo !!!!!!"}
{"text":"My experience at Nobu was nothing short of spectacular.   We did the chef's tasting menu, where you basically tell your waiter your likes and dislikes, and they ask you your budget per person and put something together for you.  There wasn't a single dish that wasn't amazing.   Regular sushi is now ruined for me.  Approx $200 a person for what we ate/drank don't go in expecting a bargain, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I called the band last week, hoping we could meet in Vegas for a reunion. We did.  Sadly, I can't talk about it because, well, you know, 'What happens....'.  The only thing I will say is that we ate at Nobu's and it was grand. After dinner, we wandered through the Hard Rock Hotel checking out the varioous rock legend exhibits, wondering how the fuck it was that a drummer with one arm (Def Leppard) got his drum set in the Hard Rock, and mine got sold to some pre-pubescent fucker at a garage sale for a hundred bucks. Fucking hell.  Nobu's has the best fish on earth. Best pineapple martini's too. None of the fish smells like cooch either, unlike the sushi shithole I go to in Phoenix.  Double bonus."}
{"text":"It's midday in Las Vegas where hoards of fast-moving passersby armed with colored bonglike glassware roam the streets. It's like a sci-fy movie set in the future. On the corner in front of Bally's are impersonators...Zach Galfanikis holding a baby, Gene Simmons in his Kiss getup, and a life-sized Hello Kitty. I want to punch them all. All hope is gone.  I need an 18 year old, some vicodin, and respite from this madness. Eighteen year-old Scotch, that is.   I wander over to Caeser's sports book to kill time before the Preakness, but the glassware people are everywhere. I duck into the nearest restaurant hoping to find solace from these curious assholes. And there it was. A sanctuary in the midst of it all...Nobu's at Ceaser's.  The server was a nice young man who resembled that creepy shit from American Pie...the one desperate to abduct Tara Reid's panties on prom night.  That's all I kept thinking about throughout lunch.  My prom.  Well, that and Becky Deluca's sudden onset of virtue, not Tara's panties.  Five Asahi drafts and one ceviche later, I was prepared to face the madness once again. The bill was close to a Franklin, but I wasn't bothered. The ceviche was a visual extravaganza, its flavor and texture even better. The draft Asahi was nothing short of nectar, a gift from the barley gods. And the server? While creeping me out, he was more attentive than a black man at a Klan rally.  Becky must be in her mid forties by now. Probably wearing those giant, white cotton panties and mom jeans. I bet she and her husband sport colored glassware when they hit the mean streets of Vegas.  Nobu's Ceaser helped me find center when I needed it most. Mylute paid $5.20 to show. I had $200 across the board on him. Be wary of the bong people when in Vegas. Fuck you Becky."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly!!! I made a reservation and requested a note. As soon as they took us to our table the note was there just how I told them.   The food is really good but the salmon roll wasnt all that for me. Unfortunately, they didnt have uni when we went but the oyster shot were really good!! Lobster taco are so tiny but delicious!!!!Cocktails were tasty and refreshing. Everything we ordered is good its just that the portion is very small. It was a great experienced tho  Oh and the dessert! :) Order all of them hahahha. Everything is so good and the price is not that expensive."}
{"text":"Just had one of the most amazing dinners ever had in Vegas.  Went here with 4 other coworkers and absolutely loved it.  Luckily we were using gift cards so we went all out ... Totaling over $120 per person.  First let me start by saying I found my most favorite drink ever - which was the cucumber martini with lychee juice and grapefruit vodka.  It was so light and refreshing w a hint of sweetness.  I can't wait to try making it at home.  We ordered a bunch of cold plates to start - cucumber salad, artichoke salad, yellowfin sashimi, crab cerviche and spicy edamames.  All delicious!!    Then we had the spicy chicken skewers and the rock shrimp.  The shrimp dish was my favorite.   We ordered three desserts including the chocolate donuts and the bento box.  They were amazing but I wish they were bigger bc we all wanted more.  I have been waiting to go to Nobu in NYC for a while and am so happy I made it to the Vegas location.  Hope to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.  The Miso Cod and Maine Lobster are excellent.  The sushi is also great.  Try the tempura shrimp roll."}
{"text":"The food is out of this world!! Joey made the experience here even better! Ask for Joey if you come to have the best sushi. The yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos was fantastic. BJ (our sushi chef) was very helpful and will make anything you want.  Though a bit pricey this place is a must for all sushi lovers.  We also had the baked black cod, can we say \"total awesomeness\"! It was perfectly cooked, flaky with a sweet miso glaze. Joey our waiter was so helpful. I swear he knew everything about each and every dish. He was attentive and made sure we were satisfied with everything we ordered.  I can't say enough about the service or food.  This is a must for all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I was really ready to give Nobu an average rating - how much can you really pay for fish?  How good could it really be?  It really is that good.  I was in Vegas for a bachelorette party with some girlfriends, and we went to Nobu.  I'd been to Nobu Next Door ages ago in NYC...and I thought it was good but not outstanding.  Apparently they save the good stuff for the \"real\" restaurant.  I was underwhelmed by the resaurant decor - it seemed a little bit like any generic Japanese restaurant.  But the food was awesome.  We had the tuna sashimi salad - tuna was so good and the salad dressing was awesome (I love Japanese salad dressing), hamachi sashimi with jalapeno peppers, salmon sashimi with chives (loved it - and I'm not even a huge salmon fan), miso cod (liked it...but definitely loved the sashimi more) and the real winner I wasn't expecting was this shrimp tempura dish...  Tiny pieces of friend shrimp covered in some sort of mayonnaise-y kind of sauce.  Delish.   To accommodate some non-fish eaters, we got chicken which was fine, but really, who goes to Nobu for chicken?    I may have to take out a second mortgage on my non-existent house, but it was worth it..."}
{"text":"Overall great experience, emphasis on the experience.  Menu is $$$$ so be prepared to drop some coin.  The ambiance is loud - even for a casino.  I wasn't completely impressed with the food, especially for the price point.    Appetizers: Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar ($48) - The boyfriend absolutely loved this.  It was his favorite part of the meal.  I'm not a fan of caviar, so I wasn't a fan of the appetizer, naturally.  Nobu Style Tacos ($6 - $14, minimum 2) -  We chose tuna & king crab.  The tacos are about the size of an egg, but the tuna taco was AMAZING.  I could have ordered a dozen.  Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Tosazu ($28) - Nothing special.  Same tuna tataki as every other sushi joint.  Hearts of Palm salad ($24) - This was refreshing.  You don't see hearts of palm much on menus, and it was a great starter to the meal.  At this point, I saw a table of 9 being seated behind us in our waiters section, and I had a feeling the service might decline.  I was right. :-/  Some tables around us ordered a dish that was lit on fire when served, and I had to know what it was.  Our server explained it was the Wagyu grilled steak, the most sought after beef in the world.  Priced $38/oz, with a minimum 6oz order ($228).  I HAD to try it, and with reassurance from the boyfriend, the waiter placed my order.  (Side note on the gender bias... Is it such a crazy concept that I was paying for the meal?  Why did he need the male approval??)  The presentation was spectacular.  The steak is brought out on 3 hot stones & they light it on fire table side.  Quite a show!  Hands down best steak I have ever had.  (All 3 bites of it!)    The waiter said Nobu isn't known for their sushi, but that it is excellent.  We decided to make this our main course.  Yellowtail and Jalapeno cut roll ($12) - I thought this was excellent.  VERY spicy!  The boyfriend absolutely detests cilantro & at the beginning of the meal, the waiter specifically asked if we had any allergies or dislikes.  We mentioned the cilantro, and he assured us our meal would be cilantro-free.  Not the case with this roll unfortunately.  I don't know why he would ask if he wasn't going to follow through.  Toro (Blue Fin) and Scallion cut roll ($16) - Nothing special, just a normal sushi roll.  Tuna (Big Eye) with avocado cut roll ($12) - Again, nothing special.  Just another roll.  We also ordered 1 piece of sashimi that wasn't on the menu the waiter recommended.  It was a slice of Blue Fin that is aged 14 days in an air tight, refrigerated cedar box.  The waiter forgot to order it, so we had to remind him after all the other rolls had come & gone.  Again, nothing special, just another piece of sashimi.  ($14)  Overall, the food was average.  Certainly not what I was expecting for a $500 meal.  (Even for Vegas)  The service really wasn't up to par for an upscale restaurant either.  I am thankful for the experience, but we most likely will not return.  We'll try something new next time instead."}
{"text":"My husband planned on us going here for our anniversary. We were looking for a more upscale vegan restaurant which can be hard to find. He was told that they did not have a vegan menu, but options so we were a bit hesitant to go. Who wants to pay top dollar for sub standard options? They exceeded our expectations. The server, Leopoldo was more than helpful. He pointed out everything that was vegan on the menu and told us of options that we could veganize. He was also very careful at asking specially what our dietary needs were and how strict we were when we said vegan. Despite being busy, he made sure to come over and check on us and even stopped to chat. We decided on the mushroom toban-yaki which had varieties of mushrooms I hadn't even seen before, roasted vegetables that came with 3 interesting and delicious dipping sauces, and two veggie rolls; one with everything including okra and an avocado and asparagus roll. The prices were fair, the portions were more than enough, and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner in July and was very impressed. The atmosphere was very calming and the servers were attentive. For starters, we had the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno which i thought was delicious. The menu was quite confusing to me but i settled for the Chilean Sea Bass with Black Bean Sauce or Dried Miso and it was out of this world. AMAZING!!!! SO had the Chicken Teriyaki and that was also really good. To drink, I had the Lychee and Elderflower Martini and that was also really good.  All in all im giving Nobu 5 stars because of the service, food and ambience."}
{"text":"I recommend  starting off with a couple of martinis (I recommend the cucumber martini) and the Miso Black Cod and you will be in heaven....  We got a couple of rolls, but I have to say that I was not impressed with the sushi- I have had better. I was very disappointed in the sushi. Stick with the signature dishes and you won't go wrong.  If you like a little heat I recommend the peppers as an app--every 7th pepper as a kick. You never know what you are going to get and they are delicious.   Friendly and knowledgeable staff with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tasmanian Trout is a must try! Delicious! We enjoyed everything we had on the tasting menu, but we added the Tasmanian trout, at the suggestion of our server, and we were not disappointed. The service is impeccable, and the ambiance is nice. Bijan was our server and he was an absolute delight!"}
{"text":"So I have been to Nobu in a few different cities but haven't been in Vegas since this one opened. I'm not a big fan of Caesars but I was ready to stay here to stay at the Nobu hotel. Only problem was whether intentional or not the reservation agent on the phone pretty much talked me out of it. However, I still absolutely had to dine at the restaurant.   Love this place and the food is amazing at every location, no matter what you order but this one loses a star bc the bartender, although really nice was very aggressive about trying to get me to spend more money than I had hoped too.   First he mentions all these specials not on the menu and when I said I would try 1 he said it's either $80 or $120 depending on how I want it prepared. I guess I should be flattered that I looked so wealthy to him but it really was obnoxious.   After that anything I ordered or that he suggested I had to ask the price of and he still was dishonest with some house special roll that was supposed to be $30 something and on my check, which I didn't look at carefully until after I left I was charged $40 something.   He also made me a drink I didn't like bc he didn't want me to start with the drink I wanted too and charged me for the drink I didn't like or drink???  They were out of ingredients for 3 drinks I tried to order and basically for this level restaurant I was very disappointed with the service and selection.   I had to ask for a glass of water 3 times before getting it and for spending about $200, by myself I was not so impressed with the service I received. However I love Nobu so I'm sure I will be back anyway."}
{"text":"Excellent! Fantastic restaurant with excellent service. Really enjoyed the shrimp tempura, our toro sushi was sublime, best salad ever laced with truffles and more. Mina the server was superior as well as the rest of the staff from greeter to bussers. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a complete waste of money. I would recommend any other restaurant for the price."}
{"text":"This is the worst of all 5 star restaurants. I have dined at almost everyone and Nobu is a waste of money."}
{"text":"So first off, this is place is very expensive.  On sashimi, prawn tempura and  2 vegetable rolls I spent $88, just by myself.  So the ambience is quite lovely.  Dark and with beautiful lanterns.  It is a fusion of a modern and classy restaurant with Japanese influence.  I had the yellowtail sashimi...which is amazing!  I would definitely order it again. It's a must try signature disk by Nobu.  I also ordered prawn tempura, which was good but it only had two pieces.  I finished off with an avocado and cucumber roll. Which were good, but not worth the price.  Everything was a little over priced...but you're paying for the experience and ambience.  My waiter was very informative and professional but right off the bat he tried to get me to order a sampling menu, which is not what I was interested in.  So I cut him off and asked if i could order off the menu...which of course I  could.  So overall, unless you are sushi lover like myself, you may not want to spend money on Nobu.  I'm all about good food and the experience, so I was satisfied.  I would probably go back, but I'll probably go to the one in Malibu.  ps- I made reservations way in advance for 7pm on a Friday night"}
{"text":"Service: Me and my friend was extremely lazy after being so relaxed at the spa so we got room service.  So, no service comment on this part.  Food: The sushi was really good, it could've been better, possibly, at the restaurant but being at the spa all day...I was happy just to dine in my room comfortably.  The sushi didn't have a strong fishy smell, had the proper temperature, and the rice was just right."}
{"text":"We looking for to try fine dining japanese in side ceasars to see how great it would be since we are local . We looking at menu and we know we have to spend expensive dinnder . So we chose the cheft course which is we looking for spend and hope it worth it . So it start with 3 stater of three kind of sashimi of different fish . They all fresh and favor but all of the sauce just taste the same that have sour favor . And then we have really good main dish which is \"black cod miso\" we love it . It taste super good . Also we have seafood toban which is nothing special . And finish with desert . I have one cocktail which is so strong . And the service is standard not really personal touch . Its a meal of a life time ."}
{"text":"I had lots of good sushi in my life, but sushi in Nobu is a completely different thing. Everything is so delicious! We had Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, Seared Tuna Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing, Yellowtail and Scallion Roll, and Valrhona Dark Chocolate Fondant and Imperial Matcha Gelato. I could just not believe how good everything tasted.  All of the food was very good. Service was excellent. I am Europian and still can not get used to the pushi service in the US ( that one gets the check as soon as possible), but the server was present, but let us take our time and enjoy everything. The only downside is the pricing. It is really expensive, but worth the experience."}
{"text":"My expectations were met. We started with the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño. The thin slices with the jalapeño and a piece of cilantro in a tart sauce was outstanding! Then the wagyu taco and tuna taco. They were bit size but loaded with flavor. The wagyu beef melted in my mouth and the sauce brought out deep flavors. The tuna was light and very good. The black miso cod was soft and tender and the fish peeled off like a flower. The sauce was gingery and not overly sweet! We finished with thin slices of snapper with dry miso which gave it a crunchiness.  We ate most of their hit dishes and all met or exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"Three words: Miso Black Cod.  Oh My Gawd.   If you have to choose only 2 items from the menu, it would be the Miso Black Cod and the Miso Black Cod.  This is not to say that the other dishes aren't as fabulous - I would definitely recommend the Chilean sea bass with dried miso, creamy spicy crab, broiled Tassie  trout, and beef kushiyaki.    The cherry on top is the service - from the first phone call to reserve a table for 10 for a Friday night dinner (made a day prior due to a reservation cock-up at Social House), subsequent phone calls to organize the delivery of birthday cake, and the servers during the dinner.    All these made us forget about the $8 cake-cutting fee which, while ridiculous, is somewhat justified.    The damage report came to about $70 per person.  Money well spent, no less."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Nobu's in New York and the Bahamas and have loved each one. My wife and I were looking forward to our meal at Nobu's in Caesar's Palace. This location is unique because they offer teppan yaki. However we chose to sit at the sushi bar for the true experience. Our selection was the omaksase or the Chef's selection. This is supposed to be the best of the best if you are a sushi gourmet. Well, it wasn't. Most importantly the sushi rice was dry and not very flavorful. We had some nigiri and some hot dishes. Not impressed. On top of that the service was slow and we were sitting right in front of the cooks.   If you choose to eat here don't get your hopes up. It is average."}
{"text":"More like noob-u.  This is one of those places that, if you're a douchebag, you brag about making it in the door.  You don't go here to eat.  That is incidental.  You go here to spend a ton of cash so that you can talk about how much of a badass you are.  Okay okay.  I'm very impressed.  While you're snorting a couple of lines off of that hookers tits, I'm going to go across the street to the family Japanese place and get some pretty decent sushi, udon, and sake.  Have a nice time and viva las vegas and junk.  Seeya."}
{"text":"Expérience gastronomique américano-japonaise de haute volée ! Nobu est une chaîne de restaurants japonais fondée à l'origine à New York et qu'on retrouve maintenant sur les 5 continents (quoique pas en France). Celui-ci est situé à l'intérieur du Hard Rock Hotel, un peu à l'écart du Strip : attention quand vous faites votre réservation car il y a 2 Nobu à Vegas, l'autre étant dans le Caesars, ne vous pointez pas au mauvais endroit... La cuisine nippo-fusion du chef Nobu Matsuhisa est remarquable, les sensations gustatives surprenantes, raffinées, exotiques ! Vous pouvez vous laisser conseiller par le serveur ou aller à l'aventure dans la carte. Comme d'habitude dans un resto japonais, une ligne du menu n'est pas un plat suffisant en quantité pour votre repas : commandez plusieurs plats, d'un coup ou au fur et à mesure (le service est rapide), pour varier les plaisirs. Parlant de service, il est aux petits soins, sympathique mais curieusement familier, même au standard américain : pas du tout gênant, mais je m'attendais à un tout petit peu plus de formalisme. Bon c'est Vegas, peut-être qu'à New York il en va autrement. L'addition vient vous rappeler qu'on est dans un resto de stars (Robert de Niro est co-propriétaire) : comptez 200 dollars par personne tout compris (ouch) si vous voulez vous faire plaisir, ce qui est quand même le but de l'opération ! PS : il est indiqué au moment de la réservation et à l'entrée du restaurant qu'il est interdit de s'y présenter vêtu d'un maillot de bain. Je cherche encore une explication logique."}
{"text":"Really a 41/2.  Back a week later except ate in the bar this time.  Had them make a scallop role in soy paper with caviar on top, awesome.  Also, stuck with sashimi again - yellowtail, snow crab, Japanese halibut, albacore, and octopus.  One tuna nigiri and miso soup too.  Had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called Deleon.  Very smooth and unique.  Expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.  Service was very good and our server was very helpful and offered other local joints to eat at suggestion wise.  Expensive but a great place."}
{"text":"I was so upset when I paid 35 bucks for a tiny Sake (large) I kinda hated the place then on. In LA fine dining the same size is less than half that. On principle, I would never return, regardless of food or service quality."}
{"text":"Even though I ate at Nobu over two years ago the experience is still pretty fresh in my mind. Its one of the most memorable meals I've ever had. I came with a group of people during a conference and luckily got to expense the meal, otherwise the cost would have made me flinch.   We had a seven course chef's tasting menu that was OUT OF THIS WORLD. The dishes that stood out were the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno, the lobster tacos, and the whole yellow tail that came out on a stand so that it was upright and looking at you while you pulled the moist meat off of its carcass. Everything was great, including the service. I hope to go back and have another 7 course meal there someday!"}
{"text":"5 Stars.  Hmmm, what else can I say?  Ordered the Black Cod Miso!  Simply heaven. Sake serving ware is cute. Ambiance and decor is tres chic!  Bring some $!"}
{"text":"I was here for a corporate dinner and I was extremely underwhelmed by this place. Food was subpar with exception to the chicken skewers that had to be requested multiple times. A couple servers were dismissive and felt snubbed. Drinks/Sapporo was slightly below room temp but far from cold. Save your money and go elsewhere with better service."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Nobu's across the country and have almost never been disappointed. The Nobu at the Hard Rock get's it right. The service was top notch, they made you feel welcome. The food was typical Nobu. It was fantastic. Taco are amazing, we always get lobster and tuna, they had cerviche tacos which I never seen on a Nobu menu, they were great. Lobster cerviche, miso cod rock shrimp tempura ,lobster tempura and there special steak with a truffle sauce. We were not disappointed with any dish. There is a reason that Nobu's is my wife's favorite restaurant. They are always consistent. I can't wait to back again."}
{"text":"Nobu Malibu last Friday. Nobu Caesar's Palace this Friday, damn life is good. This is the biggest Nobu restaurant , and the waiter was great but service was a little slow. After waiting a long time between courses we got three dishes within minutes. The tacos are one of our favorites , but they double the price that they are in Malibu, but worth every penny. The food is amazing. Every thing in Las Vegas is expensive, So is Nobu, so spend the money you won't be sorry. Nobu is the best."}
{"text":"Nothing authentic about this place. Fresh seafood but there's nothing special.  Our wonderful waiter suggested the Tiradito which was good but certainly not the best I've ever had. Also, this place is a bit pricey. For 3 people we spent over $200."}
{"text":"Great service .. As always. Food was pretty  good as always ...EXCEPT!!!!!!... Ordered the lobster and we both SPIT IT OUT...then the manager essentially told us \"tough shit\"...."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner while I was visiting Las Vegas and was impressed.  All the food was fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"I would love to evaluate the food here but I can't, the host rolled her eyes and pretty much refused to put our name in. The place was completely empty. The restaurant is empty and I am across the way at the steakhouse instead."}
{"text":"Alright, when you first walk in, it's definitely got the looks of a hip trendy restaurant to be in. My friends and I walked sat in the lounge area, very classy, high class etc etc.  Now the service could have been a little better. They didn't seem to be that busy at the time and it may have been since we were just lounge area guests that we just got overlooked here and there. We even told the server we were in a bit of a hurry but even with that it took about 20 minutes to just get our order in and that was a little on the irritating side. And especially with the price that you pay for this restaurant, the wait staff could definitely be a bit more attentive.  Now it took an additional 30ish minutes to get our order out but when it came out, it was a gorgeous presentation with about 4-5 people bringing out the various orders we had.  The fish, was definitely fresh and the black cod was to die for but in terms of price to value I think I would still prefer other sushi locales on the strip. I've eaten at other similiar prices venues and great service should be synonymous with such. With better service this could easily be a 4 star review."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had just been telling me that we should try eating at Nobu, so when I saw a Groupon for this place the next day we couldn't pass it up.  We bought the $95 Groupon ($150 value) which included a five-course tasting menu for two. My favorite was the first dish, their signature yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño. I do agree with other reviewers who said the sashimi was a bit thin, but wow did it taste great. The dessert dish was a close second favorite. It included a molten chocolate cake, green tea ice cream, and a whiskey-infused cappuccino-like dessert. My least favorite was the assorted sushi dish that included a california roll and six pieces of nigiri (tuna, salmon, and snapper). Every other dish was unique and full of flavor, while this assorted sushi dish was average at best.  Aside from the five-course meal, we also ordered their popular cucumber martini. It was a strong little drink with a fantastically fresh aroma. I don't often love the scent of alcohol but this drink was a definite exception.  We had a very satisfying experience overall. Although slow at times, the service was great and every dish was thoroughly explained. The manager was also quite nice and stopped to speak with us for a moment.  We weren't entirely stuffed by the end of our five courses, but we were full enough. Overall, the food-tasting was a true experience and definitely worth a try, but this isn't a place I would frequent due to their notably high prices. To sum up my review - if you're into high quality Japanese tapas-like dishes and can easily afford the heady price point, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Service at Nobu is always par none! Paired with my favorite standbys here...Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeño!!!! This dish is a signature and is undeniably one of my favorites in the world. Super tender and the perfect combination of savory and perfect kick from the fresh jalapeño! The Rock Shrimp are just amazing with a creamy sauce and again with a perfect bite at the finish. Our server offered a variation of my favorite black miso cod- small portions served on butter lettuce cups that rocked so much I ordered a second.   For our special adventure we opted for the Hearts of Palm pasta- again a kick and for me interesting but not a fav yet Clarence loved it! Last and should have been first was their Miso soup- probably the best anywhere , served piping hot and I enjoy it as a finish.   The Wagyu Beef was so tempting but I passed. It is hard for me to order a dish equivalent to two new pairs of shoes... Honestly we have never been disappointed in a Nobu splurge. I was pretty full before the table next to us ordered it and caused me to have food envy but there is always next time.   Aaron was a super knowledgable and very attentive. The team of secondary servers were all on point. Huge kudus to the whole team here from start to finish with a standing O for the chef and kitchen too!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviewer that the food is not memorable and does not justify the price at all, nothing's special there"}
{"text":"O.M.G.  If you have the chance (and the money) to go here its amazing.  My wife and I went for our anniversary and did a 6 course meal prepared at random by the chef.  It was the most interesting and exotic meal I have every had.  Each course was brought out and explained, with no knowledge of the next dish. Everything was fresh and tasty.  Would highly recommend if you are up for adventurous dining!"}
{"text":"Might be the best restaurant (non-buffet) that I've eaten at in Vegas. We got the omakase (chef's choice) and every dish was amazing. Word of caution though, make sure you have at least two and a half hours to make it through the whole course. We talked to the waiter and thought we would make a 10pm show (starting dinner at 8pm), but that ended up in a whole lot of anxiety at the end and we also had to skip the soup course (#8). That being said, on to the good stuff. After every dish my wife and I were saying.. \"dude, that was awesome\". And unfortunately, yes, I do say \"dude\" too much. But dude (and I mean that in a gender-less way), it was awesome.  Sushi was good, mini toro tower (chopped toro with garlic and shallots) was amazing, miso fish was flavor packed, on and on from dish to dish it was surprising and great.  But notice I didn't say cheap... don't even go here if you have to think about the price. But worth every penny. Highly recommend the Mango Passion cocktail, my wife really liked it and she's pretty hard to please with drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Nobu to celebrate our anniversary.  Dinner was very nice and the service was excellent.  We especially enjoyed grilling our wagyu beef and vegetables on the little grill.  Then they presented us with a beautiful exotic fruit and sorbet platter for dessert which said \"Happy Anniversary\"."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food... Can't say it any better. Miso Cod was a 10/10. Tempura shrimp was perfect! Octopus salad was a perfect blend of flavored. Lobster roll was ok, not worth $35.  Only reason for not getting a 5 star was the waitress. She was clearly showing her boobs the whole time... Problem is, I was with my wife and mother-in-law.  Then, when serving other patrons, her low skirt revealed everything... Funny thing, you could hear the other servers/waiters talking about her attire."}
{"text":"Service was great, our water cups never emptied and they kept pouring the beer into my glass whenever it's half full. Food takes a little while to come out initially. I don't feel like I usually wait that long for appetizers in other restaurants that are of the same caliber. Food was good but nothing spectacular. I'd say Gary Danko in SF is better even though they serve different cuisines. I love Japanese food, I've been to Japan three times so I think I know what fresh sashimi is. And Nobu doesn't really compare. My biggest issue with the restaurant was the rude hostess telling me she \"needs the table back by 7:30\" and it was 5:19 when they sat us. I've never been asked such a thing ever. Not even at Olive Garden. Seriously?"}
{"text":"I have never tasted fish so fresh! Absolutely amazing! Service was a little slower than we'd hoped for, but picked up as soon as the food started coming! First time there, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe every review isn't 5 stars.  This was the BEST meal I have ever had.  Service:  5 stars Food:  5 stars Decor:  5 stars Cocktails:  5 stars   SO basically Nobu gets 20 stars.  Well done.  There were 7 of us, and we really liked our server from the start so we decided to let him know a couple of the standard rolls we wanted, and let him pick the rest (we wanted to try new things).  HOLY jesus they appetizers alone were amazing.  We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and it melted in your mouth; Black Cod Miso (My FAVORITE - I could have eaten 100 of these), and Bluefin Toro Tartar with Caviar.  All perfect.  Then we ordered a mix of rolls which were all amazing.  I just can't say enough good things about this place.  OH and I got a chocolate banana martini and my gf's got the cucumber martini's and they were outstanding."}
{"text":"Holy small restaurant. I was shocked at the size of Hard Rock Hotel and Nobu considering how big everything is in Vegas. I decided to sit at the sushi bar since the \"dining room\" was directly next to it. The sushi chefs were great conversation and they had great cuts of sashimi (which is important to me). Nobu LV felt more like a quicky place to get sushi. The motif of modern surfing really didn't strike me as Nobu like (I've been to the one in Miami and liked it better)."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas on business and a vendor took us here. It must go down in the top 3 of my all time culinary experiences.  We had the \"Nobu Experience\" which was essentially a chef's tasting menu. At the start we told our server our likes and dislikes as a group and a budget to work with. From there they proceeded to bring about a custom menu of a good 10-15 courses over the next 2 hours.  Food excellent, regular sushi will never taste the same again. The service was exemplary.  Our server (forgot his name) was very attentive and friendly.   It wasn't cheap. The entire check for 8 people was around $1,500 and that did not really include many alcoholic drinks. May be only 4 cocktails for the whole table combined."}
{"text":"must orders: (*) yellowtail with jalapeno (*) miso glazed black cod lettuce wraps (*) rock shrimp tempura with 3 different kinds of sauces"}
{"text":"I went there with a large group, about 10 of us. We decided to go with the Chef's choices. Everything that came out of the kitchen was really salty and didn't have much flavor. The issue was that we were spending quite a lot, and the food was subpar at best.  We mentioned this to the manager and he didn't seem very supportive. We even mentioned for him to try the food coming out of the kitchen, but again, there wasn't much support.  It's unfortunate that we had an experience like this, because we were looking to have a great experience and were let down considerably."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the world! And I've eaten that a lot of places around the world. If you do nothing else get the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño app. I could eat ten of these!!!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Nobu five times and never gotten service above below average.  One time the service was horrific and when we complained the server goose-egged his own tip on the credit card slip (party of 10, $1,700 tab and we were gonna just give him 15% but decided to roll with his suggestion).    As for the food it's 40-50% the quality of their NYC counterpart - and that's generous.  Don't get me wrong I have all the respect in the world for Chef Matsuhisa, but I guess that's what happens when you open a restaurant 3,000 miles away with a dining area the size of a football field.  Some dishes oversauced, others overcooked.  No love, man, no love.  If you want Nobu style food for half the price take a trip off strip to Sen of Japan.  If you're looking for high-end sushi on the strip Okada at the Wynn's the best I've had but I've yet to dine at Yellowtail (Bellagio) and friends tell me that's the best.  I've also had a couple good meals at Shibuya (MGM)."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and prompt. Mediocre food at best in contrast to price. If you want better food for the price - I would find alternative options."}
{"text":"OK, I am just saying..If I am paying $40 for 2 nigiri I expect that when I sit down the hostess does not hit my knee with the table pushing it in before I sit down. I would also hope that the server would not forget our drinks, or new beers/cocktails every damn time we ordered them until the second or third time we ordered them again. It would have been nice to actually get our entire order before giving up and just asking for the bill instead of the missing item, again. Sigh, having to ask the server to remove the items on the bill we never received but had asked for several times was a bummer too.. I will NEVER go here again, unless I am not paying.."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here to celebrate his 30th birthday. Our reservations were for 7:30pm, and we arrived at least 15mins before and were seated right away. Service was amazing and everyone was very attentive and worked together seamlessly. My boyfriend and I ordered about 6 different dishes and loved the fact that each dish came as a course. Everyone was knowledgeable of each dish and presented them in a very elegant manner. Also, our glass of water was never left empty, someone came and refilled them each time it became low. My faves had to be the Black cod with miso, yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño and the shishito peppers. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii so we have a Nobu. Las vegas nobu has the same taste as hawaii nobu. The bad thing about this nobu is the restrooms which is located outside of nobu. Very inconvenient. Be prepared Hawaii peeps higher prices and tax."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointing. Several of our party had been to Nobu in New York. This was NOT Nobu New York.  Our waiter was obscenely pretentious....and actually put a huge damper on our evening. The portion sizes were so small we contemplated getting burgers after our meal...and for context, we were a group of Canadian women, so not expecting the huge portion sizes America is known for.  We had to order 5 bowls of rice to save ourselves from starving (for the bargain price of $25 USD). The food was decent, but not outstanding. At over $170 per person, this was a low light of our trip."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here between acts at the Joint for a quick cocktail and snack.   Service was great, good was good.   Cocktail was perfect, Ceviche was ok, not my favorite.   We did love the yellowtail collar.  Really tasty"}
{"text":"I can not tell you how many times my wife and I have eaten here since moving to Las Vegas. If you only came for the food you would be set. But the service is right there too. From the moment we enter, every time the hostess remembers us. Our regular servers, Jay, Tyler, Scott and Ryan all provide wonderful  and amazing dining experiences. It really is great to see how different servers put the menus to the test for us.   Recently we ate at the sushi bar and that experience was awesome as well   On our most recent visit we did the Nobu Teppanaki experience. This is one not to miss. I really can not say enough good things about this place. It's one of only 3 vegas restaurants that I feel are worthy of coming to the strip to eat if you live here."}
{"text":"mmmmmmsashimi: i agree with most of the other reviewers about the sound level but luckily we were seated at a table for two next to the bamboo room divider. the level of service from our waiter was impeccable. he was helpful, engaging, and honest about the pros and cons of the menu. we shared a large bottle of nigori sake and edamame - which was seasoned with this light and feathery-textured sea salt. yum. i was disappointed that they did not have spanish mackerel that night but i consoled myself with the sashimi dinner plate. the salmon was simply mouthwatering and the tuna was perfect as was the yellowtail, red snapper, ebi, white fish, mackerel, and squid. david ordered the spicy tuna and tempura shrimp rolls and an order of unagi. for dessert i had the banana \"toban yaki\" that had sliced bananas and strawberries simmering in calvados."}
{"text":"I've heard various friends praise Los Angeles's Nobu over the years, so after my girlfriend ran the Las Vegas Marathon this weekend, we decided to celebrate with some first-class sushi.  We had reservations at 9:00 PM, and we were seated promptly (actually ahead of time, which was nice). My first impression of the restaurant was that it was extremely loud (we were there on a Tuesday night), and its location in the Hard Rock Hotel made me groan (it's a bit out of the way, and not necessarily a place I want to poke around).  Our waiter, Justin, was initially very prompt with our drink orders, but it took 10 minutes (and a reminder) to get glasses of water, and another 10 to get miso soup.  Our first course was only half right (we got two dishes, but one was not what we ordered). The servers apologized and took it away. At the rate they were bringing out our food, though, we shuddered to think how long it would take them to bring out the correct dish. Fortunately, it was corrected quickly.  When our sushi came out, we noticed another mistake: the spicy scallops had been mistakenly replaced with a second order of spicy tuna. Again, we told them it was wrong and again, they corrected the mistake rather quickly.  Service got to be so bad that after asking a server to hail our waiter (and subsequently having the request ignored), we decided to get the manager over to our table. We were 30 seconds from getting up and leaving (she took another 5 minutes to get to the table) when she came over and heard our story. She seemed as interested in our plight as any manager should and agreed to comp some of our dishes, which was nice.  Still, however, Justin's service through the entire night was abysmal (I think we saw him 3 times over an hour and a half), and no amount of manager treatment could save the tip.  Regarding the food, it was OK. The miso soup was great. The spicy tuna and scallop rolls were anything but (very mild), and the hot/cold mixture of the tuna tempura rolls was a little strange. It was good, but the temperature difference was one of those things that made me wonder, \"Is this supposed to be this way and I'm an idiot for thinking this, or is something actually wrong with how it was made?\" Judging by the fact that the tuna tempura rolls were one of the dishes they got wrong initially, it could have been that they rushed the order and made it worse. Either way, I wasn't really in love with it.  For the price I [would have] paid, I can't say that the Las Vegas Nobu is really worth it for me again. I've had much better sushi in Oakland, for much less."}
{"text":"Wagyu beef melts in your mouth. It's was excellent. The service was second to none. Looking forward to my next visit back."}
{"text":"Trendy sushi... LOVE IT! Obviously pricier than those sweet, little whole-in-the-wall places, but, you get what you pay for :)  The atmosphere was awesome.  The service was superb.  The flavored sakes were amazing.  The menu was impressive.  The presentation was pleasing.  The food was orgasmic.   Bomb."}
{"text":"We came here one time before and love it. This time we showed up and asked that they pick recommendations for our group and the entire staff took advantage of our request and picked the most expensive items on the menu regardless of our taste. It was the most expensive experience that we've had and made it for a very disappointing experience.  Furthermore we left the table still hungry.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Nobu and was so excited to try it. I will start by saying that the decor is absolutely beautiful. That is almost where my good review ends. We came here on 1/2/16. The waiter was extremely condescending to us, and when he found out I was interested in ordering sushi instead of being served family style in courses (eating sushi would have lowered our bill considerably and he was constantly trying to upsell us on everything), he announced \"WE ARE NOT A SUSHI RESTAURANT!\".  Uhhhh...really?!  Because that's the main food I've heard about from your restaurant.   After discovering I was ordering sushi anyways, the waiter kept asking, \"do you even know what that is?\" each time I mentioned a sushi roll (uhhh, yes. I've eaten sushi more times than I can count). My friend just wanted to order a normal entree as well since neither of us were overly hungry and we had tickets to a show and didn't have time to eat a meal with several courses.   When he discovered we wouldn't be spending $300+ on dinner, our waiter showed obvious disgust and barely came back to check on our table. We had each ordered a cocktail and were not even asked if we would have liked a second cocktail.   The sushi I had was pretty good, but to be honest, I had better sushi other places while in Vegas. My friend had some kind of meat skewers, which he said were good, but were very tiny. Due to how mean our waiter was, he opted not to order extra and just got a  sandwich somewhere else afterwards, which was ridiculous after spending $120.   I was so excited about this place, but the illusion is now over. I won't be back. Nobu, please look into training your staff. The service we received for this level of restaurant was atrocious."}
{"text":"We have eaten at different Nobu locations and have always had amazing meals.  This one was positively superb, with the best bite going to the mini beef taco.  It was $13 for the best 2 bites of food in my life.  It was a privilege to eat food of this caliber, with great service.  It was difficult making the adjustment back to earth and airline food today."}
{"text":"Solid 4. I've been here a few times and I think the quality has gone done a bit since they moved into Caesar Palace. They overly sauced a lot of their dishes which hides the natural fish flavor. The service is amazing but I have to dock them 1 star due to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I would like to update my review because Brian the manager at Nobu fixed the situation of being overcharged and Nobu is now one of our favorite places to go when we are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Matsuhisa Nobu, I salute you! Your food is divine. I am jealous of your restaurant's decor. I envy your river stone wall. I wish I was a celebrity so I wouldn't have to wait so damn long to eat in your wickedly awesome dining establishment! I simultaneously loathe and love you...in a platonic sort of way, of course...  Nobu (in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino) is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I've also been to Matsuhisa's in Los Angeles, but there's nothing like the Nobu experience. It's Vegas baby!!  Anyway, I've found that it's so much easier to make reservations at Nobu if you're actually staying in the hotel (which is awesome, by the way). One of my college roommates' sisters used to work there and hooked me up with a discounted suite on two occasions...SCORE! It also doesn't help if you're pretty slick with the pass-the-twenty-as-you-shake-the-host/hostess'-hand-in-order-to-get-a-table-faster bit. Never worked for me...kept dropping the money...  Back to the food: pricey? Abso-friggin'-lutely! Take one look at the place. Nice furniture, kitschy bamboo sake bottles and cups, rice paper wall paneling, indoor bamboo plants, wall inlaid with black river stones, huge sushi bar, and you mustn't forget about the main ingredient: location, location, location. The Hard Rock is practically a sure-fire way to keep this place packed with gorgeous-looking people. They need some way to pay the rent, right?  But is the food tasty? Hells to the yeah, it is! Every single dish I've ever had here has been delicious...even the ones that I'm usually not too keen on were better than other places (mirugai for example: here = tasty; other sushi places = like chewing on a salted piece of bicycle tire). The sea bass is prepared very well (nice and moist, flaky too), the rock shrimp is fried to perfection, the sashimi is beautifully presented, and the tataki is to die for...*sigh* if only I could be there right now... Their desserts are just as good as their appetizers and entrees. The last time I was there they had a passion fruit sorbet that could knock you out with its incredible flavor (oooh...my mouth's watering just thinking about it...and now I've drooled on my keyboard...how embarrassing...).  As I mentioned before, this place can get pricey. But, if you have the funds and the stomach for it, you have to go with the omakase (chef's choice). Tip: let your server know what you're partial to and what doesn't exactly float your boat in the food department (I'm not a big fan of uni (sea urchin), so I let 'em know that...thanks Nobu!). I believe there are different levels to the omakase dinner, too...at least there was the last time I visited. But, if omakase's not the thing for you, go a la carte...that way you can try a variety of Nobu's offerings. It's all up to you.  Since Nobu's in a Vegas hot-spot, be prepared for celebrity sightings as well. The first time I ate there, my wife and I were seated next to a group of porn stars (they had to be with their excessively tight and skimpy clothing, the gratuitous cleavage (both male and female), the over-tanned, near-leather quality to their skin, and (of course) the cowboy hats!) C'mon! Who wears a cowboy hat in a Japanese restaurant while wearing practically nothing?! Porn stars! That's who! I also walked past ex-San Francisco 49er quarterback Jeff Garcia, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, Enrique Iglesias, and Enrique Iglesias' mole (pre-divorce, that is).  Every visit to Nobu is like dinner and a show! I think that alone gives me my money's worth."}
{"text":"This Nobu was a huge disappointment compared to the Malibu and Newport location.  I ordered 9 pieces of sushi for about $125:  Scallop (2/5) - not fresh.  Unagi (3/5) - fresh, but cold and not grilled.  Ama Ebi (3/5) - fresh.  Ama Ebi fried head (2/5) - soggy.  Foie Gras (1/5) - it was cold and hard. So disappointing.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Their menu is broken down by HOT and COLD dishes.  They might have to add a LUKE WARM section unfortunately.  What happened to this place? I've been a Nobu fan for years. Las Vegas was my first followed by London, NY, Hawaii, and San Diego.  Well, I ordered the miso cod.  It was not hot, the miso wasn't cooked through (hard to explain), and the skin of the fish was soggy.  I also ordered the Las Vegas special Salmon Nashi which raved about a Japanese pear, truffle salts, and unforgettable other ingredients.  While the concept seems interesting, the execution was flawed.  The pear portion size to the salmon sashimi doesn't work.  Its far too big and takes away from the salmon leaving a confusing fruit and raw fish situation.  Also, the cuts of pear and salmon were inconsistent - just bad.  I spoke with the server and the man behind the sushi bar.  To sum it up they shrugged their shoulders.  They did not offer a better replacement or any other dish to maybe turn my experience around.  I hope other Nobu locations stay true.  I recommend skipping the one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Nobu gets two stars-naw never-mind, one-because it's not disgusting low standard sushi, but not the highest quality fish flown in from Tsukiji Market, Tokyo, Japan.   The sushi rice is lightly seasoned with rice vinegar and sugar; the flavor is almost nonexistent. At any moment there are between 7-10 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar that are all wearing plastic gloves are they make their nigiri & rolls... Some of their fish is pre-cut, and not only for the rolls, but the nigiri as well.   I asked who was the head sushi chef, and the waitress sat me in front of him; I forgot his name which mirrors how unmemorable my sushi eating experience was. He asked me what I wanted; I asked if he had an omakase  nigiri option, and he said no. I asked him if there was a tokujo: highest-ranked Sushi tuna option, and he didn't express that he knew what I was talking about. I asked him if he seasoned the nigiri ala Jiro & other high end Master sushi chefs, and he told me to just use the wasabi and mix it with the, \"soy sauce.\" I couldn't help but laugh out loud. I understand that most places you do season your own nigiri & rolls if you're into rolls with wasabi & shoyu, but Nobu is claiming that it's a high end authentic sushi restaurant and it is not.   The chefs are absolutely not formally trained under a lineage of Master sushi chefs. Their knives look somewhat average quality, as their steel is not strategically assigned to only fish, and only rolls & produce i.e. they were not switching knives for each tasks with their plastic gloves hands-like they absolutely do at authentic sushi bars.   I ordered the aged bluefin, anago, hotate, salmon belly & uni from Japan instead of the premium nigiri option because unlike omakase at my favorite sushi restaurant Sanraku in San Jose, I completely did not trust this plastic glove wearing sushi chef who the hostess said did not with the rest of the sushi making staff have formal training in Japan.   The tuna was sparsely sliced, and wasn't the highest quality. The hotate was definitely not from Japan and lacked sweetness and flavor; I seriously think it is from Costco because I buy scallops from there all the time and it tastes identical. The salmon belly was good; farmed but not bad. The anago was very disappointing, try and way overly seasoned with teriyaki sauce; sad to say it tastes like unagi and not authentic Japanese anago nigiri. At this point I told the guy to forget about the uni from Japan; he just smirked and said, \"next time...\" There won't be a next time...  I purposely didn't write about price as I don't like my reviews to be skewed or influenced by price-as I want them to be merited on taste & deliciousness or lack thereof only. But, I must say-the price is absolutely ridiculous! And, if I factored the price of this ignoramus stupid sushi in the star would be in the negatives. I usually go hard & fat when I tip-if even with a bad experience because you never mess with people who serve you food-food for thought... But, I tipped as scarcely as the cuts of fish that were placed on the tasteless sushi rice was served to me... I'll never go back to Nobu because I don't respect liars & imposters! I have more respect for a Chinese or Korean owned all you can eat sushi spot trying to come up because these folks work hard, and don't get the respect that they deserve. The people at Nobu are trying to prevent that they're something that they are not. They are the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu version of being fake Black Belts. Totally dishonorable fake imposters with mediocre low quality sushi that will fool ignoramus drunk Las Vegas gamblers. People from Japan would never eat here! And Nobu's wasabi is cheap green pasty shit and their ginger is average if Nobu was a sushi buffet. Last time I was at Sanraku in San Jose, CA the WHOLE sushi bar was filled with Japanese speaking people-except me as I'm Sansei & Hafu. The Japanese lady sitting next to me told me not to tell anyone, and to keep Sanraku a secret. These customers would completely frown on Nobu! I was honestly & sincerely hoping for a grand sushi eating experience being that I was in Las Vegas and do not gamble or drink, but Nobu shot me in the feet as my palate is in recovery that I hope is not permanent i.e. You're better off eating buffet style sushi than Nabu while in Las Vegas; Nobu Sushi is a ginormous ignoramus mistake..."}
{"text":"The Nobu caters to affluent crowd ambiance and service are unparalleled. the Sushi is expensive, Tempura outstanding. I had the Sashimi and noticed the cuts were the same as the sushi. My uncle in Japan would cringe at this."}
{"text":"It was the first meal after we landed in Vegas, and it was hands down the BEST sushi I've ever had!!  We went with the $150/person Omakase, everyone was extremely happy with every single dish that was brought out - fresh, perfectly prepared and seasoned/cooked, and talking about presentation - look at the photos! It was such great value too for the price.   Thank you Nobu for starting our Vegas weekend in a great way. Next time we'll try the one at the Hard Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"You know,   Nobu is good.   Nobu is good in Malibu, but Vegas being the copycat of LA seems to dress down all of the cities great places and ruin their names.  The fish was \"eh\" \"Ok\"..... not super fresh as the Malibu location and also served with the \"I'm pretending this is LA, attitude\".  Get it right Vegas, if your planning on copying an icon at least make sure you can back it up with flavor, freshness and quality."}
{"text":"I was shocked to get a same day appointment at Nobu and after I was done, I thanked my lucky stars I did.  The place was smaller than I expected but I found the ambiance very warm and the decor interesting.  I started with the tempura tuna which was like velvet in my mouth.  Smooth doesn't even begin to describe it.  Little did I know that I would forget all about that when I tasted the cod.  Everyone here raves about it - for good reason.  It is simply one of the most delicious dishes I have ever had.  My sister and took turns trying to con each other out of it...only a fish this delicious could spark chopstick violence between two loving siblings.  The creamy spicy crab was actually both creamy and spicy...and well spicy at that.  If you are used to things being under-spiced, then you would be pleased with this dish.  Tasty but not dangerous.  Not much else to add here - it is 10x better than can be described.  If you are in Vegas, check it out for sure."}
{"text":"I have been itching to dine here for a while and my boyfriend's 30th birthday was the prime opportunity! The staff made sure everything was in place for our large party and our table was serviced by 2 waiters. One was super laid back and cool. The other was super pushy and borderline obnoxious. Either way, they were both knowledgable and made sure we were taken care of. Of all the things we tried, the Chilean sea bass was the most memorable. I am not a sushi or seafood person, but I'd be back just to have that flavor again..."}
{"text":"Having heard many good things about this place, I was pretty excited to go here.  However, it just did not live up to my expectations.  The sushi was just so-so, I could have gotten it at any decent sushi place in the bay area.  Definitely not $100 meal kind of sushi.  Maybe it's because I didn't order the Omakase menu like most people who like this place, but I would think that when you're spending the kind of money you do at this place, even their regular dishes should be a cut above the rest, but they were not.  This is also the first place where I ever sent anything back.  The staff recommended a drink (some apple concoction) that turned out to be just terrible.  I'm not at all discriminating when it comes to alcoholic beverages (if it has alcohol and I can keep it down, fine by me!), but this drink was just so horrible that I couldn't take more than a couple of sips.  Another minus was the restaurant not having its own restrooms (had to go outside to the casino), which just sucked.  This place just did not seem worth the money at all, and I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's easy to pick apart Nobu.  Mister Matsuhisa's \"Nobu\" brand has grown so large (worldwide) and prestigious that it's easy to hold him to a standard which is almost unreachable.  And with all of this worldwide exposure I have a hard time tearing apart Nobu.  I truly believe the food is that good.    _C$"}
{"text":"This may be my favorite restaurant in the world. The flavors you discover sitting at your table here are amazing and the staff is amazingly kind and attentive. I've eaten her twice now and will be back many more times. The yellowtail with jalapeno is a taste delight."}
{"text":"If you like over priced sushi and waiters with attitude this is your spot. Portions small and taste to match.  Overall something to miss."}
{"text":"You definitely pay for the experience here, not the food. Compared to hotels, this is the W of sushi restaurants - super hip, ambiance is amazing, food is ok. We dined on a Sun. night, and the restaurant was packed. Our server was knowledgeable and professional, but forgot a couple requests/orders throughout the meal.  Also, servers need to understand how to cater to authentic Asian palettes - every suggestion our server made was really Americanized, we didn't like anything we got based on his suggestions.  We started with some apps: - Famed jalapeno yellowtail (yellowtail was great, the jalapeno was not spicy at all) - Rock shrimp tempura (we only got this at the suggestion of our server as the 'best tempura' choice. We originally wanted to order shrimp + veggie tempura.  This is NOT tempura.  It's basically bang bang shrimp) - Chutoro carpaccio (off menu item suggested by server. Pretty good flavors throughout. Capers, truffle oil, etc.)  Main: - Sashimi: yellowtail, yellowtail belly, oh toro, clam, red snapper, uni, salmon belly (bellys were very good, uni super fresh. Have had better oh toro for sure. Most were fresh, clam was flat out disgusting) - Rolls: house roll + soft shell crab roll (both very good. They wrap their rolls in a very thin layer of radish - nice concept. Gives a little more contrast in bite)  Dessert: - Bento box (probably best part of the meal. Matcha ice cream is very matcha!)  Drinks: - 10-year sake (decent) - White wine (basic) - Old Fashioned (at suggestion of server, really wasn't that great. Should have just gotten straight whisky)  Basically, if you're looking for a dining experience, Nobu is great. But I wouldn't come again to pay this much for the food quality - would definitely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"As Drake said, \"Nobu, Nobu, Nobu!\"  This Japanese cuisine inspired by South American culture restaurant definitely won a trophy in my mouth!  Excellent dining experience all around!  Located in Cesar's Palace, this Nobu is the largest!  Ambiance is nice.  Dimmed lights, very romantic.  Everyone that we had encountered was kind & attentive to our needs.  Our server, Tyler, was top notch & we ordered everything that he recommended!  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño:  So fresh!  No soy sauce needed, just the sauce it comes marinated in is all you need.  Instead of ginger, they provide cilantro as a means to cleanse the palette.  Very neat.  Salmon Sushi (1):  Fantastic! Salmon Belly Sushi (1):  Seriously, the only sushi in the desert I will ever eat. Black Cod Miso:  A must order!  I repeat, a must order!  Move over Chilean Sea Bass, you have met your match.  The cod is marinated so perfectly, the sauce is sweet.  & it cut like butter into perfect thin slices.  I tried to take as little bites as I could to savor the goodness & literally wanted to cry when it was gone.  If I could do it again, I would order 2 more. Hamachi Kama:  This was supposed to be an appetizer size but because of the size, it was a meal.  Delicious!  When you make a reservation online, you will have to put your credit card information."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with Nobu, however this was my first visit at this location in Ceasars Palace and it was as great as the one in Hard Rock. This is a sleek, chic ambient place that begs to stay and try new things.  As most reviews have mentioned over and over, the black miso cod and lobster roll can't be missed. The flavors are just so so good. I will add that we tried the sea bass skewers, and filet and both were excellent as well.  If your feeling adventurous this is the place to do it as far as sushi goes. It is fresh and delicious and the variety we tried this time around left us full yet we managed to finish it all. 6 different rolls and all were exceptional.  For those who are undecided and want to try a little of everything there is several tasting menus to choose from, but if that's too much, tell your server your preferences and they will direct you to the perfect sashimi nigiri or sushi. Chefs specials we ordered were also impressive!  So go ahead and splurge and be adventurous here, try things you haven't tried and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  If you have room left for dessert, get the banana one. The drinks were also fresh and inventive!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but food was a disappointment. Ive been in n out of the bathroom for the past 5 hrs.... Food was salty this time around."}
{"text":"Of course it's expensive....I'm shocked at the people who show up and express dismay. It's by far the best and most consistent sushi in the country. The rock shrimp is my favorite appetizer in any sushi restaurant. The bar has an amazing cocktail menu...very creative.   Try the Acai Serrano martini, wonderful."}
{"text":"I had never been to any of the Nobus but I was expecting a lot for from this restaurant - for these prices, I expect to have something, anything, jump out at me and slap me across the face.  Two of us went and tried the following: 1) Salmon Belly - $30. meh - had a wierd honey mustard sauce on them. 2) Uni tempura - $15-20 (i forget) - it was okay but nothing special. 3) Black cod Miso - $20ish - fine, but this is a cliche at japanese restaurants at this point.  They tried to offer it in \"lettuce wrap\" form which should have been a huge red flag. 4) Live Scallop - the best dish we tried - simple, spicy. i forget the price. 5) BIG MISTAKE - Kobe beef tacos. $42. Three tacos, half the size of our palm, and tasted like street meat.   It was difficult to avoid fried, saucy, overwrought dishes.  If I were to characterize this restaurant in one sentence it would be:  Japanese Cheesecake Factory.  We ordered a couple bottles of Sake which pushed up the final price, but we wound up spending about $180 per person for a very mediocre meal that left us still kind of hungry.   Atmosphere (in the Hard Rock Hotel) was also subpar - could have been any vegas restaurant and the service was not particularly good either.  If you're going to blow this kind of money, spend it at the Spearmint Rhino."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. Reservations were easy through OpenTable. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. You have to try the foie gras cappuccino. It's a soup and it's incredible!"}
{"text":"I have been in this restaurant for 5 times. Their food is great and is worthy to come back."}
{"text":"After a second visit, I am rating this 4 stars instead of my thoughts of 5 stars from the previous visit.   The service was fast, our server was fun and friendly.  They do push a little too much for you to order many items at once, but keep in mind you can order a few things and add on later.  We did not order dessert because we were too full from ordering too many items.  The drinks were just okay and we felt they were overpriced, like the \"Blood of the Gods\" cocktail which was very small, sweeter than expecting and lacking flavors.  Food wise, the quality of the ingredients are the freshest around.  The tempura was slightly disappointing as we have basic tempura in our minds but the plate was small pieces sitting in a sauce so there is really not much crunch.  Toro was to die for!  The salmon belly sushi roll, so flavorful!"}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian omakase ($100), my friends got the regular omakase ($125).   PROS:  - they have a vegetarian tasting menu! - service / our server was amazing, incredibly knowledgable, helpful and guided us through both our selections and the courses  CONS:  - there isn't one in SF."}
{"text":"We're fans of a lot of Nobu's creations, frequenting a local restaurant that was started by a chef that trained under him and also cooking some of his recipes at home, with one of his cookbooks.  That being said, we've never had Miso Black Cod executed nearly as well - Nobu managed to keep it incredibly moist and not overly sweet. It was the best miso black cod that I've ever tried.  We both opted for the Bento Box ($55) during lunch, so that we could try a smattering of his menu to compare to what we make at home. Each dish exceeded our home versions by a mile, it was a great experience to see the stark improvement in quality and it made the rather pricey bento box worthwhile.  Dessert was mochi but they were frozen hard like ice hockey pucks and required some serious effort to cut. The flavors were okay though.   Service was pretty good.  We'll probably return to some of his restaurants in the future, we had a nice time.  I think we spent about $175 on lunch for two, after tax and tip. That included 1 Asahi draft beer. Pretty pricey... but it was a good lunch."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted about this review.   We figured it out, and; Nobu cost us $11 per bite. Seriously.   The reason I'm conflicted is: those were pretty damn good bites.   It was super tasty, but considering I had could have had unlimited amounts of  almost-as-good tuna from Bacchanal at Caesar's for half the price, I'd probably opt for the latter any day."}
{"text":"Excellent. The sushi here is incredibly fresh, and some of the best I have ever had. Service was outstanding as well. Eaten here twice now, and the rest of the courses are hit and miss. None are bad, but some are just OK to good, whereas the sushi is incredible. Liked the tacos, although they are tiiiiiny, the size of a thumbnail, for $10 each. Black miso cod was good, but not amazing. Neither was dessert. Sushi was really their strong point. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great food.  Like really great food.  Beef was possibly the best I've ever had.  Still thinking about it a week later.   Service was fine, not great like the food, but fine.  Having to walk through Hard Rock to get there kind of sucks the upscale feel out of it."}
{"text":"bad experience. went there with my family to celebrate my mom and the service was horrible. in about 2 hours of being there we only had 4 appetizers. we told them that we wanted the main course dinner and that we were done with appetizers and they didn't come back for a while.  not a very good impression for the first time at Nobu, i heard the one at Malibu, CA has way better service and i am willing to try it again there but not in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have had the privilege of enjoying sushi from several parts of the country, and so far this is as good as it gets.  It's pricey, but it is absolutely delicious!    The service was fantastic, and we followed our servers recommendations on several different dishes.  I distinctly remember the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño.  It was so delicious we ended up ordering it twice."}
{"text":"We ate at bar, as we like to see sushi prepared.   We weren't that starving after eating a late lunch at pool, but menu didn't offer basic fresh rolls.  Sushi maker busy making table platters so service was not timely for a sushi bar.  No dedicated Waiter for sushi bar, so no one offered us refills on beverages."}
{"text":"Came in with a large party. The food was good, but the waiter forgot a few of the parties orders and service was very slow ... even though there seems to many people on staff, some were just standing by our table and texting, but not noticing everyone had their food except one person at our table.. it was weird.  Location was very convenient for Magic Mike.  I would go back as like I said the food was good, but with a smaller party."}
{"text":"I love sushi! Every time I'm in a city with a Nobu, I try and stop in.   Yummy cocktails to start - check! Yellowtail with jalepenos and cilantro - check! Lobster ceviche - check! An array of awesome sushi - check! Waiter who seemed super interested in all the eye candy - check! This place would have had 5 stars, but when you spend $150/ person and have sub par service...well- enough said!"}
{"text":"3rd time at this NOBU and I give them an A+ for consistency. I love the food and service was great. I love the the intimacy of this place as it is much smaller than their other locations. Although it is inside The Hard Hotel, once inside- you forget that you are in the middle of a casino. I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Ate here in july while at a conf. The food is very good, but the service was not good. Our waiter was almost useless. Sorry, I know you have high standards, but this guy could have cared less that we were there. I think the big thing was he tried to up sell us on a Chef platter, and we said no we would like to pick our own meals not the chef. So after that he went cold. The food is very tasty. I would recommend it and will be back. I just hope I have another waiter. I have a shell fish and gluten allergy and they were easy to work with."}
{"text":"This was one of the better meals I've ever had.  Part of what made this meal so great was a very knowledgable server that worked with us to navigate the menu and put together a perfect meal with 6 different courses.  Her reccomendations were spot on and her customer service was perfect. Had a great start to the meal with yellowtail with jalapeño.  Then the new style salmon sushi, it's barely seared and absolutely delicious, maybe the best course of the night.  Third was the rock shrimp, it's lightly fried and not at all greasy or heavy and the sauce was excellent.  The squid pasta is not pasta, but squid shaped like pasta.  This was the other contender for best course, loved the squid, the veggies and the sauce.  The black miso cod is excellent and the servers reccomendations to have near the end of the meal was perfect because it's a little sweet.  We finished with a couple of small bite size beef tacos after all that seafood.  Nobu is arguably overpriced but we had such a great experience l, I can't complain."}
{"text":"I have been to several Nobu locations and this was my least favorite of all of them. Service was ok (not AMAZING like other locations), the chef we had seemed like he was new, quality was definitely not up to par with other locations, and it was so jam packed full of people it wasn't even enjoyable.    Other Nobus, they let you savor everything and encourage you to take your time which enhances the experience...at this one, I just felt rushed. And did I mention jammed in like a sardine? (Although those would not be welcome at such a swanky place)   Another annoyance: every. single. recommendation the waiter made was literally some of the most of expensive items on the menu (like...2-3x the price of the average). I mean, if I go to Nobu I expect to light some money on fire but if I followed his recommendations, it would have been $300 a person before cocktails. *smh*  When the waiter wasn't trying to inflate his tip with 1%er recommendations, ironically, he was completely missing in action. The bussers were fantastic and attentive though.   Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location. Get an Uber, go to the Hard Rock location where the ambiance is entirely different and the service and quality are some of the best you will ever have and truly up to Nobus standards. This location definitely lowers the bar and is not up to the standards we've experienced at other locations."}
{"text":"We were there for New Year's Eve dinner.  We decided to order off the menu instead of their New Year's chef's tasting meal.  We had some sushi, a few appetizers, a few entrees, etc.  Reason I don't list all of them individually was that for the most part they were all good, but not spectacular.  If I could give 1/2 stars, I would have rated the restaurant 3.5 stars.  The stand-out was the miso black cod, which i would give 4.5 stars.  I think by now, people now what they are getting with Nobu.  Pretty good experience but not sure it's worth the hype or money."}

{"text":"Came here with a Travelzoo deal $95 for 6 courses for two people. The food and service was good but it doesn't quite feel like a deal for what we got.    Soba fritters - similar to polenta fries Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño - this was super flavorful Mixed sushi and roll - typical sushi and nigiri Miso black cod - super moist and flavorful Grilled beef strip loin with anticucho sauce - tasted more like a mexican dish rather than japanese Donuts and ice cream   Everything was good but like I said earlier, it didn't feel like we got a deal. The $95 we paid felt right. This makes me realize how expensive it would be coming here without a deal.  For a similar style, format and pricing (no deal needed), check out Yonaka. It's a must for us everytime we are in Vegas.  I would come back but only with a similar deal. Otherwise it's really expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Came here last night with the Wife and brother, we ordered 5-6 rolls of sushi including salmon and avocado and sushi with tomago. The sushi itself was great, but something about it just didn't hit the mark and therefore I cannot give this place a full 5 stars. The ambience and atmosphere was great though.  The highlight of the night was running into Martin Garrix who was the DJ of the night at Omnia Nightclub!"}
{"text":"Love Nobu! It doesn't even seem overly pricey compared to all the other restaurants in Vegas, and the food is AMAZING. I had the yellowtail & jalapeno sushi, snow crab sashimi, and black miso cod. The cod was extremely flavorful and cooked to perfection. Service was attentive and the ambience was great. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nobu was pretty much the definition of an amazing dining experience. Our waiter was friendly and his suggestions were on point! The food was simply delicious. It is definitely along the more pricey side, but what the hell, you gotta splurge sometime! I can't quite remember exactly what we had because we ordered quite a lot! However, I do remember that their mochi was the best I had ever tasted. They had several different flavors, they even had a pumpkin flavor. That one was my favorite. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"An out of body sushi experience Never even heard of some of these fish... Had to try each one that I never heard of before Truly a unique dining experience!!!  What are you waiting for? Go go go and don't you dare order anything you recognize or are familiar with!!!"}
{"text":"Best dinner of my life. From start to finish, the service, the food, the experience were impeccable. First time and we allowed our server to guide us through with selections and I'm so glad we did! If you're looking for an amazing dinner while in Vegas- Nobu is a must! Now I'll just keep dreaming of the next time!"}
{"text":"What is there to say about Nobu that hasn't already been said? This is an incredible dining experience, through and through.  We made a reservation for 7:45, and arrived a bit early, but luckily scored seats at the bar to sit and soak in the Nobu ambiance prior to arriving at our table. We all settled on the rosé ($15/glass), and hung out at the bar until the hostess came over to bring us to our table.   Everything about Nobu is sexy - the pods with couches, the low lighting, the tables that are a bit low to the ground.. it's just a beautiful and completely sensory experience.   Everything at Nobu is designed to be shared, if you aren't as greedy as we were and decide to opt for that. We decided to order a cold dish, hot dish, and sushi rolls to share, and then each order an entree.   You can also select Omakase, if so desired, which is always a nice option to have when you're indecisive.   We started with the famous, and according to our server, most popular Nobu cold dish, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno ($29 for 6 pieces). It was the perfect start to the meal, and I honestly feel like I could have eaten an entire plate of it. It was so clean, so fresh, and the jalapeno/sauce on the plate combo was perfection. They'll also allow you to order a few extra pieces depending on the size of your party, so that each person can get two pieces (or they recommend order an additional order of it). Honestly, this is what I will dream of when I picture food heaven.   We also ordered a spicy cauliflower with jalapeno dressing, and then sushi rolls (spicy tuna, yellowtail and jalapeno, and shrimp tempura). All came out at different times and were delivered to the center of our table, and all were devoured almost instantly. The cauliflower was the perfect level of spicy, and the sushi was deliciously fresh and rolled beautifully.   For an entree, I ordered the scallops with wasabi pepper, and my colleagues each ordered a different dish as well, so if we wanted to try something new, it was available to us. The scallops were perfection - cooked beautifully, surrounded by a ton of delicious vegetables, and the most gorgeous level of spice. Seriously, it's 9 AM EST right now, and I'm dreaming of this amazing dinner.  In lieu of dessert, we each ordered another drink (another rosé for me, champagne for the rest of the group), to round out a night of indulgence.   Nobu is truly the epitome of elevated dining - the food is unparalleled, the service is wonderful, drinks are delicious and well poured, and ambiance is stunning. It's a wonderful treat for a night out, and one that I cannot wait to return to."}
{"text":"Nobu is a very high-end classy restaurant, however, it is more geared toward making money rather than the customers. They said they will choose the menu for us and they pick the MOST expensive dishes and MOST EXPENSIVE...WATER. No wonder the bill came to be close to a grand. After eating small plates of samples which were called meals I wanted to throw back up all my food seeing the bill. When we went to Las Vegas we expected the food to be expensive but not this expensive.   However, I cannot deny the amazing service and polite toned waitress and waiters. I did enjoy the food very much but if you have a big appetite I would not recommend. The food comes in bite size portions but it very clean and smooth. From the sushi to soups were crazy good. I cannot believe what I was tasting because it was a new amazing taste. It was my first time at a high high-end restaurant and it was traumatizing mainly due to the bill. However a very good first time experience and only experience."}
{"text":"Been curious about this restaurant for a while. Was a beautiful dining room and good food, but not ultra amazing for me.  Food: 4, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 3 Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (didn't find quality to be miles above other Japanese restaurants to warrant the pricing) Return worthiness: maybe Eve award: best fancified shave ice  Highlights: - Big portions: expected tiny plates for the tasting menu, but the portions were really large. Started with 3 huge pieces of white tuna  - Shaved ice: huge mound of airy shaved ice with fruit, jellies, mochi and tofu ice cream hidden below. Tofu ice cream had a firmer texture that was a nice contrast to the delicate ice above it. 2 sauces were provided to pour over: green tea and passion fruit. Surprisingly the hit of the night  - Variety of sashimi: 3 different preparations and 6 in the nigiri set - Decor: loved the modern, lively, open feel to it with bursts of color - Flourless chocolate cake: I've had a lot of these, and this was an excellent rendition. Warm and melty inside with a bit of a crunchy exterior layer. Appreciated the Asian flair in the bento box presentation and green tea ice cream pairing. - Not all have to tasting menu: like this as it makes ordering easier especially with the non-seafood eating hub - Cocktails: fun menu--we tried a few  Midlights: - Service: hard to catch our waiter   Lowlights: - Undercooked miso cod: this is a signature dish, so was very disappointing. It had a gummy texture and didn't flake off like it should.  Had a good meal here but not sure I'd race back."}
{"text":"It should go without saying that Nobu is an expensive restaurant, so don't complain when you pay $30 for the smallest sushi roll you have ever seen.  Don't think that just because a roll has a big rice that is fit for sharing.  I am sure a lot of thought, planning, and preparation that goes into each roll.  If you don't mind paying a lot of money for very good, but small, sushi pieces, then you will be happy.  On the other hand, if you are used to getting a lot of food for your money, you will be disappointed or broke.    You may also want to go to Nobu for its high energy vibe and great atmosphere.  It is inside the Hard Rock Casino that is a younger and livelier crowd than some casinos.  The service is better than average and the decor is very nice.  There are also other entrees other than sushi.  You will save several dollars and get what you pay for if you stick to hand rolls, sashimi or regular sushi (2 pieces).  This will offer you the opportunity to appreciate the high-end atmosphere without high-end prices."}
{"text":"3 stars for the great chef platter! - 2 stars for the shaky service  Came in this past Friday night for a romantic date night out. Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess that showed us to our table. It was almost cafeteria style, sitting right next to another couple. Finding this to be extremely awkward we opted to sit at a nearly empty bar instead. The two bartenders that were working were vastly different. One (younger guy, I think his name was Rob) was upbeat and very nice. The other guy made us feel beyond unwelcomed and like we were more of a bother to him then anything.  We chose the chef platter. This came with 10 pieces of fish,  5 different types. It also came with a Himalayan salt block which was amazing! Everything was so fresh and amazing quality. The bartender almost ruined the experience for us so we will not be back at this location, we will try Caesars in the future."}
{"text":"I was with a group of 7 other guys and we thought we'd try Nobu on the eve of my buddy's 30th birthday.  It started off as a \"minus\" experience because the restaurant misplaced our reservation, despite me walking up to the hostess the previous day and making it in person.  But, they seated us right away in the lounge area, so no harm, no foul.  The ambience was great... the larger-than-expected restaurant had a modern/Japanese vibe.  The service was as to be expected for one of Chef Nobu's restaurants.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and our courses arrived at a perfect pace.  As for the food... it was nothing short of fantastic.  Having not eaten at a Nobu restaurant before, every dish was a treat.  We all opted for the prix fixe menu.  At $125 it was expensive, but Drew only turns 30 once, so what the heck.  There was a good mix of cold and warm dishes, as well as a few non-fish items.  While it was a great overall meal, I doubt I'd pay that much for that meal again.      Pros:  Food.  Service.  And food.  Cons:  Price."}
{"text":"Much like almost everything in Las Vegas, this is just a generic duplicate of the NObu back in NYC. Thankfully, everything was just as delicious. I wish they would open a Nobu in SF!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on the advice of my friend even though I don't like sushi. What a mistake! Out of the 4 of us, 3 of my friends got their dishes right away. I had to wait till they were all done and STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN MY FOOD. They don't give a crap about anybody not eating something raw. To top it off they didn't even give me an update after waiting 30mins. Terrible never again. It's not important what I got because the whole visit left a \"sour\" taste in my mouth, before I even got my food."}
{"text":"Food is superb at Nobu in HR Hotel. Service is superb. It's a top quality restaurant that's also informal and comfortable. But watch the prices. Even without wine it was one of the most expensive dinners I've had. Especially wonderful and expensive was the Wagyu Beef dishes not carpaccio at cooked. But it was spectacularly good."}
{"text":"Fantastic Japanese food and service but didn't think it was worth the $175 per person final bill with tax and tip.  Went with a bunch of friends and ordered up about 6 dishes along with drinks and sake. Some of the dishes we had were: - lobster tempura - 5 stars - so flavorful meaty chunks of fresh lobster tail deep fried with a thin layer of tempura along with 4 different delicious sauces - black cod with miso sauce served in lettuce shells - 5 stars - fantastic - yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - 5 stars - fantastic and yummy pieces of yellowtail with jalapeno and also soaking in a delicious light sauce (no need to add own soy sauce) - ahi tuna in special light sauce - 5 stars fantastic too - chucks of ahi tuna in little mini taco shells - 3 stars - the flavor of the tuna was lost among the deep fried taste of the taco shells - beef tenderloin - 3 stars - was nice but nothing too special  The atmosphere is elegant but cool with a nice Vegas buzz and liveliness. This elegant Japanese place seemed a bit oddly located in the crazy and informal confines of the Hard Rock Casino. Service was excellent and attentive - we had basically asked our server to choose a set of dishes for us and I would say most of the selections were awesome.  Bottom line: Definitely had some fantastic dishes here but don't think it was worth the exorbitant prices. Probably could find the same quality of food for half the price at some other very nice Japanese restaurant.  But highly recommend giving a try if you are charging to the corporate card!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have ever had! All you sushi lovers you are doing it all wrong try this place to get your sushi wings, Also the manager was very pleasant I had a broken ankle and he gave the closest table!"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and  you want to have great sushi in a fantastic hip spot, then head to the Hard Rock Hotel and go to Nobu's  Sure the Sushi is over priced and everyone is there to be seen, but that is what Vegas is all about. The Sushi is fantastic and consider the higher prices as a cost of entertainment."}
{"text":"We started with some drinks at the bar for our 5-10 minute wait for seating. A super classy mixed drink with white rum and coke. Best way to get a rum and coke I should add. To start we got edamame and a tempura roll. Then came the fish. The waiter persuaded us into some good dishes so I wish I could recall. Very superb tastes."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Were the first words I thought of when I was dining and leaving this restaurant.  My best friend recommended this restaurant as we were planning our Vegas trip.  I didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  Once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  We ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  Our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  First dish on our table was the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  This dish is awesome!  The flavoring along with the fresh Yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  We also had the Monkfish Pate, Sashimi Salad, Black Cod with Miso, Broiled Yellowtail Collar; Creamy Spicy Crab, Rock Shrimp Tempura with Ponzu and Creamy Spicy Sauce.  All around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  Their Lychee Martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  I highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  This is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  Just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!"}
{"text":"Ok so I have gone here twice. The first time was good and the second time was extremely disappointing. I decided after the last dinner that I would not return - especially with all the other choices in Vegas.  1. The waiters seemed to BS their way around explaining the menu.  2. The quality of the ingredients did not warrant the prices. 3. Since everything is ordered on a per piece basis, it makes ordering a litIe cumbersome - who really wants to order tempura on a per piece basis? Especially since it is the same assortment of tempura you would get anywhere else.  I eat Japanese food fairly often, so I know my way around... and this was definitely not up to par."}
{"text":"Heard so much about Nobu so we got the chef's menu.  I thought everything was nicely done.  The food is good, but it is also quite comparable to good sushi places. The service was exceptional, and attention was paid to small details.  The display for the food was nice, but the quantity was small. That being said after the six course, I was pretty stuffed."}
{"text":"Five star all the way. Let's be honest I do not lie sushi never have meet will. But whoever is the chef at this location does not make sushi he or she takes a little piece of haven and puts it on a plate. Not matter the cost you must try before you die!!!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected from chef Nobu! Very average dinner at a outrageous price....I went to Iron Chef Morrimoto's in Napa and was blown away! Went in with high expectations to Nobu and left hungry and no WOW factor. Believe it or not best thing on the menu was cocktails and dessert."}
{"text":"Four stars is the right rating... excellent food and service.  Prices are very high, but to be expected.  The appetizer dishes are better to share than entrees which are rather small.  Sake flight was a good value and worth checking out.  This location is likely a little different in terms of ambiance as its located in Caesars.  There were plenty of choices for a few in our party who don't eat seafood as well.  The food was five stars, but portions and pricing make it four stars overall."}
{"text":"The restaurant's interior, is absolutely amazing, the staff is super friendly  and fun all around. However I ordered a sushi dinner and a sashimi dinner, I have to say that this was one of the worst sushi experiences I had in a very long time, this was 100% NOT FRESH, I understand we are in the middle of a dessert... But god come on please!!! Certainly overpriced for bad quality fish. Maybe they should look at quality first instead of flooding the world with more restaurants. Deeply shocked... wake up people..."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, my friend and I felt the need to fly 5+ hours to eat at two restaurants that have locations in NY (Nobu and Craftsteak), but whatever.  The food here was good, but I felt like the waiter was pushing us to order a ridiculous amount of food which would have been a total waste for my friend and I.  The hamachi and jalapeno appetizer was quite good and of course, I had to order the miso black cod, which was good, but not the best fish I've ever eaten (In fact, the fish my friend got was better.)  The drinks were decent.  All told, a nice meal, but pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong with my two star rating at a famous, highly rated restaurant. I really wanted to believe the hype, but it failed to impress me.  The food was good. The fish was very high quality. I had the $125 chef special omakase with 6 courses and everything tasted fine. But that's just it. It was ONLY fine and not mind blastingly delicious. It was merely satisfactory and I don't feel the cost was justified. For two of us, it was nearly a $400 dinner including two glasses of wine plus tip. So I expected to walk away like, \"Holy cow! That was more incredible than the Hulk!\" But instead it was more like, \"Ehhhhhh it was good but I wouldn't go again.\"   I don't mind spending money for an amazing and memorable meal. I truly am a person that lives to eat. But I've had omg-so-effing-good-must-serve-at-my-own-wedding food for less than $10 too. So for $400, I want exceptionally outstanding food. I understand you also pay for the service, ambience, quality, and even the name too but I just didn't buy into it all...   Maybe it's overrated. Maybe I'm being too critical. Maybe a little bit of both. But bottom line, Nobu is a no-go for me."}
{"text":"The now 4-6 month new Nobu in CP!! The largest one open in the country.... yay! We landed reservations after our show at the Mirage. Walking around and enjoying the leisure stroll was just perfect before our 10PM dinner.  Impressive!!!! Kind of steals your breath away to see  how Chef Matsuhisa has fashioned his newest restaurant in the Empire (of the Rising Sun.. hehe). My Food&Wine mag arrived last month, and I brought it along with me for reading. His easy teriyaki recipe was being featured, and how perfect that I was now happening upon some awesome fish!!  Salivation commence. It was here I tried harajiki for the first time.  We took the reco of our Japanese server (cutie pie, with Japanese lilt) and ordered as she suggested: the hamachi sashimi with ponzu, jalapeno and cilantro. Heavenly. perfect balance. awesome. 5 or 6 petite slices. $28. we'd do it all over again and get another one (yah, right... only if we had won the jackpot).  Next we moved onto a lightly battered tempura rock shrimp size bowl with a spicy cream sauce over a bed of rocket($24). Though nicely battered and delicate, we didn't care too much for it. Better to have stuck to more raw stuff. Which we didn't...  As our next dish was the famed hamachi kama ($18) Course I did enquire about the MP for the toro kama. OUT! Not in from the fish market (Tsukiji?). so no go (no worries: we both still got to experience our first O Toro in roll form)   It was SOO DARN GOOD we just kept at it. The flavor... was awesome. Nice deep grill flavor, fish around the collar was super duper tasty, and fresh, firm, yummy. And with fresh young ginger to rinse off the palate in the form of slender pink sticks (harajiki), it was too good.  Then the masterpiece: a complete 6-8 piece cut roll of O Toro ($10).. the mighty blue fin! Did we feel some guilt? yes, we did. But did it melt and just sit like silk on the tongue?!! WHY YES IT DID!  loved the dinner.  Experience and ambiance a sure hit. Solid, fresh,Japanese food cooked right.  PS A long Chef's Table exists. spotted it when headed to the washroom."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed a business dinner here with a group of 7 others a few days ago. Once we got to Caesar's Palace, it was a little hard to find, but I hadn't been before and wasn't sure which direction to head in from the lobby. Thankfully, it's located pretty well away from the main gaming areas, so there's less smokiness in the air here. The ambiance is exceptional, and attention to every minor detail has been paid, from the lighting, to the furniture, to the custom-made dinnerware that is breathtaking with such beautiful edible creations on it.  The food was 5 stars, hands down, and some of the best I've had anywhere (especially the sashimi and the Wagyu beef!), but unfortunately, the service left quite a bit to be desired, especially for the fine dining experience that Nobu should be. My co-worker and I arrived a bit late due to a delayed flight, so our business companions had ordered a couple of appetizers to munch on while they waited for us. There were a few bites of edamame and grilled shishito peppers with a sauce (ponzu?). The edamame was standard, but the peppers were pretty tasty. Once we were all together, we decided to go with Omakase for us all -- basically a grouping of chef's selections which highlight popular dishes, and give you a bit of a taste of many dishes. In total, we had about 8 courses.   My favorites were the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the Wagyu beef. The salmon sashimi was also very good. The yellowtail tasted so fresh and clean with the jalapeno. If I hadn't known how many other courses were coming after this (our first dish), I could have happily eaten this all night. A testament to the quality here: I ate wasabi. Happily. This is a miracle, Yelp friends. The salmon sashimi came with wasabi (real Japanese wasabi, mind you, not the green horseradish served in 90% of sushi restaurants), Chinese mustard, capers, and saffron. It was amazing! Mild horseradish-ness and a bit sweet from the real wasabi. Genius flavor pairing, like many of the dishes here. The Wagyu beef... I kind of have no words. This is real Wagyu beef here, they don't just call it that on the menu, and you can taste the difference. It's served raw on hot stones, which a server then sets aflame to cook the beef to your desired temperature (medium rare for our table). It's served with an Asian dipping sauce, which was tasty, but which I just skipped. The beed melts in your mouth. Literally. It melts. Heaven! And the stones are placed in rock salt on the plate, which gets smoked a bit from the cooking of the beef. Eat some of the salt and thank me later. Wow, what a dish!! Honorable mention goes to the blackened Alaskan cod with miso. It was very tasty as well. Having not been before, the tasting-type menu was certainly the way to go, but next trip in (and there WILL be a next trip), I know *exactly* what I'm ordering.  The only miss here was the service. It wasn't bad perse, but not up to par for a 5 star, fine dining experience. They seem to cover tables in \"teams\" here, with one lead server for the table, then many who drop off food, refill waters, etc. That's all great, when everyone is on the same page. Our dinner service stretched over about 3 hours. During that time, I was able to order only 2 glasses of wine (geez, I sound like a real lush here, huh? I would have liked about 8, but... Lol!). When our server who actually did any of the order-taking (drinks, etc.) would come by, she wouldn't check with everyone if they wanted another cocktail, even if their glass was low (loud restaurant + separate conversations = easy to miss her). Then, the round of drinks that had been ordered took 20-25 minutes to arrive. I assume the bar was backed up, but it seemed like a very long time. Meanwhile, waters weren't refilled and I was thirsty through much of the latter half of the meal. Also, several of our courses came out on top of each other, rather than one following another. There just seemed to be timing issues. Some will think I'm being super nit-picky here, but I don't think this feedback is out of line for the prices at Nobu, nor the expectations of a fine dining establishment. None of this would preclude me from coming back or from recommending Nobu. Overall, dinner was lovely, and if you're in the mood for some delicious Japanese inspired dishes, I think you should head on in!"}
{"text":"The food was good, not amazing, the service was good as well, the portions are ridiculously small for the price you are paying. I will only ever come back to this restaurant if I win a huge jackpot."}
{"text":"Top notch 5 stars all the way! This restaurant is sooooo good!! I have been here twice now, at this location and have had an amazing experience both times. Reservations are easy, the ambience is perfect and the food is out of this world.  Had a reservation for 8 people for a business dinner and the server we had ordered our meal for us! Family style, Asian fusion. Drinks are good, service is fast, and the employees are all very friendly and nice!!  I recommend making reservations because even the bar area was full.  We will come back! Get the waygu on rocks, you won't be disappointed.  This place is pricy, so bring your appetite and your wallet:)"}
{"text":"This is the fast food version of high priced average sushi. It does not deliver a fine dining experience. We sat at the sushi bar which is generally a fun and interesting experience. Not here. The head sushi chef berated our sushi chef the whole time he prepared our omakase dinner. Made us feel very uncomfortable. The wait staff - inattentive and do not communicate. If you want alcohol to accompany your dinner, order it all at once because they will be too busy doing other things than to ask you for a drink order. And then the bill....expensive but not unexpected. Do yourself a favor go to Morimoto - who always delivers!"}
{"text":"Exquisite, well-prepared, innovative fish and sushi dishes makes Nobu a pricy but fantastic treat. The sake menu also rates raves."}
{"text":"Its over priced, but what the heck treat your self, not your everyday sushi place, food and service was impeccable.  Sashimi, spicy tuna roll.  Yum! don't forget dessert with a whisky foam on top... enjoy Cheers."}
{"text":"1* for the food presentation and the restaurant decor. But seriously, I'm in a restaurant for food, not something I can't eat. 1/2* for the black cod(only it's fresh and well-cooked, the sauce kills the whole dish tho) 1/2* for the receptionists and a \"server\". The receptionists have great smile. I am not even sure whether he is the serve or not. A guy served us drinks, explained the menu, took away all our dirty dishes except our glasses and helped finding someone to give us check. I assumed he is our serve until .... he couldn't give us check? so who/where our serve is? Is he just a busboy who did all the servers' job?? I'm confused.   Food? Edible.  Monkfish - dry and looks like a piece of SPAM that has been sitting in the refrigerator after it was opened. Caviar - salty only, couldn't find any hint of sea. Eggs weren't firm at all. Cut roll - it just simply made me speechless. It wasn't even roll or cut professionally. Black cod miso - looks great! Fish was fresh and really well cooked, but the sauce killed the entire dish. It was so sweet that it took me a glass of water to finish it.  I knew where I was. I didn't expect the meal would be cheap, but I expected better quality. Come on! Do better than THIS!!  I was disappointed.  NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"We ate at Nobu after a concert at Cesar's Palace.  The sushi was amazing, both in taste and in presentation.   The atmosphere was fun and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"My sister and I planned out our trip to Vegas to include a dinner at Nobu. Maybe my tastes are horrible and I'm missing out on some great dishes, but I found our dining experience to be A-OK.  The service was great; the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. Of course, the prices are up there--not complaining about that part. But in all honesty, I really didn't taste a different in the quality of fish used in my sushi compared to the less than $10 rolls I eat here in AZ. Same goes with the rock shrimp tempura in creamy spicy sauce. At least I can say I've tried it."}
{"text":"This Nobu is sadly too small and cramped to be really enjoyable when compared to the others I've been to in LA and NY.  The food here resembles Nobu's dishes but it lacks the attention I'm used to seeing.  I think what's to blame is the large amount of business this location gets which takes away from the quality of the dishes.  It's disappointing b/c I think the Hard Rock Hotel itself is one of the better casino venues in LV (music, ppl, energy, etc.) and I like going there to hang out.  If you go, order the yellowtail carpaccio as that's always a pleaser as well as the miso black cod.  Enough sake and beer and you might not care about the rest of what I said.  haha.  Vegas!"}
{"text":"This Nobu is in The Hard Rock Hotel. This place was only okay. There was nothing spectacular about it. One time only."}
{"text":"This is, quite simply, the best food that I have ever eaten. I come here every two years for a packaging convention and I try to make Nobu a treat for my key employees. It is expensive, to be sure, but the food is so worth it.   This is not a \"slap on the feed bag joint\".  It is meant to be enjoyed over a couple of hours.  The plates are small but are meant to be shared with friends. You should order a few plates so that each bite is savored and you get to try multiple kinds of food. Hot and cold dishes with a Japanese/Peruvian flair.   Cold sake in a bamboo pitcher and shot glasses.   We had a few cold dishes...salmon, oysters, edamame, and a couple more.  Hot dishes of black miso cod, sea bass, scallops.....  Bento Box flowerless chocolate cake, green tea ice cream, a peach dish and an apple donut plate that was beyond belief.   Great ambiance, service and food. A delicious treat."}
{"text":"Decor is modern, dimly lit, open and a bit funky.  Maybe a bit too funky for me, IMO.  We ordered the multi-course omakase.  The seafood/sashimi selections were enjoyable.  The meat (quality/seasoning/doneness) was not to my satisfaction.  The chocolate dessert/cake at the end was overly sweet and strong thus overpowering the whole meal.  Also, Hot sake options were limited.  Service was fine.  Tab came out to $354 for 2 w/out tip and w/ sake.  Enjoyed the meal overall but not as memorable as I would have liked.  I think New York has spoiled me...."}
{"text":"Nobu, located in the Hard Rock Cafe, is perfectly at home in Vegas. The food selection and quality is amazing, the portions are small and the presentation is out of this world, and as expected the prices are sky high. Word to the wise, for all you weekend warriors that are planning a nice meal before a night of heavy drinking, sushi rarely cuts it as an adequate enough base...  However, for all you vacationers that are looking for a classy taste of Vegas, Nobu would be a very nice prequel to an unforgettable night."}
{"text":"Maybe expectation is too high on the name 'Nobu'. The black cod with miso was just okay - nothing special really. The sushi is good. Nothing really 'wow' me..  We had Tapan's dinner too... again.. it was so-so.  The bill came to 170 for the 2 of us.  Oh.. talked about the atmosphere. It's noisy and not well decorated at all =("}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!!  We could not get a table without a reservation but that worked out perfectly because we ended up at the sushi bar. You can order your sushi items right to the chefs, who prepare your sushi right in front of you. It is the perfect spot to sit if you are flying solo or with one other person.  The crispy rice with big eye tuna was so good that I wanted to go back just for that! Actually, I still daydream about it and would go back just for that!"}
{"text":"Hi! So I went here with my Girlfriend and her family, we ordered a bunch of sushi and pieces and all was super tasty! We ordered some oyster shots, which were ok, but I've definitely had better oyster. We ordered some drinks with our meals i had the Spicy Açaí martini, which was delicious and girlfriend had the lychee which she enjoyed as well. We ordered  lobster, but the amount of meat for a $70 price tag wasn't really worth it. The family had ordered \"real wasabi\" for the table, but with prior experiences it just didn't seem right. Our waiter was also not as attentive as we would like as i had to stop him everytime to order drinks and additional food. Overall the experience was pleasant and their food is definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"Nobu is the best japanese food I have ever had. My girlfriend and I ate in the teppenyaki room and split two things off of the teppenyaki menu. The waygu beef was the best thing in my opinion, the the chilean seabass a close second, the dessert and then the crab fried rice. Our chef was very talented and knew how to cook everything to perfection. Nothing I had was real heavy and over seasoned. I would recommend this place to anyone that has been t Po beni hanas and is looking for a higher end teppen room."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  Restaurant features beautiful and interesting decor, and has great service.  Our waiter was prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly.  A few dishes we sampled were excellent (I highly recommend the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and cilantro and the shaved ice dessert), and some things (eel roll) were average.  Pricing seems high for the experience.  Reservations are a must, even on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Hands down Nobu became my FAVORITE restaurant in the whole world!!! I'm not even kidding or exaggerating.   I don't really write reviews but I have to for this one. Ever since we finished eating here, I can't stop thinking about this place.   This restaurant is interesting and very high end. You can either order straight off the menu or go with the tasting menu where they chose and pick which dish you should try based on your preferences and budget. We spent $80 a person and got to try about 10 items (not sure if this was discounted or not because we had connections). These items are a la carte and are served in very small portions. I loved how they came out with the dish one by one and fully explained what the dish was or how it was cooked, etc. They even served us some dishes that weren't even in the menu.   Everything I tried was SO delicious. I was never disappointed and no dish was just \"ok\".  However I did have my favorites: yellowtail sashimi, black cod miso, and the truffle spinach salad. I have a favorite sashimi spot in San Diego and Nobu definitely tops it!   Customer service was excellent! However our server assumed we didn't want dessert because we said we were full. Ambiance, environment, and everything else was beyond excellent as well!   There has always been a Nobu in San Diego but never been there! I'm definitely going to try it and we'll see if it'll be the same. I'm going to take my fiancé here one day even though he doesn't like sashimi. Maybe Nobu can change his mind!  I will definitely, definitely come back!!! Thank you, Nobu for ending my Bachelorette Party weekend fantastic!"}
{"text":"Called to have champagne sent to a friends for her birthday (called from LA) spoke to Ashley who was sooooo incredibly helpful. She couldn't take my card over the phone (understandable) but she helped me and I still got to send my friend the champagne. Thank you Ashley!"}
{"text":"The bar for Nobu was set pretty high after trying the full omakase experience at Kabuto the night before.  I did my Yelp homework and scoured previous reviews, making note of the oft recommended items, and went in knowing exactly what my friend and I would order.  We ordered a gamut of different dishes: shishito peppers, edamame, wagyu beef, jalapeño yellowtail, rock shrimp tempura, lamp chop, otoro and salmon sashimi, miso black cod.   I thought I was assembling a Nobu all-star meal; what we ended up with was a mediocre and extremely overpriced meal.  For every dish that we  ordered, I could list a superior counterpart at Japonais or Sunda in Chicago for a fraction of the cost.  Also of note is the fact that our waiter initially remarked that sashimi orders came as two pieces, but when we got our bill, we noted that our four bite-sized slices of otoro came to a total of $76.  The wagyu was also incredibly overpriced for what we got; apparently each ounce is $30 or so and the minimum order is 2 ounces.    Maybe it was the sheer excellence of the previous night's meal, but we left feeling we had blown $350 on a very unsatisfactory experience.  Even at half the price, the value would be questionable."}
{"text":"Amber is amazing, presentation was great, but the food wasn't memorable. I think I could have had just as good of a meal for a fraction of the price. I really was expecting a wow for a \"chef-driven\" $175 per person meal. It was good, but not 5-star. I am interested in trying other Nobu locations to compare the quality and experience. Really, I could have made a better meal at home. Skip the toro sushi. 3 stars only because Amber was great, but I really think the meal was a let down for the price point. If it was priced in proportion to the taste, I would have given a higher rating.  Also, I didn't like the candle on the birthday dessert. I've seen way nicer, 100% beeswax candles at other restaurants. Even whole foods has nicer candles than the standard birthday candle they used in the dessert. For a $1000 meal, I expected more detail than an inexpensive, probably grocery store bought candle. Okay, my rant is done. I know it's only a candle, but I care about the details and I think Nobu can do better! (:"}
{"text":"LOVE NOBU - in every location... Fish is always fresh and good. Order off the menu, or make it up - they'll make it for you.   LIKES:  location - it's fun and a nice layout for this vegas location, fish fresh. staff GREAT! leche martini... yes please, I'll have another.  consistent. nice atmosphere. usually cool crowd.   DISLIKES:  Location - Offstrip:  if you're not staying at the Hard Rock (and I have, but not my favorite) it's a pain in the arse to get to. On site: After valet (long lines/wait) or self parking (long walk) it's not great. Also, it's very loud in there. I do like the ambience and decor, but volumes can get crazy.  SO HAPPY it's finally open at Caesars.   Overall, have been many times and will probably go many times more. Enjoy NOBU!"}
{"text":"Spent 90 minutes waiting for a table for 4 after being told it would be a 45 min wait. After the first 45 mins I checked on our status, and the 5 hostesses said we were next in line.  After 3 other  groups of 4+ were seated while we spent over $100 at the bar we finally left disgusted.  We then went to Mesa at Cesar's and got seated in 20 seconds....with actual customer service, and no silicon implants."}
{"text":"Wow! One of the best dinners ever! We had a wonderful meal at Nobu Beverly Hills, but the new place at Caesar's topped that by a mile. The restaurant is an interior designer's dream, which is topped only by the food. Our server was extremely helpful with menu suggestions. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Three stars by the cocktail, sushi and food  Cocktail- decent.  They had a pretty comprehensive cocktail , wine and sake list. I got a drink sort of similar to old fashion (had orange peel in it), it was very good.   Food- a safe bet but nothing impressive. Ordered a couple of nigiri. Fish was okay fresh, nothing very exciting. However we also ordered the hot served Miso Black Cod, it was fatty and very good   Staff was okay attentive.  He checked on us occasionally but forgot about us after the final dish was served."}
{"text":"The two of us tried Nobu on Sunday 3-01-15. The ambience was more casual dining than world class and most dishes were O.K. but not living up to the hype. The saki selections were great but you will pay dearly for them. All in all, a fair Cali/Japanese fusion dining experience. Nobu is becoming a bit dated and there are many great restaurants in L.V. to check out for better execution and price."}
{"text":"Sushi does not get better than Nobu!  I have visited Nobu in Malibu, both locations in Las Vegas and two locations in NYC and it is always consistent.  The Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno is my favorite so give it a try."}
{"text":"Had the omakasa style with friends and it came out to be about $250/person Doh!! (we did drink a lot of Saki from the bamboo decanter though...)  Great meal, super fun and tasty.  The highlight was the yellowtail with jalapeno on ponzu and the black miso on lettuce wrap.  Very great restaurant and amazing service."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week. I love the modern, sleek décor which reminds you of the flagship house in LA.   Okay, now the food. Let me know just preface this by saying, this place should not tote itself as a Japanese restaurant because most people should realize, this isn't. Sure, it's got sushi and stuff but no dice. If you can move past that, then you may enjoy this place.  Tuna tataki -This is good. Lightly seared but has a good taste to it Yellowtail Jalapeno -I'm not a fan of spicy but this does add a nice kick to the yellowtail. Black Cod Miso - This was surprisingly really good. The fish was cooked wonderfully; just the right amount of crisp but moist/juicy flavor to it.  Assorted sushi -This is the most standard dish that you can get at any sushi joint, for 1/8 the price. Miso Soup -I'm only commenting about this because I love how they call it \"sipping soup\" so at first you think you're getting something special...only to realize it's miso soup. Mochi was pretty delicious but I'm sure this was purchased at your local Trader Joes or Mitsuwa.  Anyhow, it's worth stopping by to check out the décor and if it's restaurant week. I would consider this place Asian fusion more than Japanese but eh, if you're craving Asian food and you're staying at the Hard Rock, this is gonna be your best (and only) bet."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. It's funny, you forget you are in a casino, or even Vegas for that matter. Expensive? Yes, but it's Nobu and it's Las Vegas.   We had food served family style and it was fantastic- ever single item was awesome, the Saké bottles were replaced as soon as they emptied, the waitstaff explained each item we ate, all in all, a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"You really need to be a sushi aficionado to appreciate this desert outpost of the much-hyped and highly-acclaimed Manhattan dining spot. The decor is a carbon copy of the NYC original, and there's no denying that the space is a stunning setting for dinner. My friends raved about their raw selections but, just as in Tribeca, I was unimpressed by my cooked entree, here a filet of whitefish marinated in garlic, chives, and ginger and seared in hot olive oil. Fortunately, Asian pear bread pudding, with ginger ice cream and brandy-infused caramel sauce, ended the evening on a high note. Very expensive, so keep your fingers crossed that the cards are kind later in the night."}
{"text":"Very good food with excellent service! We tried the Japanese snapper with dry miso, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, mixed seafood ceviche, and wagyu. My girlfriends favorite restaurant and I can't argue. Fantastic restaurant and experience."}
{"text":"We weren't planning to come to Nobu but the other restaurant still had a line at 9:30 pm, we decided to try.  Wow! So glad we did!!  Every dish looks like artwork.  The fish is so fresh and their black cod is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food!  Service is great!  You must try the black cod!  It was the best ever!!"}
{"text":"I've been back twice for various occasions (once in Vegas and once in Hawaii) and I can say I was wrong.  Sorry Nobu!  What I thought was a lame attempt to up-sell me the first time on the 'house specialties' was really a mistake and lack of trust on my part.  Get the house specialties like the Miso Cod and other dishes.  They are really amazing.  That and the sashimi is delicious with some less common choices.  I really would steer clear of the rolls...you can get those anywhere and to be honest, rolls are for the casual sushi eater.    Thanks for proving me wrong Nobu.  You made me eat cod (I mean crow) and I enjoyed every minute of it!"}
{"text":"Love Nobu! Only negative thing I can say here is that it's pricey..but I guess that's expected from Nobu and being in Vegas.  Nigiri is sold as 1 piece per order so you can look at it as if you ordered a 10 piece omakase for $100...it doesn't seem so bad. Also, if I remember correctly, fresh wasabi would be an extra $7. And if you drink a good amount...it will probably average you about $75-150 on top of your food bill. All in all...it's good and I recommend if you have the moola for it!  Oh yes...sushi bar all day everyday.  Also been to Nobu Waikiki and LA but this ones my fav."}
{"text":"I always say you know a place makes great sushi if the California Roll tastes really good by itself! Man Ohhhh Man! I sat at the sushi bar while the chefs made sushi endlessly, the precision and freshness of the rolls was amazing!! I also order the lobster roll, the soft shell crab roll, miso soup, and a mango passion drink! Definitely recommend this sushi place when you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night and we were seated at the sushi bar rather promptly. Had big expectations( when that happens I am usually disappointed) and ended up with a fun, yet not ethereal experience.  To start sake selections are good and their house pour is pretty tasty too. Wait service was  a bit relaxed in the sushi bar vicinity and I wish they were a bit more opinionated in terms of what to order. We passed on the omakase and moved from there. I don't remember everything we had to order which tells me this wasn't (a)a four star experience plus(b) I wasn't drunk. The only things that stood out to me where the miso cod, which was very good and the jalapeno hamachi dish which had good balance. I thought the menu overall would be a bit more innovative; in the end it seemed standard. Curious if his namesake restaurant Matsuhisha in LA pushes the envelope more? Restaurants such as Kiss in SF are a lot more fun for the sushi experience."}
{"text":"This was my first of many trips to Nobu restaurants. The hot and cold dishes are very good and innovative. I could pass on the sushi there as I find it to not be up to par for their prices. My favorite dish there is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. So simple yet so delicious. The miso cod is also delicious but everyone does that dish. Also try their Matsuhisa martini. It has ginger and cucumber infused vodka and is very refreshing.  I secretely made it my goal to eat at every Nobu worlwide. They need to stop opening new ones because I'm falling behind."}
{"text":"This is for sure my favorite place for sushi!! Geez I couldn't get enough. My mouth waters/salivates every time I think about the sushi. It was that bomb!!"}
{"text":"Nobu was my first experience at a Michelin rated restaurant (one star).  Omakase is the Japanese term for trusting the chef to come up with an enjoyable meal whether it's sushi or a classic European cuisine.  It's an exciting way to try the more creative and special dishes from the chef's knife.  It requires about two hours for dinner but well worth the time.  When you order, you'll be asked about allergies and this is a good time to mention the types of seafood that you don't like.  If your party is four or less, I recommend siting at the sushi bar.  We luckily sat in good view of the lead sushi chef and watched his amazing knife and prep skills.  He was very focused in his tasks but explained each round of courses personally.  There is a high level of construction/presentation involved with each dish so I was in awe of his techniques.  One really surprising thing was the appearance of black caviar, white truffle slices, kobe beef, and foie gras during the run of courses.  All those fantastic flavors in one sitting.  My friends and I opted for the $150 per person course.  There is a $200 option too.  Having lived in the Seattle area most of my life, I've been able to enjoy really good sushi restaurants.  However, I was astounded by how good the dishes are at Nobu.  Insanely good flavors and worth the price jump."}
{"text":"Came to Nobu during my stay at Hard Rock Hotel Las Vegas. Loved the contemporary and appetizing ambience. The music is loud for a Japanese restaurant which makes it hard to communicate. The menu needs to explain a bit more about main ingredients than just categorizing food as cold and hot. I had spicy edamame which was not complementary as in some Japanese places. The edamame had peanut soy sauce on it and it was yum. Then I had two orders of rainbow roll since the rolls are much smaller. Plus points for staff attentiveness but be ware of the mystery hand coming from behind and removing unfinished drinks. Prices are steep and portions are small but there's quality and freshness in every bite. Taste profile is subtle and authentic. Overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was skeptical at first - I don't like the idea of paying so much at a sushi place. But my boyfriend and I were in Vegas with friends so the good company was what brought us in.   For those who want a simple yes/no - YES, if you're looking for a high end place to try and you enjoy sushi than I think Nobu is one of those rare places that's worth it.   Our party of 8 didn't really know what we wanted, so our amazing waiter suggested that he could pick out an assortment of dishes based on our budget. At $100 a person, he said he could give us the Grand Prix. We had dish after dish that included sushi rolls, black cod,  creamy spicy crab, etc. Other people have mentioned the Black Cod - I would just add that my boyfriend made a comment while eating it that every human should taste this succulent piece of ocean nectar. that cod was that good.   One person in our group was vegetarian, and I have to say he was getting some awesome custom dishes! SO MANY OPTIONS FOR VEGETARIANS!  The food was great to say the least. The service was excellent, and the ambiance was lively yet relaxed. There was honestly nothing to complain about. Since you're reading this review, I assume you don't mind the price point as long as its worth it. I would tell you that yes, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and meal. I allowed them to prepare our meal after understanding any dietary restrictions with my party. Excellent selection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I agree with Ming-Jou in the fact that I was totally disappointed at this place. I should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being Japanese, I wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  We had reservations at 9 PM and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  It was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  Also, the crowd was much older than I anticipated.  The interior had a nice Asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.  For starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar with caviar, and tempura.  The menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  I wish the menu would have included more details.  We got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  We ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  The order came with 2 pieces each.  I liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  Also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  Most places give you barely enough sauce.  For dinner, we shared the sushi dinner which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (tuna roll).  The sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  Also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  Fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  That ruined my dinner.  We decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an Asian restaurant.  We tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  It came with soy caramel glaze and edamame ice cream.  The cake was yummier than I expected.    Overall, it was not as good as I expected but I'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Vegas and saw the Groupon deal for $95 for a five course tasting menu. We decided to go for it and it did not disappoint. The yellowtail sashimi was tasty (and I do not usually do raw food), the rock shrimp were delicious, and the miso cod is a must! We both really enjoyed our drinks (I had the Boxcar and my wife had the Mango Passionfruit martini). Service was also excellent and I appreciated the good runner explaining each dish. Overall, we were pleased and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Despite all the hype, we decided not to go for the omakase.  Turned out that the choice was not a bad one.  The three of us shared a bamboo sake order, many many appetizers, one main course, and a green tea ice cream.  I was surprised that it was under $300, and we were stuffed AND satisfied.  The lobster salad was great; you really do get an entire lobster!  The only thing we didn't love was the squid pasta salad, but it was still decent.  I was a little disappointed that for the prices we're paying, we still weren't getting real wasabi.  The service was great despite how busy it was.  I had reserved 9 days in advance but still could only get a 10pm reservation.  I was concerned that the service, selection, and quality wouldn't be up to par since the kitchen supposedly closed at 11pm, but this was not the case.  I *loved* the filet mignon with anticucho sauce, but the southerner in our group thought it tasted like weird chili.  I'd give this more like a 4.5 stars.  I really didn't like the Hard Rock Hotel, and once you step out of the restaurant, it's just way too loud, even for Vegas."}
{"text":"Super good , calming atmosphere and great food excellent service too ! Def worth it !!"}
{"text":"There were three of us. Atmosphere was great. Menu was confusing on what to share, what to do. Once we studied it, we decided that two of us would share traditional California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll sushi to begin. These were very fresh and very good.  It was probably one of the best but not the best we have had. Then, these two would share the Shrimp and Lobster with Spicy Lemon ($38). It was served in a small deep dish skillet with veggies. It was a good size dish actually. I was afraid we were taking a risk to share, but it worked out. It was more pepper than a spicy with the lemon flavor. It was good but not over the top amazing.   The other person ordered miso soup. She liked it fine. She ordered chicken and veggie skewer ($15 ea) and white rice. She liked it well.   Glass of wine ranged $15-$19 each. I had the $19 Russian river glass. It was great. Various cocktails looked fun.  Final bill was approx $60 each."}
{"text":"Prices are insane here, but it's Vegas. To put it into perspective a small nigiri piece is 9$. Chateau St Michele Riesling is 67$ per bottle, which is about 7$ at Safeway.  Everything admittedly was high quality, we went with a group so we tried a little bit of everything.  But don't expect to walk out of here without spending $200+/person. But it's also about the experience. It was my second time here, but this time I was sober :)  Overall, it was a great experience. Happy to come back maybe for a more intimate dinner. If you are looking for fine dining and light fare before the club, then Nobu is definitely a go to spot."}
{"text":"This is the third Nobu I've been to and they never disappoint. One would say for the price they should have customer service and good food down pat, and they absolutely do. It was a busy night in Vegas but I made a reservations and was sat right on time. My waitress was beyond nice she skated through the menu like a veteran and was very helpful. I'm not a big drinker so I asked about a lighter fruity drink and I got it, mango passion smelled like heaven and tasted just as refreshing. For my meal I had: lobster tacos, edamame and of course the miso cod =PERFECTION. Love this place and everything about it. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I admit, I liked the service, I liked the drinks, and the food was okay. We went early like at 6:00 no one was there. The first I noticed was a small table right next to us. I can imagine on a busy night someone seated right up to  our table where they would be practically sitting on our laps. Whoever said the waiters can be pushy was right. The waiter tried talking us into the 8 course meal. Again, I would feel bad for some young kid trying to impress a first date without asking\"how much would that cost?\" I did ( my ever heroic husband did not) the waiter said anywhere from $150-$200. I said forget it. We opted for the mini tacos, which were $10 each for apps!! That's $30 for an appetizer which usually cost $8 anywhere else. Then we got the sushi plate with like 4 different types of fish for$80! My god, it didn't even come with fresh ginger I had to ask a different waiter to bring it for me. We had 4 drinks (the lychee martinis delish) we had dessert and it was very good as well. Our total for the bill was $$360 including tip! I have no problem with a high priced bill but the decor, and ridiculously priced food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Nobu is up there with the best restaurants that I've ever eaten at! The service was excellent and our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful. He helped put together the perfect meal for our table that was catered to our liking. The black cod miso practically melts in your mouth and is very flavorful. I will definetly be back and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The great thing about Nobu is their consistency and their attention to detail. I've been to their New York, Bahamas and now Las Vegas locations and they all have exceeded my expectations. The quality of food and service is the same throughout each location which is amazing. This is another great restaurant that stands out amongst many great places to eat, especially in Las Vegas. Book in advance as it can get very busy. Most of the dishes are tapas style so be prepared to order a couple extra dishes than normal. Great for all types of occasions as we came for a bachelor party. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ventured out of our comfort zone, to the Nobu.  Someone told us about the Wagyu beef which started us on our journey.  Bottom line -- the layers of ingredients was simple but amazing.  We typically eat a light dinner, so we knew we wouldn't break the bank ... but you could if you wanted.  We started with the cucumber salad.  Simple and delicious.  The Wagyu beef tacos were a great way to taste this delicacy.  (A full steak, no matter how good, isn't within our preferred diet.)  Onto the chicken skewers.  This was our \"main\" course.  The chicken was surprisingly fatty, which is a turn-off for me, but the spicy sauce got me through it.  My favorite item were the tempura vegetables.  Perfect.  Lastly, the waiter suggested the Bento Box desert.  A flourless chocolate cake with white chocolate syrup oozing from it, fresh berries and green tea ice cream.  We don't usually have desert right after dinner, but this sounded so outrageous we had to try it.  Had we not had the dessert I would have felt the meal okay.  The dessert put the whole meal into a class of its own.    Our waiter moved the rating from 3 to 5.  He was one of the best waiters we've ever had.  Not only was Matthew patient with novices, but very knowledgeable and very smooth on suggesting different items (the Bento Box was one he suggested).  He recognized our simple palate and cheerfully went with it.  Thanks much!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Japanese meal I've had outside of Japan.  I ordered the full $125-ish tasting diner menu, plus some nice cold sake.  Various intricate, colorful, and tasty dishes appear one after another.  The Kobe beef and foie gras was the high-light.  I was so surprised that I was actually getting full.  But for $125, I shouldn't expect any less.  There was this nice couple sitting in the next table.  They shared their black cod on lettuce cups dish with me because they ordered too much food.  That dish was excellent.  If only that can happen more often.    As everyone says, it is strange to be located in Hard Rock Casino.  It is not on the strip, so not as convenient to get to.  The decor seemed a little off - feels more Hawaiian or tropical.  The service was friendly, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"Sorry Nobu - you had the bad luck to be my 4th sushi dinner in 5 nights, and fell short of the great stuff.  The place is stylin', for sure - but strange in that it has a chill vibe, but in HR fashion, they yell something in japanese everytime they walk through the place to seat new customers.  I have no idea what it is - what it means -  but it's a Disneyesque feel, and it's jarring when it's at your back (as it was for us at the sushi bar).  The sushi was obviously fresh - and it's cool that you order from the sushi chef and watch them make it (remember to tip them!!) - but the taste of the rolls we ordered was fairly average.  Luckily the bill wasn't steep, but it would be on the lines of an 'easy, nothing special' kind of place back home.  Don't think that's how they view themselves.  Tao wins out, so hit HR for the vibe outside of this place."}
{"text":"The tall african-american hostest is GORGEOUS and so freaking sweet! Our waiter was super nice too. The shishito peppers are unforgettable. I cant wait to come back just for those!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Nobu that hasn't already been written? Asian Fusion done right.  So many other places will attempt the same ideas, but they can not execute it like the Nobu franchise can.  Miso marinated Black Cod? Delicious.  Uni Tempura? YOU CAN FRY THAT? Toro tartar with Cavier? Ok... Stolen from Keller... Changed the salmon to Toro, but decedent none-the-less. Also, the best Mochi Ice cream I've had... Anywhere..."}
{"text":"Second time here!  So far I've always gotten the black cod and the mushroom soup.  I also got the miso eggplant and in the past I got a taco, some sashimi, oyster shooters, etc. The good thing about Nobu is his food is top quality anywhere you eat it.  This restaurant is spacious, but not loud.  It's very modern with dim lighting.  Attentive service, and good food, I really need to try his Malibu location since I've also been to his West Hollywood spot too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely worth it for the experience. The ambience is intimate with dim lighting. The first thing the server asked us was if it was our first time as this is probably on a lot of people bucket list of restaurants to try.  Lastly, if you are hoping to eat before drinking to soak up the alcohol later in the night, this is not the place to waste your money on, unless that's your style. They recommend you to try 3 of the cold appetizers and 3-4 of the hot appetizers before you order sushi, because you do not want to fill-up on rice in the beginning.  The server explained the menu to us and gave us suggestions on recommendations for first-timers. The miso cod was one that we tried, and I would highly recommend all first-timers to try as well. We started off with the yellowtail carpaccio with ponzu sauce, and it was delicious, coming from someone who doesn't eat raw fish. For something fried, we got the wagyu beef and lobster tacos, which were enveloped in fried wontons, not taco shells lol. They were a one-bite type of app. I tried to share it with my boyfriend, but it always ended up on the table, oops. Can't take me anywhere fancy~   Next we got the trio of oyster which had a different sauce to each of them. Forgot what it was called, but it was pretty good, we followed that with shrimp tempura which kind of looked like honey walnut prawns, but didn't taste like it. It was bombbb diggity.   To finish off, we ordered 2 rolls, a spider roll and another roll I forgot, both were really good. They use daikon to wrap the rolls over the seaweed, which is different, but I enjoyed it.  Bill came out to around $100 per person."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that NOBU is one of my favorite restaurants I've been to a couple from Vegas to Atlantis.  Food was great as always atmosphere was awesome.  I had some sushi rolls and some teriyaki beef my buddy had the Chileign Sea Bass.  The reason for the three stars is because my buddy during dinner went to drink his water and as he went to put the glass to his mouth it shattered in his had not only did a full glass spill on him but he cut the inside of his hand.  Now I'm not about getting a free meal but when your bill is over $180.00 and something like that happens you would think they would at least offer you a free dessert especially cause my buddy cut his had and it was bleeding.  Just didn't seem right I've been to restaurants in the past and have waited longer than normal for a meal and the restaurants have offered a free desert or even taken the meal off the bill.  I just wasn't happy with the situation and kind of killed the excitement for me to go back like I always have when I come to Vegas and that frequently.  Great food but a little disappointed."}
{"text":"3 words Miso Marinated Cod!  OK so we decided to go to Las Vegas on my friends birthday during his quater life crisis (there is such a thing).  This was the first restaurant we chose to dine at.  First off it's at the Hard Rock Hotel.  I don't like this place one bit.  It's over rated and think Nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus Nirvana.    OK we go in and get drinks first at the bar.  Salty Dogs are great and they make it damn good at Nobu.   We get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  Our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  We pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.  First course- Spicy Tuna and I think Dragon Roll- it was good, but come on I can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!  Second course- Tempura Rock Shrimp with Spicy Aioli and Tempura Vegetables with Soy Glaze.  Very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex.   Third Course- Yellowtail with Jalepeno and Citrus Ponzu- AMAZING!  So damn good I would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  Pepper Seared Rare Ahi with Chili Vinegar Sauce- Again give me a plate of this and I would die a happy man.  Fourth Course- Miso Marinated Cod- This is by far the best seafood dish I have ever tried.  The fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  Simply heaven.   Fifth Course- Trio of Sorbets  I must say the food was great minus the first course!  Spicy Tuna and Dragon Roll at a high end Japanese Restaurant?  I don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people I think that Spicy Tuna is not needed!"}
{"text":"This was a must try and we knew the price we were paying and it was all worth it!  We were here as tourists but we wanted to treat ourselves on our first night. We ended up allowing the waitress and chef choose the dishes to serve us and nothing disappointed   Here are a few dishes we had (drooling as i type this): Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi black pepper Blu fin tuna with crusty artichoke wrapped around tofu seared fish with chive and ginger black cod jalapeno fried shrimp truffles filet and the red bean shaved ice with that green macha dessert.   the drinks were on point too. Service was even more on point. Everything was done very professionally and i wish i can live in that restaurant.   overall a MUST experience for your taste buds."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!   i felt like a celebrity eating here. We were treated really well and the waitress explained everything to us. We ended up having the chef come up with any dish for us within the price range we gave ($150 each) and the dishes were beyond out of this world.  We were running late to our show but i could have stayed there all night. The atmosphere was just perfect for couples and very romantic setting. The dessert was this green matchu shaved ice with red bean inside. Crazy good!  I would eat here every week if i could."}
{"text":"\"Kids\" treated us all the dinner at Nobus.....I can't even list everything we had...but I think they ordered a really nice and pricey Omakase...at first I was a little worried that we were gonna leave hungry, but the dishes kept coming and coming and coming....my favorites were the scallops and black cod wrapped in a shredded potato and fried, the wagyu beef and lobsters and the deep fried shrimp head as well as the soft shell crab...the mirugai sushi was also really good.... It's the kind of place where you're really glad you got to go, but I know I couldn't afford to be a regular there.....just to glad to have had the experience. Service was good and the restaurant decor was again, impressive!"}
{"text":"Last night, my family and I came here for a family style, Peruvian-Japanese inspired meal. Upon entering the dining area, the staff yelled something in Japanese. The restaurant interior was modern looking, the walls were wavy and the pillow like lights resembled jellyfish. Everyone was given stones to rest their chopsticks on. They only have drink menus with mixed cocktails, Japanese wines, Japanese beers, and Japanese tea. Your job is to tell your waiter/server what you like and what your limitations/restrictions are (e.g., allergies, preferences, budget limit, etc). The waiter/server will talk to the chef to customize dishes.  For sweet and fruity cocktails, I'd recommend the Mango and Passion Cocktail. I could barely taste or feel the alcohol in this drink.   The dishes we received,  1. Six pieces of yellowtail sashimi topped with a jalapeño in ponzu sauce laid out like flower petals and the bud made out of a pile of parsley topped with a carrot shaving.  2. Six pieces of snapper sashimi topped with dry miso rub, garlic chips, and chives, in lemon juice-extra virgin olive oil, also laid out like flower petals and the bud is a grape tomato.   3. A bowl of Mixed Seafood Cerviche. It consisted of pieces of octopus, calamari, salmon, mackerel, shrimp, crab, and lobster mixed with cucumber, red onion, yellow and red tomato, and jalapeños, which gave the dish a hint of spice. It was garnished with two long chives.   4. A Miso Alaskan Black Cod was cooked to perfection - crispy, tender, and sweet miso marinate. It was served on a large piece of banana leaf with a drop of ponzu sauce at four corners of the dish. It was garnished with a two tone pickled ginger root (only the white part was edible), which served as a good palette cleanser.   5. Slices of tender, medium to medium rare Beef Tenderloin marinated in balsamic teriyaki vinaigrette and topped with micro greens and wasabi salsa. The wasabi salsa gave flavor and heat to the dish. There was a dash of seven spices for those who love it extra spicy.  6. A Tower of Chilean Sea Bass Tempura Cubes, garnished with diced onions and jalapeño shavings in sweet Japanese rice vinegar. What an interesting combination. The tempura was crispy and the dish had a hint of jalapeño.  7. Five pan-seared and marinated in line-cilantro Langoustines over a bed of lettuce, zucchini, roasted white pearl onion, baby bok choy, caramelized onions, and mushrooms on a sizzling dish and garnished with Jalapeños and Japanese Chile Threads. It was my least favorite dish as it was drenched in oil and too spicy for me.  We finished our meal with something cool.   7. A bowl of shaved ice and a few mini scoops of vanilla ice cream, drizzled with condensed milk, raspberry purée, and passion fruit purée, and topped with mochi, shredded coconut, fresh berries and grapes. Although it was the most popular dessert here, I felt it wasn't that special but it helped us cool off from the last dish."}
{"text":"I went to Nobu with a group of 8 people, and I was really disappointed. I really don't understand why Nobu has had so many 5 star reviews. Yes the food was good, not amazing. The only thing that was stellar was the Black cod lettuce wraps. If I was just giving a rating on the food, I would have given it a 3 or 4 star, but the service was horrible. We came in with drinks already in hand (thanks to Hard Rocks round bar), were served some bottled water, and many of us made a preemptive drink order. We were so happy we did, cause it was literally 30 minutes before we were served another drink. I would try to flag our server down, but I couldn't get him. During the night, the server was not engaging at all and rarely stopped to see how we were doing. To top it all off, since we were a party of 8, our tip was already added on to the bill. So, the despite being a horrible server, he still got a very hefty tip. On any other night I would have asked to speak to the manager, but I just let it go. I was in Vegas, with friends and didn't want to put a damper on the night."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great staff.  I would like to give four and a half stars if possible.  The quality if the fish was 5 star as well as their dessert shave ice.  The miso cod was amazing as well.  Fantastic rare sake, beer, and wine selection too!"}
{"text":"I took my best friend here for a late birthday celebration, last Tuesday.  With both of us being \"foodies\" (in the sense that we actually work in the food industry and have high standards in regards to service as well as the food itself...not those self-proclaimed foodies that have too much money to spend and no sense of what good food really is...), we had high expectations for a place that was undoubtedly going to cost $200, at least, for our experience. I say experience because that's what dining out at a place like this should be, not just \"a meal someplace\".   Anyway, our reservation was at 5:00 on the dot.  We arrived just a few minutes before and was told by the hostess (who was my least favorite part of this whole experience and initially put a bitter taste in my mouth, questioning if I'd made the right choice to dine here) we'd have to \"wait 10 minutes\", even though we were the first to arrive.  She wasn't my idea of friendly and in my opinion, a weak asset to the restaurant.   Never mind her, though. We were seated just after 5pm (and after several couples who arrived after us) and shortly after Troy, our server, greeted us and took our drink orders.  While our drinks were being made, we were overwhelmed by all of our food options.  Troy returned, asking if we'd like to start with some cold dishes or if we'd like for the chef to send out some of his favorite dishes (perhaps this isn't an option all guests have, but it was one we had, so we went with it - and no, it wasn't the chef's tasting menu that is available on the menu). Our drinks were brought to us by the bartender himself who was quite friendly, chatting with us about my friend's unique choice of beverage (Jameson and cranberry). Troy brought out our first course (of NINE!), which was a yellow tail sashimi dish.  Oh. My. God. AMAZING!! In fact, EVERY dish we had was absolutely incredible. Our dishes started cold and ended hot, just as it should be.  The time in between each course was perfect and just long enough for us to chat and digest and mentally prepare for our next foodgasmic dish. 8 amazing savory dishes later, we were presented with a special dessert plate, which was equally as delicious as the rest of the meal.   If you enjoy truly great food, a beautiful atmosphere, and friendly service (excluding the hostess), I highly recommend Nobu."}
{"text":"I adore Nobu! I go there every time I'm in Vegas!  It is pricey, I spent $300 for dinner for two this past trip.....but it is sooooo worth it.   My picks:  -Hamachi w/ jalapenos -\"live\" octopus -Tiradito \"live\" scallop -Black cod with miso -kobe beef (try tataki style) -Bento box (chocolate cake with green tea ice cream)  Though honestly, I've never had anything bad there. And try the Nobu brand beer (made exclusively for them), I'm not a big beer drinker but it pairs really, really well with the food.   The waiters are always excellent. They know the entire menu, so feel free to ask them for recommendations.   If you have to pick one nice, expensive dinner in Vegas.....definitely pick Nobu."}
{"text":"Been to a few different nobu locations and this has been my least favorite. The service was mediocre and the food was not as flavorful as we usually find it. The waiter  seemed to try to push the chefs tasting menu on us and also rush our meal even though the place was not that busy. They also switched on us half way through our meal so that could have been the reason for the lacking service"}
{"text":"One of my goals in life is to go to all the Nobus in the world! Such a special experience every time and this did not disappoint. We were celebrating my brother's and my mother's birthdays, which they happen to share. I mentioned this in the comment section when making my reservation through OpenTable but forgot I had done so as a few weeks had passed. We all ordered Omakase and enjoyed course after course of incredible dishes. When it came to dessert, they presented two very special, personalized plates with candles for the birthday people. In addition, our server also brought a special after dinner drink, on the house.    My only quibble is with service. Our main server was wonderful, as were the other \"runners\" who brought out each course. The bottom line is that it drives me nuts when plates are removed before everyone at the table is finished. In fact some are removed the instant the last bite is taken, almost in midair.  I suspect some servers are instructed to do this, so it's not their fault, but it still drives me crazy!  That being said, it didn't detract from our overall experience and many of the dishes are just unforgettable."}
{"text":"This was our first Nobu dining experience. We kept thinking Nobu Nobu Nobu Nobu. If Drake and Future include it in their song, it must be good right? Before we made the reservation, I consulted not only with the hip hop moguls but also my stepdad who is a fan. Nobu didn't disappoint. We were two couples celebrating a baby on the way and a wedding on the way. We had Columbia as our waiter and he was beyond phenomenal. Seriously- I would request him again. We did the dining experience where we gave our likes and dislikes and price point per person. I can't keep saying how incredible it was. We were all amazed and in heaven with this food. Since I'm pregnant, i didn't enjoy the drinks like my table mates did but my mocktail was refreshing. Anyway, do yourself a favor and make a reservation here to treat yourself and don't feel bad about the bill. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Just absolute perfection!  One of the best meals of my life, I can't pick which dish is my favorite.  The service was beyond fantastic.  I love how they recommend how to eat each item!  Some of my highlights were the jalapeño hamachi, the crispy rice with tuna, the miso glazed cod, and the creamy spicy rock shrimp.  The sushi was so fresh and delicious!  The cocktails and cold sake were divine as well.  Not a cheap meal, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Go see Marcus! Best server and restaurant in Vegas! Had an amazing meal.. The Toro and Sea Urchin were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place for a group party, but even with a reservation, we had to wait, and the bar area is waaaaay to small for large parties, or even 3 couples. The bathroom was so far away, I almost ditched my group on the way back to the restaurant (YES, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE RESTAURANT TO TAKE A WHIZZ). For those of us distracted by the shiny - Vegas is not the place to put your restroom hiking distance from the bar - your patrons just might not come back.  The service was average, and the food was just slightly better. Can't say I'd go back, but then again, it prob. won't be there when I get back, or it will be filled with Midwestern tourists."}
{"text":"I would rate Nobu somewhere between 3 & 4 stars.   Pros:  Nice ambience, good service, fresh sushi. Cons:  Hard to get a table the same day, somewhat over-priced. The server recommended the jalapeno yellowtail sashimi, which was great.  The other sushi rolls we ordered were average.  We also ordered toro, but when it came out, it didn't look or taste like toro. Strange... All in all, I was staying at the Hard Rock and had really wanted to try the famous Nobu - While there was nothing WRONG with it, I just think that for the money there are better sushi places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I went to Nobu Vegas with the expectation that it would be like a second Nobu - New york. I was rather disappointed. Though the food was cheap ($77 for 2 entres and a dessert). The portions were humongous, which was sort of a turn off... Waiters were not attentive but weren't ignoring us intentionally either. The food was good, very good, but not memorable and the presentation was just blah. Overall, nothing special or memorable about this experience.  I might still come back here again if I'm in town because the food was good. But I wouldn't recommend bringing your date here to impress her. Other restaurants on the strip might be a better idea. I would compare this restaurant to Chili's or TGIF quality..."}
{"text":"We just had Omakase here and the food was super crazy good the taste and the presentation was excellent very nice"}
{"text":"First time here.  So awkward to have a Nobu in this hotel though, I don't think it fits in.  Staff was attentive and fish was really fresh.  We were actually quite surprised when we went through the front and was led to our table: the place looks like a cafeteria with tables very close to each other.  Luckily there were no one next to us so we didn't ask to change a location.  And the disposable chopsticks make it feel more like a cafeteria...it's just like eating with plastic forks and spoons...  We had the tasting menu and there were 5 courses.  They served us some soba fritters to start with, and it was quite disappointing.  It was way too greasy and strong tasting food to start the dinner, and I needed to wash it down with lots of water.  It should be paired with Chinese tea...lol  The first 2 courses were a Shiromi Usuzukuri with ponzu and assorted nigiri sushi, the white fish was really fresh and the tuna was really good too.    The next 2 courses were hot dishes, and for the first hot dish we got to pick between shrimp tempura and pan seared scallops.  We picked the scallops because we were never a big fan of deep fried food.  But the server made a mistake and served us the tempura, we told them that was not what we ordered, and they brought the scallops without taking away the shrimp, so we had both dishes to try out! (YAY!) The shrimp was very similar to the walnut shrimp you can find in Chinese restaurants, only without the walnuts..I find this dish quite another bummer.  But then the pan seared scallops with edamame hummus came to the rescue and it was so so GOOD!! The scallops were fresh and huge, and the hummus really complements the scallops!  Then the second hot dish was the Black cod miso: very very delicious, love it!!!  The last course was dessert and we got the SUNTORY CAPPUCCINO which had many layers  including Coffee Cream, Whisky Foam & Milk Ice Cream. It tasted like tiramisu in some ways, but a lot more tasty. Very light and not too sweet.  All in all, even though there are some flaws here and there, the dining experience was superb and full of surprises."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here with my husband for our 10y, we got the omakase at the bar. It was fantastic. The fish was fresh, everything was so flavourful and  our sushi chef was nice and kept everything coming at a good pace and described everything well as it was being prepared or presented. We also ordered some sort of lobster tempura that was out of this world. Their specialty cocktail list was nice too. I got a lychee flavored one that was delish!   Also, on a previous work dinner there, I was pregnant and I was able to really enjoy so many delicious items that were fully cooked. So if for any reason you're considering this place but cant eat raw fish, you can still have a really enjoyable evening without feeling left out!"}
{"text":"It's an amazing! Asian fusion at its finest.  Let the chef create it for you.   Perfect for a nice date or fun with the girls."}
{"text":"Amazing black cod. Amazing. So, so good. The new style tataki is my second favorite. If you're considering yellowtail, do the sashimi even of you're tired of ponzu and jalapeño. The yellowtail roll isn't as good. I mean, it's great, but I think the sashimi plate is a better deal with more flavor. Like Blair B. said, get the unique plates here.  As a side note, Nobu participated in the Taste of the Nation, Las Vegas, which is a fundraiser to end childhood hunger in Nevada. Nobu cares about our community. I really appreciate that!  Service at Nobu is really out of this world.  Nobu's bento box is my favorite dessert of all time, so much so that I replicate it at home with success--flour-less chocolate cake with green tea ice cream and hot fudge. Lord have mercy I am in heaven!  If you have the money, spend it on Nobu."}
{"text":"Great Nobu Experience. Good food but pricy. Service was good, but It wasn't excellent. I would definitely go back again for the right occasion. Not an everyday restaurant that you would go to. Need to win some $$$ first. Good Luck to everyone staying at Caesars!!!"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant that I would recommend at the Hard Rock Hotel. I was working at the HRH for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there. Nobu is the only one that I would optionally go to again.  This is the best sushi I've had. Everything was flavorful and top quality. I can't remember all the dishes I had, but below are the ones I can remember (score out of 5):  -Bug Eye Tuna Lotus Chips 4 -Shishito Peppers 2 (I got a really spicy one!) -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno 4 -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce 4 (Butter Ponzu Sauce 3) -Rice Cubes with Tuna Spread 3 -Sushi Roll with 4 types of fish 5 -BLACK COD MISO 10 YOU MUST GET THIS, IT IS SOOOOO GOOD! -Horchata Flan 3  I would go just for the black cod miso!  The food is great, but the service was lacking. When we sat down we were a group of 5 and a 6th person joined us. When the waiter brought the tuna lotus chips out he said there are only 5 since that's how many you were when you sat down. He easily could have said I'll bring you another, but I had to specifically ask him. For the price, service should be better, maybe because it's still in the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Amazing. Let me list what I would suggest:  -Sake 35 is super smooth -Sake 40 -Chicken & Steak skeweres are amazing -sakito peppers instead of edamame  - Black Cod Miso -Spicy Tuna hand roll  However, if I was to name one thing off the menu to eat and only eat that it would be the Black Mod Soaked in Miso for a few days. It is amazing. My boyfriend thought I was crazy for ordering this dish, and ended up eating half.   After our initial entree orders, we ordered more sashimi toro because the fish literally melted in your mouth it was so delicious.    Ask for Marcus he is the shit!!!! He took care of us even though he wasn't our waiter. We ended up ordering another fresh-to order plate of shasimi with him."}
{"text":"Legiiiiit!!!! I've been to just one other Nobu, the one in Honolulu, which is exquisite. Although the hostess at the front was kind of a sourpuss, our server was amazing and all the food so scrumpdilliumptious. Sashimi, shrimp, grilled fish - all very fresh and deRish. Would definitely come here again and pork out. Fatty-approved."}
{"text":"Nobu is an experience.  They provide you unparalleled level of service and present an incredibly high quality of options.  From sushi beginner to pro this brand is a must try.  Yellowtail, Shishito peppers, Rock Shrimp & Wagyu beef are all incredible. Sake options are almost endless. Go explore!"}
{"text":"I'm japaneeeeesey fosheeeeezy!  I ordered edamame, miso soup, the black miso cod, aji (nigiri), hamachi & scallion hand roll, and an order of kampachi (nigiri).   Everything was a reminder to me of Japanese Excellence! The service was great & all the dishes were a delight to indulge in on my glutunous time in Vegas!   The alcohol was a bit pricey but I needed both Sapporo's and Sake to fully live Japanese... which I am 100%"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit to this location.  Having dined at various Nobu locations, we have always wanted to order Omakase --but had reservations on it since I've been pretty particular about my sushi dishes.  I typically order the same things but definitely wanted something different.  This time around was different as I was open to eating anything and everything prepared.  It may be because I was unsure of what to order.  Nobu offers three different levels of Omakase.  We decided on the 2nd selection.      We sat at the sushi bar, which allowed us to watch our sushi chef prepare each finite detail to our sushi dishes.  It was nice that each dish was already prepared with its specific accoutrement --so there was no need to soy and wasabi it up.  I definitely ate dishes that I wouldn't have picked out in a menu --Omakase is the way to go for sure.  With it being pricey, I would say for special occasions and as long as you are open to eating everything.  By the end of our meal, my dress fit a little more tighter.  I tend to feel that when eating sushi I do not overeat, which is good thing, but I was definitely full and satisfied with the meal and service."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the place! The experience was mouthwatering. Especially, sea bass dry miso. Definitely worth every penny and believe me...its not cheap. I do regret not ordering more of the specialty dishes versus the sushi. But I'm a big fan of sushi so you cant go wrong. Drinks were well presented and delicious. Service was up to par. Decoration and ambiance was beautiful. Cant wait to try out the new location in Houston!"}
{"text":"Our waiter claims you cant do separate checks and we had 6 business people eating together. Such a nightmare. We needed to write off our meal on our taxes and can't because of this. Such a joke. This should have been disclosed when we sat down."}
{"text":"Medeocre. The waiter insisted we did the Omakasa (sp?)  instead of ordering what we wanted and it was underwhelming. Fish quality was good - but not great, dry/thin slices. Also inspiring was the \"value\" as for $100+ per head we didn't get near the food or ingredients we would have received from ordering a la carte.   I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend it - there are much better sushi/Japanese restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice and very helpful in suggesting different things. We had the lobster taco and few other things that were great. The portions are pretty small but very tasty!!!! :)"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a conference so went with some clients to Nobu. Restaurant is in Caesars Palace, follow the signs for the Nobu Hotel. Had the Omakase which was course after course of just fantastic food. Service was impeccable and food was amazing. Overall a great experience, just as one would expect at Nobu"}
{"text":"What else can I say except EPIC!!!! I'm a pretty serious sushi snob and I can't believe this was first experience at a Nobu. I always expected it to be an overrated and overpriced sushi restaurant.  I will say I was way wrong. The experience was amazing. The best service I have ever had in a sushi restaurant. And let's talk sushi.......... EPIC EPIC EPIC!!!!!  Not cheap but worth every penny.  You guys ROCK!!"}
{"text":"Nobu was an amazing experience for me. My bf took me here for an anniversary dinner and it was exceptional!   We were greeted by the host and she took us to our table. I do know it is Vegas so there were other large parties there which were ready to party so it was a bit loud. It was a little hard to talk without having a lot of background noise.   But let's talk about the food. I tried the wagyu tacos which were ant sized but it was nice to try them. The scallops were very tasty but it was such a strong flavor that the more you keep eating it, you grow a little tired and need something else to balance it out. We also tried the yellowtail sashimi which was also good. My favorite dish hands down were the uni scoops in a spoon. Our waiter recommended it and it was to die for! The flavor and art the chef put into that little scoop was worth every single bite."}
{"text":"Finally - the meal to kill all meals.  This is when I regret NOT taking a picture of every dish and writing down the name and ingredients. I forgot I even had a food blog until  of the way into my dinner. That is definitely a compliment!  Nobu is famous for a reason. If you are going to eat here, prepare to drop some money. $100 pp minimum, $150 pp is more like it and that's without drinks.  Interestingly, even though you feel like you ate a ton of food, it really isn't that much. If you have a big eater in your group, have him/her eat something first. This is a place to savor each bite, not to eat like pigs at a trough. (That's what the Planet Hollywood buffet is for.)  And when they ask if you want edamame, they are $7 a bowl, not free.   The restaurant is gorgeous. We had reservations at 7:00 on a Saturday, and even though we arrived at 6:20, we were seated immediately.  Dress was anywhere from casual to dressy, even jeans (which leads me to the old adage - just because you can, doesn't mean you should.)  I had ordered a blueberry mojito ($15) but only took a small sip when I realized it was WAY too strong. The waiter took it off the bill without me having to complain about it. That's ok - the food was so good, I was fine with water.  Instead of ordering off the menu, we went Omakase style - the chef makes the selections. Actually, it seems like your waiter makes the selections but that's close enough. The waiter asked us our likes and dislikes so he could tailor our food to our tastes. We said we didn't eat mussels, clams, oysters and that sort of thing. Other than that, it was going to be a free for all. (In listening to the other servers describe dishes to the other customers, I suspect there is a standard Omakase menu.)  The menu was chosen to give a different sensation with each dish. We started with the cold dishes, had two hot dishes and then continued with more cold dishes (which don't seem to fill you up for some reason.)  The first selection was yellowtail sashimi with miso with a shaved bit of jalapeno and a cilantro leaf for each bite. I don't like spicy foods so I was hesitant about the jalepeno. But I'm glad I tried it. YOWZA - the jalapeno was small enough to give you that kick without making you scream for water. And the cilantro cooled down the fire. The yellowtail was so fresh, you wouldn't even know it was fish. I've never ordered sashimi before and I'm hooked. Wow, wow, wow.  The next choice was whitefish sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips. I wish I could have poured the sauce in a cup and drank it, it was THAT flavorful.   We had salmon sashimi with caviar and dill, blue fin toro sashimi, Japanese red snapper with dried miso and seared tuna with ponzu. Every dish kept getting better and better and had its own unique flavor and special quality to it.   Our hot dishes consisted of beef tenderloin with a butternut squash base and topped with cooked purple onions. The beef was so tender, it fell apart with the chopsticks.  Our second hot dish was 2 pieces of cod and 2 pieces of scallops baked in phyllo - both in butter lettuce cups.  I preferred the scallops over the cod which surprised me because I've never eaten scallops before and I generally like cod.   My least favorite dish was the hearts of palm salad. It was a nice change to the other fish items but probably not worth $20.  The servers were so attentive - both in bringing the food and the clean up afterward.  My recommendations to enjoying Nobo (1) realize that you're going to spend a ton of money so quit whining about the price or eat at HomeTown Buffet (2) don't order off the menu - the point is to try something new that you would never otherwise see at your favorite sushi place (ie - don't order friggin' tempura or California rolls at Nobu and then complain that it tastes better at your local strip mall) (3) come here with 4 or less people. People tend to be greedier when they are in big groups so you may pay $150 and eat 4 bites of sashimi which would be a total rip off. (4) you're not there to stuff yourself (see #1), you're there to appreciate the art of food.  So sit back, let someone else do the ordering and savor every bite."}
{"text":"First thing is I was really expecting a top rated restaurant what I got was a empty stomach and a 400$ bill. Lousy service and very disappointed. Not only do they sell you on there 125$ chefs choice it take them up to 2 1/2 hrs to serve it all. Guess there hope is for you to purchase there expensive drinks. My wife and I have eaten at a ton of different restaurants and this was one of the worst. Sorry guys just can't get it over the 1 star!"}
{"text":"Food was good but overpriced. Table was too short and uncomfortable. If you're over 5'10 avoid this place. After we paid we continued to talk and after about 10 minutes they cleared all our drinks and water away. I understand that their tables are in demand but this was a very rude way to get us to leave."}
{"text":"This is one of my must stops when I visit Vegas. It never disappoints. Everything on the menu is delightful! I'm obsessed with anything raw and they deliver nothing but the best."}
{"text":"Nobu Vegas is the best of the bunch that I've been to - Malibu, NYC, Miami. Never disappoints! Make sure to try the house specialties - Yellowtail with Jalapeno; Crispy Rice with tuns, tenderloin of beef toban yake; eggplant with miso in lettuce cups. YUM! Also usually good for a celeb sighting or two!   I make it a point to hit Nobu every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh Nobu, how fun it is to say your name :)  Soooo ... I'm not a frequenter of the Hard Rock (because either you stay there or you have to cab it from the strip - and I ain't made o' money people), but last time I was there I had to stop in and try the (in)famous Nobu!  Now ... to be fair I had no idea this place was famous (the rock I live under doesn't get the food channel), and I thought it was mostly a sushi place (which it isn't - according to the waiter), but I had a great time anyway.   As soon as you sit down the waiter comes and tells you about the place and what they do. Apparently they cater the menu to the group on the table etc. I wouldn't know that because we actually never got a menu. The waiter told us about the famous Omakase (where the chef's send you what they want for ridiculous amounts of money) and we were sold!!   We got three different tears of Omakase - $110, $125 & $150 - so that we could try a little bit of everything. It's an 8 course array of hot and cold dishes. If you get this, prepare to wait ... it took us a solid 2 hours to get through the 8 courses - which gets you full and drunk if you're drinking like we were (the sake comes in cute tea pots and the plum wine is amazing).   I will say that the best bang for your buck is definitely the $125 dollar option. It's worth the $15 upgrade. The $150 option is when you can tell they're trying a little too hard to be different (food doesn't have to be unpronounceable, it just has to be good).   Most of the dishes were actually pretty good - but there were a few that were underwhelming (the hot dishes in particular were not great - and those were the ones the waiter said they were known for). I did enjoy the pallet cleansers a lot though.   The great thing about a place like Nobu is that no matter how fancy it is, it's still in the hard rock, and you'll still find a group of bachelors blowing up penis balloons and sending them flying around the restaurant (one even hit  me on the back of the head - war wounds are sexy!)."}
{"text":"I can't say I am really a fan. This was a restaurant I wanted to try because of the namesake in NYC. I haven't been to the one in NYC and because I live in SF, I probably will not be going anytime soon. Anyhow, back to Vegas. We have many fine sushi restaurants in the Bay Area and I don't think Nobu is anything special. I mean the food was good and innovative, but at what price? You are talking about twice as expensive as Gary Danko? Try once for the hype and satisfy your curiosity. Go to the west coast for great sushi at a much better price."}
{"text":"The absolute best experience ever. Had the Groupon - filled us up completely and blew our minds with every dish. The service is outstanding and we were in and out in an hour. Had edamame to start - a good primer. Then yellowtail sashimi with jalapeños and a special soy sauce - oh my goodness my favorite dish. I don't even like sashimi. Then a huge California roll and tons of nigri - best I've ever had. Then this crazy shrimp tempura with the greatest sauce ever over a bed of lettuce with my best - tasting dressing that complimented it so well - like fireworks in your mouth. Very filling. Then this fish. Alaskan cod. I thought there was a party in my mouth - cooked absolutely perfectly it melted in your mouth and left you feeling completely satisfied. Dessert was insane. You just have to experience it."}
{"text":"ugh amazing. the sashimi is the best I've ever had, I dream about the stone cooked steak and literally am salivating right now thinking about the lobster tacos. The service was amazing and the food was somehow even better. I am OBSESSED with Nobu!!"}
{"text":"Do not go here unless you are planning on spending a lot of money. We had dinner for two and spent $400.00. It's was worth every penny!!  I can't begin to tell you what we had, but everything was amazing. The menu is huge and very hard to decide what to order. We picked the price range of $175.00 per individual and let our server pick our menu. Plan on not gambling and save your money and go here. This is truly a dining experience of epic portions."}
{"text":"Way overpriced even for Vegas. We weren't that hungry and just wanted a roll or two and some sushi. For 14 dollars per 2 piece of sushi it was super small and average quality.   Waiter kept pushing to eat more. It was super annoying. How many time should one person say no thank you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food, but a little pretentious, over priced (even for Vegas), and waiters have been trained to up-sell you."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat at the bar.   Food:  yellow tail jalapeno: melts in your mouth, highly recommend $24, 6 pieces rock and roll shrimp tempura: a bowl of shrimp tempura drown in delicious sauce and it had mixed greens at the bottom. this was also 20 something.   peach Belini was refreshing and delicious. 5 gulps and it was in my liver for processing.   Everything was cooked to perfection if I had more money I would eat here for a meal. our bill came out to be $92 with two drinks too."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place, my husband and I finally got to try it for ourselves. We had the greatest experience! Nobu bring fine dining to a completely different level. The customer service was amazing, I've never had a more attentive waiter. He asked us for our timing and if we had any plans after dinner to make sure that we would not be late to our next venture. He explained the menu to us in detail and since it was our first time, we let him decide the menu for us. He asked if we had any allergies and if there was anything we didn't eat. I've never been a fan of raw fish just because I don't like the idea of eating raw meat. He was very convincing and assured me that I would change my mind about raw fish after trying their yellow tail. HE WAS RIGHT! After trying the yellow tail (our first dish) I thought it was delicious! The dishes came one at a time to make sure we tasted the full flavors of that dish. The dishes were worth every penny. We couldn't decide on a particular dessert so our waiter brought us a variety plate of what we wanted. We go to Las Vegas at least once a year, after our experience at Nobu, we will be making this a MUST annual visit :)"}
{"text":"Nobu is an equally great experience with regards to taste and atmosphere. Had dinner with my uncle and cousin and we decided to go for the chef signature selection courses. It was our first time here and we figure this would be the best way to experience the different flavors and dishes Nobu offers. Our sever was very nice and professional and he, along with the food runners, were thorough in their explanations of the dishes. They started us with some raw fish dishes, moved towards lightly cooked dishes with more complex flavors, and finished with the wagyu. Overall we were served 11 courses, all great tasting, all beautifully presented. Loved the restaurant, however be prepared to spend quite a bit. I think a decent meal for one would probably be between 200-250. More if you opt for their signature choices. Worth it though."}
{"text":"Every detail was covered, from a rich broth of miso soup with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. He was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. The interior is contemporary Japanese and beautiful. And the food was fantastic.  We had a tasty hamachi sashimi with jalapeno slices. I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish. Tuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing. Blue fin toro with caviar. I think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. Mincing it up seems wrong.  And the highlight was the lobster spiced dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. Holy Gawd!! This was fantastic!! It was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. They split the lobster lengthwise in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. It makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.  Interestingly, I've been to other Nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. I don't know why, but that seems odd."}
{"text":"Came here in early June, and had to take an extra cab since it's off the strip.  I think we had a roll that was just comprised of an assortment of raw fish which was unremarkable, but we also asked the waiter the crowd favorites, and we got the Miso-cod, and hamachi sashimi with jalepeno, which were heaven sent. I'd never had cooked fish as melt-y, velvet-y as that black cod, and the marinade they used was Amazing. Portions are miniscule, but that's because this is 1%-ers place, and they never eat much.  The atmospohere is as swanky as you would expect in Vegas, with the dim lighting and the bamboo stick-pillars which are strategically placed throughout the establishment to remind you you've crossed the \"eastern exotic\" threshold. I know I sleep on a bed of rice and panda fur to keep myself authentically Asian. I think we had sake or water that was poured out of bamboo shoot-looking vases as well.   The waiter looked a little annoyed we spent less than $200 here. It felt like jewelry store, commission driven pressure. Still, hella good food."}
{"text":"holy crap, the food here was so good!  We had all different kinds of dishes - sashimi, hot dishes, various lettuce wraps, etc., and everything was SO TASTY.  They even made us some dishes that weren't on the menu that my friend requested from the Matsuhisa menu.    The service was also great - they explained all the dishes as they came out and kept our water glasses full.    The one thing I was NOT a fan of was the flavored fruity sakes.  They tasted like fruit roll ups or jam, and they were just not very pleasant.  I did however enjoy my peruvian caipirinha, and would recommend that.  Also enjoyed a couple sips of my friend's johnny blue, but when is that NOT the case?    Had mochi ice cream for dessert, and they had some awesome flavors you can't find elsewhere like red velvet.    It's weird that my first Nobu experience was in Vegas, given that I live in LA, but now I'm excited to check out the Nobus near home!  :)"}
{"text":"It's Vegas, it's glitsy, it's glam.  But the food here is suprisingly straightforward.    I was kind of expecting a lot of fancy appetizers, a bunch of cleverly named rolls, and fusiony kinda stuff, but the menu was actually pretty straight.  Omakase is the way to go.  The quality of the sashimi here is top notch - very very fresh.  I heard that they cryogenically flash freeze the toro for freshness and it shows.  The cuts of Toro here was excellent - marbelized and tender.  The jalapeno hamachi appetizer thing was really really good as well.  I'll have to start remembering these dish names, seriously.  But just look for jalapeno on the menu, you can't miss it.  My big gripe witht his joint is that the prices are through the roof, and the portions are miniscule.  I suggest you hit another restaurant late night after dinner here (which we did).  Actually this might be a good thing, because you can get in another meal!"}
{"text":"This place LOOKS really awesome...andddd okay, I'm done with the PROs. In all fairness, I am NOT a sushi/fish person. I was with a party of 8 and I simply got outvoted (even though it was my birthday weekend, funny how that worked now that I think about it...)  Anyways, here were my MAJOR issues (not enough time or space to list them all):  -I found our waitress to be very aloof, verging on unfriendly.  -RIDICULOUSLY overpriced!...and I've been to Atlantis, so overpriced food does not scare me, but I expect it to at least be decent. -I had to limit my dining choices to non-fish entrees, which was not easy, but I did manage to find some things.... --Tempura asparagus...they brought it out to me and there were TWO PIECES ON MY PLATE!!!!! OMFG, TWO, 2, DOS? Seriously?! I was done right there, but no, I had to keep going. My friend that was with me owns a fine dining catering company and worked at The Ritz, so I know when even HE says something is a rip off, it's BAD. In fact, our table was going on and on about it SO much that I think they must have overheard us, because they didn't charge me for it. --Next, I ordered 2 Wagyu tacos. Now, she told me they were small. Okay, cool, I'm thinking like street taco size-ish. I am NOT being hyperbolic when I say they were the SIZE OF MY PINKY FINGER!!!!!!! I held it up against my finger to take a photo of it!!! And the best part...THIRTEEN DOLLARS EACH!!!!!!!! And you had to order a minimum of 2. --By this time, you would like I'd just stop eating and cut my losses, but no. I ordered a chicken kabob and a steak kabob. The chicken was overcooked and dry and the steak was so UNDER cooked that I think I heard it moo...blood was oozing. Gross.  --Their beers were TINY and $10 each. Ouch.    Okay, now wanting to be fair, here are my husband's thoughts...a sushi pro:  -Overpriced, but expected. -4 of the other people in our group gave a \"price point\" of $75 a person and said, serve whatever you want to us...he liked that. -Their \"signature\" dish of black cod with miso was very delicious & succulent, everything else was \"fine\" -Annoying that it was being split between 4 people and they continuously gave portions of 5 or 6. Either give 4 or 8! How hard is that?!...it was like they wanted to start a brawl.  -Wouldn't need to return, but don't regret going.   That about sums it up."}
{"text":"I recommend the sushi dinner. It was a great sampling of the sushi menu and the salmon was so buttery and fresh. I needed at least 4 more of those to get full, but there's no way my credit card could handle that. We had tickets to Celine Dion at the Colosseum and our server got our party of 6 in and out within 1 hour - amazing for a Friday night. Their computers even went down and we were able to have 2 drinks a piece, our waters were never empty and our entrees came out so quickly. Kudos to the staff for accommodating us. Thank you for an amazing first dinner in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Appetizers consist of, in most cases, five Little bites of whatever you order. Entrees are also small. Of course we tried the black cod miso. It was tasty, but nothing spectacular.  Our favorite item was the yellowtail jalapeno sashimi. Dining there was a very good experience, it was a \"tasting event.\"  We were very satisfied, left happy. Our bill for two, not including the tip was about $234 including two cocktails."}
{"text":"It was just a meh... We had the omakase, as we would at any other good sushi restaurants if they offer such option. $175 per person, 7 courses. I understand the art of delicacy in Japan is the kind of small portion. No offense I know good things come in small package. But these dishes were really really small......... And certain fish was just okay. The one thing that filled me up was the desert lol. They ruined the Uni and abalone by cooking it. What a disappointment. My favorite was the shrimp, it was processed / fried to a degree so that you can eat the whole shrimp with shell on.   I'll probably go back for the regular menu. But waiter told us that customers spend $125 on average at dinner. Hmmm well we'll see."}
{"text":"I don't know why we came here, perhaps it's the prestige of Chef Nobu's name. The food is seriously over-priced and there are so many great Japanese places off the strip that charge a small fraction of the price here and the food tastes the same if not better.   We got a Groupon deal: 5 course dinner for 2 people for $99. The portions are tiny, to be expected at a fine dining establishment, so we ordered 4 other dishes to supplement our meal. The 5 courses had 3 shared entrees which included the miso cod and the jalapeno hamachi; both are signature dishes by Chef Nobu. The food was nicely presented, tasted good, high quality ingredients, but really lacking any wow factor. I really do prefer Raku on Spring Mountain better. The service was very attentive and nice throughout the meal and our waiter was super cute which is a huge plus.   It was a nice meal, but even with the Groupon deal, it costed $200+ for the 2 of us and I was still not full. Major $$$$!"}
{"text":"FIRST AND FOREMOST BRING YOUR BLACK CARD!!! THIS PLACE IS PRICEY!!! I'M SERIOUS!!! DO NOT GO HERE LOOKING FOR CHEAP EATS!!! THERE IS A HOLE IN MY POCKET!!!   Ok, sorry for yelling. Now that that's out of the way... where do I begin with how awesome this place is???  First of all, the smell wafting through the air is enough to bring my mouth to water just thinking about it... Mmh... My wife and I went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the waiter really took care of us. We gave him carte blanche to serve us what he loved the most, and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. It did take a little bit of time for the dishes to come out, but we have delicious beer and saki to tide us over during each intermission.   Without question there is a tuna dish with jalepeno peppers that is BEYOND amazing... food of the g-d's. Kings and Queens would fight over this dish, just wow.   Ambiance, service, food and drink... if I could afford it, I would go here every day. But that's just it... it's kind of a place where you're only going to go once a year or less, because it really will put a dent in your bank account.   Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for Vegas.... I'm a sushi snob from LA/OC and this is probably a 3 star place there. Service was great, they sat me at a wobbly table in a corner by were everyone walks by, not really a good location for a table."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of girls and was really excited since I have wanted to go for a long time. The atmosphere is really great -- very zen-like. I don't eat sushi, but there were plenty of other options for me. I had the shrimp and Maine lobster with spicy lemon sauce. Overall great flavor although some pieces of the lobster were just a tad rubbery (which is why I dinged my review one star). I must have been really hungry that night, because I wasn't full after my main course. So it was tempura to the rescue -- shrimp, asparagus and sweet potato. That helped tremendously. I do think the service could have been a bit quicker for our drinks, which seemed to not arrive as they should have. The waitstaff otherwise was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This was really hyped up by my friends.   We had a drink in the bar on the bartenders were great  Surprisingly I felt that the atmosphere was just OK. Nothing very special odd mix of Japanese and some other style.   Food quality was good but not over-the-top. Of course I was expecting over the top  When we got our bill I felt it was over-the-top quite expensive for average fare."}
{"text":"Nobu Vegas, much like other Vegas Strip satellite restaurants = meh.  I can't give it 2 stars, because the food is too good for that. Not great, like a real Nobu, but good. When you factor in the cost (2 of us spent over $400), it comes nowhere near what its name would imply.   DECOR The decor is trying too hard, pulling in all directions. There are individually cool elements, like the river rock wall, or the exploded hashi ceiling. But there are at least 5 different themes like this all smashed together. Complete contrast to japanese design principles of linear minimalism. Must be the Vegas factor.   FOOD Started out pretty good, with a Toro-Caviar dish. Great mix of flavors and a unique sauce. Everything after that, including the sushi, was was just good. A beef tenderloin dish came out steaming hot, but with little flavor and essentially raw asparagus and enoki still clumped together on top, like it just got unwrapped from the plastic pkg. I've eaten better in strip mall Japanese (many of these are surprisingly good!). I'm not a Japanese food expert/snob, but I've lived in Japan, worked in Japanese restaurants and cook a lot of Japanese dishes at home. Then again, so do millions of Japanese people, and they're not all snobs or experts. But I know how to compare Japanese-inspired food experiences. I also realize there is a fusion element going on at Nobu, but that is done much better at places like Sea Saw in Scottsdale. Overall = disappointing.   OTHER FACTORS I'M NOT COUNTING IN MY EVALUATION (but worth noting for lols)  THOR Our waiter was absolutely unintelligible. We nicknamed him Thor. He looked like a Norwegian model from a 1976 Playgirl. Very nice guy, but we just pretended to understand what he said. Every time he walked away, we both said: \"You catch any of that??? Me neither!\" No complaints on the service, just glad the menu was available to point at.  BLIND DATE VEGAS The table next to us was fookin hilarious. It was the most awkward blind date I've ever witnessed, not on TV. We kept looking around for cameras, because we swore this was a setup for a show. It is a crime that this was not captured on video. This middle-aged blowhard had this girl,  who had to be 20 years younger (NTTAWWT), held captive while he ranted about his boat and his travels and his companies (plural!) that he coudln't talk about because of his work with the NSA. He'd have to kill the whole restaurant if he told us. And he WAS talking to the whole restaurant. He insisted on feeding her from his chopsticks, for every bite. He kept asking for her review of the date, during the date. EPIC DEFEAT. He let us all know that he had to ask the universe for the right person to meet. The girl seemed to politely disagree with the universe. Bless her heart. She was a trooper.  Also, his chopstick skills were so good because he was \"raised in Japan\", but when she wanted him to speak Japanese, somehow that got by his experience of being raised there.   so...  Nobu, meh.  Thor, enjoy Valhalla.  Blind Date, see ya on the uncensored DVD."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff. Super Fresh fish! They customize your order to your liking. Had the combination sashimi. Be sure to try the yellowtail belly.  A little pricey but I knew that going in and was prepared."}
{"text":"I went to Nobu for the first time in Ceasers Palace. I have to say, it was an incredible experience from the Hostesses all the way to the bar tenders! The food was incredible! The cocktails were amazing! Even the Managers were super friendly! I'm definitely coming back and would most definitely recommend anyone to try it atleast once! Love it there."}
{"text":"Classic \"form over function\" failure.  It's all about the appearance of being a good restaurant, but he food just does not merit the price.  It's not bad, it's just not that good."}
{"text":"Extensive menu with fusion of S American and Japanese (Reminded me of Roy's).  Very friendly staff.  Yellowtail with jalapeños tasty but a bit of a soy bite; sweet tuna on chips but not spicy as advertised; eggplant with miso was spot on - toasty, juicy, salty, silky, warm. Miso with crunchy green onions and silky tofu was great. Spicy soup with tons of fresh seafood and mushrooms.  Veggie tempura was good, but nothing too special outside of the wild mushroom - yumm!  Finished up with assorted mochi - mint chocolate, mango, cherry blossom, pistachio.  No wifi. Bathrooms outside restaurant - shared with Hard Rock Hotel, really?"}
{"text":"For many years, I've heard good things about Nobu at Caesars. Many co-workers and acquaintance strongly suggested that I should go an try Nobu. I finally had the chance and I was left disappointed. The quality of food and presentation was excellent. The toro hamachi roles, sashimis, and taco was good. However, there are other sushi places just as good or even better. I agree with other reviewers that this is certainly a pricey place. I was hoping to have an exceptional meal for the price but it did not happen."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's bachelor party. I have to say, the service was spectacular and top notch for fine dining. I don't even know what we ordered. We went with the chef's suggestion, where they have a variety of dishes they put together for a total meal. I have to say, it was the best sushi I've ever had in my life. But it also, comes with a very high price tag. I would love to come often, but it was very expensive. Maybe I might come here next time I'm in Vegas. (Pics will be uploaded soon)"}
{"text":"A delightful dining experience, with courses presented beautifully. The service knew it was my birthday and they were very gracious about it. We opted for the omakase, which gave us a great surprise for each course. However, in retrospect, I think it would have been better to just pick and choose to our hearts content because there were several courses that were complete misses for us.   The standouts were: the sashimi and sushi courses (2nd and 4th courses). The rice was really what made the 2nd course so special for me. A little nit picky, but wished the tamagoyaki wasn't so grey in color. The sweet shrimp and fried shrimp head was probably my favorite thing.   The not-so-good: the dessert course. I love dessert and to me, the birthday celebration revels in a wonderful dessert. Sadly, the dessert here, fried ice cream with spicy chocolate, candied fruit, and caramel sugar work tuille failed to deliver. The candied fruit was not properly candied and soggy and extremely chewy/hard to eat. The caramel sugar art was not very delicate and could take a tooth out. The fried ice cream itself was fine, but nothing really special. The presentation was special, but the taste failed to deliver.   SX was still hungry after this dinner and we ended up going to In and Out afterwards :(   Definitely worth a visit to any of the Nobu restaurants for a special celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"My taxi driver said to give them 2 stars. But I'll give 3 for the taste of their food. I've always wanted to try Nobu and was very excited to see that there was one here in Vegas. I've been to many sushi restaurants, high-end ones such as Nobu included. Everywhere from Manhattan to San Francisco. So this is definitely not a biased, uninformed review. High prices are fine, if you have the amazing food and great customer service to back it up. My fiancé and I came to celebrate our birthdays here, which are only one day apart. My fiancé told the hostess it was our birthdays and she said OK great. Yet at the end of our $250 meal, nothing came. It's really disappointing because I see on their yelp photos that they do honor some birthdays. I guess their staff wasn't in the mood. Furthermore, we ordered three sushi rolls. Two of them came out and I was wondering what kind of sushi restaurant serves their rolls separately. We ate the 2 rolls they brought and then I realized they don't serve them separately, they just forgot and we had to remind them. Cmon Nobu, this is not splitting the atom. And you're supposedly a fancy high-priced sushi joint, so please live up to that. You don't.   UPDATE: you know I just can't give them 3 stars because for such a pricy place, there's really no excuse for eh customer service. I came here specifically for our birthdays and I'm really disappointed that they did nothing. Even Olive Garden can send out a cheap sundae."}
{"text":"I'm a local. Brought a friend in for a late lunch, amazing food and service. We liked it so much that when we met up later with friends we took them back there. I called, bc it was later, and asked the person who answered if they'd still serve us. She said they would at the bar. We arrived with 5 people and the bartender was rude and said he wouldn't serve us. I asked for a manager, April Lyman, explained that I called prior to arrival, and she told us she wouldn't serve us. She was very rude. I'll never be back. Unreal for such a great restaurant. The service is the reason none of us will be back again."}
{"text":"Incredible and I didn't have to go to NYC for the beautiful beautiful presentation for omakase! Far easier to get reservations when you also stay at the Hard Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"what is it about vegas and the walls made out of rocks?  they have one here and it boggles the mind.  the overall decor seems to be rock-themed.  very good, very honest and simply delicious food.  the flavors are wonderful and they win the award for best use of miso...  not exactly filling, but a divine experience as far as taste and ambiance are concerned."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Nobu signature experience.  Service is excellent. The signature dishes were outstanding. Both to taste and presentation. Wow!"}
{"text":"OH EM GEE!!  This was some pretty damn good sushi!!!  This is one of the best places to get sushi I have ever been to outside of Japan. The price for the quality and freshness of the fish combined with the originality and flavors of the dishes is more than worth it!  I ordered:  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy, Butter Ponzu or Jalapeno Black Cod Miso Salmon Sashimi and Blue Fin Toro Sashimi  Each and every dish we were served was not only beautiful but taste even better than it looked!  The Yellowtail with Jalapeno had just enough kick for you to feel the heat in your mouth without losing the flavor of the Yellowtail. This is an extremely important trick when working with such high quality fish!  The rock shrimp was fantastic! It was rich and creamy and comes on top of a salad that has a nice citrus flavor to cut through the richness of the cream sauce. extremely well balanced and exactly what I wanted from the dish.  The Black Cod Miso was also very good. This is one of my favorite dishes to order when I see it on a menu. Not many places have it and this one definitely ranks right up there in my top 1-2 spot. Only Irori in Marina Del Rey may have a slightly better dish. The two are extremely close though.  The Salmon sashimi was melt in your mouth good. Salmon is by far my favorite when there is no blue fin on the menu and the sashimi here is super fresh!  Last we finished with the Bluefin Toro!!!! At $20 a piece it's not cheap. However, if you love sushi you have to try it at least once. There is just no comparison to other types of fish. When you order it just bite the bullet and get at least two pieces per person. If you only order one you're just going to be asking your server for one more piece anyways then probably another one after that.  To top off the great food the service was fantastic. I don't remember our servers names but they were super friendly and helpful. The décor is beautiful and this is by far one of the nicest sushi places I have ever been to!  Be warned though. It's not cheap at all. Even if I hadn't ordered the Bluefin I would have easily spent over $200 between two people with a couple of drinks. As it was I spent closer to $400. I've been to well over 100 different sushi places in my life and If you really love good sushi you have to try this place at least once. It's well worth the money."}
{"text":"Well this place was recommended to us buy our friends we expected an exceptional experience but we did not get that I am not a snub but when I am paying 500$ for two for diner for a testing menu and live craving a cheeseburger there is a problem. Also the brake between courses went up to 25 minuets with multiple courses arriving simultaneously 30 seconds apart. Food tested good but fail to see any Japanese Peruvian Fusion at all and I have been to Tanta in Chicago wick is amazing so bottom line is if you going to spend that kind of money go to bar Massa at the aria much bater."}
{"text":"Be forewarned, yes the food here is pricey, so most of you wonder if the food really worth it's price? I believe it is, and this was only my 2nd time here.  I made a reservation for 1 at 8pm on Monday, and was seated as soon as I showed up at 7:50pm.   The first time was right before New Years in December and that time I had the Chef's Daily Creations Omakase for $225/pp with 2 other people. However, this time I had the $150 Nobu Signature Omakase (was $125 in 2017).  This 7 course plus soup and dessert tasting menu is well worth it and was much different from the Chef's Daily Creations Omakase.  Before choosing the Omakase, I decided to go with the Kikori Old Fashioned cocktail which Yesenia, my server procured for me quite quickly. I ended up drinking a total of 2 over the course of my meal. The Kikori Old Fashioned is highly recommended if you like whiskey and Old Fashioneds. The serving size is worth it for its price.  The service throughout the whole tasting menu was superb, so if you are willing to do an Omakase please set aside at least 1 hour and 45 minutes to fully enjoy the meal and all the courses.  From my calculations all the food I received cost $230 with portion size taken into account.  My top 3 favorite dishes throughout this tasting were the aged Bluefin tuna, toro tartare, and black cod miso.   The aged Bluefin tuna was unlike any other tuna nigiri I've had, it melted in my mouth and had so much flavor that I've never experienced before. As a sushi lover, this is a must each time you go to Nobu.  The toro tartare, was something I initially did not expect to like, however after the first scoop, I was amazed at the blend of the sauce, toro, and caviar.  The signature black cod miso, was just as expected. Cooked perfectly, portioned well, and had extra sauce if you want more flavor. It's a must at Nobu if you want one of his signature dishes.  The other dishes were also superb, but those 3 stood out in my opinion.  To finish out the tasting menu the chocolate molten lava cake paired with fruit and green tea ice cream was icing on the cake to end the meal.  Overall the SIgnature Omakase tasting menu has less food than the Chef's Daily Creations, but is well worth it if you have never been to Nobu and would like to taste what he's known for.  Now having done both, I might order a la carte, or do another tasting just for the value."}
{"text":"I want to be clear that this is review is specific to the Nobu restraurant in Ceasar's Palace Nobu hotel, not the one in The Hard Rock. I assume the establishments are the same in their methods, however, since this is a chain.   Verdict: Awful.   I would give it one star, except I am feeling generous today, unlike the portions at Nobu. And to be fair, I expected such. What I didn't expect was a sub-par sushi experience for the price and the hype.   The hubs and I are VERY experienced Sushi diners and we tend to eat high end. We know our hamachi from our bonito. We don't generally do the Western dip everything in (fake)  wasabi and soy. We prefer sashimi, but explore the interesting world of inari maki, temaki, Japanese warm plates, etc...  BUT THIS PLACE!  Our hamachi in sushi form wasn't fresh and the rice to fish ratio was off. Our seared (not mentioned on the menu that it is served seared) bonito was a little too seared and drowning in some type of nikiri that over-powered the fish completely.   This is to say nothing of what is supposedly Nobu's signature dish: Black Miso Cod. It is my understanding that he invented it, but I guess it has been perfected elsewhere because I have had MUCH better. Sushi Den in Denver comes to mind... The fish was just over-cooked to that point when cod changes from a delicate mouth-pleasing texture to a rubber tire. The miso sauce, however, was passable.   And the service was awesome. Um. NO. I'm only kidding. One of our servers (we had more than one) asked us how we felt about the cod and we were honest that we'd had better, but it wasn't terrible. Guess what happened next? We were treated to a very snarky come-back. WOW.   Bottom line, we wound up leaving without ordering much more, spent too much (which we ARE ALWAYS prepared to do for a meal which is worth it) AND wound up having a great dinner at Gordon Ramsey's BURGR.   You want good Sushi on The Strip? I recommend Shibuya in MGM Grand over this place without a doubt!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when I go to Vegas. First of all if you are going on a tight budget, don't bother. Albacore was great, Black Cod Miso unreal, Yellowtail with Jalapeno aw some, Kobe beef like butter. This past trip we had whole New Zeland Snapper. It was unbelievable. We went with 2 other couples and our bill was $1200. May sound steep, but that included some of the best Sake and Sapporo Reserve beer too. I would pay it again in a heartbeat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our server was one of the best I have ever had. Ask for him if you can; Jamie. He had us covered the entire night and some of his recommendations were the bomb."}
{"text":"Went there in the summer to celebrate boyfriend's birthday. Of course, we had the Omakase...   Key Points: - The exotic fish sashimi and tartar were very very good, because they were usually combined with caviar. Fresh too... duh...  - Black cod. Signature!!! Yummy!!! Although to be honest, I think it could be a little too sweet for certain individuals.  - Yellow tail w/ jalapeños. Interesting testing. Def something new for me! - Kobe beef... whatever.  - Sushi. REALLY??? ok... don't ever go to Nobu for the sushi. It's not even real japanese rice or freshly made wasabi!!!!  - BEST BEST BEST warm chocolate lava green tea ice cream cake EVER!!!!  Btw, the bill was around $350. No complains whatsoever.  Conclusion: Must go before you die. Or before your taste buds die."}
{"text":"In a word PERFECT.  In a few words, unbelievably amazing.  You cannot put more care, soul, and most importantly flavor into the detail of every slice, every sauce, and every delicately placed item on each plate. Private label Sake is of the best i've had. Service was spot on.  Must haves: Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno Black Cod Miso lettuce cups Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce Broiled Yellowtail Collar"}
{"text":"When I criticized Morimoto Napa for being like a \"Vegas restaurant,\" I now realize I was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  Chef Nobu has a signature, Peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.  Uni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money ladder.  The tataki plates of Kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  They're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.  King crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.  The same goes for the lobster salad; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the lobster was lost.  But the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.  The black cod with miso is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  Miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  That's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  And I *love* miso.  Maki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  That's a first for me.  I'm not sure I get the logic behind it.  The special house rolls e.g. with jalapeño are tasty enough, but generally the additional flavors don't complement the fish very well.  The sushi itself is perfectly made.  The knife work and rice preparation and rolling are impeccable.  Nobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  It's also to be expected from Las Vegas.    I'd certainly recommend Nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  I don't think I'd recommend much beyond that.  Japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  Nor does it need an additional side of ponzu sauce."}
{"text":"After read many reviews of this place and am awed by the vast divergence.  I will say this place isn't cheap perhaps somewhere else is a better choice if $$$-$$$$ per person is above your comfort zone. However, I was anticipating a highlight of my dining experience and prepared to do my part.  Ok having set my mindset.  My server was excellent with a vast knowledge of the menu and willing to spend the time so I could understand. The menu is huge. Don't go here for an old favorite from somewhere else. Let them take you on a culinary adventure you will never forget.  My recommendation is the chefs prix fixe menu this comes at three different levels.  I opted for the top level.  I believe there were 5 courses each having several different components. As they will be different for you I will not bore you with every item but say that each was amazing. There was Wagu, diver scallop, foie gras, fish selections I have never seen before and the best caviar legally available in this count, straight from Russia house.  And if that is not enough gold leaf on one item.  It was beautiful and each item completely explained as it was presented. If cheap fish is what you want I know a great Vietnamese place on Spring Mountain road that has the best whole flounder for cheap and deboned table side. If an experience is what you want then look no further in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Nobu is EXCELLENT!!! Party of 10+. We ordered family style and it was fantastic. Variety of hot and cold sushi.. I mean delicious. Top notch :) Environment: Classy Price: Our tab was very expensive but very well worth it.   Food: excellent Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hello, we had 8 for dinner this past Monday night at 6 o'clock for the Hibachi! We showed up and they never had us in the book for the hibachi. They told us that at the time we would have to wait until 9 for the hibachi we said we can't wait and we would take a regular table. We all order dinners, and soups. All the food comes except 1 dinner and the vegetables to go with the other meals! So we asked for the other steak that never came out and the vegetables came out after we ate the steak and chicken. We told the waiter we did not want the vegetables since we ate all the chicken steak and rice already. Also we were still waiting on the steak we told him to forget about it and my boyfriend was very upset, so he got up and walked out. Never got to eat! All the meals should of been brought out together! We also requested to speak to the manager. The manager never came over to us. This was a disgrace from start to finish! I feel that this needs to be addressed!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but it's Vegas.   Sat at the sushi bar with my boyfriend, and we were tempted to get the Omakase, but damn... can't pass up Oh-toro. Mmm... my tastebuds owe me. That's what the clouds in heaven taste like.   We got the Miso Black Cod by recommendation. GOod, but too sweet for my taste. We ordered Uni sushi, Yellowtail sushi, Spicy Tuna Handroll, Toro Handroll, Kampachi sashimi, and Japanese snapper sashimi... One of the best sushi/sashimi meals I've had. Ask the sushi chefs for their sashimi recommendations. They know what's good.  Service was excellent, and for dessert, I ordered the Matcha Parfait. Light and delicious. Perfect way to end the meal.   Atmosphere was great. We chatted with the sushi chef. Our servers were polite and quick. Awesome experience. I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"i only tried 3 dishes in this time....Price is expensive and the food is soso. black cod is good sushi is good but soy sauce is too salty the sauce for sashimi salad is too salty too. $180 i think i can have better food in other place."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday and had one of the best meals in Las Vegas. But before I start with the review, it's super expensive!! Only come here if your willing to drop some money, I was shocked when the bill came. The place is so nice, excellent customer service. I let the waitress order for us, she brought us some amazing  appetizers to start off. The one thing on the menu that is a must is the Wagye beef, best meat I ever had!! Hand downs the best!! The quality of the sushi is great and super fresh. The shave ice is made with Fiji water so u definitely taste the different. I would recommend this place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We didn't have reservation but immediately seated right at the bar, which was nice because there was only 2 of us. Food tasted amazing and fresh. Fast service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Vegas, so when my gf read great reviews we decided to try Nobu. We were seated right away and the waiter was very  accommodating to our questions. We had the black cod which was succulent and glad it wasn't bland. Aside from our other orders, the place lived up to our expectations. Only thing that was odd was the mangina of waiters. Overall was a great."}
{"text":"I'm keeping this review brief but I definitely plan to come back in hopes of getting the full sit down experience.   I came with a large group and the service was fantastic. We got a number of dishes that we shared. Yellow tail Sashimi platter and the Wagyu beef were by far the stars of the dishes we got. Sadly I was disappointed by some of them as I felt it wasn't anything you couldn't get at another Asian fusion restaurant. Being it has the Nobu name behind it I just expected a little more pop from the dishes.   Service was top notch and on point. The bartenders were excellent as well.   Overall I can see why people love coming to Nobu but I feel like a focus on sushi would be more up my ally here rather than a flurry of fusion."}
{"text":"Saturday Sept 29, my sister and I had dinner reservation for 9pm, we sat at our table for 10 minutes before anyone would show up with a menu, since I don't eat any sea food I thought I would try the $30.00 chicken dinner, it was horrible, just a breast of chicken on a big plate with nothing else, dry, burnt and no flavor the waiter then asked me when I was half way done my meal if I would like some rice. My sister received her dinner long after I was finished with mine. The other big problem was that the restroom were out in the casino across the way, once you got back the food was cold because you had to navigate your way through the casino to find the bathrooms. This is one restaurant I will never return to."}
{"text":"This is a combo of my 1 star experience and my friend's 5 star experience.   I went with 5 friends, and none of us understood how the place worked. The food courses are supposed to be a surprise from the chef, based on your preferences. You don't actually get to pick out what you want, and the pricing is very unclear. We were going out for dinner before going out that night. We wanted some sushi, not a dining experience. We weren't into spending possibly $150/person, especially since it's hard for us to agree on what we like.  However, my friend described the experience as the most amazing food she's ever eaten - crazy stuff, live scallops, and delicious. She said they spent $150/person and thought it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"We were staying at Caesar so we figured we need to give this place a try. I have to say the saving grace was beautiful decors, the whole meal was major disappointment.  Akimo, the dipping sauce around it was so sweet it taste like dessert and did not balance w the monk fish at all.  Uni shots were super salty, can't taste any other ingredients.  Asked for extra ginger and wasabi, twice and none were present.  Look for waiter to get second glass of wine.  Chef's choice sashimi were fresh  Spicy soup were decent  Roll were ...unimaginative   Our dates show up and order a few more items but didn't want to try after (they were all cooked items)  Look for waiter to get third glass of wine.  For the price, you would think they got their food or at least services in AMAZING category but nope.  Will we come back? Nahhhh!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.   I never had sushi so fresh and  good in my life! Salmon, just regular salmon, melts in your mouth. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere. It kind of looks outdated and confused. If you sit in a big round table for parties, they have curtains and you can close your area. It kind of looked tacky. I also wasn't a huge fan of seeing the kitchen as I was walking to the bathroom either. The awkward eye contact I had to make with the kitchen staff..... Beside the decoration and the layout of the restaurant, the food and the service was phenomenal. Our server was so friendly and I never had to ask for my water to be refilled which was a super plus!    You must try to Uni here because it's so fresh! Fresher than sushi I had in Japan. I hope to try the hot foods here next time I do visit! Also try the miso ice cream! I know it sounds little gross but it is so friggin delicious! My first Nobu experience was unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Middling at best. Dark and feels dated- despite being only 2 years old. The sushi was fine but nothing spectacular for that price point. I have visited other nobu restaurants and this was most lackluster by a mile. There's better sushi to dine on in Vegas."}
{"text":"LOVED Nobu!  My first time going to Nobu.  I was with my 86 year old mother and three other family members.  We all enjoyed it.  Service was outstanding.  My mother had a steak (she's never tried sushi), but I gave her some of mine and she loved it.  My brother had the Seabass and he said it was outstanding.  I had a few different types of sushi and it definitely was some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"After being seated, our table was presented a single drink menu, and left alone for fifteen minutes. Our waiter seemed a little miffed when he asked what we were going to start with to drink and i told him that we'd like to see food menus. I found it presumptuous and manipulative to leave us with a drink menu and that much free time. We are in Vegas, I know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, I expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.  Our waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common Japanese dishes.  We tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to spicy scallops, freshwater eel, albacore, and yellowtail with jalapenos. Everything was... good. Not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.  The interior of this location was bland. One of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. The main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.  The banana cake with sour cream ice cream was a high note, although the spoonful of ice cream that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like I was caught in a scene from American Psycho.   For all the noise I heard about Nobu being something special, I left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run Japanese restaurants is such a treat."}
{"text":"Overall a good meal.  Sushi, Yum! I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I've read about celebrities going to Nobu.  My friend talked about Nobu like it was a god of sorts.  When we found out we had a table waiting for us at Nobu, I was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  We ordered: The miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a soft shell crab roll, the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer, the mushroom salad, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  To drink I had the cucumber martini.  It was seriously one of the best drinks I have ever had.  It tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  Unfortunately our positive experience ended there.  After waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  We sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  I glanced at the menus, waited.  Our waiter came by and I asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  We had no water, and no menus.  Finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"We're a little short on menus.\"  We shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  We asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  We finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos.  Before I could order anything else, he rushes off.  The next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos.  Pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  I can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll.  The vegetable cut roll was pretty good, I mean, steamed vegetables, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  The mushroom salad was pretty gross.  The mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  The sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  Everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  Everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  Mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  When the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  His response?  \"No you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  I secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in San Francisco for a quarter of the price.  Overall verdict:  Skip it.  The atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  The Pros: The cucumber martini was super good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm scrumptious. The sashimi is really good here.  The lobster the kobe or wagyu with the rocks presentation is awesome."}
{"text":"Nobu survives b/c of it's name, not much else.  Atmosphere is terrible, decor is very dated, servers are attentive but a little way too salesy, and yes, it's expensive, which in and of itself isn't the problem...the problem lies in the actual VALUE you are getting, which is awful.  I've been to much better sushi restaurants in Portland (Bamboo really resonates right now) and paid 1/4 the price for frankly better sushi.  We actually ate beforehand just bc we didn't want to drop $450 on dinner and wanted to try a few things, my lady is pregnant so she can't drink, and I had A....as in 1, single drink and we had 4 single serving sushi items.  We were there for 20 minutes and our bill was NORTH OF $150.  I get that this restaurant isn't cheap, but cmon, I felt like I was bent over and just plowed in the backside (no lube, this was a dry run) as I was walking out....my lady felt the same.  Would never never never never ever ever ever go back and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Top to bottom this was the best meal I have had in a long time.    This place has a huge menu, hard not to find something you will like.  From the moment we walked in the service was wonderful.  Hostess was friendly and professional and quickly lead us to the table. Our server was wonderful recommending the menu and prompt with our drinks. Everybody that we had contact with was very nice and knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu.     We had the opportunity to try the teppanyaki- this is not your traditional scramble of vegetables, shrimp toss and poorly seasoned teriyaki steak stirfry. No sir, they created a truly memorable experience.   We had shishito peppers cooked in front of us with truffles, yellow tail jalapeno (to die for), Sashimi salad, Sea-bass with cilantro dressing and roasted tomatoes, Kobe beef with Nobu dipping sauces (cooked perfectly and such high quality beef, not the Kobe at the local teppanyaki house), Iberico ham fried rice, grilled vegetables with red onion salsa, Tempura king crab (the sauce is so good), Miso soup and Japanese whiskey cappuccino for dessert.   I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazed I haven't written a review for our favorite restaurant on the planet, hands-down! Eaten here at the Hard Rock location a dozen times now and every meal has been outstanding from service, to drinks to food and atmosphere! We always get the \"must have\" dishes like the Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno, the Wagyu Beef MiniTacos and the signature dish: Miso Cod. There is nothing like it, honestly. But apart from that, we have always trusted our server and just tell them to recommend small plates and keep them coming until we have had enough. The bill is usually pretty high, but it is THE meal we have to have when in Vegas! Going to try the one in Caesar's on our next trip."}
{"text":"Food is good but very overpriced. Prepare to be hungry when you leave. With so many options for this type of cuisine, this is not my first choice. Just another overpriced celebrity chef."}
{"text":"The food is very sophisticated.  We started with the yellowtail jalapeño which is a signature dish - 6 slices of excellent fish with a citrus soy sauce with thin slices of jalapeño.  Second we had the other signature dish - black cod w miso.  The fish is cooked with a lovely butter texture - the sauce is rather sweet (the miso I presume) - reasonably substantial portion.  We finished with the chef's sushi plate ($75!!) which was a good variety of sushi - some had sweet or savory sauces but it was primarily just fish w wasabi on rice (the rice is rather sweet compared to other places).  The grand total for this was $150 before tip and we drank tap water.  Alcohol was ridiculously expensive so we didn't order anything to drink.  I would definitely go again but probably be a bit more adventurous w the menu choices.  There is also an option for 150/person where the chef just creates a menu for you - looks wonderful if you want to spend that much.  In sum excellent (but extremely expensive) sushi.  The fish is extremely fresh - a nice surprise in the desert."}
{"text":"Usually when a restaurant has this much hype I'm disappointed.  It's hard to live up to hype. I'm happy to report...no disappointment here!  We had dinner there last night.  Our server was Thomas and he could not have been better.  One of the best servers we've ever had.  He was friendly, on top of it and fantastic about explaining the restaurant, menu, food and the area the food comes from.  We went for sushi, but after Thomas explained the menu we realized we should be eating what the restaurant does best.  So glad that we did! Our server recommended we have 4-5 dishes for the two of us.  We went with every dish that he suggested. We had... *Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno.  AMAZING.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  I want to eat it every day.  *Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Ponzu.  Delicious! *Black Cod with Miso.  Also amazing.  This was my second favorite.  Someone said it \"melted in my mouth\".  This is the perfect way to describe it.  Also, so flavorful! *Broiled Yellowtail Collar.  Delightful! *Mixed Seafood Ceviche.  My husband loved this, I thought it was just okay.  I think it was just my taste though, I don't love cucumbers or octopus.    Prices are high, but I definitely would recommend Nobu to anyone looking for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Always a good dining experience. We've tried the teppanyaki menu (the only location that has it) and it was a great sampling of what Nobu has to offer. You really can't beat the quality of the food here. Sushi bar is also a great way to watch the chefs in action. Haven't had a bad meal here. Service has always been on point as well. It's definitely pricey but it's also Vegas! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've been to many other Nobu locations and this has been my least favorite. We had a reservation for 4 people at 7 on a Saturday and still had to wait to be seated. I definitely recommend reservations.   After being seated, we waited an unusual amount of time for the drink and dinner menus. Finally, our server comes to the table to drop off ONE drink menu for 4 people and hurriedly walks away. We had a 9:30 show to get to, so already I'm thinking we need to pick up the pace. 10 minutes go by and we finally get the dinner menu. ONE dinner menu. Had to ask for another one. Like I said, I've been to other Nobu locations and the service here was f'n weird.   Our server then asks if we've been to that location before. My husband and I stated we've been to other Nobu's and our server goes on a 5 minute rant about how this location is totally different from other ones and don't expect the same experience. It came off in a very condescending way, almost like he was berating us. Side note: the menu and dinner presentation was the same as the other locations, so not sure why he said it was  different.   The Food: I always get the same thing. Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp was good, but smaller portion compared to other times I have had it. Miso Black Cod was also delicious and melted in my mouth. Only bad thing is it will set you back $37. Bento Box dessert was also not as good as the other locations. I guess my expectations were too high. I also like to get their seasonal cocktails. This time it was the Buddhas Passion, with apricot sake, vodka, lemon and passion tea-- very refreshing!   Overall, this dining experience was okay. I definitely prefer other locations."}
{"text":"This restaurant should have five stars from everyone! We always come here twice when visiting Las Vegas. Let the server dictate your menu and you will be pleasantly surprised each and every time!"}
{"text":"Best dining experience I have ever had, hands down. I was in Vegas for a couple days for a friends birthday, reservation for nobu was made prior to getting to Vegas in fear that we may not be able to just walk in or schedule the day before. To start, the ambiance of this place was great. Our waiter came by and explained the menu and the nobu experience to us. Expect to be at the restaurant for at least 2 hours. We were a larger group, so we were there for 4 hours. The dishes are prepared so intricately. I ordered the miso black cod, which was my favorite dish that I tried. In addition, I order the waygu gyosza, and salmon tartare with caviar, both so very delicious. To end, I had the California roll, which I expected to be much better than any ordinary California roll, but it actually tasted like a regular California roll (they do not use imitation crab). My personal check for 4 items was $158. I love dining at one of a kind places like this, so it was well worth it for me. Will absolutely return when back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Omg, I will not be able to do this restaurant justice so this will be brief...    It was nothing short of WONDERFUL in every way!!  Service was awesome, from making (and twice changing) our reservation,  arrival & interaction with the hostess, to the amazing wait staff.   In short, there's a good reason Chef Nobu has a ton of restaurants.   We decided before arriving in Vegas that we would have the prix fixe dinner.  Each course was prepared after the next so everything was extremely fresh.  While the plates didn't seem overly complicated when described by our waiter, their relative simplicity worked favorably in creating unique flavors for each item; no flavors were duplicated or even similar to the other dishes served.  Everything they brought was visually exciting, just check out the pictures below.  It isn't exactly inexpensive (by most average standards), but so worth it."}
{"text":"Not a big sushi fan but we were going to a concert at The Joint in the Hard Rock so we were there,   Ambiance:  loud young energetic but I would have preferred not having to shout for the server to hear. Food:  Lots of choices but would have preferred a little more directions on portion sizes and how to choose a well rounded dinner. Price: exorbitant.  Oh well, not visiting Tokyo soon anyway."}
{"text":"Overpriced, well presented fish. Sauced to hide whether or not the fish is grade A freshness. I recommend Malibu, Caesar's or even the palsy Palo Alto location in comparison. The thinly sliced A5 is good, but again, over sauced, if you want to spend $$$ for an appetizer."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start off by saying the sushi is not the best. Not even close. Portions to price to satisfaction is probably one of the worst for that. Anyone who thinks their sushi is good, hasn't had real sushi. Now that the cons section is over, let me explain why they're getting 4 stars from me.  The black cod is delish. It was probably the best cod I've had. I never thought cod could be so good (actually fish n chips are pretty good too lol). If I had ordered a bowl of rice on the side, this would have been pretty filling for $38.  The Japanese wagyu was everything I had hoped it to be and then some. The sauce was great. It was super tender and although some pieces were a bit more marbled than I would have liked, it was very memorable overall. 6 oz at $38/oz is a steep price..  but if you're going to Nobu, you're willing to splurge anyways right? Might as well go all out.  The yellowtail to me was good, but I'm not a big yellowtail person. I could live without ordering this again. Now I'm off to the bento box dessert. I'm sure that'll be good."}
{"text":"Love Nobu. Loved it in London, loved it in Waikiki and love the new one in Caesars Palace, Vegas.  They really go all out to make sure you have a customized experience. Their wait staff is very knowledgable, and can easily alter and suggest dishes per your preferences all through the selections. We had lotus root salad, and it was like no other time we had anything with lotus root or stem! Delicately prepared and flavored, that each bite just 'pops' on your palate.  Yellow tail sashimi was spectacular. I am not a big sashimi eater, but this one was too good to pass. Soaked to the right taste, cut very fine. Seared salmon, Miso cod were great as entrees. Cocktails are creative, desserts are delicious."}
{"text":"The best sushi in the world.  Unbelievable restaurant.  Came here with some friends for a 40th birthday party.  The service is at the highest standard.  Extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Everything we order was awesome.  Try the sake with your meal!!"}
{"text":"If you like the finest sushi, that looks and tastes like perfection, served by the most beautiful people, in an atmosphere that sizzles, that makes you feel like a baller; well you might like this place!   Course, dinner for 4 cost nearly $800."}
{"text":"I've had three meals at Japanese restaurants in the last two weeks and this one was the best.  The food was great and service was outstanding!  I made a 5 PM reservation because I wanted to have plenty of time to do one of the omakase options and I wanted to have enough time before the 7:30 show at the Colosseum.    Matthew was my server.  He explained the menu to me after I was seated and then he answered questions I had about the omakase and the time requirements.  I ended up with the Signature omakase which consists of 7 courses plus dessert.  Two hours later, the meal was over and it was excellent.  Course 1 was a vegetable temaki.  Thin, long pieces of vegetables in very tasty nori.  Course 2 was the Nobu sashimi salad.  I don't remember the names of the different fish for several of the courses.  Suffice it to say that the salad was plated nicely and the fish selection was good.  Course 3 was the sushi course with nigiri sushi.  Besides the sushi, there was a cube of crispy rice topped with salmon tartare and some roe.  I was advised to eat the sushi from left to right.  Everything was excellent and the crispy rice finish was superb!  Course 4 was the last cold course.  It was called the tartare course and there was a salmon tartare in the center in a homemade ponzu sauce, yellowtail to the left, and a whitefish ceviche.  The courses represented the chef's time in South America and had excellent flavors.  I was advised to eat the tartare first.  I was given a small serving spoon to carefully spread the roe on top and then advised to dip straight down and have some roe, tartare, and sauce with each bite.  Excellent.  Then it didn't matter which side I ate but they advised that is save the yamamomo, Japanese mountain peach, for last to transition to the next course.  Course 5 was the first hot course and it was black cod miso wrapped in a leaf and opened by the server at the table.  The fish was superbly cooked and was very tasty.  Course 6, the second hot course, was beef tenderloin with enoki mushrooms and an asparagus spear.  It was brought with a napkin covering the top to protect the server as he lifted the top off the cast iron pan.  It was steaming it was so hot.  The flavor was marvelous!  Course 7 was back to a cold course.  This was a small serving of green tea noodles in a delightful sauce.  Dessert was a bento box with a chocolate cake with a scoop of green tea ice cream and some fresh berries.  It was a fairly light and delicious way to end the meal.  The time passed quickly, the food was great, and the service matched.  The restaurant became quite busy."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at Nobu Next Door in New York City.  At that point I was still evolving into the foodie that I am today, and for some reason, I absolutely loved the hot spot.  The food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  In the years that have passed since, Nobu has expanded, and I have also eaten at their Nobu 57 in Manhattan and the Vegas location.  As food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of Nobu.  This chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  While some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.    My sushi-fanatic friend and I recently booked a trip to Vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try Nobu.  I knew that my friend was focused on it, so I went along with the recommendation, though I knew better.  We wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.  Our reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  My friend ordered a glass of sangria, while I opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that I needed to exchange it for a basic glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  The wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.  In terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  A tiny mound of cool, fresh Salmon Tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty Caviar.  I am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  This particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  We also sampled one of my favorites - the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Sauce.  The succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce added a creamy kick.   My friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style House Special Roll and the Spicy Scallop Roll.  The spicy scallop one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  We actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.  Unfortunately, I think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  I would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent."}
{"text":"Food was beautiful and delicious! Had the creamy spicy rock shrimp and some of my friends miso black cod. Wonderfully executed and balanced dishes. Decor was upscale, modern, clean and interesting. Cocktails were properly made and amazing. True mixologist behind their bar. The only reason for 3 stars was the service. Specifically the waitress. The most unaccomadating server I have ever experienced. I was truly shocked to be treated that way in fine dining. Disappointed that their management would be employing a waitress that would fit a Denny's or Ihop better. Somewhere you expect mediocre service. Usually upscale restaurants will make your experience perfect, or at least try. She made us feel unwelcome and that we were majorly inconveniencing her. She gave us attitude for not choosing a set menu, when our party was only 11 people. She seemed so irritated that she had to do her job and ask for all our orders individually instead of us saying yes we will take a $100 per person set menu with no idea what was going to be served, when a few in our party had allergies. I have been in the service industry for 15 years, I would never treat a table in such a lazy-I don't give a crap about you manner. She refused to spilt our bill. Which I have parties of 20 or more and keep all their checks straight. It's annoying, but it is your job! Take pride in your job and the amazing opportunity you have at such a great restaurant. All the other staff was very on point. The bussers, hostess, server assistance were all fantastic."}
{"text":"Nobu at the HardRock Las Vegas is my favorite Nobu. The service is not the same in LA. I had the chefs menu which included  chilled Tuna Tartare and caviar on top. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"One of my best dining experiences ever ! Recently dined in earlier in the week with 2 other guest. Managed to make a 10pm reservation( even though they closed at 10pm) happen to be 10/15 mins late, anyway they were extremely nice being that we were late as well. Our server was completely knowledgeable about the whole menu and recommended some of the best items. The food was out of this world ! Had one slight complication that was flattened to IMMEDIATELY, management and the server along with his service  made the experience all worth it. Will be dining  here soon . -the misses W."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a lot of fun. It was downstairs at the hotel (Caesar's Palace).   A reservation is recommended but not mandatory.   So when we sat down the waiter greeted us promptly. He wasn't as frequently as I like, but I'm from the south and we do things different 'round here!  Lol. But the fella I was dining with was from Arizona. And he felt the exact same way. But maybe the waiter wasn't the ultra friendly type. So I get it. He seemed to be knowledgeable of the menu. He talked so fast though. So we didn't fully understand. But again it didn't ruin dinner.   Now just letting you guys know. This place is pretty pricey for the amount of food. I didn't complain too much, because I wasn't paying. But for you payers. Take note of that.   The portions are very small but flavorful. They do have this full dinner recommendation where the chef selects everything for you. I would have gotten that if It wasn't so late.   No matter what you order make sure the cod is on the lineup.   This place isn't kid friendly though.  But a great place for adults.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nobu and I go waaaay back.  I've eaten at Nobu NY in the Morimoto days, Nobu next door, Nobu London, and Nobu 57.  I've been to events where Nobu himself was preparing our sushi.  I've since been fortunate enough to head to Tokyo a few times and tried ultra high end sushi, teppanyaki, and kaiseki at the source.  None of which has diminished my affection for Nobu and it's particular brand of fusion cuisine.  To be fair, I was restrained in my ordering this visit - having the Miso Cod (how can you not?) and sushi.  It was excellent, as expected.  I was alone and sat at the sushi bar  But if you aren't lucky enough to have easy access to one of the myriad Nobu outposts, and this is your one shot, I beg you to try the tasting menu, which goes by the Japanese name \"Omakase\".  The ingredients will be unfamiliar, the presentations beautiful, and the experience mind bending."}
{"text":"8 of us came to celebrate a friend Birthday. The place was very nice. The food was okay but nothing extraordinary. One incident that left a bad taste in our mouth. They brought out 6 pieces of sea urchins.  I told the waiter that we were missing one piece since we have 7 people eating this plate ( one in the group don't eat raw food). The waiter went to the kitchen and checked. She came back and told us: \" we double checked and there were 7 pieces of sea urchins on the plate\". Wow! What happen to the concept: the customers are alway right. We paid $1700 for dinner. $250 tips were automatically added to our bill because there were 8 of us."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time! Everything on the menu is delicious. The service is amazing. A must when you come to Vegas. I had to order dessert even though I was stuffed. We picked a few different dishes to try a little bit of everything and loved every entree. Make sure you make reservations."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time and everything was excellent.  My husband and I both had Nobu Signature ($125/person) which come with nine courses (included dessert) and all the 9 courses are excellent.  The foods are fresh and tasty.  There are several different prices, so it all depending on your budget.  Overall, the services are excellent and fun atmosphere.  The only thing I didn't like about this place is the restaurant doesn't have a restaurant.  The restroom is located in the casino."}
{"text":"Very high end sushi fusion tapas place. Great place to celebrate a special something or to impress someone =0) The servers are nice and very helpful suggesting what is fresh and what pairs well. Great place to eat but can be very expensive. I highly recommend this place for special occasions! If your in Vegas and winning, this is one of the places to spend some of your winnings =0)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Lychee martini and tuna with crispy rice are always my favorite!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a half star rating option and that my friend hadn't talked up Nobu up one side and down the other. Maybe that is why I wasn't over the moon about it.   First off, I will tell you...I had simply the best spicy scallop roll I've ever had in my sushi lovin life there. You could taste how fresh the scallop was and it was huge pieces. Their take on ceviche I was less than taken with. The prices were out of control, but hey it's Vegas right?   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but if you are staying at the HRH, definitely have dinner one night."}
{"text":"If I could eat here everyday I would. No matter what you order it will be bursting with flavor, making you want more. I have been to the Nobu in Malibu and yes , can't beat the view but this place is the original Nobu and the sushi tasted a little better. They used different sauces on some things I noticed. The Kronuts were a must try for dessert. What I love most about this place is you will never feel full or bloated, just completely satisfied. The service is top quality and very professional. Tiradito sashimi is an absolute must try and the  Spicy Tuna hand roll is also my favorite."}
{"text":"Nobu's Signature dish - Black Cod Miso is the best bite of food I've ever tasted.   And, I eat out 90% of the time. I've had amazing meals in the US and Europe.   The tasting menu at $125 is the best choice, if you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience.   Everything was delicious. The Alaskan Black Cod Miso stands out as not only the best seafood I've ever eaten but quite possibly the best food I've ever eaten. And, I'm a steak lover.   I understand why DeNero would fly across the country just for this dish.   Simply, amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing miso cod, sashimi sampler is overpriced at $120"}
{"text":"Nobu is an excellent option if you are looking for Japanese food on the strip. I'm quite picky when it comes to sushi, so that is saying a lot. Stylish lounge-y atmosphere.  Usually one of my favorites, but I was not as impressed on my last visit here so I think it's teetering between 3 and 4 stars. You must try their signature yellowtail jalapeño sashimi app. Skip the shishito peppers. Rock shrimp tempura is always good. Make sure you ask to try all three flavors. Although I think creamy jalapeño is my favorite. It's hard to pick. The oysters we had were very small which I don't mind, but they over salted them when we went this time.   I think the favorite of the night was the miso cod lettuce cups. Sushi was great. Both mirugai and ikura nigiri had the perfect flavors and texture. Rice was seasoned well and cooked right. Even the seaweed was toasted perfectly. Uni was good.   To end, we had the tempura king crab legs with ponzu. We had a few bottles of echigo and a teapot of house daigingo sake. Our waiter was ok. Total bill came out to be about $650 before tip for our party of 5."}
{"text":"I knew something had to give cause my Vegas trip was going too good. Won the Super Bowl so I was having wet dreams of Sushi for my dinner at Nobu. Then it happened at dinner !!!  Where do I start ... Yes, Rice and I'll say it again rice. Rice is the basic foundation that gives us Asians identity, culture, life ...Without rice there would be chaos, anarchy in the streets and darkness in the hearts of men. As Jiro stated in Dreams of Sushi, rice is the most important part of Sushi !!! What part of that did you miss Nobu The Fricking Rice was under cook!!! How can they screw up the basic given in sushi 101 and I'll say it again given as in my sushi rice should be cooked. I was so disappointed after the succulent dreamy ($22 for 1 piece ) Toro went in my mouth. My fricking Nobu / dreams of sushi dining experience came to a screeching halt. WTF !!! Every GD sushi on that platter was the same. At that moment a similar disappointing experience lock away so deep in my mind came back to me. It was when I was trying to pick up a hot and I mean hot chick at Avalon under the influence and finding out she a he!!!  Victoria had a secret . The flash back was intense, I felt nauseated just as I felt that night so long ago ... You can't trust anything in this day and age .  So using my level 7 yoga breathing technique learned from my mail man Mr. Chang to hold the rage down as I called waiter calmly to informed him of the sushi situation. AUGHAAAAAH I can not go on writing this review,  I'm still in mourning...I hope Robert D is reading this \" cooked rice buddy \""}
{"text":"well i went with the guy that sells to the guy that sells the seafood to nobu.   yeah. oh yeah. it was awesome.  i like the take they do on japanese food. very inventive....  should be minus one star though. too fucken expensive. good thing for buddys expense account."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! Try the Wagu Beef Gyoza! The rock shrimp was awesome as well as the sushi! expensive but highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We ended up at Nobu because of circumstance more than anything else. I've long heard the hype but this was my first time actually eating here. Upon first impressions the ambiance was good - trendy and the kind of thing you'd expect from a Japanese fusion eatery. The waitstaff were all very attentive and helpful at navigating the menu and recommending the best dishes.   Overall the food was good, not great. We sampled a mix of cold and hot appetizers and entrees as well as the sushi. The quality of ingredients was good, as was the presentation, however the flavor of the dishes didn't match.   Highlights: Try the crispy rice and tuna tartar appetizer. It was something different and put a nice spin on a standard tartar. The sushi was good quality and what you'd expect from the place like Nobu. The toro was excellent, as were the uni, amaebi and unagi. The unagi sauce was quite good and made in house which is a departure from the shimmering gloop most sushi joints in the states serve.  Low lights: The yakitori dishes were a disappointment overall. We sampled the beef, shrimp, sea bass and pork belly. They come with your choice of teriyaki sauce or a South American style chimichurri - neither were very good. The teriyaki sauce was overbearing and much too sweet. The South American option had a nice kick but seemed out of place with Japanese ingredients. The pork belly was too gelatinous, as if it had been cooked and left to cool for many hours - skip it.   Overall Nobu is a lot of hype and shines too brightly amongst other, far better sushi options off The Strip. Come for the ambiance and the trend factor. But if you're looking for the best quality sashimi and nigiri, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"A lovely experience from start to finish.  AMAZING food and service."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I love Nobu Malibu and Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills.  With those dining experiences in mind, I say that Nobu in Hard Rock is awful.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the exceptional staff and the green tea ice cream.   The chef's sushi dinner was third rate.  The fish was the ordinary fare:  tuna, yellow tail, sea urchin, sweet shrimp and unagi nigiri.  Plus tiny spicy tuna rolls.  I wish I could say that at least the fish cuts were exceptional quality.  They were not.  They tasted worse than cheap sushi from a sacramento discount sushi bar.  I gagged several times trying to choke down the fish.  I was appalled that I spent as much as I did on terrible sushi.  I will never, ever, ever go back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to eat at Nobu at least once? When you step into the restaurant, you'll forget to walk for a second because it's so beautiful. There are so many interesting structural elements in one space, whether it be the light fixtures hanging from the top of the ceiling, or the semi-enclosed pods along the edge of the restaurant.   Nobu is all about the experience really. With a variety of items on the menu, I highly recommend going in a big group, everyone getting some things and sharing items. It's an experience of many senses: sight, smell and taste. If you came to Nobu to dine on a budget, don't. The bill won't be cheap, but you will be full. You're not coming here every day, so if you come, be prepared to splurge."}
{"text":"Good service, but too much over price, $400 after tips for two of us, that price I can eat much much moore better sashimi at Los Angel, won't go back anymore"}
{"text":"I give it a 4 because it is awesome. to be a 5 star in my book you need to bring it like no other. nobu reminds me of a place in sausalito, ca called Sushi Ran. The food is a sushi background with a french culinary flare. Again , the actual standard rolls are good but nothing special. if you really want to benefit from going to a place like this you need to order the special items on the menu and stay away from your typical rolls. so the food is amazing and the service matches. I am eating here everytime I go to Vegas, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Best.Sushi.Ever. Amazing Misi black cod, Spicy Tuna Roll, amazing oysters and the Lobster Roll is the absolute best!  Sit at the sushi bar & watch it all be made.  So fresh, so delicious!  You can taste the flavor of the fish yummmm"}
{"text":"A-maz-ing. All I can say. Have waited years and years to go to Nobu, and we were finally able to on our honeymoon to Vegas. We let them know when we made the reservation it was the highlight meal of our honeymoon, so I think we got a very experienced waiter as a result. He walked us through everything and was beyond helpful. He had been with Nobu for over 8 years. We decided to order a few things off the menu. We started with the yellowtail jalepeno cold dish appetizer. Flavors were amazing. The salmon skin salad was also divine. My husband was nuts for the beef tenderloin toban-yaki. The only thing we ordered that I wasn't crazy about was the sea bass jalapeno tempura. I found it to be a little bland. But the amazingness of everything else overshadowed that. I'm not sure if I'll ever get to go back, but it definitely lived up to my expectations!"}
{"text":"great food, good service and some interesting dishes. Try the miso black cod! I'll whole party of 6 loved it. Mochi was awesome as well."}
{"text":"Billy is the best server I've ever had in any restaurant, period.  I love Nobu, from the sparkling water to the unique \"tempura\" they use - every bit of the meals I've had there are on point, terrific and enjoyable.  I have returned every time I go to vegas, in no small part because of Billy the server.  See you guys next week!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Ok. I came here for the first time with a friend about 6 years ago. Since it was my first visit, he decided to order everything, which was almost half of the menu. I must say thy I was not once disappointed! I understood then why the restaurant was packed to capacity, with such a wait, even with reservations. That was such an unforgettable experience. I love this place."}
{"text":"Been to this place 4 times, so have a good feel for what I like, and I love the chef's choice/sampler/whatever.  Costs a whopping $150 or $200pp, but the food is unbelievable.  Skip the often-cited black cod (or lump it in) and go with this if you're on an expense account or looking to splurge Vegas-style.  The items are varied, inventive, and super-tasty. The wife and I prefer the cold items, but the hot ones are very good, too.  Add a bottle of champagne or white wine, and it's bliss."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! Can't wait to go back! I'm not a big dessert person but you have to try the watermelon dessert!!! So refreshing!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: Best Japanese in a town of lots of good Japanese.  When our new baby turned 2 months old, my husband and I decided it was time for a real, baby-free date. Seeing as how I had not eaten sushi for the preceding 9 months, it had been on my mind for a long time. And when I want some serious sushi, there's only one place to go - NOBU!  In all actuality, you shouldn't really order off the sushi menu at Nobu - it's good and all, but it's about twice as much as comparable sushi at, say, Osaka. What you really want is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, the black cod with miso, and whatever else your perfectly-attentive-but-not-really-there waiter recommends.   Not sure what else I can add that hasn't been said already, but if you're willing to spend the money, Nobu is awesome.   Side note: if you are there early, and have a small party, you can probably find seats in the lounge or at the sushi bar (still full menu). Otherwise, MAKE RESERVATIONS! Just because the restaurant isn't all that full when you arrive, doesn't mean that it is not booked."}
{"text":"\"I hate sushi.\"  That was me earlier in the night, when looking at the menu.  I was in Vegas for a week and it was our last night.  My friend really loves sushi and I wasn't that hungry, so... fine.  Nobu.  Truth is... I'd never actually had sushi.  I had some lobster roll once and couldn't get past the seaweed wrapper.  Almost turned blue and, well... it wasn't pretty.  Anyway... they seated us in the lounge area in a huge booth.  No one behind us.  Clear view of the entire place.  Felt like we had the best table.  I scanned the menu to try to find something I would actually eat.  Wagyu.  That works. Chicken, too.  Shrimp Tempura.  I can do that.  The server (super hot; in fact... all the servers are ridiculously gorgeous)  was convinced that I'd like sushi if I just tried it.  I explained my issue with the seaweed.  She smiled (knowing what an idiot I am, of course) and said rolls are one way to eat it, but that I needed to trust her.  She said her brother hated it, as well... but once he tried it... he loved it.  She suggested the \"Omakase\" - a tasting from across the menu.  You give them a price point (ours was $125 per person).  They ask if you have allergies, what you like/dislike... and you get a series of signature items delivered over the next hour. Ordered a lychee sake and... as I looked around, I realized that it was our last night and this was a nice place. Ok.  \"Amazing\" is an understatement.  One of the best meals I've had.  Ever.  The first dish was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno.  Wow.  It was incredible.  Next up was a red snapper sashimi with lime.  Another sashimi... this one salmon with sesame, ginger, and green onion.  Then came the beef tenderloin (my least favorite dish of the night), followed up by black cod miso (wonderful flavor), creamy/spicy shrimp tempura, and then the sushi... albacore (holy mother of god this was good) and bluefin.  The final dish was a dessert... chocolate cake and green tea ice cream (with berries).  Topped it off with an espresso and called it a night.  With tip, the bill came out to about $450 for two.  A lot of money, but... it was a terrific experience and now I know I like sushi.  Highlights...  Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno Albacore sushi  Lychee sake (had a few; they were about $20 each) Servers (what? eye candy is nice, too)  I'd like to try the wagyu tacos.  Needless to say, I'll be back.  Consider me converted."}
{"text":"Definitely reached a moment of zen here.  I have yet to experience Nobu LA or NY, but I was blown away by the beautiful interiors at this location.  Our party of five were here back in late September, but the yellowtail sashimi + jalapeno, rock shrimp tempura, mixed seafood ceviche, and tiradito still bring very happy memories.  It has a hint of that SNL-Jeffrey's vibe that makes me a little queasy.  Nonetheless, after several small dishes with a round of alcohol shared among five friends, it was actually a very reasonable price for fine dining on the Strip.  I get a kick out of the waiter who rescues your napkin whenever you leave your table.  He's got eyes like a hawk!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Nobu. I visit Vegas 2-3 times per year. Every time my husband and I go, we make it a point to dine at Nobu. We always get several dishes to share. Our favorites are the black cod and the jalapeno sashimi. The sashimi is to DIE for. I live in the SF Bay Area where we have a million sushi joints and I have yet to find sashimi as wonderful as Nobu's - please if someone knows of a place let me know because I crave yummy sashimi. The spicy miso lotus chips with big eye tuna is delish too! Actually, we have been happy with everything we have tried.   Nobu is definitely on the pricey side but so worth every penny. We are always sure to take our time with our meal and savor every bite! Our bill is usually anywhere from $80 (no alcohol) to $120 (with alcohol). The other great thing is that all the wait staff work together so your plates are constantly cleared and your table cleaned. They even fold your napkin for you if you get up from the table.   The only reason why I give Nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because every so often we will get a waiter who is pompous and thinks his shit doesn't stink, which is really unfortunate because most of the wait staff is really great! If I could knock only a half star off for that, I would!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype's about...Nobu has mediocre food and totally over-rated. I thought the food was ok - nothing to write home about...The omakase was totally not worth the $150 per person. So if you want to be seen but don't mind the mediocre food then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Nobu at the Hard Rock Las Vegas has continued to be the overall best Nobu location we have experienced. Dish recommendations are on point, and customer service is amazing (the manager has even taken the time to get to know our names). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was good....it was pricey but that is to be expected, also why I gave it 4 stars....we were there on may 5th for my birthday and also the weekend of the fight so there were a lot of people out. It was strange to see some empty tables....the jalepeno yello tail was my absolute favorite...it was soooo good!!!!..their cocktails were good too (pomegranite martini....oh so yummy) so I dont remember much of what else I had to review it:)   P.S. we saw Michael J. Fox there"}
{"text":"Amazing yellow tail tuna sashimi & tempura shrimp. The mango passion fruit martini was really nice!!"}
{"text":"I loved the food here! The portions are served family style, so my group split several dishes. Everything I sampled was amazing and delicious, perfectly cooked and/or seasoned. The things that stood out for me were the rock(?) shrimp and the yellowtail sashmi. The lychee sake I got was also super yummy.   My only suggestion is that if you do go, be aware that this place is pricey. It's worth the cost for the food & service, but in my opinion ONLY if you go with a small group of no more than 4 people. We had 8 people in our party, so by the time everything went around, I probably had a total of 5 bites of food all night. For $80. That kind of sucked."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. The quality and flavor of each dish was absolutely superb. I've read other reviews that complain about the up-sells, but I highly recommend that if you are going to a restaurant of this magnitude (and price), you go ahead and let your waiter customize your meal for you based on your preferences. Take some risks, try some things you'd never thought you'd try and let the magic happen. You'll be happy you did and this will likely be one of the best dining experiences of your life."}
{"text":"Every bite of every dish was delightful!  We started with the crispy rice with spicy tuna and then the yellow tail with jalapeño. We didn't think anything could be better than the crispy rice and we aren't really yellow tail fans,  but OMG it was delicious. We ordered the black cod with miso and we thought it looked very plain when it arrived,  but every mouthful was a cornucopia of flavor!  The rock shrimp with the spicy sauce was delicious. It was amazing that everything was so equally fabulous- one mouth watering sensation to the next! We were also impressed with the friendly and competent staff. Our waitress,  Twee, was fun and extremely knowledgeable. The whole experience was outstanding."}
{"text":"OMG! The hype of Nobu did not disappoint!   The food is incredible! Cooked (or not cooked lol! **sushi**) so perfectly in every way with the best mix of ingredients.   We ordered the: FOOD Japanese Snapper with Dry Miso (or special sauce) Yellowtail jalapeño Roll Salmon  Scallop Tuna (Big Eye) Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy  Black Cod Miso BENTO BOX* (Valrhona Dark Chocolate Fondant & Imperial Matcha Gelato)  DRINKS 2Mango & Passion Martini for me 2 Nobu Side Car for my partner  I can't tell you how amazing this experience was! From the food down to the waiter and servers. The food is out of this world! My favorite out of all (but don't get me wrong I absolutely LOVED all if anything everything were my favorites lol) was the Japanese Snapper with their special sauce? Im not sure if it was dry miso or not. But it was a different sauce that mixed so well with the japanese snapper! The crunchy addition was a perfect touch! The yellow tail, salmon, scallop, and tuna sushis were all in one plate including the sauce. The sauce was the perfect sauce for the sushi! The rock shrimp tempura was amazing! No extra sauce needed! My partner absolutely loved this dish! The black cod miso --where do I start? It was cooked so perfectly. Not overcooked, not undercooked. When I say perfectly cooked this is what cooking is supposed to be like. It seemed like it it was taken out of the pan at the exact perfect second! The bento box dessert loved the matcha gelato sooooo good! The chocolate was great, love dark chocolate! If you're more for the sweet chocolate you can also mix the matcha gelato with the dark chocolate which is what my partner. Expect to pay about 200-250 including tip though for all these, but it is sooo worth it! Ahhhh it was so good, I'm thinking of going back before we leave vegas!"}
{"text":"Probably the WORST service my family and I have ever experienced. I'm just in shock. First they sit us at a table for 6 when there was 8 of us. We made these reservations in July. We sit down and get told that its family style servings. Not even close to family style serving! Terrible terrible service. Waited for a while for drinks. The only thing I can say is the sushi is good and that's really about it. Nothing great for how hyped up it's talked about."}
{"text":"Totally my kind of place, elegant and posh! Serving tasty food in small portions so I can try a variety of dishes, fresh and delicious, especially the miso black cod, it is to die for, I tried to cook this dish at home, it doesn't come out the same. Wish there was a Nobu close to where I live so I can get my fix! Much better than Morimoto in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is consistently good, and the service is very good. It is NOT good if you think you are going to have a relaxing dinner conversation.  It is so loud in there that conversation revolves around \"What drink did you order?\" and mouthing to each other \"oh my god...this is so good\"  But in fairness, it is in the Hard Rock which is already a loud property, and it is consistent with that cool vibe."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was tasty. Definitely recommend dinner here. The Groupon deal was a fantastic bargain!"}
{"text":"I met some colleagues here for dinner and a we all had a wonderful meal. All 4 chose the black cod miso on the recommendation of one who has been here before. It was a great choice. Tender, flavorful and perfectly done. Also great sushi, sashimi, skewers and amazing wagyu beef potstickers which we ordered twice. We just kept eating and eating!"}
{"text":"MOCHI MOCHI MOCHI!  Mochi is a must and really can't go in choosing a better Sushi place than this. Great for big groups! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious, premium quality, and beautifully prepared, but it did cost $80 for one person.  I ordered sake, saba, uni, tobiko and the soft shell crab roll.  Loved it all as well as the miso soup.  The sushi was fresh and melts in your mouth.  I also liked how the soft shell crab roll was prepared with tobiko, avocado and a thin layer of daikon wrapping the outside of the roll.  The only thing I didn't like was the kelp salad (weird crunchy texture and sour flavor), but they let me exchange it for the field greens salad instead (just ok).  The restaurant is gorgeous on the inside, and the service was excellent.  It definitely satisfied my sushi craving, but at $80 it was a bit steep."}
{"text":"This is the best Nobu. It's expensive as hell, but delicious and it's Vegas right? so why not live it up. Usually the service is awesome, this last time was a little under par but everyone has an off day. I've eaten sushi in Vegas at other places and it's always a crap shoot, but Nobu at the hard rock is consistently the best. I go whenever I am in Vegas and not broken from craps."}
{"text":"Dining at Nobu Las Vegas was a great experience!  Having dined at other Nobu restaurants, we knew that we would be getting great quality food, but what made this visit stand out was the service.  Our waiter was energetic, friendly, and made it an awesome night for us.  He asked us our price point, and he created a delicious menu for us.  Even if it was his regular spiel, I wouldn't have known it because he made us feel special and brought out some dishes that we hadn't tried at Nobu before, as well as some notable signature dishes.  He selected great dishes for us, and we felt that there weren't any \"fillers\", even given my husband's allergy to shellfish.  And the wines that he paired with each course were well chosen.  I would definitely go back and visit this Nobu again."}
{"text":"I wont go into details.   My experience at Nobu was something like a dream.   To extrapolate and analyze would be like waking up to the harsh reality that is my normal routine.  I'll keep this simple:  *  Best Japanese food I've had in the United States.  *  My new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas  *  One of the ten best meals of my life  Make sure your credit card bill is all paid up before attempting to dine here.   There is some sticker shock.   But I guarantee you it's well worth the expense."}
{"text":"Unbelievably excellent sushi. Two of us ate for $156 (no alcohol and a freebie Yellowtail & Jalapeno) and needed a midnight snack.   The top of the line Toro Oh is incredible. Two pieces of sushi for $38. We saw a homeless guy on Swenton and Paradise 3 minutes before we were seated. I felt guilty about this indulgence for about .3 seconds.   Black cod lettuce wraps and Japanese snapper/Miso were the hits. No misses.  Make a reservation!! And don't gamble at the Hard Rock, worst odds on or near the Strip."}
{"text":"If you have $300 to splurge on food, the $280 Nobu Teppan-Yaki should be on your list. From the Shishito appetizer (jalapeno pepper), Toro Tartare, Japanese Scallop with Uni, to the Teppan Style Foie Gras, Japanese A5 Wagyu beef, and the Foie Miso Cappuccino, everything sounded exquisite and tasted even more so."}
{"text":"Overpriced, average sushi, waiter was nice.   Maybe it's just all Vegas can offer sushi wise, if that's the case burgers will do just fine and save the extra money for the tables."}
{"text":"Food: 10/10  Where do I begin on the food here ... I'll try my best to put what I've had into words. I'm rarely at a loss of words when it comes to food... Their menu is designed so you go light to heavy, cold to hot. Each dish, including their sashimi based dishes are a complex explosion of flavors that seems so simple, yet creates this complex enigma of flavor in your mouth. So we started off with assorted fishes prepared in different ways. All of their fish is VERY FRESH and flown in each day. If you're not quite sure on what to order like me, I recommend getting their pre-fixe menus and than swapping things out a-la-carte. Some of the more unique things i had is their fried sticky rice balls. We asked for it along with our Wagyu beef at the end and it was a great pairing as the rice balanced out the sodium of the beef. Their Wagyu Beef (at $30+ an oz.) is simply put, breathtaking. The first bites was one of those rare moments where our group was silent, everyone enjoying a piece of it. Their beef is finished off infront of you with flaming river stones. No that wasn't a typo, they're flaming river stones (check my video if you don't believe me). If you wanted it more then medium rare, it was recommended you leave it on a little bit longer. When they charge you $30+ an oz on beef, you gotta be a little skeptical but the balance of fat, meat, flavor and juice in this beef was just definitely worth it. I recommend everyone trying at least one piece per person! We had around 10 dishes for 6 people so we were a bit full for dessert so can't speak much on that, but the food here at Nobu is definitely worth it! Service: 9/10  I don't usually give service a high rating because my expectations change with each establishment I visit so I don't think it's fair to put them all on the same scale. But here at Nobu, the service, even for a high-level restaurant, was outstanding. Their servers act like an encyclopaedia between you and the chef, explaining the menu and each dish with great detail. They're extremely knowledgable with each dish from describing how the flavors are supposed to mix and how the dish should be best enjoyed to where their ingredients come from and exactly what you're getting. The service here is, simply put, beyond expectations. Overall: 10/10 Additional Notes: Definitely worth coming here! They have nice private booths/tables if you require as well as some Hibachi tables (but from what I can tell, no one does Hibachi anymore). When you come here, be prepared to leave with your stomach enlightened and your wallet lightened."}
{"text":"In a way, it's a disappointment that I'm not giving five stars.  Nobu is a name with weight. It stands for a world-renowned chef and a decorated series of restaurants, many of which have earned Michelin stars. This one in particular has none, although that may be due to unfortunate circumstances, namely the lack of Michelin stars for years now in Las Vegas. Regardless, you can't help but want to try this Peruvian-Japanese cuisine for yourself, and you should.  We went to Nobu in Caesar's Palace to celebrate a friend's birthday. We waited an hour to get seated, we waited a bit too long to receive a menu, and we spent more time while trying to figure out what we wanted to get from the expensive menu. Let's be honest - this isn't a place that you try every day, but price is still a factor.  Our server was helpful in explaining the menu, highlighting menu favorites, and mentioning seasonal items and specials. I would have preferred more writing, but I understand that availability of fish can change often. Anyway, he said he could help work out a menu for us with the chef if we told him what sorts of fish and such that we wanted to eat, and he espoused the virtues of the omakase menus, but after a while we decided just to order and share specific menu items. Others may find that service useful.  Cold items and sushi were presented first, then hot items. And yes, I include prices in my reviews, so deal with it:  Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño ($29): this is a really good dish that's not executed wisely. We were instructed to eat a small bit of cilantro with each of the six slices of hamachi, in addition to the jalapeño. See, the thing about piling all the cilantro in the middle is that one person grabbed a little too much cilantro for one piece of fish, which ended up depriving other pieces. This means that because they didn't give extra pieces of a very cheap herb, they prevented the dish from being consistent.  Uni nigiri ($10/pc): some of the best Santa Barbara uni that I've had. Has the essence of the sea, but not in an overpowering way. Sweet. If you haven't had good uni, you haven't lived, so you might as well try it here if you're already gonna be here.  New Style Sashimi - scallop ($35): yeah, I don't quite understand this. The soy sauce, oils, chives, sesame seeds, and ginger were interesting components, but I wouldn't miss those flavors. Plus, the scallop felt like it was sliced too thinly. Maybe I should have gone with the beef?  Soft shell crab cut roll ($20): our server did warn us about this, or rather the entire sushi menu. He said that it wouldn't be anything special compared to other places, and that he always recommends that his guests order off the cold and hot menus. He was right in this case. It was good, but it wasn't worth it when you can get something similar at AYCE sushi places.  Black cod miso ($36): regarded as Chef Nobu's signature dish, this is certainly the best rendition of the dish that I've enjoyed. Incredibly tender cod with sweet flavor, some of which is provided by the sauce that I still can't pinpoint flavor-wise. Regardless, this is definitely my favorite of the night and a must-order.  Squid \"pasta\" with light garlic ($27): squid cut to resemble pasta. I was disappointed initially with the relatively small portion of tender and tasty squid, but thinking back, I'm sure the price would have to be significantly higher to have the right squid ratio. However, the dish grew on me as I kept at it. The vegetables were all executed perfectly, from zucchini to snap peas to the shiitake mushrooms. Strangely, the veggies remind me of kebabs that I've had. In a great way. I'd say that even though my expectations weren't met, I was pleased overall.  Rock shrimp tempura, spicy creamy style ($26): I don't know about this one. It was good, but it wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped. The spicy creamy variant was described as the most popular preparation style by far (as opposed to butter ponzu or jalapeño), but I would have hoped for shrimp that was a little more firm. Maybe you can't do that with this shrimp, but this veers a little too closely to feeling mushy to me. That, and the flavor just isn't extravagant or complex and reminds you of versions of shrimp that are much cheaper.  Flourless bento box ($15): it was a very good chocolate lava cake (with white chocolate and shiso syrup). As expected, I did enjoy the blueberry and the piece of starfruit that I was able to taste, but I would've liked more blackberries and a more prominent role for the matcha ice cream. The ice cream definitely took a back seat to the powerful dark chocolate.  I enjoyed everything, so of course I'm going to go with at least four stars - but no higher, I am certain that you can get better food at a better value elsewhere. For example, there are comparable, even superior cold dishes at Yonaka Modern Japanese just a few miles away. Make Nobu a one-time visit or a special occasion meal, and get the black cod miso."}
{"text":"The meticulousness of every detail was well felt! The goal was to pass on an experience and that's where Nobo was 100 percent successful. Saying that we enjoy our meal would be an understatement. We sat by the sushi bar and took the delicious tasting menu meal at $ 125. This was one of the best meals I ate and their greatest success was that even though the restaurant was full we felt like we were the only guests. It was a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"Nobu is like \"heaven on Earth and sex on a plate....\" (courtesy of Kate Winslet)  I came here on New Year's Eve 2012 with a group of friends some of whom had never eaten sushi before so to not only give them a little taste of everything and make the MOST of our dining experience at the world renowned Nobu, we decided to order Omekase style!  With only a few fish restrictions and about an $75 per person limit, we let the chef whisk us away to a culinary destination, from which even my non sushi eating friends would want to return!  Now...I hope what I'm about to say doesn't shoot holes in my credibility but....it was New Year's Eve...and I had quite a few drinks at the hotel and a couple shots of cold Sake so I can't remember the names of ALL the dishes we had (about 10), but every single one of them was heavenly. HEAVEN....wait for it....LYYYYYY!!!  The ones I remember are:  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno Black Cod With Miso (I'd sell my kidney for a lifetime supply) Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spice Sauce Kobe Beef Tenderloin with Okinawa Potatoes White Fish Usuzukuri Jidori Free Range Chicken  The service was really tremendous, with multiple people waiting on us hand and foot, clearing dishes, serving our next dishes promptly with almost very little wait time in between without making us feel rushed!  5 stars for food. 5 stars for ambiance. 5 stars for service.   All around, BEST sushi experience I've had HANDS DOWN!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food and drinks! We just gave the server our desired price point and certain dishes that we liked, and they made the menu for us. Everything came out delicious! Some of the things we ended up getting were the hamachi sashimi, salmon sashimi, hot rock beef, hamachi kama, black cod miso in lettuce wraps, rock shrimp, and a couple of rolls. I think there were some other things, but I can't remember. This was for about $50 p/p. We also had a hard stop point because we were going to a show after, and they timed dinner perfectly!"}
{"text":"I love Vegas and I love sushi. And this is the perfect place for both. Inside the awesome Hard Rock Hotel, Nobu is amazing on all fronts: food, service, atmosphere - maybe not price, but just deal, it's VEGAS!  The drinks are tasty and the food amazing. Try the avocado tempura (YES), the shrimp tempura roll, the unagi sashimi, rock shrimp tempura (AWESOME), and the black cod miso (out of this world), thanks to our amazing waiter we also tried the tacos (i know) and they were mouth watering. I wish we ordered more of those! The waiter hooked it up for an amazing meal.  Thanks Vegas, you never disappoint."}
{"text":"Good restaurant overall. Kind of stuffy, with a pompous staff. The food and drink were decent, but massively overpriced. I guess it's to be expected in Vegas with the Nobu name, but I wasn't very impressed."}
{"text":"Interesting and modern decor, server was extremely knowledgeable and serious about the menu.  I had no idea what to order so I ordered vegetable and shrimp tempura for $35. I did not think it was anything special -just breaded and fried veggies and shrimp. The shrimp, however, were very large and meaty. I was with five others and they ordered multiple dishes and a few drinks. The dishes come out very small. There are no sides. Those I was with said their food was \"amazing.\" Our bill was $1,000.00 with gratuity. Very pricey considering how little you get, but if you're looking for quality over quantity, you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Loved the food, service and experience!!! Will definitely return! Shane (our server) was incredible and helpful! We had the spicy edamame, shishito peppers, yellowtail sashimi w jalapeño and a roll. All so amazing! The fish is fresh and honestly melts in your mouth!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nobu a lot, since I was a teenager and I've always loved this restaurant. It's my favorite sushi restaurant in town. My favorite roll in the entire world is here and it's the tuna & scallion, try it, it's so simple and utter perfection. Also try everything off menu, those are my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"I needed to update my review (still 5/5 stars for this LV location) because the must-try dishes when dining at Nobu include: 1. Premium Imported Japanese Wagyu A5 $38 per ounce & make sure to get it on the stones set on fire w/ Courvoisier (we typically have a party of 6-8 ppl so we order 12-16 ounces) but this is so worth it if you don't live in or near Japan 2. Black Cod Miso Lettuce Cups (the cod w/o lettuce cups is good too) 3. Yellowtail Sashimi w/ jalapeno  4. Salmon Sashimi 5. Hamachi Kama - baked 6. Variety of Oysters (allow them to surprise you w/ the diff. toppings they offer. Very fun!)  7. Wagyu sashimi  If you don't order these dishes, (at the very least the top 3-4 listed) you're doing Nobu all wrong. And now that I've had the opportunity to dine at the famous Jiro's Sushi (3 Michelin stars) in Japan, I can still say that I love Nobu Las Vegas. I keep stating LV location because I've tried 3 other Nobu locations that don't always hit the nail on the head in terms of presentation, taste, consistency in food & customer service.  I only have great things to say about the customer service at this location and the manager, Keenan, is the best. He's genuine, honest, & very personable. Each time I'm in town & dine here, he makes it a point to come say hello & make sure everything is perfect with my family & friend's dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner here. Menu is different to the restaurants in London but really excellent food and service.  Would recommend the lobster salad and also the grilled lobster. The fish and chips - lightly battered Chilean Sea Bass with fried vegetable chips was also excellent.   Quite pricey - $300 for two of us with no dessert and drinking only water but a great evening."}
{"text":"Love the vibes in here! You can come here dressed up or not.  Would recommend making reservations because they are usually full!   We ordered the omakase and it was delicious.  The waiter was so great in making sure we were doing well and that we knew what we were eating!   All the fish were so fresh but the beef was very very salty.   The best part of the lava chocolate cake with ice cream at the end. Best dessert ever!!"}
{"text":"Great Staff and Service.  However the price for the amount of food and quality is outrageous.  The taste was just average and I left hungry and broke. Save your money and go to Tao."}
{"text":"One of the BEST dining experiences I've ever had!  The food was absolutely amazing and the service was on point.  Everything was prepared flawlessly and perfectly prepared and presented with the right accoutrements. The hot sake was so smooth and delicious.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best experience ever!! They took care of ten of us, including two vegetarians, flawlessly. We were celebrating my good friend's bday. We decided to order a bunch of food and do community style. I got lucky to try multiple delicious dishes like  their lobster, ceviche, shrimp, yellow tail and some amazing vegetarian dishes that chef put together. Their sakes are pretty good too. Again, I got lucky to try many of them, and couldn't be happier. You won't go wrong w Nobu!!"}
{"text":"Service is not great, but the food keeps me coming back.  Splurge and get the chef's tasting menu.  Cool sleek decor."}
{"text":"We ate only vegetarian options and it was amazing. The field green salad was very refreshing with a soy based light dressing and the mushroom soup was also nice. I would have liked a little more flavor but it was a good start. The miso eggplant was amazing and the vegetable skewer with South American sauce was very flavorful with a nice kick. The oshinko sushi roll had an interesting spice in it and the vegetable roll had okra as well as other interesting spices. The rice was a bit firmer than I would have liked but the overall taste of the rolls were good. I had the black orchid tea and it was a good ending note for the night with some sweet notes."}
{"text":"Hang on to your wallet and your pallet.  We did the Omakase tasting at $125 each.  Add a few drinks and we end up at $436 btt. for two.  Victoria earned a full (well deserved) 20% for flawless service.  I tasted some things I never had before, and I liked it.  Ok that sounds like a Katy Perry song, but it is really true.  So here it comes....  Al says;  You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Located in what smells like sex and rock and roll Hard Rock Casino/Hotel, Nobu is an upscale Japanese restaurant. The decor is very nice, the dudes behind the counter making sushi and other Japanese dishes is cool to watch, and the huge bottle of saki is fun ( a bottle of house saki is around $150).  For around $150-300 (not including bar tab) per person you get family style eating of fresh Japanese food. There are approximately 7 courses brought out, one at a time, a delicious and fresh array.  The raw ahi with a dash of caviar, lettuce wraps, steak on the mini hibachi, etc., was fun to see what would arrive next. The service was impeccable, the place is clean (although I don't like that you have to exit the restaurant to use the restroom) and food quality excellent.  Personally, Japanese is not my favorite and $150/200 pp for me, is steep if I am not loving the food. If you enjoy fresh Japanese, then this place may be for you."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever.  Also most expensive sushi bill ever.  If you have the money, eat your heart out here...it's definitely worth it!  I sat at the bar and the chef I talked to was Japanese and lived in another part of Japan that I worked in too (similar situation as at Taka Sushi) and was super friendly.  I think I sat eating here non-stop for 3 hours haha."}
{"text":"Went here as a party of six.   Had the omakase $100 option. Yelpers were pretty accurate on dishes like the Black Cod Miso. Good, but a little sweet. This is definitely not the place for hand rolls and sashimi. Everything was presented well and at the end, I was kinda satisfied.   Only three stars for me because it cost me $150 after one beer and splitting some sake four ways. The food was kinda heavy, so I felt very bloated after. I also felt like having sushi the next day, so the only urge it satisfied, was the one to have a bougie dining experience. Too much hype. If you want a bougie meal to impress, this is the place. For an outstanding EATING experience, this is not it.     Glad I went. Not going back."}
{"text":"Hipster dining not worth it's salt. For the money there are better places in town.... IT'S VEGAS! Nevertheless.... a decent addition to an already overcrowded assortment of fusion cuisine."}
{"text":"Overall, the original Nobu (Hard Rock Hotel) is a great experience, both from an ambiance perspective and naturally, quality of food. (As an aside, the Caesar's Palace location is newer and busier but given that this is the original Vegas location, it appears more logical to start here if you have never experience Nobu before.)   Given that we were not famished, we asked the waitress to help us craft a light menu that still allowed us to experience Chef Matsuhisa. We started off with mocktails followed by Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño (which had just the right kick and freshness). Then we had the New Style Sashimi (Salmon), followed by Black Cod, and finally two sushi rolls, the soft shell crab and shrimp tempura. Overall, the dishes were varied, flavorful, and yet light.   We ended the night with recommended dessert - Sata Andagi - which I was admittedly unsure about upfront - however, after experiencing it, I was surprised I had never tried such an amazing dessert combination before. The Apricot Doughnut was one of the best desserts I've had and was perfectly complimented by white chocolate crumbs and the black tea ice cream.   Overall, the ambiance, vibe, and service was a great foundation for a memorable meal at the original Las Vegas Nobu. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"This place...... This place is just wonderful. There is nothing that I can write that could possibly tell you how much I love this restaurant. But as a Yelper, I must try. I literally had several dishes that could easily all be on my top favorite dishes in my life. The top being the first thing that I ate. The glorious Chilean Sea Bass! When you get it, you will look at it, then say WTF?! It's a salad with some fried tofu on top. Get that shit away. You would have made the biggest mistake of your life. This is such a succulent filling fish that has an out of this world taste that cannot be described other that sex on a fucking platter. They would just bring use sushi and sashimi. And literally no matter what they brought out was amazing. I thought I had already had the best sushi I could possibly have but I was wrong. They use spices that I have never had in my life and I love it. This has to be the next best thing next to having sushi in Japan. If Japan is better than this place I might not ever leave that country. As long as I could order this food in Japanese I could care less about anything else. After just typing that I realize it sounds like I'm a drug addict. I can easily see how this food is drug like. It is a completely euphoric experience. Yes, the decor is gorgeous and feels oh so luxurious but I could care less if this food came from a dumpster. IT IS THAT GOOD.   GO HERE BEFORE YOU DIE!!!! A FOODIES BUCKET LIST MUST!!  special notes: -excellent service -ok drinks"}
{"text":"OK....with hundreds of good, authentic sushi joints in Vegas, why wait in line and spend too much on this one.  Food is fine, but nothing special given the big rep this place has...."}
{"text":"Excellent! Go Omakase! And, ideally go for the \"Chef's Daily Creation\" for $225.00!!!  Food - I'd say go all out and do the Chef's Daily Creations for $225.00/pp. Yes, you'll pay more for than the Nobu Signature Omakase for just $125.00, but if you're truly an Omakase lover and you've got an empty belly to fill, you'll be happy you went all out! I've done the Nobu Signature before, so I wanted something different and the $225.00 menu did not disappoint. So many creative courses, and I had so much food that I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all, but I did, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience!!  Atmosphere - Beautiful, chic, and modern. Note, though, that it does get very busy as the evening progresses, so the noise level naturally escalates accordingly.  Service - I dined solo here, and received wonderful, attentive service. However, as the restaurant got busier the attentiveness slightly dropped as well.  Love this place, even more so than Nobu New York City."}
{"text":"Delicious. I don't think you can do it any better. I have eaten sushi and different types of Japanese food at so many places just like everyone else on here, but this is a whole different type of experience.  The place looks very nice, and the service is excellent. I'm no expert on Japanese food so there were a lot of things that I wasn't familiar with. The waiter was great at explaining everything.  I like to be adventurous from time to time with what I eat and so I ordered the chefs selection because it had so many things on it that I had never tried. Well it was excellent. Some of the flavors were a little strange, but I don't mean that in a bad way.  It definitely added to my life experience, and I am so glad that I tried this place. If you are ever able to go then you should go, it's worth it for sure."}
{"text":"Incredible food but getting a reservation around 7pm on a weekend was extremely difficult. The cost of the dishes are fairly expensive but everything in Vegas is fairly expensive. It's definitely worth a try if you can get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Considering it's located at the Hard Rock Hotel, the atmosphere was not as loud as the floor and the lighting was perfect with a modern decor.  Now to the food, since it was my first time there the server recommended I try their specialty dishes. Which I did and was floored by the flavors, started with the yellow tail sashimi with Jalapeño, to the black cod miso. Now I did stray from the servers recommendation and ordered the Chef's sashimi which was ehh. Next time I will certainly follow the servers recommendation and would recommend to stick to their signature dishes. What made up for the ok sashimi was dessert and there are many to choose from, I ended up going with the Vanilla Tapioca. Sake was a bit pricier than usual but well worth the money. Service was slow but perfect to enjoy a nice dinner and discuss the evening's events with your companion.  All in all, I would definitely return and try their Beef Wagyu Beef or other signature dishes. Note this is not a cheap dinner by any stretch and expect to spend at least 150 per person but well worth it for the atmosphere and the experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Service was good, sushi was sooo good and having great martinis on the menu doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"Troy, the waiter, was sublime.  The food was unparalleled, outstanding, but the service was the 5 stars here.  He suggested that we give him a budget and he would tailor a menu for us.  We did, and, wow, did he.  Troy was so excited about the food and the menu, and he brought that excitement to the table.  He was uber attentive, and the dishes he picked were exquisite.  A funny twist was that I told him I wanted the toro with oestra caviar,  and he told me that if I liked toro, I'd like the toro carpaccio dish more.  I took his word for it, and he started the personalized menu.  A few minutes later, we got the toro plate with the caviar.  I figured he decided to go with my original suggestion.  We started to indulge in it, and he came by and told us he was sorry, it was meant for another table.  So, he comped us the plate and still brought the carpaccio.  He most definitely did not have to do this as we had no idea what our \"menu\" consisted of, but he really wanted us to try the other dish.  That made all the difference in the world, and, by the way, the carpaccio was leaps and bounds better.   I could say so much more about the food, but it's almost a given at most of these celebrity chef establishments in Vegas.  It's almost always always fabulous food....it's staff like Troy that set them apart and keep us coming back for more.  See my pictures for a thorough rundown of the food we had.    Perfect night!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill and for the price, it is pretty scandalous.  Went here last Saturday night.  The restaurant wasn't even half full so apparently everyone else already got the memo not to come here anymore.  Sidenote:  I'd been here before as well as to two other Nobu locations, which is also part of the huge disappointment.  The sushi portions were tiny.  The rock shrimp was delicious, especially when eaten with the greens (although the server should have told the table to do this since it wasn't obvious to my group so I had to inform them).  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was a terrible presentation.  The yellowtail jalapeno sashimi was beautiful but boring.  Same for the tiny sushi portions we received.  Miso cod was still excellent.  But the price considering the portions is just offensive.  All in all, not a great experience and I expect so much more from Nobu.  Perhaps there's a reason we couldn't get into the Caesars location that night.  Bottom line:  don't come to this Nobu."}
{"text":"Love the service and the food is amazing! Would recommend this meal to anyone looking for a good seafood/ sushi dinner"}
{"text":"The most overrated and expensive place for the food. I mean the ambiance was nice and great servers, but nah I wouldn't come back. The group all picked the $125 prefix menu and it was a total disappointment. When asked about the sashimi type, it was just your basic salmon, hamachi. I was like damn, but didn't want to upgrade.  There was like 6 dishes or so. The beef dish was super dry, tasted like bad flank steak. The sashimi dishes were good, but it was the sauces that did it. OMG the chocolate moose/cake with green tea was the worst dessert for a high end restaurant. The monkish pate with caviar was good and different. We were still hungry, therefore, ordered two rounds of uni and amaebi. Crap, it was like $10 a piece!~~ Oh the sake and soju, way over priced!!!  I think for 7 people, the bill was like $1500"}
{"text":"I still think about the miso glazed cod, day and night...   it was love at first bite.  Our amazing dinner was planned by a girl who knows one of the chefs at Nobu.  So in addition to the delicious food, we got a fat discount as well, making the experience all the more lovely.  The first 3 courses were top notch sashimi--- hamachi, albocore, salmon and bonito.  Needless to say, every bite was heavenly.  The dinner then progressed with the legendary miso cod (orgasmic), a whole fish deep fried and drizzled in cream (quite a presentation at the table), sauteed mushrooms, and a platter of sushi.  Every dish wowed me.  Then came the finale: The dessert plate.  White chocolate cigars (white chocolate wrapped in wonton skin and deep fried), coconut sorbet, dark chocolate warm cake (and more yummy sweets I can't remember now)...     It was so decadent and satisfying and absolutely Vegas."}
{"text":"Just got back from another great Vegas weekend. Though I have been to Nobu here many times, I have never given them a review. Long overdue. The good news is that with the opening of the \"new\" place at Ceasars, the Hard Rock location is very easy to get a table now (Hope they stay here ;) ) The service is always top notch. The food still retains a very high quality. My favs did not dissapoint, the Spicy Rock Shrimp tempura, The Yellowtail with jalapeno and the Black Miso Cod were perfection. Can't wait for my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Wayyy over priced and ok food. Close to the shows at Linq and Cesar's palace, nice ambience, but goodness the food is too expensive for what it is. I feel like I'd be missing out if I don't finish all the scallions in my soup.  Service needs to improve big time. A skinny lady at the bar was our server, she never greeted us or offered us the menu for at least 20 min after we sat down, and it was impossible to get her attention. She would turn around and talk to someone else when we were still talking to her without acknowledging or even eye contact. For a $200+ dinner bill for two, I expect better."}
{"text":"Food was right on point!  Awesome customer service... Probably the best server, Jeff,  we've ever had."}
{"text":"Nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. My wife and I aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...I understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, IMO.  We went on a Sunday night at 7:30p. We were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. My wife had the Passion Mojito, and I stuck with a Sapporo because I'm not a huge fan of sake. The drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the Omakase.  There are two basic \"levels\" of Omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. The lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". We both opted for the latter. I was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so I likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes.   - Kumamoto Oyster, on the half-shell, with Nobu Salsa - Sweet Shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head) - Some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, I'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings) All three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, I think, ponzu sauce. The oyster was pretty large, such that I didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. The sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what I'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than I would expect, but still very good.  - Kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom  Kampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. The kelp and mushroom, I think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later.   - New-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side They have a really good sauce for the uni, because I don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) The unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.  - Toro salad with vegetable spring roll I wasn't crazy about the spring roll...I thought it was bland. The toro salad, however, was very good.  - Green tea & Ume sorbet I guess this was a palate cleanser? I wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. After the server brought it out, I told my wife, \"Thank you for dining at Nobu, please come back soon.\" Anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.  - Broiled snapper over risotto with snow crab meat, topped with a white truffle chip  The hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. The risotto was OK, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.  - Small, sliced, grilled \"Kobe\" beef tenderloin with Okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled Japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled foie gras. I'm going to commit heresy in a bit...I put Kobe in quotes, because I hear a bunch of stories about whether or not Kobe is Kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. Great dish. I don't really like eggplant, but this was OK, so they did something right. I'd never had foie gras before, and, well, meh? There, I said it.  - Miso soup with clam Another break, like the sorbet. It wasn't bad or anything, but I was getting kinda full, so I almost skipped it. (almost).  - Nigiri sampler: Oh Toro, pink snapper, sardine, snow crab, jumbo clam The clam was fresh and crunchy, but the snow crab was pretty ordinary. This was only the second time I've had sardine nigiri. I like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, I think it's just too oily? I couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. My wife told me the Oh Toro was awful and that I should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. I love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) Try the Oh Toro.  - Blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries. Full. I almost had to pass on dessert (almost). Again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well.   The service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. Our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.  If you're a fan of this type of Japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in Vegas, so live a little!"}
{"text":"Black Cod Miso, Black Cod Miso, Black Cod Miso that is all you really need to know. We also had yellowtail shashimi with jalapenos which was very good as well. However, nothing touches the Black Cod Miso. Cons - The place is very loud. Hard Rock Hotel is the loudest hotel/casino in all of Vegas so it is a bit of a given that a place inside would be loud as well. The staff is a bit ridiculous but we just chalked it up to that being part of the show. The staff will try and strong arm you into letting them order for you. Just stand your ground and go for what you want. Also, they will offer you an $11 bottle of Fiji water right off the bat. Smile and refuse and get some free tap water instead. Pros - have I mentioned the Black Cod Miso? The best thing I have ever had pass my lips. The people watching is top notch really every meal on a Vegas vacation should be a dinner and a show. The show at Nobu is one of the best. With the spouse swapping to my left and the wrestling over who picked up the check to my 1 o'clock (no kidding a half nelson and a headlock/nuggie was used) I was laughing a majority of the time. Some people should not have saki. The food is the main reason this place rocks as, it should be. Everything else is just a distraction."}
{"text":"Extremely good food.  We were taken here as guest and were treated to dine in a way where we sat and enjoyed the food that was selected for us.   By asking some simple questions regarding likes and dislikes, dishes came out selected for us not only looked artful but we were treated to a fantastic assortment of flavors.  If you are willing to pay the money and allow the chef to select your dishes, I would recommend to dine this way.  The enjoyment of good company and great food is the only way to go."}
{"text":"We celebrated by sisters birthday there and it was amazing! It was an experience, the flavors and Rich. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nobu twice now and each time was phenomenal. I don't normally eat seafood but love everything I've had here. The second time, the server chose our menu and everything was great! The yellow fin tuna sashimi and crab tempura are amazing. Unfortunately the portions are very small and the prices are very high but the taste makes up for it. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"There's nothing special about Nobu.  They have multiples locations. This place is for novice sushi lover."}
{"text":"The only five star of this restaurant is the service, but the management was sub par at the most. We have a reservation for 7:30 and we were sitting at 8:45. The food  was good but not great as one would expect from a place  with these prices. The local has good decoration, but they might do something with the acoustic, the place was really loud."}
{"text":"Go for the Groupon deal! $100 for a $160 value tasting menu. We were able to purchase the same deal for $85 since Groupon was running a special. Superb service. Everyone was extremely knowledgeable with its dishes and ingredients. Yes, they are a little on the price side, but one taste of the fish you will understand why it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I spent $1000 for six people.  I took clients here when i was in town for business, and one of my clients wanted to go.   I wanted to hate it, being so trendy and all, but the fact is...I loved it!  My partners wife knew one of the chefs cousin who works in Los Angeles,  and he came out to greet the table.  He asked what we were looking for and we told him...just give us your best \"Omakase\" style meal.  I don't know if the fact that we knew his cousin influenced the food or not but the whole experience was awesome.    Just a few of the memorable items were:  1. Shishito peppers, fried and delicious- I had never even heard of these before...where have I been. 2. a plethora of Sashimi plates with various spices and sauces, especially the red snapper. 3. Kobe beef on hot rocks, beef is served raw on sizzling rocks and you cook it yourself at your table.  When I go for sushi, I usually go alone or with one other person.  I sit at the bar and make sure the chef serves me what he recommends.  I don't want sauces,  I want perfect fish.  Normally I don't go for this fusion stuff.    I have to say the fish was great and the fusion was a nice change of pace.  I do live near Malibu, and I have never been to the Malibu Nobu.  Maybe I will give it a try.    It was definitely  a fun and tasty night!"}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food. I found the food good and the service good but its ridiculously expensive and frankly not worth the cost. Frankly I can find sushi just as good in other less expensive Japanese restaurants for a fraction of  cost for the same thing."}
{"text":"I am ok with expensive sushi. I am not ok with insanely priced sushi that is priced by the piece (that is, one not two pieces when you order at the sushi bar) and comes with unimpressive service. They brought the hand towels mid way through our meal, did not remove used plates, overcharged us on our bill, and gave us attitude at no extra charge. Six pieces of not amazing sushi and two tiny beers cost $99. Just not worth it!"}
{"text":"I must say, best meal we have enjoyed in the entire year (and we have been to Nobu in Caesars Palace twice this year). Fantastic service by our server, Keenan, who shined throughout the service/ with his great personality and vast knowledge of the menu, he is what every gourmet server should aspire to be. The food- perfect in every way. We enjoyed a chef's tasting, which was timed perfectly and with no hickups whatsoever. Beautiful and carefully thought out presentations on each course. There is no doubt that Nobu at Hard Rock is the restaurant to go to if you want a personal experience. I hope the management see's this, as the wait staff was ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS, and I cannot stress that enough. It's the little things that truly count; communication, great timing, menu knowledge, personality, table setting, and genuine care for the guest. A great night with passionate food and good company! Cheers and happy eating!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first dining experience at Nobu.  We showed up early, so while we were waiting for our table we went to the bar to grab a cocktail. Mid sip the hostess let us know that our table was ready and before I could ask she told me she'd take care of the drink transfer so that we didn't have to close out with the bartender.  This service I love!  We sat down in a cozy table towards the front of the restaurant.  Promptly after being sat our server, Heather, came over and introduced herself and walked us through the menu, both food and drinks.  We decided on a \"custom\" Omakase.  Heather was so passionate and excited about the menu, I had to let her pick for me.  We tried 4 different types of sake based on her recommendation. Heather did an amazing job picking out a variety of dishes and then pairing them with our sake choices.  She's so genuine and grateful to serve you and definitely made my experience memorable.  I'll gladly revisit because of her."}
{"text":"Out of this world. One of my favorite places across the country. Chef's selection is the only way to go. Bring your wallet (or two) but a phenomenal experience nonetheless.   Great service, sake, and surprise dishes."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had, and here's the kicker: it was vegan. I came here for my birthday, and when we told the waiter that I'm vegan, he had the chef create custom dishes just for us. They just kept bringing them out til we were full. The service was fantastic and they really made me feel special.  Also, I haven't been able to get the Acai Jalapeno Martini off my mind. IT WAS SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Back again. This time celebrating our 44th wedding anniversary.   Again seated immediately at our 6:30 dinner reservation. An intimate table as requested. Wow I love this place.   We ordered the same as in 2015. This time I had a Manhattan and it was expertly prepared.   This place is a winner.   Highly recommend.   After dinner intend on going to the Monticristo Cigar Bar to smoke my Cuban mini Romeo & Juliet!  Viva Las Vegas"}
{"text":"the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.  there were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.  there's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  So use your imagination..  course 1 - a bonito sashimi. course 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes. course 3 - toro sashimi with ponzu ginger sauce and jalapeno sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap. course 4 - seared scallops on a bed of sea beans. course 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried foie gras. course 6 - sushi set (nigiri) with lobster broth and lobster chunks.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (red snapper) and tamago. course 7 - an array of sweets including mochi ice cream, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.  ..  all in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.    i was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like LA, SF, NY, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.  i truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am TOTALLY infatuated with bone marrow.  ..  i've said too much.    i am off to eat.  EDIT:  i don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.  *shrugs*"}
{"text":"This is Nobu. What else can I say? This was one of the very first REAL fine-dining establishments I visited when I first arrived in Las Vegas. You can't even imagine. At Nobu, I first tried tiradito, shishito peppers, edamame, hot sake... the list goes on. Gourmand I was not. Enter Nobu, one of the best dining experiences i've had to date in this city.  Everything is great, obviously all of the sashimi, ceviche, tiradito, everything is sublime. I mean, Nobu Matsuhisa invented miso black cod, hello!  I will say this, it is mighty expensive. And you kind of have to accept that you won't leave here full. Or at least, I never have. I am no high roller. But believe me, it is all worth it."}
{"text":"When you have such a memorable and satisfying experience, it's almost irrelavant to highlight every positive detail. The food, the service and total ambiance blend as a singular experience. At Nobu, we had a wonderful time. The waiter indulged us with the house specialties. It was the best dining experience I had while in Vegas."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" pretty much sums it up in an as not-snobby way as possible, though it's Yelp and \"meh\" reviews of triple cash money places ALWAYS sound snobby, so... well... shit.  This restaurant is ENORMOUS and thus is pretty cavernous on a weekday night at 9pm, which is when we went. As a two-top we were made to wait for 20 minutes at the bar for a lounge table even though the lounge area was only half full and the table at which we were eventually seated was open when we walked in. Meh.  We ordered the omakase (125 bones for the \"Chef's Selection\" version - there's a longer tasting menu for 175). The first four courses were all sashimi salads. In order: tuna with yuzu soy sauce, seared salmon belly with miso crumble and yuzu soy sauce, hamachi with cilantro, jalapeno and yuzu citrus glaze, sea bass with miso, crispy garlic and yuzu olive oil. ALL YUZU EVERYTHING. The fish was very high quality, but by the fourth course I think my citrus taste buds had punched in their overtime and gone home. Meh.  A waiter then brought us a fine-looking plate of tuna sashimi, which our server had to unceremoniously repossess a few minutes later, as it was not part of the omakase and delivered by mistake. We were told that a sushi plate was to follow later. Meh.  The fifth and sixth courses were the Nobu signature miso-glazed sea bass with grilled asparagus, which was excellent, and a definitely not-medium-rare steak teppanyaki with enoki mushrooms, which was just okay - \"meh\" if you will.   The seventh course was puzzling, a bowl of jalapeno-mayonnaise glazed rock shrimp that appeared like an appetizer pulling up fashionably late to the meal progression. We didn't finish it.  The promised sushi plate arrived as the eighth course, in the form of spicy tuna rolls. MEEEHHH.  Fortunately the dessert was great. Flourless molten chocolate cake, fresh fruit and four flavors of mochi ice cream. It was uniformly awesome.  250 for dinner for two before tax, tip and drinks is not outlandish in Vegas but no one could or should call you snobby for expecting more out of a restaurant that looks this impressive and bears the Nobu brand name.  #meh"}
{"text":"Nobu, Nobu, you truly failed me.  I really love your sushi. I do. I come here every time I come in Vegas. And this time, when I had my S.O., you failed me. Sigh.  We ordered Miso (normal), Salmon glazed in miso (OK, but not the special, wonderful dish I'm used to), and a mixed sushi platter.  The rice was too sticky, the nigiri were on the point of self-destruction, and the fish was \"good\", but not excellent.  And boy, Nobu, for your prices, I expect EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Came here on a business trip with a group of 15. Best Japanese cuisine in Vegas for sure! We had the family style pre selected menu, and had more than ten different small plates. It was mostly cold raw fish (yellowtail, salmon, etc.) plus a couple hot small plates (bass, beef, etc.). Every one of them was truly amazing!! Service was exceptional. We paid about $200/person including a drink. It was pricey but man it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Truly epic. Service was outlandish. Food was even better. George, the manager, was there to make us feel like VIP's.  Literally - best sushi I have  ever had and I'm picky. Bar none, the best oysters I've ever had, tuna, yellowfin belly, you name it... they asked us what we wanted, and they brought out what we had never dreamed of."}
{"text":"yellow tail sashimi with jalapenos= out of this world  The reason why I am giving it a 3 star instead of 5 is because I've been to the Malibu location for Nobu and it is a lot better. Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to walk through the casino, through the nasty drunken guys who whistle and harrass you, just so you can go to the bathroom, it makes it hard to enjoy your cocktail during dinner when you know if you gotta go, you'd have to make a journey to find the restroom, and once you're there, there's a huge line full of drunk girls waiting to use the restroom as well. I would think for such a high scale restaurant, that there would at least be a bathroom inside.   Other than that.. the food's amazing, the bloodymary was delicious, the sangria was good too! The service is acceptable for the price you are paying for, and it's great because they expanded the place, so there is rarely a wait to be seated. p.s. the dessert is presented really pretty thaty you don't want to ruin it by eating it lol"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was amazing. Everything they brought us was good. And they brought us ALOT so I feel like I sampled the entire menu. Our server Kim was so nice great. We told her what we were in the mood for and she brought us the perfect dishes. Why I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars... The decor and the price. Very simple in design and I wasn't quite convinced that the food (even with the amazing service) was worth the price. Still Nobu is a must try! I would definitely go back again... just maybe on someone else's dime next time. ;)"}
{"text":"I came here a few days before New Years to celebrate.   Food: Overall pretty good, but not worth the price.  Sushi is quite good, but in my opinion isn't worth the price. Nothing is wrong with it, but they charge several dollars for each piece as opposed to roll. You can go to other places and have similar quality sushi at a fraction of cost. Unfortunately I can't recommend the rock shrimp tempura with creamy sauce. It looks better than the actual taste. It lacked flavor.   Drinks: There was an old fashioned here that was incredible! It wasn't the one I can't remember the full name, but it was like \"Applewood...\".  - It wasn't the  barrel aged kikori old fashion.  I typically don't drink old fashions but I definitely asked for another.  Lastly, I dont recommend the lychee martini.   Service - overall very good service. Waiters were respectful and prompt. However there was one waiter that was very weird and awkward. Maybe he had a bad night."}
{"text":"Our food and service was impeccable. We did the 5 Course tasting meal from Groupon. It started with edaname that was prepared perfectly. Then came a red snapper appetizer that was Devine. Next came an assortment of nigiri: salmon, scallop, tuna, and tuna with jalapenos, it was fabulous. Next came the Rock shrimp calamari. It was excellent. Next was the trout and very flavorful. Finally for dessert came the Bento box. Our server  Natasha and her helpers did a fantastic job. Great meal."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I think Nobu Vegas stands out as the best Nobu venue in the U.S. I've done the Omakatse menu (degustation) several times, and each time, it has been almost totally different, with each course being innovative, surprising, and most importantly, delicious. While Kobe beef may be hard to mess up (though certainly not impossible :P), Nobu delivers it perfectly in several different preparations. From tartar, to seared fillet, to wok fried, it's always decadent and flavorful. The sushi is ridiculously fresh and well presented, as are the salads and desserts. The staff does just an amazing job describing every ingredient in every course in great detail, explaining where everything is grown, what flavors it's chosen for, and it's history. Simply amazing.   Their Sake list is diverse and excellent, and Nobu has the best cold Sakes I've ever had. I've had the chance to have some blind horizontal tastings, and Yk-35 always wound up as being my favorite."}
{"text":"KOBE!! Forget the prices and get your wallet ready to be emptied but I promise you just won't care about the cost. Nobu is delightful and full of experiences for your pallet from start to finish. All I can say about the food is OMG! I've never had such an experience with food and saki before."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite spots in Vegas. The food is amazing. Not a huge fan of fusion but Nobu does it well. If you've never been, inform the wait staff and just them handle the ordering for you. You can give them a price point per person and any food that you don't eat then they'll make some great selections for you.  A lot of times I just stick to their sushi menu but thanks to the wait staff the last time I tried all kinds of stuff including the Wagyu beef and black cod which were amazing. I've had just about all of the Nobu style tacos which I highly recommend. To truly experience Nobu, order Omakase style which is about $150/person."}
{"text":"Came here for a light dinner one evening!    Started it off with some drinks.  Then we ordered the Wagyu tacos!  These were the smallest tacos I have seen in my life!  The Wagyu beef was so decadent that it melted in my mouth!  I could have eaten another 5 of these!  Then we ordered the famous Nobu Black Cod!  I've cooked this before and tonight it came out just perfect!  (By the way you can find many recipes online and you can do it yourself at home with excellent results!)  The we had the big eye tuna which came with a nice thin slice of jalapeño!    Overall ambiance very chic!    Food was good but nothing that blew my mind!  Very expensive and I'm glad I had the opportunity but would not return as there are so many other places to try for the price in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've ever have had. If you are looking to try something new you will not be disappointed. The food and service is amazing. It was worth every penny. I will defiantly be going back the next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Like all 5 star dining this place never disappoints, although I enjoy the nobu @ hard rock maybe because it's a smaller i don't know.  I came here with family from out of town they wanted to have a Vegas dining experience.  We started with Kumamoto oysters house style they were lightly sweet and crisp make sure to eat the small grape/Japanese  peach to cleanse the plate you'll wish you had more than one, mixed seafood ceviche was great nice and tangy, their yellow tail with jalapeño which never disappoints next the tuna and lobster tacos always a good choice, black miso cod is my all time favorite I have to order it every time I go, toban yaki style wagyu, and to top it off we got the Fiji water shaved ice which was basically like halo halo if you don't know what that is GTS."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I have really good sushi I forget what REALLY TRULY ABSOLUTELY THE MOST AMAZINGLY FREAKEN  PHENOMENAL sushi tastes like. Then, I go to Nobu and get schooled on the magic of their fish. It took me many years to actually try sushi and though my mom may disown me for actually saying this but I might actually consider this for my last meal on earth over her chicken mole. That's saying a lot coming from a beaner like me.  Damn, my mouth waters and my palms sweat just thinking about the yellowtaill sashimi with jalapeno and the rock shrimp in the spicy sauce. These withdrawls are worse that crack..."}
{"text":"Nobu is always a delight. Food was amazing,  and so was service. We had the best table, great view of the night life,  and surprisingly fantastic drinks. We didnt care to look at the menu, gambled by kindly asking the chef to pick his favorite dishes - & they were nothing less than delicious. We had such a variety,  and all tastings (sweet, sour, spicy)..... were perfectly, deliciousness !  Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Probably the best japanese restaurant I've been to. Sushi was top notch, all the chefs are Japanese which is a good sign. The umami seabass was amazing. Super pricey"}
{"text":"I love sushi, so obviously I am a fan of Nobu's. The fish is always so fresh and delicious. My favorite is the yellowtail with the jalapenos.  We came here for a friend's birthday. The experience was good. The bad thing was the location of our table. There was a large table with a birthday right behind us, and they were all standing around like it was a night club for at least 45 minutes. My chair got bumped several times, until I was finally so irritated, I was ready to leave.  The ice cream things with the rice paper are amazing (sorry, forgot what they are called!). Oh, and try the lobster ceviche - YUM!  This place is very expensive, so be prepared for the sticker shock."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as CES ritual. One star hands down is for their sushi menu and how nasty the quality and taste of their fish. It was so gross and after all these years, I continue hearing friends' upset and raging experience how bad their quality of all the fish is. I always forgot to remind my friends not to order anything fish related at this restaurant. And yes, they will sell you a $200 bottle of sake that tastes like water !   Four star for their teppanyaki and wagyu beef. It was a bummer that they refused to give us two seats at teppanyaki table even though I had reservation from few weeks back. I was craving for wagyu beef and been waiting all day for this meal. They said they could serve it at table too. We ordered it flamed style as that's pretty much the only decent option they offered, it was $38 an ounce vs what it says on their online menu $26 which is probably for non-ces days. We ordered 8 ounces and was very delish!! We ordered foie gras which they billed you $50 for an order. Yes it's Vegas and its Nobu that's known for the rip-off. While our server tried selling me caviar, I went for it but he was nice enough to repeat our order with price, and the small jar of three tea spoons full of sturgeon caviar cost $350!!!! I repeated myself to him 3 times and totally sounded silly. Of course I cancelled it !   Nobu is a place that is very tricky for their food and price. They raised menu price up 2x during ces or convention to balance out the business in slow season, and companies have the money to spend anyway! If you had loads of cash to spend, DO NOT ever order fish related item at this place, that said, don't even look at caviar either. Always go for cooked items such as miso black cod, beef items and so, to make the most of your meal!  They do have good selection of whiskey such as Japanese Yamazaki, Hibiki and Hakushu (not avail in the US) with reasonable price which means it's not doubled than their value . This is the reason that got me to give 3-star instead of 2!"}
{"text":"This food was so good that I literally didn't want to swallow, just wanted to keep chewing ! Highly recommend Wagyu beef tacos, rock shrimp, shaved ice, black miso cod. Also had amazingly fresh sushi"}
{"text":"Food was good but definitely over hyped and not in line with prices.  Black cod was great though."}
{"text":"Do you like big checks and hype...then this is the place for you. I have heard tons of great things about this restaurant but at the end of dinner I was really let down.   Things I liked:  Rock Shrimp Tempura with creamy spicy sauce  Miso Cod  Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno   Things I didn't like:  The waitress was not very friendly. She informed us that our sushi dishes would come out last...guess what?  The sushi came out second...of course, we ate the sushi and our waitress came up to our table and asked if we wanted more food...she had no idea that we didn't even get our warm food. Please dont  tell us our meal must end  with cold sushi and then the food runners can not even get it right. When you are paying this much for dinner, you expect to get treated with some love.   The sushi rolls were extremely fishy too. My friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all I know is that I wanted to gag.   Also we asked for two orders of the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and they put both orders on one plate. That is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? The math does not add up. My friends told me that they noticed that they have been shorted before. Wow and my friends still like this place...Oh yeah expense account!!!  Small Dishes with Big Prices!!!   If you are on an expense account then I recommend...go for it...run up the bill and try everything. If you are paying for it out of your pocket, then I would save my money for my kids college fund!!!"}
{"text":"Absurdly consistent.      This would be difficult for a restaurant with 10 tables, but when you factor in the massive size and scope of this multinational operation it's beyond impressive.    It hits all the right notes at exactly the right times.    The theatrics of the presentation.   The spectacular quality of the food.   The personable but professional staff.   The feng shui of spatial relationships on the walk to the restrooms.  Nikkei cuisine meets oxygenated casino floor.     Expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"Good sashimi. Boring sushi rolls. Everything was way overpriced... Were these magical fish flown first class from Japan? It tasted like any other sushi restaurant I've been to.   This was a double birthday dinner for my fiancé and me, which I told the hostess. But nothing happened... It wasn't a busy night.   No sense of value after experiencing this place. We were both hungry when we got back to our hotel room, and $275 poorer.   We ended up snacking on goldfish crackers after our dinner. Happy Birthday!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the years and have had very good meals, but my experience this week was mixed.     Food: 3.  We ordered the hamachi with jalapenos, miso glazed sea bass, grilled yellow tail collar, toro roll, grilled eggplant, and bento box dessert.   The hamachi was the best dish - fresh and flavorful.  The bass was a generous portion and had good flavor, but the texture was mushy (maybe not cooked enough?).  The yellow tail collar was cooked perfectly, but the skin was not scaled!  Disappointing that they overlooked something so simple.  The toro roll was very small - definitely not worth the cost.  The eggplant also had good flavor, but the sauce was too sweet.  The bento box was awesome, as usual.  Service: 4.  Our server was attentive and comp'd us for the dessert (we were celebrating a special occasion), but a bit aloof.  I asked what kind of salt was on the edamame, but the response was a flippant, \"sea salt.\"  Another server overheard the exchange and gave me the name of the brand on a piece of paper."}
{"text":"I have never had food this amazing before. WOW!! I got the signature dishes and it was worth every penny and more!! Everything was soooooo good."}
{"text":"I came back four years later and this place is still so good! So good that i went twice in one week which is very unusual for me especially with all the great places Vegas has to offer. The items that stuck out for me were the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (simple but omg all the flavors work so well together...and that sauce that it comes with is delicious), salmon belly,  black cod miso, Crispy rice with tuna, miso soup, and the Kronuts! And the service was absolutely impeccable!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I've always known about Nobu and how great it is from word of mouth/yelp reviews, but what actually brought me here was on a whim after listen to that Jump Man song. After giggling about how weird it is to sing NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU, we decided on a fly to make a reservation a few months out. Well, it has met all of my expectations and a little more.  We had a 5 star experience once we were at the restaurant, but the only gripe I have is that I made a reservation for early May way back in early March. When the time got closer, I had to reschedule due to an obligation, and when I called in, it looks like my reservation was never put in the calendar. The hostess asked me if I had the right location, which I did, so I just made a new reservation. So if you're looking to make a reservation, I would call a few days ahead just in case so you don't run into what happened to me!  We had the omakase dinner, and the waiter will take your preferences and dietary concerns to create a tasting menu with the chef. We wanted about half hot dishes and cold/sushi dishes, and I requested dishes that weren't heavy on dairy (since I'm lactose sensitive). We started out with the champagne 95 and grapefruit on the rocks. Both were great! The champagne 95 was fresh/crisp/refreshing with orange liquor, peach liquor, and pineapple & roederer champagne. The grapefruit on the rocks tasted more of just grapefruit juice without much of a kick or other flavor besides grapefruit.   All dishes we got were amazing to a point that I can't speak highly enough of our waiter, Columbia, creating such an extraordinary menu. The only things I didn't really care for was the beef toban-yaki. The beef toban-yaki is in an ancho chile sauce, and I think that's what threw me off. The sauce was a little too intense for me, but I also think that this dish would be a favorite for many other people. It's just not for me, but it might be for you... so try it out and make up your mind for yourself.   My favorite items happened to be the cheapest (you could say i'm a cheap date, I guess??). They were the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, spinach salad with dry miso, and the salmon sashimi new style. Each had great flavor and were so unique in their own right. The yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno was served with ponzu sauce. It was slightly sweet, savory, and absolutely perfect. The spinach salad with dry miso was fresh, and the miso dried miso gave it a nice, salty crunch. The miso is broken up into very small pieces, so it isn't so overwhelmingly salty.   List of what we got: Champagne 95 Grapefruit on the rocks Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno Spicy miso chips with big eye tuna Spinach salad with dry miso Salmon sashimi new style Black cod miso Rock shrimp with jalapeno sauce Beef toban-yaki 2 scallop with wasabi salsa 2 albacore sushi 2 tamago sushi 1 miso tart   Overall, I would come back to Nobu for maybe a special occasion or if I'm feeling zesty. The food is amazing and the service from the waiter is extraordinary. I would get the omakase again. The only reservation about Nobu is the hostesses making your reservations. You should definitely call a few days ahead to confirm your reservation."}
{"text":"Best veggie Asian food I've had in a very long time. Will be back for sure! Don't order off the menu. Tell them what you want and let them build it based on your likes and dislikes. They did a fantastic job all the way around."}
{"text":"Everything you have heard is true...it's back breaking expensive and worth the gastronomic investment!  If money is no object, go and don't look back.  If money is tight, go and make concessions for other meals...it's worth it!   This was by a long shot my favorite meal in LV...probably one of my top two favorite meals of 2014 so far.  The food is incredible, the atmosphere, music and general ambiance, is both sexy and fun.  I would have gladly eaten there several times if I had unlimited funds.  I have always been interested in Nobu  during my many trips to NYC.  The locations there are very hard to get into at a decent hour, so when I was easily able to score a table at the location in Caesars at a prime time it was a no-brainer.  We had many different items...all were incredible...but here were our favorites:  Miso Marinated Black Cod--plain and simply ridiculous eating pleasure...hard to explain how good this is.  The fish is cooked perfectly and the top is almost like a creme brulee from the miso marinade.  Crackly, sweet and a perfect match for the succulent, luxurious black cod beneath it.  Crispy rice with big eye tuna...a  phenomenal combination of sushi grade tuna and crunch.  Mini bite sized tacos, salmon and wagyu...perfect crispy meat filled bites.  They are small, but flavor and texture perfection.  Yellowtail Sahimi with jalapeno--doesn't sound special, but the glistening, fresh fish, sitting in a delicate citrus sauce, with the slightest slice of jalapeno on top is flavor magic on the tongue.  The yellowtail is mellow and smooth, with a hint of sweet and acidic citrus and a touch of heat from the pepper.  Better than I could ever make it sound with words.  Finally dessert...Nobu Shaved ice...this one again on paper did nothing for me...Shaved ice, with condensed milk poured over it, toasted coconut, bean paste and tofu ice cream...doesn't even sound appealing in all honesty...I couldn't stop eating it!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I only went to the bar so I apologize if my review is misleading.  I ordered the only cocktail any man should ever order, an Old Fashioned. I drink about 1-3 of these a day and when I go out I will order each bartender's (worth his salt) version of the drink with an open mind before deciding to keep drinking it or tell him to make the one I love. Brian, a young but honest kid, made me the cocktail with the exception of NO cherry (blasphemy in my opinion). I was reluctant of the drink at first watching him make it but it was subtle and smooth, very pleasant, but it was missing something. Being that it was a Japanese restaurant and bar, he used the Nikka Coffee whisky (again more reservations as I prefer Knob Creek Single Barrel), and so on the second drink, after being pleasantly surprised, I boldly asked him to make his full interpretation of the Old Fashioned with cherry.  Great and memorable is how I would describe it. I HATE cherries. HATE. No cherry flavor. Instead, the way he does it creates body and more subtle flavor, enhancing the drink. It ain't some fancy girly drink. Just a good whisky cocktail with nice flavor. He does a few EXTRAS things to the cocktail but you will have to go there and ask for it yourself to see it for yourself. Kid worked hard and was attentive for a timeless drink. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for our 15th wedding anniversary dinner & so glad we did. We had a five course tasting menu that was to DIE for. We had a red snapper sashimi, a mixed bag of sushi rolls, rock shrimp tempura, black cod with miso, & a dessert. It was by far the best food & dining experience we have had. We will be returning for sure, thanks Nobu it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the food but hate the overbearing staff. I don't care what you like on the menu because I did not ask. I also told you I was a nobu veteran and you kept going.  Do I look like I want a fru fru cocktail?  Get rid of those silly and lousy male waiters. They crashed my opinion of the brand.  I'm paying for food not the opinion of an over coiffed doofus."}
{"text":"Impromptu trip to Vegas for my best friend's birthday! Yay! While planning our trip, I noticed a Groupon for Nobu. I'd been wanting to try out one of the LA locations for a while, so this seemed like a win-win. Overall, the experience was pretty great. The service was friendly and very attentive (almost too attentive... my ice tea cup was never empty. i don't think they even let it get half empty...)  The meal started with edamame which wasn't anything special. Standard at any Japanese place you'd go to. The first course was the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. This was so good!! I'm normally not a jalepeno fan, but it had just the right amount of kick to it. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night.  Next up was the Rock Shrimp Tempura. This was alright. I liked the sauce with the lettuce/salad below, but it was too heavy for the shrimp... My friend and I agreed that it just left us craving honey walnut shrimp from Panda Express.   Third entree up was the Black Cod Miso. This was also an outstanding dish, like the yellowtail. The fish was cooked perfectly and the entire dish was both presented well and tasted great.   The fourth entree (and the reason for docking one star) was California Roll and assorted Nigiri. Maybe it's just because I live in LA and I'm spoiled by great sushi, but I wasn't impressed. The fish was fresh enough, but definitely not up to par to say, Sugarfish. And at the heart of it all, Nobu is a Japanese restaurant, so I expected their sushi to be on par with their fusion dishes. Sadly, not the case.  The meal ended with the Bento Box dessert, which had flour-less chocolate cake, green tea ice cream and some cappuccino thing. I'm not a huge dessert person but it was ok. I've never disliked any green tea ice cream I've had and the cappuccino thing was unique.   Overall, it was a great meal and good experience. Without a doubt, it was worth the price of the Groupon. Not sure about full price though. I think only the Yellowtail sashimi and black cod miso would be worth it."}
{"text":"I love NOBU and have been to several! Two dishes are on my death row meal list and they did not disappoint. The yellowtail and jalapeño sashimi and Black Cod with Miso were flawless. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was the beef dish we ordered. The seasoning was lacking and the beef had an off flavor. Could probably eat 3 orders of the yellowtail so will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to NOBU at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.  It rates on my list of top ten restaurants in the world.  The ambiance is stunning, the service is exceptional, and the cuisine is phenomenal in every sense.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a lovely hostess who escorted us to a fantastic table surrounded by a wicker cocoon where we could observe passers-by in the casino but still felt intimate and private.  Our server, Amber, was quick to visit our table with menus.  When she learned we had dined there before, she suggested we consider having the chef design our dining experience and asked for budget parameters.  A very smart way to create a custom prix-fixe.  We chose to dismiss the menus without even looking and let the chef's selections begin.  Our first course was the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  It happens to be one my favorites.  Bright delicate slices of yellowtail with a light lime infused sauce topped with slashes of jalapeno.  How such a simple dish can be so wonderous is beyond me.  Gorgeous pure unpretentious presentation that burst with flavor.  Next up, Soft Shell Crab Tempura.  A generous portion of perfectly prepared crab.  Crisp, just the right amount of batter, and seasoned to bring out the natural essence and not mask the flavor of this fantastic crustacean.  Maybe the best soft-shell crab I've ever had.  It was about at this point that Aaron Hopwood, the Bar Manager/Sommelier, paid our table a visit to check on us.  What a nice touch.  Aaron was sincerely interested in our dining experience and it gave us a chance to give praise to the immaculate service we were receiving from Amber and the rest of the team.  It's rare to find such exceptional, efficient and warm care.  Following the crab was the Filet Mignon with Crispy Onions.  The filet was nestled under wisps of fried onions that were so delicate they absolutely melted in your mouth.  The filet was medium rare, and thinly sliced in a light sauce.  The combination was sensational.  For our closing course, the chef chose to present a special sushi plate with various filets and rolls.  The highlight for me was it included two delicately fried Sawangani River Crabs.  These tiny fresh water crabs are about the size of a silver dollar and are eaten whole.  They are so crispy, crunchy, and flavorful.  I've only had them once before in my life and absolutely fell in love with these exotic crab delicacies.  What a treat.  At this point, we were completely sated.  The perfect combination of dishes and just the right portions.  An absolutely exceptional evening on all levels.  We can't wait to visit NOBU again."}
{"text":"great place for some sushi. food overall is good but pricey. make reservations bc the wait will be long. dinner time the service can be slow and you might have to wait for your food for a bit."}
{"text":"A true gem at the Hard Rock. You tell the waiter what your price limit per person is and he brings out shareable dishes to accommodate. Everything, and I mean everything that he brought out was finger licking good! The miso on the Black Cod Miso was the best I've ever had, ever. The tuna tar tar.. Wow. They brought out the sushi dishes at the end but everything prior was better. Highly highly recommend going to this spot."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed at this place. I should've listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but noooo, I had to go and throw down two bills to prove to myself how much they sucked.   The decor was nothing to write home about. I think there was an overuse of bamboo in the place, the chairs were Ikea and the tables were just weirdly laid out.   First of all, I couldn't understand the cutesy English the waitress was speaking. Each time she said something, we would pause for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, since we couldn't tell if she was asking us a question or making a statement. Then it'd be followed by, \"I'm sorry, what?\"  We ordered chilean sea bass in the black bean sauce, the crab ceviche, and some grilled beef thing. The ceviche was overwhelmingly tangy. I think it reshaped some of my fillings in my teeth. There was a lot of it though, even though the waitress told us that they were small portions. We next had the chilean sea bass which was not good at all. Again, portion was decent, but it was bland and not even hot. Finally, the meat came and although tender, it just wasn't as flavorful as I expected.  For being \"Nobu,\" I did have high expectations. But DK and I evaluated it and said that even if this was a no-name restaurant that we just walked into, we still wouldn't have thought it was good.   And by the next morning, we were telling people that it just \"sucked.\" And I'm sticking with that.   So for those of you who speak Mandarin, you know that \"bu\" means \"don't.\"  So this restaurant's name is a forewarning of a the answer you'll give when asked, \"So was it good?\" or \"Is it worth going?\"  No. Bu."}
{"text":"MAN ALIVE.  I wish there was a Nobu in Seattle or Portland b/c this is seriously the best damn sushi I've EVER had.    The black cod w/ miso?  FABULOUS.  The yellowtail w/ jalapeno?  UNREAL.  My cucumber martini?  So could've gotten me into trouble if I'd kept drinking them. Our server?  HOT.  The aesthetics of the restaurant?  Tranquil, even though the place was bustling!  If you're a sushi fan, you must must MUST go to Nobu.  It's completely worth it."}
{"text":"Everyone, you need to read. If you are truly a fan of high quality fish, this is NOT the place for you. If you just want to dress nice and post an IG pic flexing that you're rich, by all means come eat your gas station quality fish. If you order the spicy edamame, expect maple syrup on it. This is the only time I had to force myself to swallow my food. There is a place called Kabuso and Yuzu in LA that makes this place seem as if you bought your food at 7-11. The rolls only taste like seaweed and old rice. Bring a magnifying glass and tweezers for your fish tacos. Please, go have a steak instead."}
{"text":"Overrated.   Came here for dinner with my in-laws on a whim, because the buffet line was way too long. I was super stoked to try this place, but I was pretty disappointed with the meal.   Recap: 1. Decor/Atmosphere - Very nice. Back when I was young and single, I totally would have rolled up to this place to impress my now-wife. Swanky decorations that oozes class, balla', and sophistication.   2. Food - Quality of the food is good. I feel like they use very expensive, high-end ingredients, but the food wasn't executed very well. Nothing that we ordered really \"Wow'ed\" me.   3. Drinks - Delicious! The drinks here are very good, but will set you back $15 bucks/drink.   4. Price - No bueno. The food was hella expensive for what you get. If I got a little more for my money or if the food was outstanding, I would be okay spending money here. But to spend an arm and leg on mediocre food broke my heart.   5. Baby Friendly - Not really. Yes, they did have high chairs, but no changing tables in the men's room.   6. Staff - Phenomenal service. I think we had 3-4 servers running food and tending to us. Knowledgeable about the food and made some decent recommendations.   Overall, I had a good time here. I probably wouldn't be back because of the prices/portions, but I'm glad I checked this place off my bucket list."}
{"text":"Sushi heaven, simply put. You will be spoiled by the experience and will scrutinize every sushi restaurant post dining here.  Located at the Hard Rock, I was fortunate enough to grab a spot at the sushi bar and partake in the hustle and bustle of the Japanese chefs' banter. Being at the bar allows you to receive great recs on unique dishes (i.e. snapper nigiri with special hot sauce, et al).  For me, what sets Nobu apart is the freshness of the fish, and the perfect cut of fish paired with the perfect amount of rice. It's all about getting that balance right.  In regards to vibes, Nobu is a place to be seen and the interior supports the Asian influence with contemporary.  Be prepared for a long wait if you don't make reservations and remember, there's a premium to be paid for the Nobu brand and quality."}
{"text":"My first time at this Nobu. I normally use the Ceasars one in Vegas. Devine as expected. My absolute favourite place. You can't get better black cod miso anywhere!!!!! This restaurant executes everything perfectly. I never have anything but positive comments. Thank you once again for making my visit amazing!! Until next time."}
{"text":"OMG, I love Nobu. Talk about understatement...   Like my experience at Bouchon, we had a set menu but I didn't care! It was quite simply amazing!  My favorite: A lettuce wrap cod... It was so delicious. Seafood Skeptics were even keen on the whole Nobu menu! They also had a spicy tuna salad that was just impeccable!  Did I already say that I loved Nobu????   Please go... and keep in mind, a Jap Sushi dinner is never complete without Sake. I only wish I remember the name of the Sake I tried... but I'm sure after 10 shots they all tend to taste alike."}
{"text":"One thing does not disappoint in Vegas is the ability to find some world-class restaurants and being awed by the decor. Each one is more enticing and eye-catching than the next!  Been wanting to try a restaurant owned by Chef Nobu for a long time and just had to give it a go when I stumbled upon \"Nobu\" at the Caesars Palace.  The menu has hot and cold fare priced from $10+ with a big list of sushi and sashimi to choose from. The nigiri do not come in pairs. Sushi is ordered by the piece and it ranges from $5 to $90. At the same time there are also sushi rolls and hand rolls as options.  The Alaskan black cod miso $34 was seasoned nicely and grilled to perfection. It came with a beautiful stalk of pickled ginger root which the sushi chef pointed it out that the tip was edible.  I ended up eating the whole stalk because it tasted really good.  There are sushi bar or the lounge bar to choose from if dining alone.   I think the fact that this restaurant is located in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas made it quite high-profile and at the same time allowing them to command the steep prices.  There's no way to leave this place feeling satisfied without spending at least $100 per person."}
{"text":"Nobu blew my mind! Not only it had amazing food, the service was absolutely outstanding. You are served by at least 5 people in addition to your waiter, and every staff member walking by is trained to ensure your dining experience is flawless.  To start with, I wore a little black cocktail dress to the restaurant, and when I settled, there were white napkins on the table. My white napkin was quickly removed, and a black napkin put in its place. (!!!!). My husband dropped his napkin without noticing, and a passing by staff member put a clean napkin next to his plate, picked up the dropped one and disappeared. And in everything from bringing food out to refilling your drinks, to taking the empty plates away, Nobu provided the most authentic service we have ever experienced  Now to the food - Nobu is known for Japanese cuisine infused with Peruvian flavors. Every morsel of fish explodes with flavors in your mouth. Cocktails are unique and flavorful. The green tea is only surpassed by the tea we had in Japan.  The menu was difficult to navigate for a Nobu newby, but to make your selection less stressful, there is a pre-selected chef menu and you server can select food for You, based on your preference and price.  We asked for fish only, and around $125 per person, and thoroughly enjoyed the food they brought us. The most memorable were the sashimi style dishes with raw slices of fish served with different sauces. Yellow tail jalapeno was a treat. Miso salmon. The presentation was also top notch. We will definitely be back when in Vegas next. One word of warning - if wearing heels, the tile floor on the way to the ladies room is very slippery. Walk slowly. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. Highly recommend and can not wait to visit again!   The food was impeccable and the service was A++! My water glass and Sake glass was never empty. Our server was friendly, helpful and knowledgable about the menu and offerings.   We opted to create our own shareable menu for our table of 4- the 12 courses was just enough to fill us up without being miserably full. The food was amazing. Everything was so delicious and the fish was fresh. The Wagyu was like butter. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The food presentation was stunning. The desserts are to die for! I wish I would have snapped photos, but as I was at a group supper it didn't happen.   I can not remember all the dishes that we tried, but here are a few of my favorites and MUST haves during your visit: Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, Premium Japanese Wagyu, Maine Lobster with Wasabi Pepper and Toro Sashimi. The Desserts y'all! OMG the best things ever- Bento Box, Santandagi, Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream, Green Tea Royale,"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner last Friday evening. We were staying at the Nobu Hotel, which is within Caesar's Palace and adjacent to the restaurant. I should mention that we visit from Arizona and stay on the Strip often. The food here is fantastic and the staff made us feel as if we have been coming here for years. This was some of the best hospitality I've experienced. From here on out, this restaurant and hotel will be my choice standard whenever visiting the Strip!"}
{"text":"Fun experience! No privacy...: When we were seated I was disappointed that we were elbow to elbow with other couples on either side- no chance of a romantic dinner (or a private conversation for that matter). At one point the couple next to us leaned over to discuss one of our selections! The place is small and somewhat crowded. Although I frequent Japanese and Sushi restaurants this menu contained many things I had never had before. Most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size (~$14-25). We chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections.  The yellowtail tartar was great, the lobster ceviche was not so. The tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size). We tried the house special (a rainbow roll) and Eel sushi. Both were good, but not my favorite rolls I'd ever had-actually kind of plain. For dessert the bento box, essentially a souffl"}
{"text":"Amazing... amazing! Mouth watering food! The bartender made me an custom blueberry martini, that should be on rhe menu. Our waiter Randy was very help suggesting dishes just for us! Just spectacular!"}
{"text":"Came here on our last night in Vegas. We sat down and the wait staff immediately traded out our cloth napkins based on what we were wearing. Our server was especially helpful telling us what was popular on the menu. Excellent service. Probably the best service I've experienced at a restaurant. As far as the food goes, the maki rolls were good but did have a lot of rice. The yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and miso glaze was two thumbs up and a must try. The sea bass skewer with ancho sauce was delicious. Overall, great service and food."}
{"text":"Im finally back from month long vacation and its been an interesting one especially in vegas. When they say crazy shit happens in vegas, its so true. Looking back at my pictures made me wanna share my story here. I ate here with some girlfriends for my birthday. The food and service was great, except for the bar. We waited there only a few minutes before seating down. We were creeped out by the bartender with pubic looking hair. His english was annoying probably because he was mexican. He would just stare, yeah you...CREEPER. But whatever our table was ready. After eating and drinking we forgot all about him. We asked for the check, but the server told us some guys paid for it, SUCKERS.Trick in vegas, go out with girls half naked. Guys are stupid and pay for everything. The interesting part of the night was the manager. I dont remember his name but he was a white guy. After dinner, we went to Omnia. This club is awesome. We must have stayed there all night. This must have been a vegas classic. Sometime during the night i ran into the manager from nobu. He seemed a little different from the restaurant. I was thinking because he was finally off work. He asked how was my partying going. I told him amazing and i love it here. We went to the table and he made me some drinks. I left to get my friends and came back. VEGAS!!! When i got to the table , i saw him sniff something. I told him so you like to \"party\" huh? He said its \"VEGAS BABY\" and asked if i wanted some. I said im ok because im a Christian...ha ha ha. This just made my night in vegas. I seen it all here. My friends loved the \"party\". LOL. I dont know what time we got back to our hotel, but  knew it was late. The sun was coming up. I cant wait to come back to vegas. This place is awesome. You experience lots of stuff like in the movies. Thanks for the great time."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a new joint venture among celebrities and famous chef according to our friends who wanted to try it out. We arrived shortly after 8pm on a Saturday night and the place was full. We had a big party of 10 people. Some of the Seafood was the freshest I have tasted here in Vegas, however, I still find the price tag do not justify the portion of the food. We had a birthday girl and they were nice enough to provide a dessert of banana ice cream for free, however, it was served long after I told them someone in our party is having birthday today, which was kinda late as the dessert was only served when we were ready to head out after paying the bills."}
{"text":"Impeccable service to match an equally impressive menu. The menu is full of all of the Nobu's greatest dishes sprinkled with a few new items that are sure to be future favorites.   I knew we were in for a treat when we were welcomed at the door by a friendly and professional hostess. And i was not mistaken the 4 Star treatment continued throughout our 3 hour dinner experience!   we will definetly be back craving for more!!!"}
{"text":"Been there So Many times of Nobu in Vegas  This one never disappointed me  It always as good as usual!' The food the environment the proffisional stuff there all amazing  It's expensive but it worth every penny of money!!!!"}
{"text":"Again... We have come to this Nobu for years and again it tops the level of excellence that it attained prior. The butter lettuce salad is quite literally to die for. The watermelon soft shell tempura crab is the greatest creation of man. This place is our favorite restaurant for a reason. Wedding reception, anniversary, lunch dinner, delicious and with every penny."}
{"text":"Personalized service from an outstanding server named Trene last night. We let her drive completely, and she absolutely nailed every course. She set budget boundaries and learned time constraints on the front end, and she kept things moving at the perfect pace. Her team kept out glasses full. Everything was well explained. This was one of the top 5 dining experiences in my life. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a sushi FREAK. So you don't have to wonder, \"Hmm... maybe it was just her first time or....\" No. I seriously LIVE for sushi. I eat at incredible places about 3-4 times a MONTH! I dont care about cost either. Good sushi is worth it to me!   Okay, that being said... I would give Nobu a 3.5 stars if that were possible. Then again, the only reason I'd bring it up by half would be the friendly servers and great decor.   Now, for the sushi... like someone said below recently, I was expecting to be WOWED. I've eaten some amazing food in Vegas and hoped this was going to blow those other places out of the water. But this was not to be unfortunately. Now, I don't know if it's because we're more into nigiri & sashimi and we don't go the hot meal route very often. Either way, I was just not impressed. We ordered red snapper sashimi which came as big slabs of flavorless fish, no presentation & really no taste either. Next was spanish mackerel, usually my fave. This too was bland & boring. Then I ordered unagi, which as most sushi fans know takes a while to get to you when they bake it fresh. This was brought to me almost before the words came out of my mouth! Fast service yes... but how did he bake it so fast? I discovered the answer when I noticed a plateful of it sitting on top of the little oven already done & waiting. Boo!! This caused it to be lukewarm when it arrived. Finished off with rock shrimp tempura because at this point we really just wanted out of there realizing that if we saved up what money we'd normally spend, that we could go to one of our fave places soon to make up for it!   Rock shrimp tempura was good, I can't lie. But it was also nothing special. Oh!! And something that really bugged me & my dining partner was that the chef wasn't very good at making his rice stick together tight! It fell apart the second you touched it. :(   So to sum up...  1 point for service, 1 point for ambiance and 1 point for food/taste.I do have to say the the fish did taste fresh & the quality seemed safe & good. However,  will I go back? Ehh... I would if someone else was buying. But I will never seek it out on my own again I'm sad to say."}
{"text":"keep it coming. every dish was unique and divine. the ambiance was just right to highlight the food.  i actually felt like i had escaped  las vegas. service was top notch. sake was smooth and the bamboo reed it was served in was rad.  i want one.    i would go back any time and can't wait to try the malibu location.  you're money will be well spent here."}
{"text":"OMG Fabu Nobu! You Never disappoint! Try the lobster salad - best ever Also sashimi whitefish with jalapeños ;) Until we meet again Nobu...."}
{"text":"From food to the service!! Its all about the whole package! Every single item that arrived in our table surprised us with lots of excitement!! What can i say... Nobu really take good care of its reputation. And there were at least 3 server attended to our table. They really explain every single detail in the menu, to make sure u know what you order. Yes its not cheap.. But hellloooo... You got what you paid!  Its Worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult review for me to write - I have regarded Nobu Matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in Japanese cuisine. Maybe time is passing by and his 'new style' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore?   I've had sushi at the London, Dallas, and NYC locations of Nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original Matsuhisa restaurant in LA. My visit to Nobu in Las Vegas did not seem to compare with the others. It was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. The service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. Perhaps the global expansion of Nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a Nobu menu in years. Sad.  Anyway, enough hatin'. I had a great creamy spicy crab (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of Nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. It was all good. But I'm not sure I'll seek out the LV branch of Nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in Vegas).   Given Nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (Morimoto, Tyson Cole's Uchi), I can only give Nobu-LV 3 stars."}
{"text":"Before I start my review, I must warn the reader that the one star rating is purely relative. The rating is not because the food was too expensive. Rather, I believe that a restaurant that charges this much deserves to be compared against the very best restaurants in the world that charge a similar premium. If I were to compare Nobu to other teppan yaki restaurants such as Benihana or Hamada it would easily receive 4 or 5 stars based on the ingredients used and quality of food alone (for the most part).  Originally my plan was to eat sushi and sashimi at Hyakumi, the other Japanese Restaurant at Caesars Palace at 8PM. However, I found out that Hyakumi is now closed for dinner so I went to the Diamond Lounge around 8:15 PM and talked to a receptionist who informed me of Nobu's grand opening. He apologized and said that there is no sushi at Nobu but he could reserve a teppan yaki table for 2 at 11:00 PM. When I walked into Nobu I was a little annoyed to see that there was indeed a sushi bar as well a non-teppan yaki seating. Although this does not (and should not) effect my rating for Nobu (because it is Caesars's fault), I feel like this little tidbit of information is necessary. It is certainly reasonable to think that I may have perhaps approached my experience at Nobu with a bit of negative bias. I personally believe that this is not the case. However, I still urge you to read on with caution.   I came into Nobu with pretty high expectations because the Nobu at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas was highly acclaimed and was even adorned with a Michelin Star once upon a time. I went into my meal intrigued as to how a teppan yaki restaurant could receive such high praise, and then I found out that there is no teppan yaki at the Nobu at Hard Rock (go figure). In any case, I sat at my teppan yaki table and had only two tasting choices available for order. There was no a la carte option. I ordered the $280 per person option and the other option was a bit cheaper (I think $190?...I don't remember for certain). Although the sake menu was limited, my taste for dry sake was well met at a very reasonable price ($25).   The tasting menu that I ordered offered a variety of different courses including Toro tartare, seared foie gras, Maine lobster tail, wagyu steak, and Jamon de Iberico fried rice.   First, the Toro tartare was certainly interesting. It was served in a wasabi based reduction and was essentially chopped up toro (fatty tuna) mixed with a variety of spices and topped with caviar. While good, I still have some reservations regarding this dish. To me, it is a bit pretentious to take toro, chop it up and add caviar on top with some fancy sauce. As they say at the tables, you don't mess with winners. Don't split 10s, don't double down on blackjack, and don't mess with toro. Toro by itself is one of the most delicious foods in the world.  Furthermore, the foie gras was overdone. Seared foie gras should undoubtedly melt in your mouth. This foie gras overwhelmingly tasted burnt with a bit of crunch After a couple of chews, the foie gras did ultimately melt. That said, I just could not muster up the courage to tell our table side chef to his face that he had royally messed up the foie gras. One of the weaknesses that teppan yaki opens itself up to is a potential for inconsistency. The lobster tail and the wagyu beef, however, were immaculate, and could not be cooked better. The wagyu beef, cooked medium rare, literally melts after one bite.   As for the Jamon Iberico fried rice, I can certainly say that I was disappointed. Jamon Iberico naturally comes cured and is sliced thin and wide. Jamon Iberico should also melt in your mouth because of its marbling. When put on a grill and chopped up, the Jamon turns a bit chewy. The grilled Jamon is still of superior quality when compared to regular ham and I get that the whole point of grilling the Jamon is to extract the fat in order to make the fried rice just that much more savory and delicious. However, the end result is a bit lacking and I am not sure if the added taste to the dish makes up for the compromised texture of the Jamon.  As I was eating the fried rice, I decided to order a traditional Japanese garnish, takuan, to accompany my dish. It took a while for it to be served (~10 mins) and when served the takuan was of surprisingly poor quality. At a good Japanese restaurant you expect to be served takuan that is either off white or dark yellow in color. This takuan was bright yellow and cut way too thick. The most troubling thing about this is that takuan is used in sushi. It's simply unacceptable for a restaurant that touts its high quality food to serve such poor quality takuan. I understand that Nobu just opened, however their menu was just a big miss. The only circumstances under which I would recommend Nobu for now is if you are craving Wagyu and you are willing to pony up $280 for you and your guest(s) plus alcohol. Otherwise, forget it."}
{"text":"This is the 4th or 5th Nobu that I have been to and it is on the bottom of my list for both food quality and customer service.  Starting with the hostess who seemed to have a bad day not wanting to smile or communicate even simple pleasantries (e.g. Have a nice dinner, etc.). The server turned out to be pretentious going on about how this Nobu is special and trying to upsell to the chef's special dinner. The rest of the dinner the server was rather elusive often requiring us to ask others to get our server. The only upside on service was the bus person who was very personable and genuinely wanted to make a connection (thank him for getting two stars on the review).  The food, especially for the price, was on the disappointing for the most port. Notable exception was the tatake. The miso black cod was on the mushy side and not the flavor from other Nobus. Waygu gyoza had an off taste. Requested a special role with eel and could have gotten something better from a gas station. Tried some other things but can't frankly remember them after a couple of days.  Not likely to visit this Nobu again given so many great choices in the area.   Sushi Samba and Tao are far, far better choices for both food quality and service!"}
{"text":"It is very rare that you get service and food on this level. Amazing. Every dish was prepared to perfection. The service was great. An amazing meal."}
{"text":"As expected of a Michelin-starred restaurant, Nobu stands out as one of the premier fine dining options along the Las Vegas strip, offering their guests an incredible dining experience by means of \"Omakase\" - a tasting menu hand-chosen by the restaurant's chefs that takes place over the course of two hours. A take on Japanese-Peruvian fusion, Nobu delighted our palettes with a unique succession of small plates, including King Crab Ceviche, Black Cod miso, and Wagyu Beef, which was aesthetically set ablaze upon black rocks.   To put it candidly, Nobu was one of the best overall dining experiences that I have ever been a part of. The quality of food, staff, and ambience is simply unmatched in the city of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This must be the best Japanese food in Vegas! Extremely overpriced, but you are where you are. Excellent sake too! Loved every bit they brought out to us. Being Peruvian I definitely tried the tiradito, and it was a good fusion. What really had me though, were the black cod and the Bluefin toro sashimi which just melted in my mouth. The uni was delicious too!"}
{"text":"This place is a Fucking joke the food is garbage and bland 200 dollars for a fucking snack I had to go get dinner after dinner the waitress acts like its the best sushi in the world  it's pathetic I can't believe they built a hotel around this garbage sushi the don't waste your time or money stay away go to the palms around the corner i want to give them a minus if I could they are taking advantage this place is a tourist trap stay away"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience at this Nobu location. Going from my last visit in London Park Lane. Nobu did not live up to the expectations. And to top it off, the Manager couldn't give 2 sh*ts! Will never come back and make sure no one I know comes."}
{"text":"This place gets props for service and food presentation.  Our waiter was excellent and all his recommendations were spot-on.  The plating of the food was also beautiful - you almost don't want to eat it!  The taste of the food leaves a bit to be desired.  Some of the flavor combinations just did not work for me.  The prices were very steep as well - not good after a tough night at the tables!"}
{"text":"Been to many Nobu's around the world and like always, a tremendous culinary experience. The team at Nobu's are true experts! They always have the best toro sashimi and tons of creative choices. The truth is, whatever you decide to go with on the menu, it's always a safe bet."}
{"text":"I did like this restaurant/ I know it's been called overhyped but I think for the price, you really get some creative dishes! The decor and lighting was perfect for starting a night out, but the entrance to the Caesar's place to get to nobu is a bit disturbing haha... you'll see what I mean (lots of noisy redneck types at the slot machines, etc). I did feel though that many of the dishes tasted similar / maybe too much like and cilantro ?? But worth checking out if you're into checking out different/Americanized presentation of sushi!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The crispy rice squares are insanely delicious. Toro hand roll so good!!!! And their drinks are yum yum yummy"}
{"text":"Food and venue were very good. Only to be surpassed by service.   Related- to restaurants (out of 5 possible stars) Venue- 4 Service- 5 Food factor- 5 Overall exp- 4.75 Stars   Drawbacks- A little expensive but everything for the most part was very nice. If I had to be super critical the ambiance could have been a little nicer for the cost."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner.  Service was excellent, and interior of restaurant was beautiful.  Will absolutely go back when we visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Nobu was one of the biggest restaurant disappointments for us ever.  Why? Let me explain:  Nobu pretends to be a traditional Japanese restaurant with Peruvian flavors. However, in reality it embodies everything which is wrong with American hip ethnic restaurants.   1. The food is simply not good. The seafood is only semi-fresh and definitely not at the quality level the price would suggest. 2. The flavors of EACH dish we had were totally overdone. Mostly the dishes were just over salted to the maximum. Others were super sour or too sweet. Japanese and Peruvian cuisines are known for preserving the distinct flavors of the ingredients - Nobu overpowered every single dish with the sauces and seasonings (yes even the sushi). The only dish which was okay was their signature black miso cod - but we definitely had better. 3. The service was ok but not great. Servers were rushed and didn't do a good job explaining their huge menu. 4. The interior of the restaurant feels like they are trying too hard to make it look \"cool and hip\". The setting inside is way too dark - I have seen 10+ guests using their cellphone lights to be able to read the menu. 5. Worst for my wife and me was that the quality of their ingredients were definitely way off. We are both very used to seafood and raw fish - but we both had terrible diarrhea right after the dinner.  Overall, Nobu felt like a Japanese version of the Cheese Cake Factory to us. A huge menu with okayish food but nothing is particularly good because they are trying too hard to appeal to the average American taste.  Definitely not coming back. Totally overhyped - there are WAY better options in Vegas at that price level."}
{"text":"When our waiter, Shane, told me that this was going to be the best dining experience in my life, he wasn't joking. Who knew that such a top notch Japanese restaurant was hiding in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Shane told us to give him a price and the chef will bring us numerous dishes to accommodate. He also asked us what we preferred and if at any time during the tasting we loved or hated an item that he will adjust the rest of the menu accordingly. Each dish was perfect.  The ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant made me feel like I wasnt even in the Hard Rock. The customer service great. Shane was very knowledgeable and accommodating. We told him that we had to catch a show at 930 and he got us out right in time. The price was a bit much BUT well worth every penny."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  Every time we visit Las Vegas, Nobu is a must for us.  The service, ambiance, drinks, and food get a A+.  We always get the cod miso, it is to die for."}
{"text":"Look, to be honest, I'm no sushi expert.  In fact, I usually get the dragon roll etc at my local sushi haunt in San Francisco, and I'd bet there isn't much raw fish in any of the rolls I'm used to.  That being said, I took a leap of faith and ordered the chef's choice sashimi dinner.  6 different high-end exotic raw fish drawn and quartered for the pleasure of my pallette. Holy crap, so good!  Waitress was awesome, explained everything for a semi-novice like myself and wasn't snobby.  I was even able to do sake-bombs at the table and not piss off the other patrons (its at the hard rock cafe and the crowd is somewhat older, but still some rockers and youngsters in there).  Be warned tho, between two people we ended up spending about $140!!  NOTE: This resteraunt was shouted out in the definitive sushi howto (found here: http://eugeneciurana.com/musings/sushi-eating-HOWTO.html)"}
{"text":"Good food!  Between 4 people, we were able to try a lot of stuff.  We started w/the live scallop, toro tartar w/caviar, and yellowtail sashimi w/jalapeno.  All were amazing.  Then we had the sashimi dinner and a bunch of rolls.  Dessert was something chocolatey w/crunchy bananas and sorbet...can't recall the name (sake).  You can't go wrong w/this place!"}
{"text":"An amazing meal at Nobu. Although the meal was quite pricey, it was well worth the money. The Restaurant is beautiful and tranquil on the inside. Nice low lighting with the tables spaced out so you feel very private in a very busy room. The bone in filet was off the charts!  The sushi was on point and super fresh. The service was great as well, it seemed like there were 2 servers at our table the whole time. The dinning experience took some time so manage your schedule before you come in and expect to sit for around 2 hours. Will be back at Nobu again in the very near future."}
{"text":"I got the beef teriyaki, but it was so clean and lean that it just lost a lot of the appeal of beef teriyaki. Cost a butt-load too."}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable. Our waiter walked us through the menu and how Nobu intended his patrons to enjoy the food. The food was stellar as well. Now although I gave it 5 stars the price is definitely something that would bring my rating down. However the food was that good, just wish there was more of it for the price we paid. Apparently it was a quieter day in the restaurant, as our buser informed us, but it was just perfect for us...a couple who want to be able to hear ourselves when we have a conversation. Now we did have some complaints, water being spilled all over my husband's feet as the buser was trying to refill water glasses at the table next to us, bones found in our fish dish. Our waiter apologized profusely for all those matters. But that was it."}
{"text":"I had dinner here twice in the past years at Ceasar Palace. The food was good. Their drinks aren't my favorite but ok. Sugarcane blows everyone away with their drinks and is big competition for Nobu food wise. Nobu is overrated as everywhere. For regular prices i could probably rate more stars but for what you pay I expect top quality and no average cocktails."}
{"text":"Came in without reservations on a Thursday night, but nabbed a seat at the bar.   Certainly not the best or most authentic Japanese food I've ever had (especially after spending a year in Japan), but creative and most certainly tasty. Our neighbors at the bar were very friendly and we all got to cheer against Miami heat together--no better bonding experience.   The bartender was also extremely nice and my drink (the sakura.. something) was quite potent. Sipping on one drink lasted me all through dinner.   We ordered the yellowtail w/jalapenos (or something like that, a cold dish, it was good), rock shrimp, and crab tempura. We also got sweet shrimp with fried heads and some ikura for sashimi. Next time I would skip either the rock shrimp or crab tempura since both were fried and I didn't realize it at the time of ordering.   Overall a solid meal with some fun new friends."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting any Nobu locations, and unfortunately didn't get to try as much as I had hoped to (for various reasons) so this review will primarily be regarding the service, although I will talk a little about what I ate.  My friend and I had intended to have dinner here before going to see Britney Spears, but it was a somewhat last minute decision so called around 5:30 pm to see how busy they would be at 7:00 pm. The hostess on the phone was rude and could not give me the slightest estimate on what the anticipated wait time for a 7pm on Saturday was. She quickly rushed me off the phone.   We decided to try and go anyway, so we arrived and (I assume the same hostess) was SO RUDE. We were asking questions about wait times for seating at the bar and the sushi bar and she acted as if she did not want to give us the time of day. The wait for the sushi bar was 20 min so we decided to wait and grab a drink at the bar.   Things got better. We ordered drinks and immediately a hostess arrived to take us to the sushi bar, so the bartender brought the drinks over to us. She was super nice, helpful, and the drinks were great (although it is difficult to mess up a dirty martini).   The first sushi chef we had was quick and friendly, but not very chatty. We only ordered a few rolls because we were somewhat in a rush. I highly recommend the soft shell crab! The second chef we had was friendlier and funny. Our waiter was pleasant and attentive, however mostly unremarkable.   From what I've heard about Nobu, I expected a better experience. It wasn't terrible, and I will update the review when I am able to go try more of the food selection, but I also didn't expect my best experience there to be with the bartender. The lower rating is attributed to what I experienced versus my expectations for Nobu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Drinks, food, servers, atmosphere-- everything was great and we had a great time!  First off, the server was great. He did an excellent job explaining all the drinks, dishes, and dinner style to us, and he was a great sport joking around with us, as we were there for a bachelorette. We looked at the menu to decide if we wanted to order our own dishes or do their family style / chef-chosen dishes. He told us he could get us full / satisfied for ~$50-60, so we decided to go with their shared style dishes.   About the family style: he asked a few questions about dishes we liked, our taste, and whether we liked fish / red meat, and they came out with a bunch of dishes for us to try. Overall, we had 6 dishes, and they were all really great. 1) Yellowtail jalapeno. We specifically asked for this dish, but it was already on their list for us. This dish was so delicious; the fish was so good and the flavor was amazing. 2) Salmon sashimi. This was very good too (but I did like the previous one more). 3) Popcorn shrimp. This dish was okay; some of the girls really liked it, and it was good, but it didn't stand out to me. 4) Yellowtail collar. One of the girls asked for this dish, and it was amazing. The meat was very tender and flavored very well. 5) Steak. We all got one piece of this steak, and it was very delicious. Extremely tender and so yummy. 6) Cod in lettuce wrap. The cod was so good, and I wish there were more in that little lettuce wrap.  Overall, we weren't stuffed, but satisfied. The food was all really great, and we all liked our drinks too. Try their special martinis! I had the elderflower and lychee and it was great.   I definitely want to come back and try more dishes!!"}
{"text":"OK, this place is expensive, sure.  If you go and order some maguro, unagi, and a dragon roll you'll probably be disappointed.  But I wanted to see everything they could offer so I did the tasting menu, and it was just plain awesome.   Definitely a few dishes that I'll remember for some time.  There was this fatty tuna cylinder floating in a mix of soy/wasabe with caviar on top that was simply fantastic.    $175 a person lighter later, and not only was I satisfied but happy to have had the experience of eating here.  Absolutely a top notch restaurant in the land of famous chain/celebrity chef restaurants."}
{"text":"Heaven on Earth!! Presentation, quality, outstanding service...it is no wonder Howard Stern hits and raves about the one in NYC (one of 3 versions)!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Nobu, best sushi ever! We got the Omakase, 8 courses. The courses were delicious and not too adventurous. It was A LOT of food. Most of the courses were raw, with a delicious beef dish in broth towards the end. The dessert was chocolate lava cake with matcha ice cream, extremely tasty! Our server was great. The cocktail menu is also worth checking out. Will definitely be back to Nobu in the future."}
{"text":"Sushi is basically my favorite food ever so I've been to MANY sushi places. This place is just so incredibly overpriced for what it is. I mean, this is even when you're expecting Nobu prices.   First, if you're looking for a sushi meal, this isn't the place. In fact, the waiter told us upfront that they're not known for their sushi-they're known for their hot and cold dishes. These dishes are all smallish portions for a hefty price tag. Everything was good, but not stellar. There was nothing particularly innovative or fresh about the dishes here. I felt it was kinda all very 2010? The best thing about the dishes is probably the presentation, which is important, but it won't carry the day alone. The decor is nice and the ambience is nice. But the food and pricing was just kinda ridiculous. It was so disappointing after having high expectations!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night.  We had dinner at Nobu in NYC years ago and loved it then.  This dinner did not disappoint.    We shared the tempura rock shrimp and black miso cod.  Both delicious and I could have easily just have ordered another one of either versus trying something different.  But I had a spicy tuna handroll - also very good.  My husband ordered the yellowtail collar - I was not a fan of this as it smelled very fishy but he liked it a lot.  Also the edamame was warm with sea salt - never had it this way - very good.  But I am a salt-o-holic :-)  The service was very good.  Our waiter came back enough to check on us without it being intrusive.   I had the Champagne 95 cocktail - yum.  It was a Sunday night at 9:30pm (and closer to 11pm when we left) and it was crowded so imagine Friday and Saturday nights get pretty crazy and since its Vegas there are a lot of late diners.  Definitely recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"This was out first time here. The food was amazing and service was exceptional. A little rushed but would definitely return. The atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here, especially with all the hype.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.   There were 8 of us for a bachelorette party, the service was poor considering the price point for this restaurant. While the server did warn us the rolls are 'very standard', It seems like if you're a sushi/japanese restaurant of this reputation you should have 'standard' anything. Granted the yellowtail with jalapeno was nice, but again - not drop your jaw amazing.  Besides that, the taxi line at the hard rock is NOT worth it."}
{"text":"Seriously, one of the best restaurant experience I've ever had. Besides the exceptional food, the service also stands out. I ended up staying in Vegas by myself and decided to treat myself with Nobu. I was worried that people will judge me for being alone at a restaurant but servers and hostess made me feel so comfortable while eating. I chose chef's special where each dish is created by the chef that is not on the menu. After 8 small plates with special 24k dessert they made for me, I was overjoyed with the experience at Nobu. It's worth every penny."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!  All the standards from Nobu NYC, Hamachi with Jalapeno, Black Miso Cod, Rock Shrimp Tempura, and Seared Ahi Salad with Salsa are all personal favorites.  If you are looking to treat yourself the Kobe Beef is amazing.  The bamboo Saki presentation is pretty cool.    Great service!"}
{"text":"Hi, I love you.  Love,   Tracee  Okay okay, I'll write something with a little more substance.  Their food is great - I usually get the Omakase so it's a nice surprise of edible goodness that I wouldn't have otherwise ordered.  Yum yum yum.  Fresh.  Flavorful.  Heaven.   So how do I REALLY feel about the place?  Eh, it's alright.  =P"}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced and gimmicky.  If you came up big after a night of gambling and had some money to burn then maybe.  One positive note was our waiter.  He was very knowledgeable and helped us navigate the voluminous menu with patience and class.  We all liked the Hokusetsu sake and it's definitely worth the premium price."}
{"text":"A good, high-end sushi place.  It's pleasing that they enforce a dress code being that it's within the Hard Rock that can border trashy.  The sushi is fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh.  You're paying for quality and you are getting it."}
{"text":"#1 Nobu experience: A friend brought me, and introduced me to the Black Cod Miso - I've been a fan ever since. Following that we had some amazing sushi, but for the life of me I unable to remember past the cod when thinking back.  Every visit to Nobu should start with the Black Cod Miso. :)"}
{"text":"OMG!  This is the best Japanese experience I've ever had. I had the chef tasting menu and each dish was more delicious as it came out. Don't leave Vegas without eating at Nobu!"}
{"text":"Nobu is my favorite Japanese place! I am extremely sad that there isn't a Nobu in San Francisco. I heard about Nobu from my sister who is a huge foodie and she told me this is the place to go if you are in Vegas. I was a bit hesitant because I typically don't like sushi or sashimi, which is something nobu is known for. I decided to go anyway because my boyfriend loves Japanese food.  When I were there, I was in awe. First off, the restaurant is beautiful. The interior design is mesmerizing and has a unique feel to it. I made the mistake of not making a reservation, but there were able to seat me next to the sushi bar right away.   Our waiter was awesome! He was super knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor. Being in front of the sushi chefs was also a great experience because everything they were making looked delicious.    We ordered the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño that was with yuzu and cilantro. OMG, it was amazing! It was like nothing I ever had before. It was so full of flavor. Unlike other normal sushi restaurants, I wanted to get more and more sashimi. Anyone who doesn't like raw fish should go here and try it. You just might change your mind!  Another memorable dish we got was the seared trout with flash fried spinach which was also spectacular. I have never tasted flash fried spinach and it was definitely different, but delicious. I would also recommend the eggplant hot dish. Equally as amazing.   Now we left with a bill of $200, but we were full. So if you are willing to pay a little extra and get the best Japanese food in the US, go here!"}
{"text":"I love this place.    Came here on my Bacheloratte weekend, yep!  we did the whole weekend at the Hard Rock!    We had the Omakase, everything was DELICIOUS!  The best's gotta be the Toro Tartar with Caviar!  Also the miso black cod!  We ended up ordering extra orders of the cod.  I've been to the one in Malibu, but my experience here in Vegas was a much pleasant one.  Maybe because it's VEGAS BABY..."}
{"text":"Really like the ambience of the place but I seen many people out of dress code. I cam suited and booted with a dress shirt and tie but one of the people next to me had an affliction shirt on lol...The food was excellent. The fish was really fresh and the chefs selection which was 200 a person was the greatest sushi adventure I've had to date. food was very vibrant"}
{"text":"First off: don't go here. It's too expensive. Three of us rang up a bill of over 300 dollars and that was after a steep, steep discount courtesy of a spousal employee.  With that out of the way ... the eats are awesome. I'd like to be articulate about it but awesomeness is simply its essence. Just tell the waiter to start bringing whatever the chef recommends and you'll let him or her know when to slam on the brakes.  Service was very friendly. Decor is eh but I wasn't worried about it with the deliciousness in front of my face.  I think there's a temptation to be contrarian about this establishment but if you're honest with yourself, you'll agree that the food deserves the hype."}
{"text":"Ate here last year and gave it a strong rating. Leave the menu to the waiter and chef and I promise you a 5 star meal. Be prepared to pay for tho however $200 per head, without drinks, will provide you an amazing experience. Example. Aged soy, truffle oil toro or how about yellow fin toro blanketing foire gras topped by aged soy and a thin jalapeño pepper. Exquisite dishes. If you want the same ole rolls and same ole standards, go elsewhere because you're not leveraging the talents of these chefs."}
{"text":"Wow! I never realized how great Nobu was until we came here before a show at the Colosseum. We even have a location at home in DFW. We'll definitely hit it up! The food is well cured, prepared and presented. It's as delicious as artistic as you'll find. For two, don't be surprised if you spend $200+."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here not too long ago for a fancy date night out. The location is a bit hidden within the Hard Rock since the signage blends in, but it's right next to Culinary Dropout. Once you get inside the dining room is lively and bright. I would have liked the lighting to be a bit more dim to make the mood somewhat more intimate, but either way it was enjoyable.   The dining experience was unique and like nothing I've personally done before. Our waiter asked us what our favorite flavors were, what our plans were for the night, if we had any allergies or diet restrictions and what our budget was per person. From there, he would bring out dishes for us almost as a surprise. I really enjoyed this since it forced us to try new things we might not have originally ordered and it was exciting to see what would be next.   Some of my favorite items from the night were the Tasmanian Ocean Trout Pan Roasted and the Salmon Belly in a mustard sauce. Both of these dishes were 5/5 for me. They were cooked/prepared perfectly and the flavors were outstanding. I also enjoyed the Yellowtail Sashimi and Rock Shrimp, these were 4/5 for me.   This place was excellent from the food to the house exclusive Sake to the outstanding service from all staff members we encountered. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others for an epic date night or birthday celebration."}
{"text":"NY outpost far surpasses LV location.  only saving grace was the delish scallop dish. very disappointed they messed up the signature miso black cod and the yellowtail w/ jalapeno.    maybe i went on an off night?"}
{"text":"I went there a few years ago and it was amazing...............  I am from Japan and the foods taste brought the feeling of some kind of nostalgia..... I believe it's because the qualities are extremely high and they follow the traditional Japanese taste. Actually it was a spiritual experience."}
{"text":"I visited here last april for my birthday dinner and was not really impressed by the food or atmosphere. The waitress was less than helpful and our seat was in an odd place in the restaurant. The food was good but overpriced."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat at Nobu since I first learned about the NY location when I was in high school.  Now, my age has doubled and I still never thought I would get to try it.  My dad was here for NAB in April and in front of him, Eric R. surprised me: for my birthday we had a staycation reserved at Nobu Hotel and Nobu Restaurant!!!  I was beyond excited - supposedly we got \"preferential seating\" if we were hotel guests, but I never figured out what that meant.  The restaurant entrance is right next to the Nobu Hotel lobby, so it was easy to get dressed up and walk to the front.  We were seated immediately in the back of the restaurant, very close to another 2-top where we could easily hear the next party's conversation, so we were forced to chat with them sometimes.  Service was very slow, though our server was nice, we were surrounded by huge round tables with parties of 6 or more and it was hard for us to get his attention at all.  Eric R. had whiskey and 7, and I got the cracked basil cocktail with soju, yuzu juice, and pink peppercorns, tasty but tiny for $16.  Since this is a once-in-a-lifetime meal, we decided to order for ourselves rather than do Omakase.  The server suggested we do cold dishes, then hot, then sushi, then dessert.  We started with 2 cold dishes: yellowtail tartare with caviar, and beef new-style sashimi.  When the tartare arrived, it was doused in wasabi-soy dressing, very overpowering and not noted on the menu.  Eric was able to eat most of the top part that was not sitting in the dressing, and I ate the rest.  The server tried to convince us to order another one without sauce - no way!  The new style sashimi was amazing - thinly sliced beef topped with chive and sesame, seared by hot sesame oil accompanied by yuzu juice and soy.  It was so good that the ladies next to us then ordered it.  Our next course was hot: black cod miso and nasu (eggplant) miso.  They came together, perfectly flavored.  The cod was delicate and the eggplant skin crispy but soft inside.  Our third course, sushi, was ordered in 3 increments: toro scallion maki, nigiri: hamachi belly, salmon belly, scallop, saba with kelp, amaebi with fried head, ikura, fluke, uni, anago, big eye tuna, temaki: yellowtail jalapeno, negihama, salmon skin with avocado.  The big eye was sooo fatty and amazing.  All of it was amazing actually!  Fresh and delicate, served with tart yuzu soy.  Lastly, we ordered the banana harumaki for dessert (banana, dulce de leche in spring roll with passionfruit sauce) - it came out with a candle and Happy Birthday scripted in chocolate!  The next morning we did Nobu in-room dining for breakfast.  I had zosui (rice soup with tofu, mushroom, egg) and Eric R. had the breakfast okonomiyaki (with egg batter Osaka-style).  It was very good.  I really enjoyed my special birthday staycation meals and if I ever went back to Nobu I would sit at the sushi bar for sure!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Nobu due to some friends being in town for business. I probably wouldn't have went there otherwise but I wasn't paying so I said, \"Why Not!\"   On the pricey side but well worth it...we ended up sharing many of the dishes.  We started with the edamame - it wasn't really anything special next time I would probably skip!  Maine lobster salad - I'm not a big lobster fan due to the texture but this salad was really good, highly recommended.  Wagyu Gyoza - the wagyu was super tender and flavorful!  Shrimp with the spicy garlic - one of my favorite dishes. Shrimp was tender and the sauce complemented it perfectly!  Lastly, we had the toban-yaki beef tenderloin - the meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. Defiantly a must try.  When I go back I will be trying the Japanese wagyu!  The staff was on point and service was impeccable, knowing every dish and what complemented it!  Of course this restaurant is on the strip so you will end up paying more but if you want a good night out and willing to spend the money, why not?"}
{"text":"My mother-in-law wanted to eat there after seeing an article.  We had the Lobster Tempura, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Edamame, a Lobster Taco, a King Crab Taco, Chilean Sea Bass, Beef Toban-Yaki, Teriyaki Beef, and Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream.  The Ice Cream was not good. No one at the table liked it.  The two tacos weren't worth the $19 that we spent on them.  They were the size of a cocktail frank, and a complete waste of money.  For me the best item was the Yellowtail Jalapeno.  Very good.  My wife and mother in law aren't sushi people and I forced them to try it.  They both loved it and wanted more, too bad I ate it all."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was spot on. Our waiter was friendly and really helpful since it was our first time here. Not sure what it's called exactly but it might've been the chef's selection? Not sure but we had multiple courses and each one was delicious. My favorite part of my meal was when they served us a tuna wasabi tartare of some sort and it had this cute little fruit, it looked like a kumquat but it tasted amazing like candy!! Need more of that in my life!"}
{"text":"I'm a japanese. But I don't like this restaurant . Because SUSHI is terrible, and too expensive. But waiter is veryvery friendly."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I didn't give this place five stars is because their servers can be pushy. Am I in a nice restaurant or on a used car lot?  We typically sit at the bar where the bartenders don't try to sell you everything on the menu.  About the food: it's delicious.  They have a jalapeño tofu dish (similar to the famous yellowtail) and it is a vegetarian's dream!"}
{"text":"A bit late - I was out there in mid-December and just catching up on some reviews.    WOW.  Second time I've been here and this one was my December B Day trip.  It was our last night in Vegas with just two friends left who had flown in to see me from Florida (yes, they're awesome).  We had some Saki at the bar.  We talked to some people at the bar -  from LA I think..(it was my birthday a month ago leave me alone).  We ordered OFF menu.  We trusted out server.  We trusted our Itamae (Chef).    It.  Was.  Phenomenal.  So good.   He kept us under the price point was asked, offered a fantastic array of options, and kept us full on drinks.  I'm so glad I went back and let the server \"dictate\" what we would have (did't have that freedom on the first trip).  Such a good idea.  I'd give 6 stars if I could...sorry I don't have photos, but you should go.  If you don't mind a bit of an up charge (location and tourists) it's so worth it but real easy $100/person if you're really enjoying the place and drinking.  Honestly the best I've had."}
{"text":"Incredible.  Can't wait to go back again!  Everything was delicious including;  yellowtail jalapeño, wagyu and salmon \"tacos\", rock shrimp tempura, Japanese mushrooms, and Chilean sea bass w/basal mic teriyaki.   It is on pricey side but you're paying for the name, and location."}
{"text":"If Japanese food is your thing the Nobu experience is impeccable. At first bite the mixtures and textures of Peruvian sauces compliment the fish incredibly well. I adored the oyster shooters (the perfect starter) and the sashimi the most. Tried toro, salmon, and yellowtail with jalapeño- all tasted so fresh and exotic with the ponzu and spicy flavors. White fish with chili paste was a close second to the sashimi platter, Wagyu beef incredibly tender.  Also, did I mention the drinks were phenomenal? The lychee martini was good and strong, the cucumber martini was refreshing, the mango and passion super sweet and fruity (would suggest for a fruity drinker) and last but not least the favorite drink was the Hakka Nigori. The Hakka Nigori was like a Mexican mojito but instead with sake- chilled, minty, strong and delicious! The ambiance made me feel like I was in a Japanese hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  The service was fantastic and our server helped us decide what to order on the menu. I would go back again and completely trust my server with the menu and have them decide for me, they're that good! Great service, top 5 favorite restaurants in Vegas and I will be back. Can't wait to try Nobu Caesars location!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Some of the highest quality fish and sushi you will ever find. The sushi melts in your mouth. Totally worth the price. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My husband, sister, and I went to Nobu while on a trip to Las Vegas.  The atmosphere was really pretty, and our service was excellent.  Our waiter was friendly, professional,  and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  He suggested that because the menu is so large, that if we were interested we could just give him our budget and preferences, and he would design a meal for us.  We decided to do that, and it was fun being surprised by each course.  The food is beautifully presented, and we loved the unique preparation of the sashimi dishes.  The chefs incorporate flavors such as citrus and cilantro, which is something I've never had at a Japanese restaurant.  The black cod melts in your mouth and is a must when dining here. I'd also highly recommend the rock shrimp.  There was a wonderful beef dish, and for dessert the huge mound of shave ice with two syrups, berries, and mochi was impressive and not too heavy.  The food and service were top of the line, so why am I giving it only 3 stars, you ask?  The answer is the prices.  I am talking about $18 beers.  I am talking about $10 bottles of water (and we would have been happy with tap water).  To give you an idea of how pricey this place is, our food bill was $200 but the drinks and tip added another $200.  That would be easy enough to do, but we were not sitting around drinking ourselves under the table.  Between the three of us we had one glass of sake and four beers.  Five drinks, that is all!  Be careful if you decide to dine here.  You could very easily go broke, as it's one of the most expensive, if not THE most expensive, place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Yeah I get it.. Its Vegas, everything is overpriced and the restaurants have some of the best chefs in the business. Well, im a sushi fanatic, and I live in LA. I have found places like Sushi Joint in Glendale, and even the Wokcano chain in Burbank. Both offer, in my opinion some fantastic Sushi. Then comes the overpriced Nobu in the Hard Rock. Sure the presentation is nice, but when the waiter told me to eat cloves in between bites of the Yellowtail I was laughing in the inside. No eating cloves in between bites does NOT make the YellowTail taste any better than normal.   You know what this place is, its above average Sushi that if you believe the nonsense, you might think this place is something amazing. But I thought the Sushi had a stronger fish taste than normal, and the dishes to be overpriced for the quality/quantity that was given. Its ok, its better thank ok.. but its not $150 for two people ok.  We have amazing sushi in LA, so I wasn't impressed with Nobu."}
{"text":"This is literally going to be the hardest review I will ever write because this is LITERALLY THE BEST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. Let's put this into perspective: I've been to one of the best restaurants in the world, Le Bernardin in New York City, which is three Michelin Stars. So by definition, I have eaten at a world renowned restaurant (which up until now, was the best restaurant I have ever been to). Yet, Nobu is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at. My uncle treated me, my best friend and boyfriend to an all expenses paid trip to Vegas, including dinner reservations to a couple amazing restaurants on the strip. When we arrived at Nobu, I was pretty tired from drinking (Vegas you know), so my friend and I waited to the side while my uncle and boyfriend got drinks at the bar. We were seated right on time at a regular table. Despite knowing that Nobu wasthe first to start Teppanyaki, we side-stepped the grill and went straight for the main menu. This is probably the best decision I have ever made in my life. We ordered so many dishes from all over the menu: yellowtail jalapeno, sashimi salad, wagyu beef tacos, miso black cod, teriyaki beef tenderloin, wagyu gyoza, shrimp and vegetables, toro roll and salmon roll. Before knowing anything about this restaurant, I thought of it like Sugarfish where the raw fish took center stage, but it was quite obvious that the hot dishes are the best things to order. Out of all of the things we ordred, we couldn't stop raving about the miso black cod and the beef tenderloin, mostly the cod though. We were talking about the black cod even after dinner the NEXT day AFTER eating at STK!!! This fish is really one of the best you can eat- its a really oily fish and my uncle says its very politically correct since they are raised in a very healthy, sustainable fishery lol. It is also referred to as a butterfish, which is what Roy's calls it if you've ever been there. The miso has the perfect amount of flavor and the fish just flakes off when you take a bite. In pictures it looks small but the portion size was very generous upon getting our plates! The Beef Tenderloin was cooked PERFECTLY medium, and even though the teriyaki was a little overpowering, the meat was prepared flawlessly. We only wish that the meat didn't come with any sauce at all because it really does speak for itself. Other honorable mentions are the wagyu tacos and yellowtail jalapeno. I'm not a big fan of yellowtail normally, but this particular fish and sauce were really delicious. Our family loves wagyu beef, so naturally we ordered a couple things with wagyu. These tacos had the perfect balance of textures, with the wonton shell and the tender, flavorful pieces of beef. The beef almost tasted like it was melting in your mouth! Being full Japansese myself, this place is definitely not traditional, but your server tells you that straight up. If you're looking for something that you'll find in Japan, you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for a restaurant that will blow you're freaking mind, THIS IS IT. Only complaint were the rolls - we thought that the fish would be whole but instead they were all chopped up which wasn't very impressive taste wise. Other than that, Nobu is a Japanese food experience of a lifetime, and one everyone should experience."}
{"text":"Black Cod Miso was very good, as were the whitefish  and salmon \"New Style Sashimi\". Tasmanian Ocean Trout which was way too salty. Also had 2 sushi rolls that were okay but forgettable. Service was good, decor was nice (mixture of modern and classic). A little overpriced (paying for the cache of eating here), but enjoyed the business dinner here."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place.  I know it's popular in LA and have never been so we were walking by in the Hard Rock and looking for a place to have dinner and thought why not.  We were seated right away in the lounge area so that was good.  There were 3 of us dinng...our waitress didn't write anything down and I may have jinxed her when I asked if she was going to remember all of it because she forgot what my husband ordered.  She was friendly enough but service was slow.  They brought out all our food and it was pretty boring.  I ordered the Shrimp Tempura hand roll and it wasn't rolled well and was basically just rice with a shrimp tempura and a tiny bit of sauce.  I ordered Albacore sushi and it was not that great...albacores my favorite.  The salmon sashimi was okay.  I'd definitely say this place is overpriced for what you get.  After we were done eating, the waitress brought us another order of everything we had just eaten and said the kitchen messed up and we could have this food for free.  That was cool but since the food wasn't that great, we weren't too thrilled.  The tables in the lounge area are too short...my husband was too tall to sit at them so he sat on the booth side instead of the chairs...wierd."}
{"text":"Nice upscale yet relaxed atmosphere. Food was EXCELLENT. The wagyu tacos, are small but pack a mighty punch. I was thoroughly impressed with the service & expertise provided by our waiter Jay. Oh....the spare ribs....DELISH!"}
{"text":"Nobu at Ceasars is a must go everytime I am in Vegas.   Warning: Sushi and Sashimi is so good, eating here will make it difficult to enjoy similar dishes anywhere else.   I have made reservations and ate in the main dining room, however I prefer sitting at the sushi counter which is usually available by Walk in.   Best Rolls we have had are when we keep an open mind and ask the sushi chef to prepare his favorite.   I crave the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. They drizzle a citrus sauce on it that is to-die-for.  If you can sit on the far end of the sushi counter from the entrance, you may get the added entertainment of watching the Hibachi Chefs prepare at the private party Hibachi tables.  Good selection of unique cocktails, my favorite is the Lychee Martini.  I live in Seattle which has good sushi options but the best Sushi/Sashimi I have ever had is at Nobu. And the the fun and beautiful environment makes it a special experience.  I have been to Nobu at Ceasars 4 times in the past year and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a really tough review to write because the food was absolutely outstanding but our waiter had the tackiest and most unprofessional approach to service I've ever witnessed.  We brought a client here for dinner on a Tuesday evening. Obviously, the evening is on our tab and we are well aware we are in a nice establishment. Our waiter asked if anyone had been to Nobu before, which some had. One key person - my boss, who was paying the bill - said he had been to multiple Nobus. Well, then the waiter proceeds to talk about how the menu can be a la carte or created as a tasting menu, and then went over pricing points, like, if we didn't want to have a nice, classy meal, we should do a la carte, but if we wanted to go above and beyond, tasting was the way to go.  AWKWARD. You never want to make a client feel like they can't order what they want, and you also never want to make them feel unimportant by, say, NOT ordering the tasting menu.   We, of course, ordered the tasting menu.  Beyond that snafu, our waiter had way too many tables and wasn't quick enough with our requests or needs. We would have likely had another glass or two of wine but he never was around. We had to wave him down for the bill. Unacceptable at this price point for any of that to happen.  The tasting menu was good. A variety of options for everyone - even the two people in our party who don't eat raw fish (sigh.) However, when bringing out dishes for the other four people at the table that ARE raw fish, bring out an option for those two. At the same time. This didn't happen and they often sat and stared while we gobbled down heaps of sashimi and the like.  I will say, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno was one of the best things I've ever tasted. If it's possible for fish to melt in your mouth, this did it. I've never had anything so fresh and satisfying. And that was the first course.  But based on service alone, I wouldn't return to this place. Or, if I did, I'd sit at the bar or at a table with a friend - not a customer dinner where we are made to feel awkward and not waited on to the standard in which we should have been."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food...no, but really good modern Japanese food. Yellowtail with Jalapeno - everytime I order this dish.  Probably could eat 3 plates Black Cod Miso - Excellent but you better eat it with rice or share it  because the miso can become overwhelming.  But that could've been the 4 bottles of Grey Goose the night before speaking. Creamy Crab - tasty but salty, again good sharing. Creamy rock shrimp tempura - excellent. Blue fin toro with caviar - excellent. Blue fin toro with truffles - it was a special at the time and not really worth the $100 for 6 pieces.  Just order Blue fin toro sushi, sometimes simple is better. Would venture here every other trip to LV.  Haven't tried other Nobus to compare but will get a chance in the Bahamas."}
{"text":"I feel like the name speaks for itself and they don't need a guy like me to tell you the food is good here. That being said I had one of the best Japanese style meals of my life at this place. We let the chef decide what we were going to eat and told them what we like and didn't like and they custom tailored it for us that way. Once you have one of their incredible craft cocktails (I had a couple of highballs) the waiter will start to bring you out courses at a perfect speed. They wait and watch your every move and make sure all your needs are catered too. The food is second to none. Must haves (I don't know if it's always on the menu) are the black cod entree which tastes like nothing I've ever had before. Uni spoons, the fish carpaccio with the famous Yuzu vinaigrette and we had a matcha flavored cronut (tm) for dessert. If you're in the vegas or Nyc or Malibu area stop in for a real treat."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice - once on our Honeymoon and once in March 2011.  We are a challenge - vegetarian and Gluten free.  Both times they were extremely accomodating and knowledgable.  We had tofu sashimi, hearts of palm salad, a mushroom rice dish, various rolls, and a flourless chocolate cake we will never forget.  The ambiance reminds me of an urban outfitter and I mean that in a great way.  The service is world-class.  Friendly, appropriately casual and approachable, while also knowledgable.    The food is fantastic."}
{"text":"We had an absolute amazing experience here. Went in a group of 7 and Amber was our server. She was incredible! So friendly and helpful. She made great recommendations and everything we ate was incredible!!! The soft shell crab was my favorite and the vanilla tart dessert was to die for (I seriously could have eaten like 5 of them myself). This was definitely a splurge but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and our server, Arnold, was passionate and knowledgeable about Nobu's.  Very expensive, but a taste experience unlike many we have had, so strongly suggest trying numerous things if you can budget about $200-$250 a person with drinks.  Small portions but beautifully created dishes.  Bravo Nobu!!"}
{"text":"Nobu is one of my favorite Sushi Restaurants when in Las Vegas or in San Diego.  The Sashimi is always fresh and the flavors are amazing.  Their Sea Bass in Black Bean Sauce and the Squid Ink Pasta was delicious.  Not to mention their tempura Scallops."}
{"text":"Was very excited to go to nobu, I made advanced reservations. Service was excellent, food mediocre, small portions and very expensive. Another thing that was ridiculous, barracuda sashimi for $40. Paid less there for tuna which was very funny because tuna should be more expensive. My wife and I, had three sushi orders and and app. 185.00 for that price would much rather go to Flemings, the palms, or Ruth Chris. If you want good sushi go to koi in planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Short version: Very good food, very expensive. If you don't care about price (either you are rich, are splurging, or got comped), this is an awesome place to eat.  Long version: It was my last night in Vegas and I decided to splurge. This is definitely an expensive place to eat. Get over it.   The restaurant decoration is classy with several areas to choose from: the bar, the lounge, the sushi bar, and booths. There is a high ratio of waiter to customer. Most of the waiters are very conscious about what's happening on each of their tables and empty dishes are cleared within a minute. Some of the bust help were not as quick but that's understandable. Jonathan was my server and he was very knowledgeable about each of the dishes. He even know the proper Japanese names for the food and dishes. Impressive.  Now the food: I had 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, and some sushi.  The lobster taco and Wagyu taco were very good. The shells were deep fried gyoza wrapping. The lobster were steamed and the wagyu were grilled (I think). Topped with a variety of toppings, the bite size (literally 1 bite each) taco had great flavor.  Even though they were a bit small, even for appetizer. 3 star for this dish.  The second appetizer was the yellowtail with jalapeno. The fish was super fresh. I live in Hawaii and I know what fresh yellowtail taste like. This IS fresh. The ponzu sauce was light and did not overwhelm the dish. The thin slices of jalapeno made perfect compliment.  Each bite was a delight. 5 star for this. (Incidentally, a week later, I was back in Hawaii at Dash Gastropub and they had the same dish.  Let's just say it was good contrast.)  I had the black cod miso because I read so much about it. A good size piece of cod, marinated in miso, rinsed off, and grilled. The flavor was very good but it was strong so I had to order a bowl of rice ($5?!) to enjoy it fully. BTW, the ginger sprout garnish was a very good compliment.  I wish there were more than 2.  Even though it dish itself was very good ... but coming from Hawaii, we are used to eating miso butterfish. I can buy it marinated in the supermarket, take it home, rinse it off, grill it and it would have turned out to be exact same thing... for a fraction of the price. Value wise... I have ding it. 3 stars.  The pork belly kushiyaki with spicy miso is basically cubes of pork belly (meat and fat, not skin tho), skewered, grilled, have a spicy miso paste brushed on, grilled again, and served. The pork was very tender. The fat did not feel fatty, the miso was tasty and flavorful. This is a very good dish and I would eat it any day. 5 stars.  If I have to pick on something, it would be that it is quite heavy so you probably shouldn't eat more than 2 skewers.  Ladies should look at 1 per person.  After the 4 courses, I needed a little bit more so I ordered some sushi.  The anago and unagi were excellent. In fact, this is the first time ever I like the anago better than the unagi in any restaurant. 4 stars each.  The snow crab leg was decent. 3 stars.  The soft shell crab maki on the other hand was a disappointment. The roll was gummy and the crab was not pronounced at all. Not going to order it again.  There is no question that this place serves good food.  Majority of the dishes are very well done. The main issue here remains: value. Would I eat here again?  In a heartbeat, as long as I don't have to foot the bill. Maybe I'll pay if I have a gold digger girlfriend that I need to impress..."}
{"text":"If you can manage to get a reservation, DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP.  It is the best sushi that I've ever had outside of Japan.  In fact, they actually fly the fish in fresh from Japan every single day.    My menu recommendations -- ie get these three things or don't bother going at all -- are the Miso Eggplant, the Yellowtail with Jalapeno and Cilantro in Yuzu Sauce, and the Thinly Sliced White Fish in Ponzu Sauce.  Though I have extensive experience with the NOBU menu, in my opinion these three dishes are the most outstanding options on the menu.  Now when I go to NOBU, I gorge myself by ordering multiples of just these three dishes.  I also recommend their restaurant beer brand.  It's lighter and more crisp than most Japanese beer, and in fact, tastes more like a Chinese beer to me."}
{"text":"Walked in about 520. Table open but only if we could give it back by 7 so we chose to eat at the bar. Mostly empty at the time but filled up quickly.  They put on the hockey game for us.   I got the chef's omakase for $175 and it was worth every single cent and decadent morsel of goodness.  It was nine courses. Seven cold and two hot. And I had about 14 different types of seafood - fish varieties and shellfish. Every single one was so tasty. Everything except two nigiri and the sample of yellowtail with jalapeño were off the menu so worth the customized experience.   Splurge on the wagyu. It's like eating butter and succulent meat fat.  And at $38 an ounce it's really not that expensive because it's so filling and better to savor a little than gorge on a lot.   My friends split a bottle of wine -$80 and it was really good. Semi sweet. Semi dry.   I had 3 cocktails including the award winning purple rain. SO GOOD! I'm a big fan of sweet drinks that are aesthetically pleasing so I loved the huge blood orange (purple colored) ice cube. Mango passionfruit drink was also great and very sweet. The Peruvian caipirinha is perfect for people who like ginger beer and a slightly spicier profile.   Service was top notch. I assume at the tables too but because we were at the bar we had several people always around to attend to our requests."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I have to drop their average number of stars for Nobu, well at least the one in Las Vegas.  I had high hopes for this place after dining at the one in Hawaii.  Total change of scenery here.  Very Loud and casual.  I should have known being that its in the Hard Rock Cafe, but I thought people would step it up here.  Had to knock off a star just for ambiance, & price (i dont mind paying high prices, but I expect a total experience for the price I pay)    Had to knock off a star for the food.  The Black cod with Miso was good but my was a little slimy and quite a couple of bones I had to pick out. For the price and caliber Nobu touts to be there should be no bones. The glass of wine we got tasted old also.     Luckily the Yellowtail sashimi w Jalepeno was still the highlight.    Not a place to get full at, expect to pay a lot, skip the edamame and bottled water, that'll add about 20 more to your bill...."}
{"text":"Celebrated my one year anniversary with my husband during my trip to Vegas. We made reservations a few days prior, and we got seated in a nice booth.   We opted for the omakase $125 menu, and it was delicious! Our server said this is a great option to try out the popular items on their menu. I also ordered a really delicious pineapple martini. I'd get it again.   The first four dishes ware served cold with raw fish. The sashimi was so fresh and melted in my mouth. The next two dishes were the hot protein dishes. I loved the miso cod dish. It was slightly sweet, but still tasted great. Next was the miso soup, which was a great way to end our savory meal. Last was dessert, which was amazing! This meal will fill you up, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"If it were only about the sushi, Nobu would get 5 stars from me. But, I knock off 2 stars for service. We walked in on a Saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. We went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were Nobu's house specialties, including \"new-style sashimi.\" These consist of the best fish, sashimi style, with delicate sauces and garnishes: yellowtail with jalapeno, live octopus with a Peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon with ponzu sauce, tuna with miso-mustard sauce. Everything was first-class, including the Junmai Daiginjo sake.  Then, I ordered the bento box chocolate cake dessert. We were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. No problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. Another ten minutes went by. Our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. He tried to give us a plateful of mochi ice cream to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful of mochi ice cream and then a chocolate cake. Another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. It was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. We ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? By this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already.   When our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. When I mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. But I was miffed that I even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.  Too bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. Even for a Saturday night in Vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the high reviews for this place. Did I have a one-off terrible experience? Went here in December with my father and husband for a celebratory dinner. Had a good (overpriced) cocktail at the bar, then we were seated at possibly the worst table in the place, despite our months-early reservation. Got a booth back by the server pow-wow area / cash register, next to a massive table of really drunk and really loud patrons. Ok, fine. Ordered many dishes, including small plates, entrees, sushi rolls, etc. My father makes it clear to the waiter he doesn't like mushrooms (this is pertinent later).   Our 3 tacos come out - $34 worth of tacos - and they are the SMALLEST, most laughable portion size ever. I literally laughed out loud when they put them down. They were no bigger than lime wedges (I posted a photo). Very good, but ridiculously priced and sized. Ok, fine.  The other dishes start to come out, and they're timed terribly. Sushi after entrees, entrees at different times...I ate alone basically while my companions looked on, waiting for their food. My father's entree comes out and it's the WRONG one. Finally, when his actual dinner arrives, it's covered in mushrooms. The waiter never mentioned that could be a problem when my father placed his order, and the menu mentioned nothing about mushrooms. Ok, fine.  My husband's $80 sashimi chef's special comes out and it's also laughably undersized. Literally 9 pieces of fish for $80. When we go to Morimoto in Philadelphia, a $50 sashimi plate has easily 3x the amount of fish on it. Same quality. I get that it's Vegas but this was a joke. The waiter never explained what fish were on the plate either - just left my husband to guess. This was the last straw.  Overall the food is fine, but there are so many other places that serve comparable stuff at way better prices. Nobu is nothing special. I hope for the sake of other diners my experience is not typical, but it was enough to burn this frequent Vegas traveler. I will not be back."}
{"text":"One of my motto's is \"feast at Nobu whenever & wherever a Nobu is nearby.\" I just made that up.  Las Vegas Nobu did not disappoint.    The blue fin toro tartare with ossetra caviar ( my favorite caviar ) was SO bomb that I admit, I ordered it twice in the same meal. At 50 bucks a serving it wasn't cheap but it was so worth it for the amount of ossetra and toro in the dish.   I also had two uni shooters, omg so good.  Monkfish pate with caviar--YUM!!! Would probably skip next time for more uni.  Nobu crispy rice with tuna ( at this point in the meal I secretly unbuttoned my pants, stealth mode).   And of course the rock shrimp with jalepeno sauce.  Next we ( I was eating with one other person so you can't blame me for being a glutton), had the japanese wagyu tataki, which I have been craving since a recent trip to Japan. Melt-in-your-mouth good.  We both had the chef's daily omakase, which was outstanding, and finished with a light deconstructed cheesecake thing that I couldn't eat.  && THEN  I didn't eat for a day.  SO GOOD, expensive, yes but you get what you pay for! No regrets.   I knocked off one star because service was terrible and I felt like I was at a strip club lol ( seated in the bar)."}
{"text":"Food = Phenomenal  Service = Phenomenal Price = Super Pricey  Took a few of my friends there this past week and had an amazing meal.  We chose to simply have the waiter bring us their wonderful dishes one after another, which is an option on the menu by the way.  It was so delicious.  From torro to sushi, from beef to sashimi, it was simply amazing.    Our group had 9 courses including mouthwatering sushi towards the end of the meal.  What I enjoyed the most was how frequently the food arrived at the table.  Literally, we would finish a dish and about 2 minutes later another would arrive.  It was amazingly choreographed and simply delightful.  Every bite was amazing.    Keep in mind though, the price is significant for 4 people it ran me $800+ including tip and very little alcohol...  Some sake and a few beers were included.    Definitely recommend if you are looking for an evening of being a total foodie.  Every bite filled the table with conversation and a constant hum of \"yum\" and \"oh my\".    Enjoy Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Simply an AWESOME dining experience!  Give yourself a good 2 - 2.5 hours to savior every moment of the food and your time here!  Excellent service, scrumptious dishes, and fresh sushi!  You're going to be paying a pretty penny after all's said and done, but it will be your honor because this IS fine dining at it's best!!!  Recommendations:  Omakase + Black Cod Miso + Kobe Beef"}
{"text":"I was simply impressed by the service and food.  We ordered the $150 a person tasting menu, which came as I recall, about 7 courses. Each course was just devine.  The fish was well cut and well paired with seasonings and garnish.  My favorite was the yellowtail toro and the stone grilled wagyu.    Special mention should be given to the wagyu, which arrived raw with hot stones and salt on the side.  Dip the raw beef in salt, place on stone to cook for a second or two, and eat.  Simple but so mouth watering good.  This wagyu had desirable marbles of fat that melts, creating so much flavor that we had to fight for the last piece."}
{"text":"the jalenpeno hamachi, and the black cod were delicious and memorable. mmm makes me want to fly back there now."}
{"text":"Nobu has a wonderful reputation of first class service and amazing dishes. Here to say the Las Vegas restaurant is not exception. They prepare eve thing family style and will create menus to suit your tastes and budget. Sarika guided us through the menus and choices.  Fantastic service. The best dish was the black cod in a miso glaze. Wonderful. My only reservation is that you need to be cognizant of both your food and beverage budget. Outside of that, enjoy the wonderful flavors of the freshest fish in town,"}
{"text":"I didn't want to believe all the hype, and just wanted to go in with an open mind on this one.  So I did just that.  I went in with no expectations and came out a Nobu convert.    The miso black cod is a wonderful dish.  The fish is fattier/oiler than I expected, but delicious none the less.  The crispy rice with spicy tuna is out of this world.  So delicious we wanted to order another plate.  I also loved the tuna and jalapeno roll.  I wanted seconds on that as well.  I washed it all down with a ginger caipirinha, phenomenal.  The ambiance here is fantastic.  The staff are very attentive but don't hover over you.    All in all, this is a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"So many reviews on this place already, but I'm contributing because a few of the dishes our group sampled were truly outstanding.    Things you have to try: -yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno -Sea bass on bok choy (cooked) -Kobe beef w/mushrooms (cooked) -vanilla sake with dessert  Atmosphere: I likes the vibe, but it is pretty loud.   We had a client dinner for 8 at a round table and couldn't hear the people on the other side of the table.  Also, they sat us by the kitchen and when asked if we could move, they were unable to accommodate us, so minus one star.  The servers are 99% male, several of them very handsome, which is a bonus if you're a straight woman or gay man looking for some eye candy to accompany your meal.  Service was courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place at all. Way too dark, and the sushi menu was not too impressive The service and location was good though."}
{"text":"The last time that I was in Las Vegas this was the last meal that I had.  I needed a quick trip home for 10 days to settle some business in the area as I live bicoastal  Las Vegas and New Jersey I'm not as crazy about sushi on the east coast as I am on the west coast so usually when I'm home me and my friends always gather for brunch in sushi or happy hour that's just what we do there's always food involved My parents have a diamond card and gave it to me so I had rented a room for the last four nights that I was at the hotel and on my last day I went and I got some sushi by myself and finally checked out this new location there is another one inside the hard rock I have been to that location to times and the Noble in Malibu several times To be honest I think this was my favourite one I don't know if it was because I was alone or just because it happened to work out so well I was in a very happy mood I had some deals going on with real estate and everything was going well. Buying and selling so I was kind of celebrating I was able to get some champagne that I liked and just sat by myself and I ordered two specific roles and they gave me free saki.  I was waited on fairly quickly and seeded quickly with just the walking but I looked pretty nice  I did take me a bit to get my check because they started to get busy and I needed to catch a plane I wasn't even sure how much my bill was I fled down the first person that I could find and told them to get my server and couldn't wait any longer so I just left a $50 bill on the table and ran to the Bellmon for my luggage because my driver had arrived to take me to the airport I will often wonder if I owe them money or not but I think I took care of it I really didn't order much  I will say that this particular Noble is definitely better than the one in Malibu in the one in the hard rock nearby it's just down the street"}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal. Would not recommend getting sushi here the cooked dishes are definitely the way to go. Sushi was pretty standard but very expensive.  I was not wowed by the quality of the fish and considering the price I think there are better spots for sushi.  The fried snapper, chili paste and truffle oil edamame, hamachi with ponzu sauce,  and fried rice balls with spicy tuna. were some of my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best meal I've ever had in my life! And coming from a foodie like me, this is not an easy feat!  I made a reservation for the Nobu in the Hard Rock and ended up in the Nobu at Cesars Palace, they didn't have a table, but they accomodated us at the Sushi Bar and I can't say I was dissapointed.  Watching these guys perform their craft is pretty entertaining.   Two things that changed my view of food forever, the Kobe Beef (at $38 an oz) and the tuna belly (which absolutely melted in your mouth, literally).  There was also the Aboloni (which was delish!)   I mean, you know when you go to Nobu you'll get a good meal. I would suggest it for anyone who intends on sharing a special occasion with a special someone, because it ain't cheap :)  Also, I forgot to add that the service is impeccable! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Nobu is my favorite sushi place.  If you want traditional, delicious, fresh top of the line quality sushi, and don't mind spending the money, this is the place for you.  I have been to this Nobu more than ten times and I've loved it every time.  Im never afraid to order the more unusual items such as uni and ikura here, b/c i know it will be fresh and delicious every time.  If youre looking for crazy inventive, huge, fish on top of the roll sushi, and inexpensive, this is not the place for you.  The hot items on the menu are equally delicious."}
{"text":"Best meal EVER!!!! Came here for my friends bachlorette party since it was being paid for by another friends boyfriend. Gotta love a high roller! So there were 13 of us in our party & they were jumping through hoops for us. The service was the best I have ever had in Vegas. We decided to let the chef make us his best stuff and boy are we glad we did. The amazing food just kept coming out. There were so many dishes it was hard to keep track. My favorite was the black cod and the lobster.  We had bubbly flowing & so much sake I could barely get up without falling over! The bill ended up being over 3 grand for 13 people with endless drinks & endless food & desserts. By far the best meal I have ever had the pleasure of eating & it didnt cost me a thing. BONUS! Its good to be a woman..."}
{"text":"Our first stop during our trip to Vegas this past week. We decided to come here to celebrate my Aunties Birthday! My cousin and I have heard so much about the place we HAD to try it with our mother's during our mother/daughter trip to Vegas.  Here is what we ordered  Yellowtail w/ jalapeno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=DwKr-LhPVr9kFIVr4Q7PtQ: Very Delicious, my mother and cousin who do not eat sashimi even enjoyed the dish. After the dinner when I asked them what their favorite dish was this was on the top. It is slices of yellowtail sashimi w/ a type of ponzu sauce and good to eat with the small slice of jalapeno and cilantro. I think I've had similar dishes like this at other restaurants but I think b/c its from Nobu it just makes it that much better.   Sashimi Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=12QbNH80NCNJdBy_mZVnOg): The dressing on this salad was very good and tasty. It comes with mixed greens in the middle and like seared ahi layering the outside. I wish it had a couple of different types of Sashimi in the salad but that's okay, it still tasted good.   Scallops with filo on lettuce cups (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=NK22wem6XYcmO21jvgPJVQ): This was probably my favorite dish. The scallop melted in your mouth and the taste was pretty good. I think the scallops were made with a miso sauce and had green onions sprinkled on top. Whatever it was it was super super good. ahhh drool.  Whole deep fried cod or snapper I don't remember the name of the fish on top of sauteed veggies in a miso butter sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=vefN4PoI2zsBDZNyHZaAXQ): This was another special. The waiter told us that everyone raves about this dish. It came out and we were all in awe. It was pretty big. The table was in WOW when my mother and my auntie started laughing... they then asked one of the waiters how much it was $100.00.. WOW, didn't realize that when we ordered it. I think it should have been something that the waiter said, especially since it cost so much.  Needless to say the fish was delicious! You can eat almost every single piece of it. The fins where crunchy and were very good dipped in the miso butter sauce. The sauce was sweet with a little spicy. The sauteed veggies were also very good and eaten with the fish heavenly. We picked at this dish the whole dinner and still weren't able to eat the whole thing.  Bummer b/c we definitely tried, we knew we had to get our moneys worth if we were going to spend $100 on one dish.   Sushi and the Tempura Dinner: Nothing spectacular about either of these dishes. I don't even remember what rolls we got except for the house roll which wasn't anything special. I would definitely skip both if you are coming here. Get these at some other restaurant.   The service was good but not spectacular. They have a lot of people working here but nobody went out of their way to enhance our experience.   Overall I would come here again. There are a couple other things I would like to try off their menu."}
{"text":"Very friendly, informative, and FAST experience. Amazing food, would DEFINITELY recommend!!"}
{"text":"My expectations of food quality and service from this high end restaurant were more stringent given its reputation and price level.  Service was great: our waitress, Amber, provided good explanations and recommendations.  What made this a good dining experience was the way the dishes were served at the right temperature and appropriately timed to allow us to savor.  Cold dishes: the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño @ $39 (for a party of 4) meant two very thin slices each.  They were overwhelmed by an overabundance of ponzu sauce making it difficult to appreciate the true freshness of the fish.  Three out of the four kinds of kelp salad (except the bland white variety) were tasty.  However, most were not completely cut creating a challenge and awkwardness in sharing the small portions.  Hot dishes: the black cod done 2 ways (miso and butter lettuce wrap) was both superb.  The shrimp & Maine lobster that came on a bedding of shiitake & oyster mushrooms in a slightly spicy lemon sauce was flavorful.  The sea bass tempura style turned out to be ball-size bites served in balsamic teriyaki sauce (oddly reminiscent of Palm Tree Inn lemon chicken) that hindered appreciation of the soft moist fish.  After watching ten sushi chefs hustling behind the counter we decided to check their output.  Our orders (bonito, tamago, yellowtail and mackerel) were not remarkable or extraordinary.  The Inception Pinot Noir and Dashe Zinfandel wines were both decent."}
{"text":"OMG. If you're looking for the most incredible sushi/sashimi you've ever had, look no further. Decided to splurge on the 9 course omakase menu at Nobu, and despite the high price tag, it was completely worth it. This was the best food I've ever eaten in my life (and that's saying something- because I looooove food). It was so fresh, so well thought out, and the textures and flavors were beyond imagination. Everything was so harmonious.  Do it. You won't be sorry.  Menu: Yellowtail with yuzu sauce, salmon belly with miso, oysters on the half shell and big eye tuna with caviar, uni shooter, the most melt in your mouth wagyu that I've ever had, black cod with miso glaze,  king crab tempura, a selection of the freshest sushi, with tuna, whitefish, and salmon belly with yuzu soy, hamachi tempura with jalapeño sauce, and a coffee mousse with whiskey vanilla foam.   Absolutely incredible. My complements to the chef and the staff. A singularly amazing culinary experience."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of many Nobus around the country for years, and this one just doesn't measure up. Will never return - only the one in the Hard Rock for me in Vegas from now on. The biggest problem was the complete and utter gauging that was done to our group of 10. They saw \"expense account\" and decided to take us for every penny possible. Told us we could go only pre-fix and only have the most expensive items in insane quantities. We've had bigger groups at other Nobus (including Hard Rock) and never encountered anything like this. We wanted a few items that were not part of the set menu and were told we could only have them in addition. After five courses we were filling up and said we didn't want any more and were told that we couldn't eliminate anything - it was all pre-prepared. The sushi is pre-made?! I certainly hope not. At that point the sushi and dessert were still 3-4 courses away- yet we couldnt cancel any of it. The amount of food was disgusting and absurd, and didn't live up to previous Nobu experiences in taste or quality. Many of the people serving us had no idea what they were bringing, what was still coming etc.  It was likely over $500 per person and absolutely not worth it - over half was left uneaten, while they brought more and more food. It was absolutely ridiculous and very frustrating. What a horrible waste. They should be ashamed of themselves.  And it didn't taste as good as other Nobus on top of the outrageous service. Never again."}
{"text":"Well located and nice armosphere. This place is more name than anything! Our reservation was ok and waited for about 15 minutes to be seated. Service was average... Nothing yo brag about. The place is clean and restrooms were also clean. Now the food: We ordered the premium sushi and sashimi for $180 and got +/- 20 pieces.. The best and only impressive one was the Toro Tuna... For the rest, have eaten maybe better in average style sushi restaurants. \"Real\" wasabi was a treat though! Other dishes looked good, but never for the price. Their signature desert, the chocolate box, maybe avoid! Over cooked and nothing special. All in all, been there done that! No more for me!!!"}
{"text":"Just want to start with saying awsome experience, No issue..  Our server was great he's name is Cris..  it was our first time here. He explained everything very well about what is this restaurant offers. We order chef special it's 7 special plates from sushi to white meat to red meat to sushi! Definitely will be coming back to this restaurant.."}
{"text":"Went I went to this particular Nobu four years ago, it was outstanding. Perfection on all front. Really some of the best food and service I've ever had. Since then, I'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or Nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. Either way, it was still a great meal overall.   Hubs and I made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in Vegas. We put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. Our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. Maybe he was having a rough night. Regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...  Jalapeño hamachi: 5/5: Bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. Exactly what I remember about Nobu!   Ehu: 4/5: Per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail red snapper. I've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. Taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty.   Rock Shrimp: 3/5: Last time I was at Nobu, hubs and I ordered two servings of this. Not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. This go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy.   Black Cod: 3/5: Another dish that I used to love. This visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided.   Spicy Tuna Roll: 4/5: Standard spicy tuna. Fresh, delicious and on the mark.   This visit was a good one but not a great one overall. I'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping I came on an off-ish night!"}
{"text":"My first single star review! Disappointed with the service...was told 1 hour to 1.5 hour wait when I signed up with a party of 5. At 68 minutes I checked in and was told there was 3 people ahead of me. Felt pretty excited at that point, but at 2 hours still had no response. came back to find out that the same 3 people were still ahead of us. Came here with high hopes but was extremely disappointed.  Called for more insight and  turns out, don't expect to get in unless you have a reservation. But they will neglect to tell you when you sign up. There was TEN RESERVATIONS and three sign ups ahead of us. If they told me honestly, I would've gone elsewhere without wasting my time."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype.   Nobu isn't a Japanese restaurant, it's a new age sushi restaurant. They may have borrowed their name from New York, but that's about where the similarities end.   Service was friendly, but brisk. They clearly wanted to get us in and out of there since we were sitting at the bar.   We ordered miso soup, the four kelp salad (their version of a seaweed salad), tamago, the Chilean sea bass with a dried miso sauce, and chicken teriyaki. The miso was standard, and the tamago was much larger than what I'm used to, but both were good. Kelp salad was a little too fishy for me, but then again, I had my heart set on seaweed salad. Both the Chilean sea bass and the chicken teriyaki were merely good, but not good enough for the ticket ($45 and $30 respectively) and neither came with rice.  So why the three stars? We just weren't overwhelmed. Nobu wasn't an impressive dining experience, and in this town, if you don't have experience, why bother?"}
{"text":"There's no doubt that Nobu is an amazing restaurant. With locations all over the world that are frequented by celebrities, they obviously know what they're doing are, able to consistently provide a luxurious experience for guests, and have been able to scale that experience well.   My girlfriend and I were finishing up a road trip with one night in Vegas, and after showing me Drake's instagram, convinced me that Nobu would be the place to try.   She was right. To end our trip we got dressed up and showed up to the beautiful restaurant inside Caesar's. Amazing decor, everyone dressed to the nines, and five star service from start to finish.  We got two drinks each, and then split about 5 different dishes to share. I absolutely love seafood, so I was surprised that one of my favorite dishes of the night was the seared tofu skewers in a spicy chili sauce.  We ordered two rolls; the salmon and California if remember correctly. They were good but nothing to write home about. We also had the delicious shishito peppers.  The absolute best thing I ate that night was the Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Tosazu. It was simple, elegantly plated, barely seared, and resting in a light soy based sauce. It essentially melted in my mouth and immediately made me feel connected to the ocean, like they some how pulled this fish straight out of the water before they brought it to our table. If you're a lover of raw/fresh seafood you'll know what I mean.  I figured we'd spend about $100 a person, and that was almost exactly how it worked out. I think it was about $225 with tip.   All in all it was a great experience and the majority of the food was incredible."}
{"text":"I was here back in Feb.  I had really high expectations for this restaurant.    With all the hype and the name.  BLAH.  Very casual.  Just your typical sushi restaurant.  Nothing special, very textbook.   I did however enjoy the sake thats made specifically for Nobu.  I wanted to buy the bamboo serving set and bring it home.  Vegas has much better Japanese restaurants on the strip (Sensei or Japonais would be my pick)"}
{"text":"I will never forget the experience my friends and I had at Nobu. Our server was absolutely amazing and made food suggestions that were perfect for what we were trying to convey. He suggested the Black Cod entree' and almost 5 months later I STILL reminisce about that dish! It was full of flavor without being overwhelming. The Cod was perfectly tender and juicy and was cooked to perfection. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and I wish I could remember our server's name, because he made the dinner an experience. He was knowledgeable, patient, and seemed to have a real passion for not only food, but for Nobu as well. It was a great start to our night!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Pricy but worth the price for the taste and service. A few family members have food allergies but they were very accommodating and nobody got sick!"}
{"text":"Excellent as always. While is on the expensive side, I never regret coming back. Everything from the service to drinks and was perfect."}
{"text":"Right on point. Every Nobu restaurant lives up to its expectations. Bartenders are very nice and friendly. They make the perfect old fashion in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Please see our Nobu New York review for more wild and crazy Nobu action!!!  The differences:  Not much, perhaps the food here in Vegas is edgier but maybe it just seems that way after we've been playing blackjack and eating stale shrimp cocktails for 32 straight hours...  Reservations in Las Vegas are much easier to get.  We've been here 3 times and ordered omakase every time.  Get this, damn wifey even asked for MORE expensive options and we were denied 2 out of 3 times!  What restaurant do you know refuses to take the extra money you try throw at them?  Gotta respect their integrity."}
{"text":"I've eaten at 4 other of their restaurants and have to admit, their food and service is very consistent.  We showed up with 11 people for an 8 person reservation and were accommodated immediately.  Drinks were brought out fast, as were a fee of the appetizers.  Once we all ordered our dinners though, thinks went a little downhill.  I had two full plates of sushi in front of me for almost 10 minutes before anyone else got what they ordered.  The delivery of food was so sporadic, we basically just took turns watching each other eat.  -1 point for the most \"memorable\" part of the dinner; the cheap, takeout quality, give-your-tongue-splinters, chopsticks!  How do you cheap out on these disposable splinters of firewood?  Such a cheap item to upgrade, instead it totally ruined the dinner for the table...it was like going to a good steak house and being given a plastic knife to cut your filet.  Two at the table were somehow offered dessert while the rest of us never even saw the menu or heard the offerings, -1 again for lack of service.  Not much of a social scene for what I was expecting at the Hard Rock, but still one of the better options in Vegas for sushi.   About half the price of Massa, but you sacrifice the service a little bit.  Still better than the other strip options as far as quality of food goes though."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience. Everything about this place really exceeded my expectations.   The ambiance, the food, the service, the staff.   All the waiters seem to know the menu upside down (which is extremely important). They make wonderful recommendations and are very friendly.   I recommend the Yellowtail Sashimi as an appetizer, the salmon crunchy roll, and the horchata flan. We had a few other things, but everything is seasonal so they might not be on the menu.   Overall, great restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try if you are a sushi lover. This restaurant has a posh atmosphere and super fast service. Beautiful decor. They serve traditional sushi but are open minded with their menu. The drink menu was impressive and the caipirinhas were amazing. We tried the yellow tail jalapeño roll and it was awesome: certainly a unique mix of flavors, in a good way."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I've ever had.  The other items are amazing too - kobe beef melts in your mouth.  Honestly one of the best meals in my entire life.  The ambiance is spectacular too, and the service is impeccable.  The waitstaff are friendly and full of good recommendations.  And it's at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Stick around and you might see Tommy Lee (I did).  ;)"}
{"text":"Five stars all around!  Amazing food, fantastic service, nice ambiance!!! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, anytime if they are willing to pay for a high end DELICIOUS dining experience."}
{"text":"Gastronomically exceptional. We were expecting a more upscale atmosphere and were contemplating going elsewhere until the head waiter, Bijan, came over.   He was professional, confident and exceptionally eloquent in presenting our dinner options. In the nearly 3hrs that we remained there, Bijan created a multi-course meal specifically tailored to our food preferences and palates.   It wasn't just that every course blew our minds but that the service was so incredible. Its probably best to summarize that going to this Nobu is an experience that you will never forget."}
{"text":"Nobu is by far the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at in Las Vegas.  I consider myself a \"foodie\" in that I go anywhere and am willing to spend whatever for the best food and more importantly for the greatest service and experience available.   I travel to Vegas 5 or 6 times a year, I'm not a gambler or a big drinker, I come here for the food.    Nobu specifically isn't bad food but at this price point it should be great food and a great experience.  The food is good at best but the service is terrible.  At first I thought it was just a random unlucky one off, but I now believe it's institutional here.  My waiter/server Matt, professed to be some sort of expert on the \"real\" Nobu experience.  In his opening remarks Matt offered to bring us through this experience, just let him know our comfort level based on price, things that we especially would love to eat as well as those that were a definite no way option and that he would create this culinary adventure and memory without comparison.  W ell this turned out to be true.  I told Matt that the price wasn't a problem, for me the only real no go was a texture thing.  I like sushi, I love great food and that I'm more of a Beef, Pork and Chicken person but would be open to whatever he recommended except the only \"No go\" for me would be slimly, gushy items.  The first thing he brought out was a yellowtail jalapeno dish.  Flavor?  Good, texture?  Terrible.  Matt asked what we thought, I told him that it had \"good flavor\" but failed on the texture scale and that it was exactly what I said I didn't want.  The next dish was almost the exact same thing only with some shaved almonds on it for \"texture\".  I made the same complaint.  Third dish, a Crab Ceviche on a bib lettuce cup. Okay now, I'd about had it, I took Matt aside and told him that he asked me what was a total no go for me and them proceeded to bring me three dishes in that category. I also told him I was able to somewhat muscle through these dishes, but if he noticed I didn't finish any of the dishes he brought out and that at nearly $300 per person, \"I do not want to muscle through my meal, I want to be able to sit back and truly enjoy it.\"  I pointed out each of the three times he visited my table that other people around me were eating appetizing dishes and that he hadn't been even close.  He then brought out a very good Sea Bass dish followed by a Wagu Beef dish that was excellent and then a tempura crab that was sub par at best and a chocolate lave cake with ice cream that was  so over cooked there was no lava and the edges were \"Hard\".  Overall the meal was $650.00.  Matt did not offer to remove any of the poor choice dishes, he didn't offer to buy us a drink and a manager of chef didn't stop by.  Nothing.  I am not a rearview mirror kind of guy and don't spend time fretting over things that already happened.  But this one bother me so much so that the next day I stopped by the restaurant to express my views about what happened.  I was promised that someone would call me in the middle of the day.  No one called, no one actually cares here and that is why waiters like Matt work there.  My advice, don't go, take your $650.00 and drop it in the machines."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have had yet!!! I am not a huge sashimi fan and usually play it safe with the rolls but this restaurant is truly a divine pallet experience!!  We had the chef's recommendations as well as sweet shrimp and my husband likes Uni. I have tried Uni one time before at another sushi restaurant and I was totally repulsed by it. The server urged me to try it at this restaurant and it was amazing! Everything we had was absolutely perfect. Very flavorful and fresh! The only down fall was we could have eaten more!  I will for sure make this one is my \"splurge\" restaurants when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, the service outstanding! If you can sit at the sushi bar and watch the sushi chefs do their magic; it's an art form"}
{"text":"So, as many of these reviews state, \"Nobu is expensive.\" Yes, but it is exactly what an expensive restaurant should be. High quality, professional service and top of the line food. I have eaten at Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino in Vegas 3 times now and I find it excellent.   My average bill per person has been about $150. This is including a $60 bottle of saki and a couple of $15 martini's. Without drinks, my wife and I probably would have spend about $100-$120 each. This is also without trying to go cheap. If you wanted to eat here on a budget, it would be completely possible to order a couple of $12-$15 Sushi rolls and a couple of $12-$15 skewers and get out of there with a tab that runs about $60 or $70. However, in my opinion that would be defeating the purpose because while you can budget yourself into turning this place into a typical sushi bar, the real goods and their signature dishes that separate them from the rest are the more expensive plates.   Their main signature dish is their yellowtail- jalepeno sashimi. Definitely an appetizer portion, but very tasty if you like sashimi. My personal favorite is their blackened cod in a butter-lettuce wrap. The last time I was there it was not listed on the menu but when I mentioned it they knew exactly what I was talking about and whipped it up for us. Also an appetizer portion, but very different and very good. The fish literally melts in your mouth. Another recommendation is the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. It's sort of a beef filled pot-sticker that is cooked to perfection. The beef is imported either from Japan or from Australia, depending on which one you decide to go with, and comes with an incredible dipping sauce. A little more filling of an order as well. Their sushi rolls are good, but nothing you can't get at another place that makes good sushi. However, I recommend getting a couple rolls to get yourself filled up then get a couple of their specials in order to keep your cost reasonable.   The service is great. Then waiters and waitresses have a good attitude and they know the menu like the back of their hand. If you just tell them what you're feeling they can put together a meal that works for you. There is someone coming by to fill up your water or bring you another drink every time you need it and they all have been well trained in how to communicate at a high end table.   As much as I like to branch out and try new restaurants, this place is always going to be hard for me to pass up when I am in town."}
{"text":"This restaurant helped turned me in to a sushi and restaurant snob! The food itself deserves five stars but despite how many workers they have, service was very slow and bad! I have been to Nobu in Malibu, California which had amazing service so I was expecting the same but unfortunately I did not have the same experience here.  Food Recommendations:   1.) YellowTail Sashimi with Jalapeños ($28) in Yuzu sauce. This is by far the freshest and best tasting yellowtail I have ever eaten! The Yuzu sauce is quite zesty, the jalapeño adds a little kick of spice and the yellowtail sort of just melts in your mouth.  2.) Rock Shrimp ($24) available in Creamy Spicy, Butter Ponzu or Jalapeño. We ordered all three bit fell in love with the creamy spicy! The only way I can explain this to you is like Shrimp Tempura meets Walnut Shrimp in heaven and had a baby! This is a must try! 3.) Wagyu Beef ($26 per ounce- 2 ounce minimum) choice of Hibachi (grilled- seared quickly served with dipping sauces), Shabu Shabu (meat submerged in a pot of dashi) or sukiyaki (slowly simmered in an iron pot). No matter how you cook it this meat is top grade, tender and amazing. 4.) Chilean Seabass ($48)- although it's not the best Seabass on the strip (Noodles at Bellagio) it's cooked comparable well here.  *The cocktails are amazing*- just be prepared to wait 30minutes to get your first one."}
{"text":"It's not like any ordinary  sushi joint, it's very hip menu is large.... The way the restaurant  set up was very cozy"}
{"text":"We came here for a fancy night out in Vegas.  Although the food we ordered was delicious, the portion sizes were an absolute joke.  Don't even get me started about the prices!  If you want to show off to your pretentious friends and spend gobs of money this is the place you want to hit up.  Otherwise, I say pass."}
{"text":"This was the first time ever I've dined with three other Yelpers so I'm curious to see where the other reviews come in. Personally, four stars is a little high but I really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so I'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (I don't think I've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").  The black cod with miso was the highlight. The Kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 I'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing I've ever eaten. The scallops topped with jalapeno were the third great dish. The sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.  The ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for Vegas. It looks the way a Japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. And the service, though efficient, was humorless. Any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based desserts off the menu is not winning any points with me.  Still, the price minus the Kobe was totally reasonable, especially for Vegas. And the Matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward adding up to a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"Nobu has it all - celebrity guests, a famous name, wonderful food and a HUGE price point.    We had a group of 10 that included family and friends, so instead of ordering a la carte we went with the Nobu Signature option on the Omakase menu, where the chefs craft a custom menu in real time based on our group's expressed preferences, allergies, etc. The price per person was big but since it was basically all-in and we were there for a special visit, why not.   The food was 5 stars. The miso cod was fantastic, the wagyu beef tacos were amazing, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeños were divine, the grilled premium Japan wagyu beef was delicious and the dessert assortment they brought out was one for the ages. Best bite of the night was the first one - the salmon tartare topped with caviar in a wasabi soy broth with a mystery berry of some unknown origin (unknown to me) on the side - that dish was superlative-worthy on its own.  I didn't love our shrimp dish, but that good was far outweighed by a whole lot of great.   The cost ended up being crazy high.  My buddy handled the accounting but what I think happened was that on top of the Omakase went the pre-order appetizer and the cocktails. And when the server suggested the sake that she said paired great with the desserts, we didn't realize it apparently wasn't part of the prix fixe menu.  Either that or there was some sort of misunderstanding.  No regrets. Had a wonderful, truly memorable meal with a great group.  Worth (almost) every penny."}
{"text":"I think this spot is a little overhyped, but i also had the worse hostess experience ever here. Arrived at 8:03pm for our 8pm reservation and were told the party before was taking awhile on desserts - poor seating planning in my mind. Then after 15 minutes, we asked the same hostess what's taking so long still and she said she would speak to her manager. Another 15 minutes passed and haven't seen her call or speak to a single manager.. she just stood at her counter picking up calls and looking at her computer screen. Others in my party of 5 got frustrated and asked again what was taking so long and she said she will ask her manager, again. Finally, we just found another hostess to ask. We decided to take the regular seating when we initially booked for teppanyaki. Even ordering a beer at the bar took my friend 15 minutes, which was a little ridiculous how slow and poor service is. After being seated we ordered appetizers and still tried to make our teppanyaki seating happen. Finally, we were approached by another worker saying the seats are opened for teppanyaki. We moved our seats and sat around a grill that had extra 5 seatings and the table next to us had another extra 5 seatings...which super disappointed us that we couldn't have been seated in these seats earlier. I would've given this spot 2 stars based on our first hour here, but the wonderful waitress and bus-person for our table were super friendly and accommodating. Our chef was also super friendly and welcoming. This reminds me lots of Benihana but the food tasted a bit better. We had a few appetizers, drinks, first 3 teppanyaki sets to share and dessert.  - Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño: too much sauce that covered the actual taste of the fish. Sauce was a little too salty for me. - Lobster & Tuna mini tacos: this was just a one-bite and it came with two of each so it wasn't enough for the group. I had some of the tuna and thought it was ok, the taco skins were too thick, would've been nicer thinner to not mask the original flavor of the fish. - Mixed seafood ceviche: this was yummy with so many options inside with a good amount of citrus so it doesn't overpower. - Whitefish on chips: forgot the name of this order since my coworker ordered it. The presentation was beautiful! But the orange sauce above my fish was too much yet again. - Lychee, Mango mocktail: delicious! Would totally order again. - Shishito pepper: always a yummy choice! - Edamame: always a good choice for starters too & perfect amount of sea salt on top. - Tuna tartare: literally one small spoon bite per person - wish portions were better for larger groups. - Salmon & Tuna sashimi with lettuce wrapped in daikon: not bad, fresh fish. - Black Cod Miso: This is what they're known for & it's definitely as good as people say. Definitely order this!  As for the rest of the meal, it was in the first 3 Teppanyaki sets. Portions were small, but we were left filled because of all the stuff we ordered. My favorite of all these dishes is the A5 Wagyu & steak - cooked to soft perfection & melts in your mouth! The sauces were also yummy, especially the truffle one :p For desserts, we ended with the chocolate lava cake that my boss loved, and I loved the green tea ice cream paired with it. The ice cream mochis were also delicious! Overall, hostess service sucked and it ruined a lot of the experience, but the waitress for our table was awesome, food was ok - small portions & a bit overpriced, but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Seriously worth a visit.   If you are looking for a nice dining experience and price is not relevant. Come to Nobu. Service was wonderful from the host to the bar to the table. And of course the food was delish!  Hostess Friendly, smiley and genuine. Great first impression.   Bar The bartender was friendly and could make one heck of a drink. I love ordering from the  cocktail menu and the bartender made some great suggestions.  Table Waitstaff was attentive, friendly and quick. Our server did a wonderful job with suggestions and answering questions on the menu. We had a party of 7 and were handled flawlessly  Sushi To die for! Really really wonderful. I don't know if I could list a favorite dish.   We will be back."}
{"text":"So, in Vegas, and looking for somewhere to eat that isn't named after a TV show chef?!? Or a place where the food is fresh and not all fried? This would be a great place to start-   Had dinner here while in town for a conference at the beginning of the month with some business acquaintances from out of town- all three of us are pretty familiar with Vegas and what it has to offer- in multiple aspects ! We didn't have to wait- big plus! The server was super knowledgeable of the fish served - and of the menu including the pricing.   The other two that I had the pleasure of dining with asked our server to recommend a few choices and he did- we all agreed to allow his expertise guide us in our meal. He ordered a few dishes - they were great - and then we requested just one more and he complied. The texture, flavor and presentation were amazing. I have had sushi all over the country and this will be rated in the top 5. The flavors made my palate go insane !! 5 stars on the food !   So, a total of 5 dishes for the bargain price of over $250 and that wasn't including a tip. Upon review of the receipt. One dish was charged three times for a mere $18/charge - I questioned the server who politely explained that he took the liberty of ordering three orders of so each of us at the table could have two pieces... I'm sure he did. The other three dishes were on average of $60 ish each- hmm.... One would have thought that he would have had the courtesy to pick a variety of dishes price point speaking - not the highest on the menu OR have the courtesy to ask if our group was on a budget or what our price point was verses assuming. Our tip alone paid for his internet bill for the month in addition to half of his cell phone bill.   Out of courtesy- we all reached for our cards (me slightly cringing at what my accounting people were going to say when they saw this horrifically high dinner for three) and one of the other two decided they would take the heat on the cost... Not sure how he are going to explain that one.   Moral of this story is- always order your own food in Vegas unless you have an unlimited budget! Thus the 4 star rating- minus one star for common courtesy and respecting the client/customer."}
{"text":"I was only a fan of a couple different kinds of sushi. Not anymore. I am a fan of an array of sushi!  WHOA! This place has the BEST sushi I've ever eaten in my entire life! I'm not even joking. If you like sushi, you must, MUST go to Nobu and stuff your face. Don't look at the prices. Treat yourself like a king or queen for the night. The sushi is so delicious and the service is very kind. They are very happy to recommend their favorites and tell you a little bit about the different orders of food.   I swear it to you, you'll not be disappointed. I can't even begin to tell you about the food because I'd ruin the surprise! It is all just so delicious and you just need to take my word.   I love you Nobu!! xoxo"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary because we heard great things about this upscale chain restaurant.  We ordered sushi (which was nothing special), the Chilean sea bass (can't go wrong with this), and kobe beef ($28/ounce; we ordered 3 ounces [minimum]) Tataki style.  The kobe beef was amazing, but the price was a little outrageous.  Personally, I believe that Nobu is over-hyped; it's an experience (we saw several famous people), but not a place that I'd return to.   (+) quality and freshness of ingredients, positive and upbeat atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff (-) pricey, sushi was sub-par"}
{"text":"Pretty classy, even for Caesars Palace, which I was visiting for a conference. We started things off with the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, which was served over ponzu. Spicy and tart! Eel sashimi was also tasty. Definitely recommended if you're hanging out with someone else who can expense it."}
{"text":"Service is always impeccable and the food never disappoints. Go to favorites are yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and black cod miso. If you've never eaten here I definitely recommend doing one of their omakase options. With omakase they are very good about accommodating each person in your party whether they have allergies or food preferences.  I've never had anything here I didn't like. I find it's usually easier to get a table last minute at this location over Caesars."}

{"text":"My fiancé and I had the pleasure of dining at Nobu Tuesday night (8/8/17). Our server, and the young man who filled our water, cleared plates, etc., were both helpful, respectful, and fun (appropriately fun for Nobu). Based on our waiter's recommendation, we ordered the yellowtail sashimi appetizer (to die for), the creamy jalapeño tofu (a nice departure from their wildly popular shrimp version, and just as delicious!), the spicy seafood soup, the sushi dinner, and some nigiri. The saddest thing about Nobu is no other sushi will ever taste as fresh or delicious! We're already looking forward to our next visit to the Malibu location! Thank you to everyone on staff Tuesday night for making this such a lovely experience for us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Ceasars Hotel and Casino. We have also stayed at Ceasars Nobu. We decided to try Nobu (sushi) resturant since we love sushi. We were highly disappointed. =( The prices are extremely high for what you get. We are aware its Vegas but when you get a \"taco\" the size of your pinky finger for $18..thats a bit much. Halfway through our meal a cockroach ran under our booth! These things happen but in a fine dining establishment...? A waiter scooped the roach up w a napkin...a cloth napkin people use to wipe their face. Im hoping this went straight in the trash. The kicker was when we told our waiter he said, \"Oh, Its just because of the environment. They come inside because of the heat. We spray ALL the time and they just keep coming.\" By this time even my husband was grossed out. He offered us free dessert like we were at Golden Coral or some cheap buffet. No thanks. If you're looking for great sushi and exceptional service try Naked Fish off the strip. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! I finally got to try Nobu a couple weeks ago in Vegas, and now I know what everyone has been raving about!   At first the menu seemed overwhelming with so many options, I didn't know where to begin. We basically just ordered everything that looked good, and I pretty much liked everything with the exception of the tacos-too small for the price, you are better off ordering something else. Also, wasn't a big fan of the new style salmon sashimi, the sauce was kinda off to us. The black miso cod was not our favorite.  On to the things I loved...I loved the soft shell crab and watermelon appetizer (not on the menu). The jalapeno yellowtail appetizer was also good. We were surprised at how delicious the chicken entree was, the meat was juicy and it was served with three delicious sauces. We loved the trout which was served with crispy, delicious spinach. The sea bass was also great! The cooked entree dishes-chicken, sea bass and trout were pretty large orders, bigger than we had expected. I also liked all the handrolls, which were decently priced.   The prices weren't as crazy as we had anticipated for the quality of food and ambience. Definitely want to try different locations of Nobu on special occasions!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Maybe the worst I have seen. Pretentious waiters who won't pick up an empty bowl because it is \"not there job\". Not sure if this effected my mean in taste but only about 50% of the dishes were very good. One we sent back, the cold kelp salad because we were a) not told it might have sea shells in it and b) almost had broken teeth because of it. The sushi rolls were very good but having to wait 45 minutes to have your table cleared and get a check should not happen at a restaurant of this price and caliber. I will never enter this restaurant again."}
{"text":"My table had a large variety of food and everything was art with the perfect contrast of ingredients and we had outstanding service from our server Billy. He KNOWS the menu and all the servers are trained to set up a menu that agree with your preferences if you trust them enough to, which you should, but if not then go with anything on the menu and you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Heard about Nobu many times, obviously, but first try was on Valentine's day. The hotel couldn't get us checked in so we had to go in t-shirts and shorts but the hostess didn't give us any grief when we explained our predicament.  Pros: Food was very high quality and the service was very fast. That's about it.  Cons: There were no frills. It was almost boring. Decor was nice, but it was just kind of boring. Mostly because the service was TOO fast. That may sound strange but they were at the table every 2 minutes with another dish or to ask us to order more. It just seemed very rushed. We tried to take our time and talk but we were done with our dinner in under an hour. That was the pace they set. Which is great for turning tables but it wasn't the most pleasant experience. The cost of many of the dishes were insanely over-priced.  I would go here again (if someone else was paying, haha), but wouldn't make it a romantic evening. Food was pretty great."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner last night. My waiter was very knowledgeable and gave me a great tip on the tacos. I had 1 Shrimp and 1 Lobster and wished I had several more! The chef's special roll, kinda of a Rainbow in a seaweed wrap was great! The only slight negative is they are proud of the food $$! All in all-a great spot!"}
{"text":"Love Nobu everywhere. This is actually a 4 1/2. Hawaii is a better location.   Service is exceptional and food is delish"}
{"text":"yes, other than the sticker shock, I would say this was a perfect experience.  Server explained, engaged, and suggsted all our dishes.  my daughter who's mantra is \"i dont do raw\" sat there and ate everything with her eyes rolling back.  I cant even say what my favorite dish was, it was all amazing.  had five courses each one heavenly beyond description.  drinks were pretty darn tastey as well.  the cucumber martini is a must try."}
{"text":"Overly priced, but if you've just hit gold at the tables, it's worth a try. Go big or go home, so do the tasting menu, otherwise you're missing out. The fish is FRESH and the flavors are well put together. Get reservations, for sure. Expect to drop $100 for the tasting if you do the smaller of the tastings."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Food was ok but for the price... You can definitely find better. Warning!!! Do not let the server suggest what to order... He will pick the most expensive dishes on the menu and will fail to tell you how much it is.. They should definitely warn you that your dinner for two will cost u nearly $1000.00!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE STRAIGHT UP CROOKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited the Hard Rock for dinner at Nobu. The service and food was amazing. We experienced the Chef's tasting menu and it was fantastic. Not a questionable dish in the bunch, one success after another. Notable was the seared scallops over brussel sprouts but nothing disappointed. Not to be ignored was the Saki flight that was a perfect compliment but did not over shadow the Nobu Sidecar. All in all the experience left me high anticipating the opening of Nobu DC where I currently reside."}
{"text":"A group of me and my friends stayed in Caesars this weekend and were craving some sushi.  Before even being seated one of the hostesses says \"No, he can't come in, he's not wearing a long sleeve shirt.\"  We were all dressed up and one of our guy friends was wearing a tank, as he had just gotten off his flight.  I have eaten at several high end restaurants in Las Vegas (I am a local here) and have never been treated so disrespectfully.  We had a group of about 8 people, so they lost out on a big check.  Will not recommend this restaurant to any colleagues or visiting friends.  Just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Walking the Las Vegas Strip I worked up an appetite. I decided to check out  Nobu located in Caesars Palace because I LOVE SEAFOOD.   Overall this restaurant is yummy.   I was pleased to see that my favorite salad, the mushroom salad was on the menu which is not served at all Japanese restaurants. The entrees were small and the price was huge. This girl likes to eat so The bill was rather large. I had a shot of tequila which I regret. I loved the martini I do not recall having. I just remember I loved it according to my friend who was dining with me. Oh and I also had a few cocktails. (yummy cocktails with great flavors of fresh cucumber)  I would compare Nobu to Sen of Japan which is another  fine dining Japanese restaurant. Both places have mushroom salads. Do not go to either of these places with a big stomach unless you expect to spend a couple hundred. The food quantity to a tapas restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock and decided on a nice dinner.  Service: 2/5 we had never been here before and it wasn't explained to us why nobody was giving us a food menu. They gave us an alcohol menu only. Server finally came back and I told him \"I don't decide on my drink until I've picked out my meal.\" He told me that HE would help me decide on our food and drink pairing. I just needed to tell him what I like. Ok... so I told him what I normally order at Japanese restaurants. He then gave me a menu and never returned to our table.  FINALLY, another server came by and we told him that we were put-off by the previous server. This server was MUCH better, explains their cuisine, process, and answered questions.  Ambiance: 2/5 it's crazy loud in here. They have music blasting and there was a big party nearby. Tables are close together and it's a fairly small establishment. Imagine a diner with mood lighting, the waiters wear black, and the price of tempura is $40. That's Nobu.  Food: 2/5 blah at best. I've had better California rolls at Safeway. The vegetable tempura was bland. The $90 wine was just ok. The seafood wasn't fresh. We were told by server #1 that it was family style, but the food was not served that way. The best thing I ate was the crispy spinach... that was good.  Price: $$$$$. I don't mind paying for a nice meal but this was not it."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Nobu hotel for a week and had dinner at the restaurant last night. I sat at the bar and asked the bartender for all his recommendations, and they were awesome! He started me off with this fresh cucumber martini was delicious! Then I wanted something light, so he recommended the yellowtail sushi with jalapeño, wasn't too spicy at all, perfect amount of flavor.  I was still a bit hungry so his last recommendation was the black miso cod, cooked perfectly! Tender, juicy and full of flavor!  Was an overall great experience, now I have to go back for dessert!"}
{"text":"Sushi is my fave food. I tend to try different restaurants, in different cities to see how well they each match up.   I decided to try Nobu at Caesars. I had just got married and my husband & I were in the mood for sushi.   As we approached the ambiance was great. It was tucked into the forum shops and in the middle of the hotel. One of the hostess was pretty much a straight up bitch. Sorry honey if you dont like your job or kids, but you can quit. We had our 2 year old with us and had her in her stroller. She was rude in the sense in telling us, not really asking, but telling us to fold up our stroller and leave it at the front. My husband did not want to do that, so we didn't.  Our waitress, I forget her name, she was really cool. Very helpful in explaining the menu and recommended a few items. We settled on a few different pieces of sushi as well as cut and handrolls.  Our dish was brought out on a large platter and boy was I disappointed. The only rolls that were really cut into normal sizes, was my husbands spider roll. The others were just way too small and so not worth the price.   For what we paid, I expected more. I realize this is a trendy spot, but so not worth it for the overpriced sushi and rolls."}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty high when coming here.  For a notable restaurant, I expected a pretty damn good execution of everything.    I went with the omakase, consisting of 8 dishes including dessert.  Some of the stand-outs included the Hamachi Tartare, the Barracuda Salad, and the dessert notably named \"Bento Box\".    The Bento Box consisted of white chocolate sauce in a flourless chocolate cake, with green tea gelato and berries on the side.  A little excessive yes, but it was effective.  The first couple of rounds of the omakase were the cold dishes, which were acceptable, as I expected small portions of dishes to come out.  However, I was surprised (and almost annoyed with the second half of the omakase, which consisted of warm dishes that basically over-powering and excessive.  They could pretty much act as their own entree.  tl;dr  The cold dishes are tiny, the warm dishes are a whole lot.  With that said, the price of $110 is worth the 8-course meal, but I was slightly annoyed at how small and then how big the proportions were.  The quality was fine, but I wasn't satisfied at the end."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner at 5pm without reservations on a Saturday night.  Sat in one of the cool \"pods\".  We had never been to Nobu so the menu style was explained to us as \"small dishes to be shared\".  We ordered the spinach salad (AMAZING), edamame, teriyaki beef and peruvian seasoned chicken skewers, black cod with miso seasoning, and a salmon roll.  Shared a half bottle of wine. Everything was delicious.  The waiters gave phenomenal service.   The experience was worth the splurge."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The juxtaposition of spicy / sweet in all my dishes was just what i wanted. The Cod was amazing, the yellow-tail tacos... everything! Definitely a must for the sushi lover while in vegas."}
{"text":"One star Melt in your mouth delicious black cod miso.  Wagyu new style absolute a NO NO, taste just like Wagyu drowned in lemon juice $80.00 two oz. I called and bring it to their manager's attention.  All plates was recommended by their server.  He said next time order something non citrus.  Fine dining professionalism, I don't think so. Look at my yellowtail & Wagyu dishes, both soaked in lemon juice. Everything else is plain, All sashimi just basic & none of the plates have diping sauce.  Plain soy sauce and ginger either. bla bla which I can go anywhere.  Look at my review on Sushi Samba that's real sushi.  Each plate have the executive signature dipping sauce.  You want real fine dine experience,   Go to Palazzo, it's real sushi & real chef :-)"}
{"text":"Been waiting to revisit my first amazing sushi experience from the resturant that got me hooked onto sushi.  I veen to this location twice before the remodel and my gf wanted to try it ever since weve seen them in la.  The service was excellent as always and the ambiance was outstanding.  The goods, the sashimi was super fresh, handsdown nobody can compare, uni was super creamy, toro had tge perfect texture, nothing to complain there.  Saw someone wrote about the jalapeno yellowtail, pretty accurate, not sure why they didnt just put the cilantro on the fish instead of the middle, the jalapeno had very little favor, the ponzu was a little bit salty.  The seaweed salad was good, but not great, sauce was not consistent, some had more sauce than others.  Probably better to mix it instead of leavijg them separate but I understand why.  The kama was tasty but lacked some meat.  The flourless cake was good as well.  The sashimi was a lot smaller and thinner than how it used to be as well :(.  All and all not bad but def no longer my fav sushi spot, sushi den took over that spot."}
{"text":"We had the best meal of our Vegas trip at Nobu.  Our server suggested the tasting menu and put together an amazing dining experience based on our budget.  He didn't up-sell or condescend, instead he put together a great menu that we all loved and we could tell he loved serving us and explaining the dishes.  I almost wish we'd given up our steakhouse night (CUT was good though) so we  could have moved up a price step or two at Nobu... it would have been well worth it! Overall, Nobu is highly recommended and was the surprise show stopper for us during our time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love love this place. Definitely will return if I come back to Vegas. The staff was superb and very professional. They understood the menu like it was there restaurant. Everything we order was delicious. The price is a little high but I must say it's well worth the price tag. I'm so happy that we had the chance fine here. Love love the food and atmosphere to the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service, first time experience was a hit! We are locals and will definitely be back.  Loved the pre-set seven course meal  Thank you for the customized dessert!"}
{"text":"Now I understand why so many people are so crazy about Nobu. What a dining experience!   I'm not just talking about the food. I mean, if a restaurant has 20 something locations all over the world, it's a sure proof that the food is there. I was more impressed by my experience overall. Impeccable service along with unique ambiance, dining at Nobu will open your eyes to a whole another world of fine dining.  As soon as you walk into the restaurant, sole size of the restaurant itself will surprise you. Then, you'll be awed by origami decorations above the hostess stand, or stylish lounge areas of the restaurant. Ambiance of this restaurant is very unique. It's not as uptight as other fine dining restaurants, but just luxurious enough to impress.   We started with some cocktails (two of us), yamazaki sidecar for me and champagne 95 for her. Both drinks were strong, which is perfect! more the merrier :) both cocktails were excellent.  We had shishito peppers to start with, and they were perfect appetizers. Fried crispy and with a spicy kick, they certainly had our appetites going. We had shrimp kushiyaki (skewers) in anticucho sauce, and they were delicious! Anticucho, as explained by our server, is Peruvian chili that Chef Nobu began to use for his cooking back in his days in Peru. It had very unique flavors, and we both loved it. Next item on agenda was Nobu's famous black cod miso, which was outstanding! I'm usually not a big fan of broiled fish, but miso-glazed black cod certainly changed my perspective on that. In To top it all off, we had beef tobanyaki, which is beef tenderloin cooked in a stone pot with mixed mushrooms and vegetables. This was certainly the highlight of the meal, as tenderloin was cooked so perfectly and sauces used complemented the tenderloin so well.  I can say dining at Nobu was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Ludacris was eating at the table next to us.  That's the only reason I didn't give a 2 star rating.  Food was ok, not great.  We made the mistake of letting our waiter order for us.  He ordered us an $80 appetizer.  Would not visit again."}
{"text":"If we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. The service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. The flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. Since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. Damn you Nobu for being so expensive! Otherwise I would have ordered 2 of everything!  A couple of dishes I would recommend trying are: -yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno -toro tartar with caviar -black cod with miso -rock shrimp tempura -new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce  ***The MUST try dish is the FISH/LOBSTER TACOS!!!*** They are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are AWESOME. I have pictures to prove it."}
{"text":"Nobu has such a dear spot in my heart, and I'm so happy I was able to bring my mother here!  We chose a few items, and then asked the waitress to surprise us and choose the rest of our dinner - this was a fantastic decision!  I've been to Nobu Malibu twice, and while the atmosphere here is totally different, the food and service is the same quality."}
{"text":"this place really is fine dining.  the restaurant was fashionably decorated and looked classy.  I love plates of sashimi with sauce on it so that's mostly what I ordered  - white fish  - salmon - yellowtail - black cod  - uni - oysters - wagyu beef tataki  the dishes were amazing! very fresh and the texture was buttery and super good.  I loved all the sashimi dishes  the uni was cold and tasted really fresh. must get! $10  my other favorite fish was the salmon.  the texture was like butter and the brown sauce it came with went great with it  the white fish was also good.  the sauce was very lemony  yellowtail was great also but it's just with ponzu sauce so nothing special  the wagyu beef was also very good! it was lightly seared beef thinly cut and served cold.  I think I would prefer it served warm or hot but I guess.  they put some ponzu sauce on it  also tried a roll for the hell of it.  the waiter said the house roll was popular.  I did not like it at all.  the white wrapping it came with was good though. I like anything besides the regular seaweed wrap"}
{"text":"Really expensive, but freaking awesome. I've sat at the bar both times I've gone, and the chefs are classy and highly skilled."}
{"text":"I love coming here for many reasons. Last night I went yet again and it is quite the experience,  1.  Parking -easy enough as this is the Hard Rock. You can do valet or self park and it is a small walk.   2.  Ambiance-  well appointed place with perfect mood lighting. Yes you may have to bring your uncool reading glasses to see the menu!  3.  Service-  freaking outstanding. I don't think my water glass was ever empty. I dropped my chopsticks between courses and in swooped a new one immediately!  Love how they are well trained and can explain the dishes.   4.  Food -as usual I ordered the Omakase chef choice menu and was amazed at the gastronomic experience. It was simply unforgettable.   5.  Mula -  bring the do re mi as this place is expensive \"tres cher\" however it is worth it!!!  Gotta check this place out. And if ya gotta use the restroom be sure to bring tip money as on weekends they have attendants in the Hard Rock Restrooms"}
{"text":"Maybe it's becuase I live in a state not known for it's seafood -- but Nobu consistently has the BEST sushi and fish I've ever eaten.     It is the first reservation I make when going to Las Vegas or Dallas for work.    Yep it's pricy but I have dreams about it -- it's that good !!   And i've even paused my television when I saw some psuedo celebs eating there on some reality tv show -- when they were eating my favorite things.  The trick is really to just get the good stuff -- it's over the top fantastic but when I try new stuff it never quite lives up to the others ..  1,  Yellowtail with Jalapeno -- get at least 2 orders -- I could eat 3-4 by myself if I really tried hard.  2.  Black Cod with Miso -- either version (in lettuce cups or not)  3.   Tuna Sashimi Salad -- yum !!!  4.   Any other sushi -- but if you get rolls - I suggest you pay extra for rice paper instead of seaweed (did this cuz one friend is allergic to seaweed and it makes the fish stand out).  5.  Rock Shrimp  6.  Yellowtail with Jalapeno  7.  Yellowtail with Jalapeno  8.   Yellowtail with Jalapeno  9.   Yellowtail with Jalapeno  10.  Yellowtail with Jalapeno   (Did you get it yet ???)  And the service is always TOP NOTCH !!!    Attentive and knowledgeable ....   and the drinks are FANTASTIC TOO !  It is a spendy dinner -- but in my opinion -- totally worth it !!!"}
{"text":"Nobu at the Hard Rock Cafe is my favorite restaurant in the world! You won't believe how delicious and inventive the food is."}
{"text":"Fancy. Foodie. Delicious. Pricey.  You have to order wisely here or you will leave hungry.  The cold dishes are small and pricey. You are paying for the AMAZING sauces and the fresh fish. They were delicious for sure.  I ordered a tuna and asparagus hand roll and a piece of unagi. Others at my table ordered the beef and the seafood steaming plate (I forget the Japanese name). The seafood was so fresh and delicious.  We shared a dessert which was plenty and paired our dinner with a wonderful CA sauvignon blanc.  I would recommend this place as a splurge to dress up and taste some very fresh and delicate plates. This was great for a business dinner, would be for a date or a group.  Great mood lighting."}
{"text":"Five Stars for the experience!! The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious... HOWEVER the portions are extremely small and in my opinion not worth the $$!  I enjoyed my Pineapple Martinis, Oyster Shooters, YellowTail/Jalapeno Rolls, Scallops, Cucumber Salad and Crab Tacos ***HOWEVER*** I left hungrier than when I arrived! 9/21/13"}
{"text":"Came here recently for a birthday dinner with my friends -- one was pescatarian, the other was vegetarian. We were blown away by the server who accommodated our requests and suggested some delicious menu items for the picky party.  We selected about 80% vegetarian dishes and some seafood dishes as well. I was so impressed by how delicious everything we were presented with.   If you're with a bunch of people who have numerous dietary restrictions, Nobu is one of those places where they will definitely cater to your needs.  One of my favorite dishes of the night was the hearts of palm pasta. The Brussels sprouts were absolutely addicting -- very different to the ones I'm used to. There's nothing generic about the Brussels sprouts here.  Our meal for 5 people with sake was $500, with tip.  A really great meal with great service. Our server Dan was superb! BTW, I just realized that it's been 10 years since my last visit. WOW!"}
{"text":"A hot chick with ULTRA BAD BREATH and dandruff. That's how disappointed I felt after eating here. After having Nobu in New York and Hong Kong, I was really hoping to get lost in some Epicurean sashimi trip......  ... but no. The food was about as appreciated as cruddy bellybutton cheese on a model's stomach. The rolls were blah average, the dynamite mayo was either old or bottom-shelf, making it taste like something even the Dutch wouldn't want, and the even the simplest Unagi was about as tasty as conveyor belt sushi.   I'll give props to the service, as the waitstaff and host were great, but man.... for that kind of price, I'd have expected something more....... Maybe they're just too \"famous\" to care at this location.   TOMMY BURGER PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"The teppan table at Nobu was one of the top 3 or 4 meals of my life.  We had a 7 pm reservation on a Friday night.  This was the 5th time my buddy and I had reserved the teppan table.  The previous 4 we had been bumped for high rollers, so I was wondering if we would even get the table at all.  Fortunately for us, we did.   There are 2 teppan tables in Nobu with 8 seats each.  There were only 4 of us and no one joined us, so we were able to spread out and all had a good view of the chef.  The tables are kind of separated from the restaurant, so it's a much more intimate feel.  When we left, I was surprised to see a completely full restaurant buzzing with activity, that's how isolated you are from the regular dining room.   Our server (Andrew, who was fantastic) explained the menu to us.  They offer ala carte ordering, but like most teppan joints you've been to, most people chose a tasting menu.  They have several levels:  $125, $155, $190, $280 and the reasonable $688, which is a wagyu tasting menu that must be ordered in advance.  Given how good our meal was, I can only imagine how the $688 would be.  I am sure on my next trip to Vegas I'll hit a progressive and try it.  Our table of 4 decided on the $190 menu, but with crab fried rice instead of chicken fried rice.  Additionally, 3 in our party added a seared foie gras bun, which was $50.  The wine list at Nobu is solid for Vegas.  The somm was great, we ordered a magnum of cab and when he didn't have the bottle, he offered us 2 bottles of a better vintage for the same price.  What Nobu does have is (as expected) a great Japanese whiskey selection.  2 of us went with the $40 flight and I am very glad I did.  All 3 whiskeys were fantastic, and it got me curious about Japanese whiskeys, which have been receiving high praise for some time now.  I don't think I have enough room in this review to adequately describe every dish, so I will give you what we had and then highlight a few items.  This is what the $190 tasting menu came with at our visit:  blistered Shishito, Yellowtail Tartare, Sashimi Salad, Japanese Scallop, Chilean Seabass, Japanese Wagyu, King Crab Tempura, Scallop in Cilantro Sauce, crab fried rice (usually chicken) and a coffee flavored dessert with whiskey foam.  The Japanese wagyu was my favorite of the evening, and the second best steak I've had in my life (after the riserve ribeye at Carnevino for those keeping score at home).  It was filled with veins of fat that melted into flavor during cooking.  It is served with 3 sauces, but I only tried 2 of them and didn't use them during the meal.  The steak is too good to mask with sauce, even sauces as good as these.  Additionally, it is served with an asparagus and mushroom salad, soy salt, and fried garlic.  The fried garlic was fantastic (it's the stuff that looks like tiny cornflakes in the picture).  I had every intention of copying this at home, until I found out that the process takes over 24 hours.  I could eat a full bowl of this stuff.  A bite of the steak with fried garlic and some soy salt was the best bite of my 4 nights in Las Vegas.  To be honest, probably one of the better bites of my life.  I don't know if a $50 3 bite sandwich can be called a bargain, but the seared foie gras was.  Of course it's ridiculously expensive, that's the markup you pay for eating on the Las Vegas strip at an iconic Japanese restaurant.  However, the foie gras is also fantastic quality.  The sear adds only a slight crust to the exterior, the foie gras is left with that great umami flavor and mouth feel.  I absolutely would get this again and highly recommend you do the same.  The chilean seabass was cooked perfectly and served in a balsamic teriyaki sauce that was sweet & syrupy but not too heavy.  I could have just ordered a large filet of this fish and been very satisfied with my meal.  The crab fried rice is probably the best fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was served toward the end of the meal, which was new to me.  I devoured this stuff, I could have eaten another bowl, and this was after all of the food we had already eaten.  It had some nice heat, everything was prepared well, and the seasoning was spot on.  If you don't get this with your tasting menu, I would say it's well worth it for the table to add it ala carte.    The yellowtail tartare was another table favorite.  Served with caviar in a fantastic sauce (you get so much stuff it's hard to keep track and remember what everything was, so all I know about this sauce is I like it), it was tartare of the highest quality.  The surprising dish for me was the king crab tempura.  Light but with a great tempura crunch, this was a fantastic dish.  I liked everything, but a couple of the dishes had too much cilantro for my preference.  But, that was the only thing I could nitpick about in my entire meal at Nobu.  Finally, I cannot think of a meal more appropriate to act as my 900th review than the teppan table at Nobu.  I hope I am back very soon."}
{"text":"Really liked that this awesome restaurant was off the strip.  I was with a large party, and it was great to get away from smoke-filled casinos and the conference we were attending. As usual Nobu did not disappoint. A big highlight for most of the group who is the Wagyu beef. But my favorite is always the fish. We had a lot of Sake which always enhances the meal. Marcus was our server and he was fabulous. Highly recommend this restaurant at this location.   Only reason I did not go with five stars....  at the end of the meal there was a small critter (yup a bad bug) crawling down the wall. Good thing we were already done eating."}
{"text":"Second time, I have been to this place.  And, it is still absolutely fabulous.  Started out with a sake tasting.  The sake was served in glasses on a bed of salt.  The visual presentation was very appealing, and the sake was very smooth.  We told the waitress what we liked and she basically picked the food menu for us.  But, we specifically asked for the yellowtail jalapeno.  And, that was a melt in your mouth experience.  You must add a bit of the cilantro to each bite to get the complex flavors and texture.    We had butter fish and surf and turf (beware, super expensive) and when they lit the beef on fire over the stones at the table, it was nothing short of FUN!  The meat texture was so tender.  Both the steak and lobster were served with a distinct, flavorful sauce, and the pickles on the plate were soooo yummy.  Who knew pickles blended well with lobster?    When the final entrée of sushi arrived, I doubled down and tried them all.  Assorted, super fresh fish.  By then, I was in a food coma, but it was blissful."}
{"text":"Crispy rice awesome!  The rest was Meh/Ok.  But...i think i would come back for the Crispy Rice alone =)"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! Had to eat here twice to cover my craving! Last meal was chef select, what a great experience, I will be ordering that again."}
{"text":"Alive after five,chic architectural design,eclectic vibes with a narcissistic attitude is what one feels as you cross the marbled flooring.What is next?  An orgasmic mouthwatering journey about to begin. Monkfish pâté topped with caviar was my first on my list.Creamy,smooth,fatty with a slight metallic finish but adding the caviar masked the metallic taste some people don't like.Shrimp and Maine lobster with spicy lemon was my next endeavor.Just like the fireworks light up the Fourth of July,this plate had the same effect on my tastebuds.The lobster was firm,white and opaque,accompanied by the shrimp that had a very firm and crisp texture with the spicy lemon sauce that was drizzled on top,oh mother it's perfect.Half coconut Haupia was the perfect ending.The coconut was warm,supple with mixed berries on a path of light brown sugar crumbs.When the plate came out I didn't think it would work but the flavors married really well.  This definitely is a five star restaurant but I had a slight problem with the caviar which could of been of better grade for the price I was paying.Also our server was real snobby and had the body language of I don't want to serve you cause you don't look like high rollers.Hopefully management fixes some of the attitudes here especially the hostesses who check you up and down when you walk up,whaaat. And that's my take Yelpers,Peace out peeps"}
{"text":"I got stranded in Vegas once when LA air traffic control cancelled all flights into LA during the LA Fires.   That night, my coworker/buddy Danny and I decided to splurge and try this \"NOBU\" place out... and it was AMAZING! DAMN!!!  Since then I have dined at NOBU almost every time I've been in town. In fact, I even had my 30th Birthday Dinner there last year!   Now, based on that experience, I wouldn't recommend NOBU for LARGE groups... it becomes too complicated and they pair down the menu for you so you can't please everyone and charge auto-gratuity, etc... let's just say it can be a hassle.  HOWEVER, for a date or a group of 4 or so people, it's great!   The decor is simple. The staff is MORE than ample. And I want to install that polished black river rock wall they have in my house! I digress...   While, I haven't had enough sushi here to comment, my MUST-ORDER menu is as follows: -Chilled Toro Tuna Tartare with Caviar: Too rich for one man! -Roasted Arctic Char with airfried spinach. Soo Tenda' -The Cod! Buttery, delicious, melts right in yo mouth! -Baked crab legs! Creamy, buttery. DO NOT TRY to eat this on your own!   You cannot go wrong with any of these choices... unless you have high-blood pressure or are allergic to shellfish..."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi bar. The new and the classic stuff was delicious. Definitely coming back. Great service. The sushi bar chef made great suggestions and knew his craft well. The miso soup reminded me of what I had in Japan."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and presented beautifully.  Service was excellent.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food = Good. The fish is fresh, tamago is amazing, hamachi kama just melts in your mouth, shaved ice is awesome  Price = Expensive. I can't get over that they charged us (a lot!) for water..   Service = blah.   For such a nice restaurant, we should have been treated with a bit more respect. It was really only our waiter that annoyed me-- all other staff were kind.  Basically, I felt as if he was talking down to us-- like we didn't know a thing about what we wanted to eat. I was particularly offended, since we eat sushi very regularly, AND he was a younger non-Asian guy who apparently couldn't be bothered to shave and be presentable that day.   He also kept pressuring us to order more expensive things. With kids at the table, we wanted to order shrimp + vegetable tempura-- but before we could finish the order, he goes on and on about the lobster tempura, cutting us off. But we order shrimp + vegetable anyway and he give us a dirty look like we're cheap.   -____________________________-  Overall, he just seemed like he didn't want to be there, and thought that he was above us. The other waiters were so nice.. We just HAD to be stuck with that guy. I don't care how much he knows about sushi-- he could have been a tuna fish himself for all I care, but customers should always be treated with kindness and respect. I get that people have bad days but for a restaurant this nice, it's pretty much unacceptable.   So, for that, and the water, I give you three stars Nobu."}
{"text":"Nobu, a name that echos throughout las vegas when it comes to sushi. I have always heard rave reviews about and was excited to dine here.  Reservations were @ 8pm. The place was filled but was almost dead when it hit 9pmish. I don't think it's hard to dine here without reservation depending on time.  As a person who is a sushi addict, the sushi bar is where we preferred to sit. The chef was very accommodating and all smiles. All cold dish is ordered thru the chef, hot dishes are ordered with the waiter.  Rice: thicker grain compared to regular sushi rice w/ very very minimal vinegar.  Top Recommendations: *Yellowtail with jalapeno! The mini jalapeno was not spicy, but gave a nice crunch with the yellowtail texture.  *Cod with miso! The miso is delicately sweet which enhances the melt in your mouth cod. The recommendation of this dish is not to be downplayed!  *Uni shooter WITH sake. It's a pretty large shot glass and worth it. I hate the taste of alcohol but even tho this shooter has sake, it was sweet.  *Barracuda with miso and vinaigrette  (off the menu). The chef was actually preparing this for another table when we asked what it was. And behold, he said it's not on the menu!! (This is why sitting at the bar is awesome!) Glad we tried this. The sweet miso flavor and tang really made this fish stand out.  Other nigiri tried: mackerel, kohada, uni (sea urchin), sweet ebi (shrimp), octopus, tuna, tamago (egg), toro. These were pretty good and some above average, but not enough for me to order again if I ever visit again (except maybe if they still have otoro).  Dessert: mochi ice cream. Kinda worth it if you're in the mood, but it tastes just like the mochi ice cream sold in supermarkets.  I was iffy between 3 or 4 stars. I'll be nice and keep it at 4 because service was nice. My gripe is the price!! Ugh almost paid just as much here vs a michelin star sushi restaurant in SF which was superb quality compared to Nobu. I felt ripped off when i found out their uni (sea urchin) came from Cali and not Japan. C'mon Nobu! It's not hard to get sushi from Japan, esp for the price you're charging.   Verdict: eat here if you want above average sushi with creative dishes-- and just because you're in vegas!! But if you are a die hard sushi fan like I am, you know you can get better top knotch quality sushi at a way cheaper price."}
{"text":"Came here with a fun group of friends and had the most delicious meal I have had in recent memory! Sake was a plenty and I loved the family style servings!  We all throughly enjoyed this experience.  Sad to say with the current economic situation I doubt I will be back soon, but I will definitely be back!!  Delicious, beautiful, good service (not great, but good), very pricey but worth every penny!  This is definitely a special occasion place."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly, patient (a majority of us were drunk), and accommodating.  I was trying to catch up and loved the Lychee martini and the Sangria, both of which were recommended by our waiter.  The miso soup was above average, I enjoyed the large pieces of tofu I had the house roll (I don't remember if thats  the exact name) which had four or five different types of sushi.  The sushi was fresh, but I've definitely had better sushi.  I know, I know, I can't compare to the sushi in Hawaii, but even in Chicago, I've had sushi that's so silky in your mouth.  Not a must go restaurant in my book, but definitely not one to snub if you're looking for a sushi night.  Oh, Nickleback was dining there that same night.  So nice eye candy for us ladies."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a but if a trendy vibe reminiscent of a club. We had checked out the menu earlier in the day and decided we wanted to try a few of the dishes. Ordered the omakase and it was definitely worth the price. I was worried about some of the dishes that were presented (squid and oysters) but everything goes was beyond my expectations. They had interesting cocktail a as well."}
{"text":"Nobu in Vegas is the gold standard of sushi for me. The only place I've had that was better was O Ya in Boston. The service here is super friendly, I've sat at the bar, their sushi bar, and their tables. Don't be surprised to see a celebrity eating here. I sat next to a bunch of Yankees once.  As far as the food goes, you can't go wrong with any of the sushi. My favorite dishes are the Rock Shrimp and Black Cod with Miso. Must go here f you're n Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh Nobu, you are definitely deserving of a 4 star review, but alas our server (name withheld) decided that serving us wasn't in his best interests.  Now before I utilize Yelp to complain about sub-par service I must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.  The Black Cod Miso was a life changer. You owe it to yourself to have this dish. Also the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, I can't find words to do it justice.  Now as to why Nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. Our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. Why did you bring us (2) Rock Shrimp Tempura? It's delicious don't get me wrong, but two?   Maybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those additional tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? I don't know. But when I'm spending $60-70 per person, I expect a little more."}
{"text":"i have always wanted to try Nobu and finally went! and it was worth the wait let me tell you! We went for my Bday and did not have a reservation. We got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. Our Waiter Jeffrey was on point. Best service. He recommended we start with the Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno. It was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. LOL. It was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. We also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. A lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but It was still good. We also had a sear salmon sashimi which I do not remember the name that was excellent. We got spicy edamame, Beef Kushiyaki, the Black Cod with Miso and the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. The Cod was really good and highly recommended. The Wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. We literally could have kept ordering food. We had a couple of nice cocktails as well.   After dinner they brought us out a plate with Happy Birthday with a choc cake and green icecream. We also ordered the Whiskey Moose. Both desserts were to die for and I was in Heaven.   What a fun place to go. You have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. Come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. Yes please!"}
{"text":"I was expecting exquisite.  I experienced only very good.  It probably doesn't make my top 5 sushi places in the U.S. and that is what I was expecting.  Still, it was very good.  I sat at the sushi bar and only had sushi.  The sushi chef was cordial, but not overly friendly.  I had the feeling that this was more of a sushi factory (albeit a high quality factory) than a high quality sushi experience.  - The amberjack was amazing.  Full of flavor.  I've never had amberjack that had this much richness with just a hint of fishiness - The toro was nice and fatty.  Not quite as fatty as I would expect, but still very nice - The aji was average.  I've had much better elsewhere - The live octopus was seriously the best octopus I've ever had.  Just wow.  Why do other sushi places even serve that purple octopus jerky? - The golden eyed snapper was rich and full of flavor.  Not something you usually get with snapper - The Santa Barbara uni was Santa Barbara uni.  Smooth, sweet, and creamy - The flying fish was ok.  Unique fish, but not a unique flavor - The Japanese barracuda was meaty and fishy.  I enjoyed it - The jumbo clam, which I'm not a huge fan of, was better than average.  I only had to chew 32 times instead of 50.  It also had more flavor than cardboard - Loved the Japanese mackerel.  The lemon juice and sea salt really brought out the flavor  So overall, it was very good.  Not a great value and definitely not in the special category, but solid."}
{"text":"Food was very good , portion size was so small for the entree.... we got a eel roll, spicy shrimp and the king crab tempura and 1 beer the bill was $103 befor tip. We left hungry ...need to make the portions bigger ."}
{"text":"The best dining experience I have had so far. I am in love with this place and it definitely lives up to its hype! My boyfriend & I celebrated our anniversary here, I made reservations just in case it gets packed. Environment is super nice, cozy and romantic. Staff was attentive, great customer service.  We ordered: Sashimi Platter Premium: Super fresh and delicious! 13 pierce, the otoro melts in your mouth! The wasabi is freshly grinded! Uni Shooters: Loved it, super fresh and had a good amount of uni. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño: The yellow tail was so good, it tasted like otoro. it melted in your mouth and the sauce went super well with it Lobster & Wagyu Taco: Very good. I prefer the lobster one more! Rock Shrimp: Delicious! Must order this asian fusion dish! Premium Japanese Waygu: MUST MUST MUST order. They roast the Waygu on some hot stones in front of you. It is the best meat I have ever eaten to far. It is worth every penny! Pork Belly Miso Skewer: Pretty good, kinda salty, but the pork belly was roasted well. Japanese Bento Dessert: Delicious! The lava cake was amazing and the green tea ice cream tasted very authentic!   Overall this is one of my top favorite restaurants. I would definitely come here again. Next time I do want to try their chef's special, it comes with hot + cold dishes and you can set a price limit per person and the chef will accommodate!   Thank you Nobu for making my anniversary dining experience amazing!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give our March 2014 meal at Nobu @ Caesar's Palace 0 stars for service and 4 stars for food; 2 stars is my compromise. The exceptionally high prices are a given. Our lunch for 4 cost $500, and we weren't too full to skip dinner. The food, in general, was very tasty. Surprising standouts included the shishito peppers and the spicy miso chips with big eye tuna. The kumamoto oysters were shockingly disappointing; without the salsa toppings, they would have been completely flavorless. The black miso cod was also disappointing, probably because it was not as warm as it could have been. Which leads me to the real problem with the meal--the service. Our waiter, Ryan, was exceedingly condescending from the get-go. Beyond that, he spoke way too fast (and this was the consensus from 3 New Yorkers) while also failing to enunciate. He arrived at the table with way too much attitude and launched into his poorly delivered spiel despite our telling him that one of our party of four was in the rest room. When that person returned, he was less than willing to fill her in on what she'd missed. Ryan kept wanting us to let him design our menu, but since my preference would have been to see him fired on the spot, I was not inclined to let him choose our food. I cannot overemphasize how much undeserved attitude Ryan was dishing out. Our group had never seen anything like it, and between the four of us, we have eaten in great restaurants around the globe. Beyond the service problem of Ryan himself, we were also quite unhappy about the tremendous speed with which each course arrived at the table and the equally swift way in which even not yet finished plates were whisked away. One could either eat one's food as quickly as possible, without having the opportunity to savor it, or let it sit on the table, growing cold, as my black cod did. I've had significantly slower fast food. In general, I don't like to rate the quality of a restaurant based on its service rather than its food, but in this case, the horrendous service made the food much less palatable. Nobu management should be embarrassed by the restaurant's service failings."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is always great.  The service is phenomenal.  The staff always make sure you are taken care of.  Everytime we come here, the chefs are always talking to the guests to see how everything is going.    I would recommend the Omosake menu.  Let the chefs give you the best things from the kitchen.  Just tell them what you can't have and then will make you a happy person. Our favorites our the black cod miso.  I saw someone say it was too sweet but I disagree.  it's perfect.  The yellowtail sashimi is my wifes favorite.  One of their options last fall was a shaved asparagus and crab salad.  I still have dreams about it.    Can't go wrong.  It is expensive but very reasonable compared to other restaurants, especially on the strip"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took so long for a foodie like me to eat at Nobu!   With plans to spend Labor Day in Vegas, I was thrilled with how easy it was to secure an 8pm reservation on the Saturday of a long weekend.  Economy or Vegas?    Boyfriend is a Nobu-phile (who isn't, once they've been?) and so insisted that we order the Yellowtail with Jalapeno and the kobe on hot rocks, but then gave our server latitude to bring us a few other raw dishes.  Every single thing I put in my mouth was outstanding. As noted by the legions of yelpers, the Yellowtail with Jalapeno blows you away--big, bright, fresh flavors that highlight, not mask, the fish.   Next out was snapper with breadcrumbs.  Similar to the yellowtail in that it featured fresh fish adorned simply with bold, savory flavors, but with a totally different flavor profile. The third, and final, cold dish was that day's special: toro served with arugula, a truffle oil-infused dressing and topped with fresh truffle shavings.  I was a bit nervous about this dish, having seen it on the menu, because I love truffles in theory but often find them cloyingly rich and heavy, with a sort of artificial after taste.  This dish induced giggles, it was so good (see Mastro's review for further discussion).  It also induced an epiphany: I dislike truffle oil for the exact reasons enumerated above but I LOVE fresh truffles.  They have all of the best parts of truffle oil (that intense earthy umami flavor) but without any of the fake, sickeningly denseness.  I know, I know: TOTAL white people problem.    Finally, it was on to the kobe beef on hot rocks.  Fun, interactive and tasty as hell.  Lots of sauces and spices to choose from, but our favorite was just sea salt and the Japanese seven spice.  Our waiter (excellent service, incidentally) brought us a 6 oz portion which we finished but couldn't have eaten any more of.  At $27/oz, that's a pricey little entree but definitely a splurge-worthy item if you're looking/able to splurge.  We rounded things out with cocktails in lieu of wine and I definitely appreciated the relative speed with which the meal moved as we had a comedy show to get to that evening.  I left feeling sated, not stuffed, and already thinking about when I could back to Nobu for more."}
{"text":"Few times in my life have I been speechless during a meal. I know that sounds very cliche but its true.   My friend and I decided to do an all out dinner on July 4th weekend so I promised her an unforgettable meal at Nobu. I heard great things about this place and all was true.  We went for the Chef's special, around 8 courses in total, each one better than the one before. The waiter knew every dish by heart and can talk about a dish like its a piece of art (many of them looked like pieces of art)  Even the Green Tea was amazing.  Only twice have I ever had a Sushi meal that I will remember for the rest of my life. Once when I went to Japan and Nobu.   If you really want to empress a lady friend, or want to have a great start to a Las Vegas Night, you need to eat here when visiting Vegas.  Remember its not cheap, I dropped a few bills on this meal. But I Didn't care"}
{"text":"The wife and I have eaten at lots of sushi restaurants, including Morimoto in NYC, and we had high expectations for this place. The service was good to great, but you would expect that from a restaurant of this price, but what's the deal with all the caucasian waiters who can't even pronounce omakase?! (For the record, it's oh-ma-ka-say, not oma-case)  The atmosphere was pretty lacking. It was dark, loud, and looked almost like someone sort of gave up on the decoration. It was just so-so nice and didn't really give off any particular vibe. And I've never been to any kind of restaurant other than a hole-in-the-wall where they give you the bill on a freaking round white plate. Then after you give them a credit card, they bring back the receipt and a pen. Yes, just the receipt and a pen. No plate, no folio, nothing. They just put the receipt on the tabel with the pen. Does that scream 4-star restaurant to you?  When trying out new sushi restaurants, we always like to order some of the basics, to get a foundation to compare against other places. We ordered the sushi and sashimi plates. Both had decent to very good fish (but not *great*) except for two big disappointments: the tuna was really mediocre, and hello! take it easy on the wasabi, chef! Sushi chefs that use too much wasabi are either trying to cover up not-so-fresh fish, or they're just not really good at making sushi. The fish seemed pretty fresh, so I don't think they were trying to cover anything up, which leaves......  Maybe we should've had lower expectations when we came in, or maybe Nobu is only good with the fancier dishes. But for the prices they charge for \"regular\" sushi and sashimi, it's just not worth it.  The service gets a 4. The decor/vibe gets a 2.5, and  if the prices were maybe 30-40% lower, I could easily have given them 3 or maybe even 4 stars. But for what you get, I'd give them a 2.5. But since yelp doesn't let you give half stars, I'd round off this overpriced place to a 2."}
{"text":"took the fam here and it's an experience!  i had the same server \"Victoria\" on both visits and the wait times seemed long, unnecessary and not very attentive.  ordered lobster ceviche, artichoke salad, rock shrimp, beef & chicken kabobs, black cod miso, cali cut and house spec cut.   all dishes were \"okay\" but now that i've tried nobu's a few times i don't know that returning is on my list of places to dine at while in the area."}
{"text":"BLUF...The dining highlight of my trip to Vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at Nobu.  This was my third trip to Nobu, each time having had the Chef's Omakase Tasting Menu.  Nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  Since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the Chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  We both received 9 courses with sake pairing.   First course:  We started with a Kumamoto Oyster wrapped in smoked salmon topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet and sour miso sauces.  A masterful start!  The 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish!   Second course:  Shima-aji Sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gelée with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  A great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!  Third course:  Bluefin Tuna Sashimi topped with garlic purée and sliced serrano chilies with jalapeño emulsion over brown rice salsa.  I love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  The brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!  Fourth course:  Ocean Trout and Seared Sweet Shrimp Sashimi salad served with mâche, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing.   Another success!  The peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.  Intermezzo:  A Yuzu Sorbet...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.  Fifth course:  Pan-seared Seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a yuzu soy sauce.  As much as I loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!  Sixth course:  Grilled Wagyu Beef with Seared Foie Gras served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction.  The oh-so-tender Australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared foie gras.    Seventh course:  Dashi with Lobster and Enoki Mushroom with Japanese greens.  So simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  They didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  In many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.  Eighth course:  A selection of sushi...Otoro (fatty tuna), Tasmanian Sea Trout, Sea Eel, a fish I can't recall, Mirugai (geoduck), and Tamago (egg omelet).  I love sushi.  I LOVED all of these nigiri!  Ninth course:  Shiso (?) Panna Cotta with Strawberry \"Caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  The \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.  As for our sake, Chris (I think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that Nobu imports its sake from Japan and that it's made especially for Nobu.  I'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  Suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  Chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  We had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  The timing was impeccable!  I'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals I've ever had...at least since I've started yelping!  Each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  It takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if I had to pick one, it was the wagyu and foie gras course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  If you're in Vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to Nobu and have the Omakase Tasting Menu!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my baby and we were greeted by the Hostess at entrance that checked on our reservation. We were seated immediately n well attended by a lady server. Lobster was delicious but what stole the show was Bento Box flower less chocolate cake. Delicious! Loved it. Service was good and we had great time!"}
{"text":"Heaven, I'm in heaven...  I forgot how awesome this place is.  First time at LV outlet.  Been to the NYC restaurant a couple of times.  Just fantastic service and even better food.  Sushi that melts in your mouth.  Miso cod that makes you want to move into the restaurant and never leave.  I didn't take any stars away but the only ding is that its at the Hard Rock.  Dang blasted craps table money stealing Hard Rock ;-)  [just kidding]"}
{"text":"you call this sushi?  their O-toro didn't come close to some other places ive been to that are like half the price. it wasn't that fatty. a huge disappointment.  their fish isn't that fresh. the uni wasn't that good. the amaebi tasted weird. i had to mix it in my mouth with ginger to put it down.   once again, the only asians there. . ."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and cocktails. Waitstaff and bartenders were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this for dinner if you have a thick wallet. $20 cocktails are, well - so Las Vegas."}
{"text":"After our free Pitbull concert from one of our work vendors, we were hungry!  For appetizers, we decided to go to the Culinary Dropout, so for dinner, we decided to go to the next restaurant, Nobu.  I've heard AMAZING things about this place and knew that it was top notch.  Heck, I've seen it on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. As good as I know the food would be, I also knew the price tag would be pretty hefty!  When we got in, I noticed and array of seating.  Chairs, tables, booths, bar, you name it.  The green back splash of the bar really went well with the light colored wood framing around the rest of the restaurant. You felt like you were at a super trending Japanese restaurant.  It just felt high end!  Our server was nice, but knew we had a bunch to drink.  We put our menu in his hands.  Here's what we got (with prices):  -Kumamoto Oyster with Nobu Sauce  18 -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno  24 -Oyster Shooter  12 -Salmon Sashimi   24 -Mixed Seafood ceviche  22 -Snow Crab Sashimi Salad  28 -Tuna (Big Eye) sushi 12 -Salmon Sushi 10 -Yellowtail sushi 12  Some of these items came in a sushi platter.  I wasn't too sure how the platting and combination went.  All I know is the fish was SUPER fresh.  The aesthetics of each plate was like a work of art.  I felt like I was a Kardashian! LOL.  Our total bill for 7 people, came to $780. OH-EM-GEE!  For a nice, elegant night, to me, this was worth it.  Such amazing food and great atmosphere.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This should be a 3.5 star restaurant (when adjusted by price). The service is great (just like Sushisamba's) and they take care of you very fast. The waiter was the best waiter I've had so far. He was a trainee as I could see someone shadowing him and giving him prompts. He was really nice, explained to us how this restaurant was Peruvian influenced Japanese food. I did not say that I was Peruvian myself (not sure if this would have made a difference).  It is very expensive but I guess that is not a surprise. Anyways, we came here due to Groupon. They had a pretty good 5 course meal for $95. I will (want) to assume that this made no difference as to how the meal was prepared for us.   It started with Edamame, which was pretty good. It had rocky salts all over it which made it taste way better than just plain old edamame. This dish I've seen in different versions in different japanese restaurants so it was not something new.  The second dish was I think 6 pieces of sushi and a california roll. The sashimi was meh I didn't feel it was specially good or bad, just ok. Nothing melted in my mouth. Also, the california roll was the only reason why I was not super hungry at the end. Since it was given to us second, then by the end of the meal metabolism had done its share.  The third dish was (the famous) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño sauce. In my opinion it was really good. As a Peruvian, I am used to eating ceviche and tiradito. This obviously is more similar to a tiradito but the sauce had an extra kick that I loved. It was really good. If I had to go back here, I would only order this and leave.  The fourth dish was (the also famous) black cod miso. I liked it a lot. Tasted really great and I liked the sweet flavor. Now, it is probably true that if I did not know that this dish was so big I would have probably said it was excellent. I just had higher expectations as to what a great dish should be like.   Last dish was desert. The brought us the bento box. I liked the flourless cake and something that came in a capuccino cup.  Great meal overall, I felt like I was in a great restaurant but I feel it is slightly overrated. The waiter kept asking everytime about how great the food was. I guess they just expected us to clap right after eating a bite of something.  Oh! be warned. This restaurant does not have a bathroom. It shares the bathroom with the casino! Why!?   Oh! If you are into plum wine, as I am. The one that they carry was really good."}
{"text":"four star for AWESOME service! Every dish was described in detail when it was brought out. water was ALWAYS refilled quickly, as was my tea. plates were frequently exchanged and finished items quickly removed! Wonderful suggestions from our main waiter.   Love the yellow tail with jalapeno the bed. the cod with lettuce wrap was a little on the sweet side for me. spicy tuna wasn't really spicy enough. I couldn't really tell if the sashimi or sushi was fresh because all the dishes were overpowered by the sauce--but most of the sauces were good. popcorn chicken also very tasty. all in all, great dining experience but properly would not go out of my way to come here--pretty pricey."}
{"text":"The service was top-notch. We all sat down and had dinner her for the first time. The waiter asked us if we would like to order off the menu or as tradition at Nobu they offer a family style for the price you wish to spend per person. So we ended up doing the family style and it was worth it. We did pick to spend $100 per person. We had about 7 nice sized dishes and they were all amazing. Your favorite one was the popcorn shrimp in a chipotle type orange sauce. It was out of this world that I had to order more after all the family style. A must try place! It's located in the Hard Rock Casino"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi I have ever had. The quality and artistry of this establishment is unparalleled. The sushi and sashimi is incredible fresh. My favorite dishes are the wagyu beef tacos, the rock shrimp tempura, the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi and the crispy rice tuna. Expect to pay about 80-100 dollars per person including alcohol. I recommend ending the night with espresso and the Mochi plate. It is well worth every penny, nobu will become your next dining obsession."}
{"text":"Heard great things about nobu for years so wanted to give it a whirl. I think the hype led to my extremely high expectations. If it wasn't so overpriced, I would have given it a better rating. Don't get me wrong the food was pretty good. Had the yellowtail sashimi to start, and salmon tacos. The tacos are bite sized so I was pretty disappointed by that. The concept is good, it lacked substance at $7 a taco. The shared hot dishes were very good but definitely pricey. If you are looking to splurge on atmosphere and decent food, this place is alright"}
{"text":"So let me start off with the reality that this place has A+ food. The restaurant has great lighting and the sound is perfect for conversation over dinner. So you may ask why I gave it 3 stars...  If you are attempting to give a good dining experience, you should make sure staff is aware of this. Having to get out of the way of staff while they are walking and dodging staff walking backwards is not the attention to detail I expect. Also, asking if the seating is desirable for the party or desire to seat elsewhere is good etiquette (having been seated in the middle of a near empty restaurant, when better seating is available). Finally, the waiter made a point to talk about the fusion of Japonessa and Peruano cuisine... besides the one line of ceviche, not much of a nod to Peru.   Don't let this review dissuade you from trying this place. Highly recommend the rock shrimp tempura and wagyu beef tacos. Food is good, just need to step up their level of service."}
{"text":"Lucky efficient service.   Too much upscale on menu especially if you say you've been to another Nobu.  Little unnecessary at this price level.  Waste no money on tacos.  Microscopic.  Rice a tad undercooked. Good for newbies to sushi and sashimi that want to be seen on social media."}
{"text":"I was skeptical, but Nobu delivered. I just finished dinner with a friend of mine and I had to write a review before I forgot the details. Let's just get to the chase.  My friend and I walked in and I asked our server what the best three dishes were. He then recommend these three. I felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. But I often do this for restaurants that I've never been to. After dinner, I find myself recommending the same. Here's the pro and cons:  1) Toro Carpaccio- Okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, I had to know what it was about. Now I know and here's the scoop. The toro is incredibly delicious. It is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro I've ever had. The fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. Capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil and soy dressing over greens really hit the mark. I will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (That's right, I'm Chinese and I'm saying it). I would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.  2)Yellowtail Jalapeno- This was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. The Yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. The jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. I would actually recommend this as a first dish.   3) Black Cod Miso- I thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. Cooked to near perfection, the Cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. The miso glaze wasn't much to look at. For me, it resembled gravy. I've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. Nevertheless, the dish was great. I actually prefer Black Cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. Sweet Miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable.   4)Sea Urchin sashimi or sushi!!! Just order it.   My friend and I were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but I must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. Overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. Here's the list:  -Salmon skin hand roll- thin slices of salmon skin with gobo, rice and seasoning. Nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the salmon skin.  -Baracuda Dry Miso- $40 for six slices of barracuda. Very interesting texture as I haven't had barracuda before. The lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. Again, I see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so I simply eat and keep my comments to myself.   Live Scallop- again, great cut of scallops, but nothing special to write home about. It was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce.   New Style Oyster- Four pieces of Kumamoto Oysters served ready to enjoy. So you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.  Crispy rice w/ Big Eye Tuna- For lack of a better term, it's Japanese tatter tots. Square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. Well prepared, tasty, but nothing special.   All in all, it was a great experience. My general assessment is that Nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. Not exactly my cup of tea. Maybe I'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. However, I can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. So I eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"I spent a week in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel for NYE this year. It was not my first visit to Nobu, so we were very much looking forward to a meal there.  As always, it was fantastic. The cucumber martini was so very refreshing I am still craving it. The yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. We also had the lobster tacos which were great.  For hot dishes, we had the rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce and the black cod with miso. Can you say melt in your mouth? This is the reason I return to Nobu again & again."}
{"text":"Hostess team was weak and disorganized. We had a reservation, restaurant was not at capacity and it was early by Vegas standards.  The delay appeared to be related more to their disorganization than demand or to orchestrate the allure of the restaurant.  I actually witnessed a hostess advise an older patron that she would need to leave her walker at the front door due to space.  Hmmm...how many different levels of dumb does that bring to mind?  The wait staff was good but we did not have the consistency of 1 server.  That offered confusion and delays at times.  They were all knowledgeable and helpful.  The food was good but not worth all the effort to get to Caesars.  This was not the experience I expected from Nobu or had at other Nobu restaurants.  I would not recommend or go again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Too bad I can only eat here like once a year since they charge an arm and a leg but it's an absolute treat! Every single thing we ordered was deliciously memorable. The freshest fish ever, albeit in small portions. The oyster trio was yummy! Don't skip out on crispy rice cubes and spicy tuna. The panna cotta dessert was so light and refreshing, a perfect finish to our meal. The service was top notch as well. Again, if dining as a couple, expect to be at least  $200 poorer when you leave this joint, but your tummy will thank you :)"}
{"text":"My friend been dying to asked me and my wife for a double date. For once I decided okay, what could possibly go wrong in Nobu. I am right? Nothing goes wrong. Everything was perfect and absolutely delightful. My wife is pregnant and her option is limited. But she absolutely enjoyed her meal.  A few must try dish however is Softshell crab and watermelon combo. I didn't even ordered this dish, the manager is nice enough to send us this complimentary awesome dish. Next worth mention item is the crispy rice. I mean, its rice deep fried with spicy tuna on top, what so great about it right???   The presentation!! They make it look like a nice delicious rice lollypop. They have great miso cod and OMG that pork belly appetizers just melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Very poorly organized.  Had a 9 pm reservation.  Was told 15 minute wait which turned into another 15-30 minute wait.  Seriously!?!?   Very portly managed place.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"NOBU.  This 5 star Yelp rating is really a 6 star experience.  Okay, I'm a self admitted sushi snob.  I can't help it.  No matter where I go it always comes back to Nobu--Bahamas, New York, Malibu, Las Vegas...  Every single location I've been to has provided a first-class sushi experience.  The Las Vegas folks were especially nice - particularly since I was playing those Wheel of Fortune machines again and much to my husband's dismay we missed our reservation and they gave our table away.  As soon as we arrived, they moved us to the top of the list for the sushi bar - on one of their busiest nights.  Thank you Nobu Las Vegas team.  PROS: - Incredible selection of sushi, dinners, etc. - A great place to meet up at the sushi bar or to have the full first class dinner experience - The best fresh fish, most unique combinations (my fav - yellow tail sashimi with japlapeno...  yum, I have dreams about this)  CONS: - Pricey - Maybe a bit pretentious (according to my husband), but I disagree"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Sure for three people it was $300 dollars including tip but my son swears he's never had anything better. The drinks are top of the line and very reasonably priced. Mention a birthday and they bring out a nice little cake for the celebrant   They are not open for lunch and I recommend dinner reservations on weekends but midweek you probably won't have a long wait. I made reservations to be safe but they didn't look crowded enough for them to be warranted.  (I'm in a back brace so even a short wait feels like an eternity to me now.)  If you're adventurous I'd suggest letting them design your meal. My son chose this option and was not disappointed. My pictures are of his plates. The miso was the best I've ever tasted. Granted it's hard to mess up broth but whatever they put in it made it significantly above par.   It's one of those places where you can't just read the menu rather you have to \"discuss it.\" I feel terrible that I cannot remember our servers name but he was great. If management reads this and would like to figure out who it was they can ask the staff which young man had this conversation on March 26th around 730p....  Server: I'm very gullible.  Me: Did you know that's not in the dictionary.  Server: What's not? Me: Gullible, it's not in the dictionary.  Server: WOW I'm always learning something new.  Pause for dramatic effect while he realizes.  My mother: She's teasing you, of course it's in the dictionary.  Server: See, I told you I was gullible.   This down to earth interaction was the best part of our visit to Vegas that didn't involve murder or magic. (CSI Experience and Masters of Illusion).  Also, if they still can't remember us mention the lady with the cool walker that folds in half because they stored it for us while we ate. I made a joke that they were holding me hostage until our bill was paid because I couldn't get away without my walker.   My comparison is based off of many dinners at high end places like Top of the Hub in Boston and Gordon Ramsey's London to give you an idea of my base line for excellent food. You will drop a pretty penny if you go all out here but this is one place that is well worth it. We visit Vegas annually, usually hitting new places each year but Nobu and HRH are definitely worth coming back to.   (Please feel free to see my Hard Rock Hotel review to know more about accommodations and service at the hotel.)"}
{"text":"It was good. It was very, very good. I particularly recommend the tuna and jalapeno sashimi (and I don't normally eat raw fish, but I wasn't going to pass it up this time) and the cod that comes on a lettuce leaf with a little shredded, toasted phyllo on top.   Our waiter was patient with us, and helped us decide even though we were a bit clueless. The service is fast once you make up your mind about what to eat; and we ordered in waves, which the kitchen was fine with.   The only reason this wasn't a 5-star experience is that the room is small, crowded, dark, and noisy. We were literally reading the menus with the lights from our cellphones. The price of everything probably also weighs into my decision not to give the place 5 stars. For five of us to eat enough not to be starving but not to be totally full either was more than $300, and that includes one drink apiece."}
{"text":"Nobu deserves its place with the absolute top eateries in Vegas.  As with its LA and Honolulu counter parts, Nobu Las Vegas uses only the freshest ingredients.  As with all other locations, the nigiri sushi is very skillfully prepared but as with all other locations, why fill up on simple sushi when there are so many great, mouthwatering, fusion dishes to try.  On recent visits, the king crab and avocado ceviche was excellent and so was the lobster and fresh shitake salad.  The broiled yellowtail collar is a must try.  Perfectly cooked.  The sweetness of the fish just explodes in your mouth.  Although its not sustainable seafood, the Chilean sea bass with dried miso.... ahhhhh heaven.  Finally, you cannot go wrong with the king crab tempura.  Prices are in line with restaurants of this caliber.  Special note, if you are from Hawaii, you will find the prices at this location 30-50 percent higher than in Honolulu for similar dishes.  Service is excellent.  The wine list is OK and in line with Vegas pricing.   As with all Nobu restaurants, I prefer to drink extra vodka or gin martinis with their food.  It pairs well and cleans the palate between bites and courses.  Baller status for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience!    Came here with friends a few nights ago and the service was terrible.  The waiter got our orders wrong and the food came at the wrong times.  Completely a disaster, as far as service is concerned.  But, one might ask, the food must have been good, when it was finally served?  No.  It was only mediocre and extremely overpriced.  I highly recommend going elsewhere.  There are so many great options in Las Vegas.  This place.  Not good.  Not good, at all."}
{"text":"Someone told me a while back that many great chefs have restaurants in Vegas, but a shittier version than normal. And this Nobu met that statement.   My girlfriend and I didn't really get to test the entire experience, because the experience from the beginning was a bit off.  Our server made us feel rushed. He had understood that we have been to other Nobu locations before, but didn't make for an experience worth repating.   We ordered some of the traditional dishes along with the traditional mango passion fruit martini, and was disappointed with everything. Not saying that anything was bad, it just wasn't up to the standards that this brand has built us up to.  It would be difficult for me to return to this location, but I will not stray away from the the other Nobu's I've been to in the past."}
{"text":"This is only for the bar. We had a group of 4 and already ate and was looking for a quiet place to drink. All the bars at Caesars was packed and we remembered Nobu, and the bar was quiet on a Saturday night. I forget the bartenders name but he was a young man and was very knowledgeable and even customized our drinks. I had a MIA MARGARITA  and my wife had some sort of Seasonal Horchata drink. They were awesome! If you looking for a quiet place to take a date for drinks, this is it! We will be back in a few months!"}
{"text":"I'd rate the sushi, 7/10 and the drinks 9/10. Nothing special about the sushi. SUPER pricey for the quality of the food.  Our server was very attentive"}
{"text":"Went there with a few coworkers and nobody was satisfied. It's a high end restaurant so not gonna knock for giving tiny portions.. But the taste was very average. I've had better, and worse, Japanese at different restaurants. Presentation was terrible, would have never guessed I was at a nice restaurant. Service was decent though. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"So myself and 4 others had reservations at Nobu inside Caesars Friday night.  I will preface this by saying I have been to two Nobu's in Los Angeles/Malibu as well as the Nobu in the Hard Rock.  There are a lot of similarities and I typically order Omakase.  The server informed me this particular Nobu was doing a special family style Omakase to celebrate Caesars 50th anniversary.  I ordered the Nobu sidecar whiskey cocktail which was a perfect way to start the meal.  They served the cold dishes first, and unlike the other omakase meals there wasn't a pallet cleanser and neither was there a soup.  All things aside it was the wonderful meal as you would expect for $250 a head.  The A5 Kobe beef served over hot stones was excellent as well as the sea bass.  All the dishes from the sushi chef were amazing as well. Not a punch my wallet can take too often, but a great meal to wrap up a great trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a place that you go to when you have 2 hours to burn.  I went with a group of friends and we had a great experience. Our waiter was awesome and made some great recommendations. Really cool atmosphere and you never felt rushed.  We paid $500 for 6 of us and didn't feel cheated..."}
{"text":"This place is VERY expensive.  For example, an echigo beer in Scottsdale is $12, here it was $18, adjust your price expectations accordingly.  However, there was enough here that I can't get elsewhere and things that I can get were better.  Loved the salmon belly sashimi, and the A5 steak was so amazing. It's served on black rocks surrounded by coarse white salt, then set on fire!  If you're ready to drop $500 per couple it is definitely an experience.  Take advantage of server recommendations."}
{"text":"Executive Summary: One of the best Japanese restaurants in the world!  Value (Price/Quality): Good - price is expensive, but quality is outstanding.   Customer Service: Good, but needs improvement. I've been to other Nobu locations in the world and the service at this location is very sub-standard compared to their Monaco and Hong Kong locations. Especially since this is Las Vegas and America, these waiters, bus boys, and hostess need to earn it. Service at their global locations far more superior.   You'll like this place if: If you appreciate Tasting Menus, been to Japan, like baller places or have a global taste palate.   Don't go here if: If you eat California Rolls or think Panda Express is Japanese food.  Transportation: No parking. Limited Street parking, Ample bike parking. Limited parkades in the area. Best to walk. Public Transit only on Bathurst or Spadina streetcars  Tip: Yellow Tail with Jalapeno and Black Cod Miso are the must trys! I also got the wagyu beef tacos. The peppers is a tastier option than classic edamame. Currently they offer a $50 USD bento box for the Caesar's Palace 50th Anniversary promotion.   The Good, Bad and Ugly Details: If got $200 USD+ budget do the tasting menu. Otherwise, you are robbing yourself of an experience. Skip the Vegas buffet and come here or just don't gamble your life away and spend it here where you know you won't be disappointed.   Yelp Customer Bottom Line: If you made it this far to read my review, count your pennies and save up to come here if you don't anticipate on visiting any other Nobu locations near you.  Business Opportunity: Step up the customer service. Especially considering the brand is part of the Nobu Hotel, it should be a seamless guest experience from the moment a guest books a reservation to paying a bill. Take a learning from Shangri-La Hotels guest services for their diamond members."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a large group, and they never gave us a hard time about last minute changes on the size of the group.   Our waiter was attentive, patient, and gave great recommendations, and it was easy to get helped, even though we were seated allll the way in the back of the restaurant.   I had the yellowtail with jalapenos and the miso cod, and between all the folks at our table, I tasted a pretty good portion of the menu, including desserts, and nothing was bad.   When I go back, I'm getting the lamb chops or the miso cod. Can't wait. Vegas anyone?"}
{"text":"Ate here solo due to boredom after my friends left Vegas early, and I ordered omakase at the bar.   First, the taste and quality: Nobu chef imbue their creations with a South American touch, using unique spices and pairings. I would consider it Japanese-South American creative tapas. Delicious and intriguing creations which had me closing my eyes and savoring the novel tastes. I hoped to prolong the moment as long as possible before the inevitable gulp and swallow. The meal felt like a 10 act performance, although I was a bit disappointed that the first half completely outshined the closing half.  Service: waitstaff was like a ninja, darting from the shadows behind me to assist at every opportune moment (in the first half of the performance). Halfway through, the chef no longer personally created my dishes and they arrived straight from the baxk of the kitchen. At this point, waitstaff became slightly disinterested and less ninjalike.  Ambiance: modern, dimly lit, but nothing extraordinary. It could pass for any old sushi joint in the bay area, CA.  Value: at $250, sooo not worth it. I think I have had superior omakase from small lesserknown restaurants in the OC for 1/4 the price. Omakase in Tsukiji Japan is superior in quality and freshness for 1/4 the price, too. Omakase from the world-famous Jiro in Tokyo is about $200 more, but worth it for bragging rights and last meal on earth status.  Verdict: unless you are very bored, skip this place, save your money and spend it where it will go a heckuv a lot further. I am curious about the Nobu hotel at Caesars, though..."}
{"text":"Ordered the $300 per person NYE omakase. Aside form this ridiculous price, I would say that unless you're really really curious, don't do it. Nobu is a celebrity hot spot and not exactly affordable or worth it to us common folk. You can get a better omakase for a lot cheaper without the Nobu name.   Food wise, everything from start to finish had some kind of unnecessary add on or detail that made it exquisite. Most of it just tasted like ceviche haha but honestly the plating and the service and the experience was pretty impressive, but as for the food like I said you're not paying the $ just for food but also for the presentation.  Omakase included a few items not usually available to the general public such as the endangered blue fin tuna.   Enjoyed my experience, but would rather buy an IPad. Haha"}
{"text":"First time coming to a Nobu. I really wanted to go to the Ceasar's Palace one, as it seems to be the more popular one, but they didn't have any open reservations. It really wasn't too busy, but we sat at the bar. The bar tender was really helpful and talked me through a lot of the menu items.   I started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno. Perfect start to the meal! The fish was so fresh. Next I had the Lobster ceviche. It's served on a bed of lettuce. I was debating between that or the crab and the bar tender really pushed the lobster, but it was just ok to me. I feel like there was almost too much going on. My friend ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and I ended up eating a good amount of that. It's way better than my second dish.  I closed with a soft shell crab roll. The roll was delicious!!! However, I feel like next time, I might get it as a hand roll instead of a cut roll. I feel like you don't get the full soft shell crab experience if you just cut it up and throw it in a roll like that."}
{"text":"Got the 5 course meal, was absolutely amazing and perfect. Service was exceptional and so was the food.   Great atmosphere, but the restaurant was really busy so call ahead for reservations.   Not cheap, but definitely worth the money. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"We ate omakase for three people tonight.  I've had omakase in the past and it was much better, much fresher and much less expensive.  Nobu is highly overpriced and overrated.  My fish tasted like it was starting to go bad, I could tell based on the texture that it has been frozen awhile.  The hot meals were over-cooked as well.  Overall, all the food I've had on the strip in Las Vegas has been much more expensive than even five star restaurants where I live.  I was very much looking forward to dining at Nobu and I was really disappointed. Save your money and go to a real sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"We also make it a point to have dinner at Nobu while in Vegas.  This time it did not disappoint. We let the waitress pick some items for us- we barely looked at the menu!   It was a little noisier than usual due to some large groups dining that night, but service was still relatively good(a bit slow in the drinks). Must have- black miso cod.  We also enjoyed the king crab and a seared tuna."}
{"text":"Nobu is one of our favorite restaurants and this location did not disappoint.  The food was amazing...I actually said that I would eat it all again right after we finished!  We had the Tuna Tatake, Black Miso Cod and Soft Shell Crab over Golden Watermelon.  Amazing!   The first time we visited a Nobu we thought that we would be getting sushi but we ended up ordering hot & cold plates off the menu and specials and have never gone wrong.  You can get good sushi at a lot of other places.  I highly recommend going with the other items on the menu and trust your server on the special and amount of food to order!!  The service was great - a sure sign of this is the fact that as soon as I sat down they noticed I had black pants on so they swapped out my white napkin for a black one.  I LOVE that (another restaurant we had been at that weekend had to search around for a black napkin once I started getting lint on my black dress)!  Be aware that it is a little pricey, but in my opinion well worth it."}
{"text":"You gave me a sushigasm You got me drunk You cost me a lot of money You were worth every penny  You, Me, and dinner... be there or be quadrangular.  I enjoy you Nobu and your little fish too."}
{"text":"We were going to go to the Caesars palace location but opted for this location instead since we were able to make last minute reservations.   We initially came in wanting to get the omakase (nobu signature) but our server made a recommendation to pick our dishes based on what we like, what we don't like and our dietary restrictions. We opted for this option because it sounded like something that we would actually enjoy. (At this point, we haven't even received a menu to look at). This is probably where I went wrong and regretted not getting the nobu signature.   The dishes didn't really feel like they were tailored towards what I liked/preferred. There was really nothing special with the recommended dishes because many others around received the exact same dishes/courses.   There's usually seven courses, but we had to skip out on the last course and dessert. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. But for the price point, I thought I would've enjoyed my food so much more. I just didn't really care for the crispy rice and the rock shrimp tempura - it was just filler food. It probably would've been better to just order off the regular menu.   On the other hand, I did enjoy the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and the Alaskan cod.   Also, make sure to ask for a menu if you don't get one. Definitely going to try a different location and hopefully I have a better experience with the food."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. NOT that great for me since I DON'T eat sushi/sashimi (raw stuff). LoL I know that Nobu is supposed to be well known for their fresh seafood sashimi. Anyhow, I believe this place is OVERHYPED and highly OVERPRICED tapas style. LoL Even their alcohol drinks are OVERLY priced too. OMG!!! I believe ALL Nobu locations are going to be the same thing. Smh BUT this location is nice, always crowded, see & be seen and a lot of beautiful people."}
{"text":"Typically delicious sushi, very good izakaya, but the noise, the noise! What? I can't hear you over the frat party in the next table chugging beers and screaming at each other. What? No, the management never asked them to tone it down, just kept serving. What? No, I wouldn't go back, there's just as good elsewhere on the strip."}
{"text":"Everyone i spoke to really hyped this place up but to be honest for the money you pay its not that spectacular. The food is really tasty and well presented however I've eaten at a lot of high end restaurants and the food just wasn't on par. From memory the bill came over $300 for two people and we didn't even buy that much plus the server was in training which didn't help. If the price was half of what it was then i would be giving this place a five star its only based on what i was expecting for the money i paid."}
{"text":"We are huge sushi fans and heard only good things about this place so we decided to try it out. Very cool atmosphere, friendly service.   Bottom line: best part are the cocktails, appetizers, and small dishes- very unique. Sushi rolls nothing to brag about. Priced very high.  Drink menu unique with lots to choose from, we got some cocktails with a sake base to try something different and they did not disappoint.  For food: mixed ceviche was our favorite dish, different than the usual diced up kind you get elsewhere. Yellowtail and jalapeño was good and we got it bc was highly recommended, but seems a little over-hyped and also had a ton of soy sauce. Shrimp lobster hot dish was great, my wife really enjoyed it, good amount of seafood. As for sushi, we got the spicy tuna and chef roll (similar to rainbow roll)- they were good but definitely nothing extraordinary that you would expect.  Worth the experience but we eat a lot of sushi and this place is not near the top of sushi places we have been."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was because of what we ordered, but I was not impressed. I eat a lot of sushi normally so I've had a lot of good sushi and some bad sushi. Nobu is a very well known restaurant but I didn't think it was that great. It was just good. It definitely was a bit pricey, but I understand it's Vegas. However, even at normal prices, it still wouldn't have impressed. Maybe next time I'll order other items. I will give it one more try."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my life.  I want to say it was more like an adventure.  Our server was the best and we let him lead the way.  He did all of the ordering for us and it was well worth the high price.  This is definitely not a place I can be a regular at (boohoo) as it is VERY expensive.  But every once in a while you have to treat yourself and this was an amazing treat."}
{"text":"If you come here, make sure you ask for another server if you are unfortunate enough to get Roye. The food was great, don't get me wrong, but the service at the end of the meal left such a bitter taste on my palate.  The black cod with miso - 5/5 stars. Definitely a must-have if you're coming here for the first time.  The creamy spicy crab - 3/5 stars. It was very oily, salty, and didn't impress us. Felt like it should've been served with some kind of carb (maybe bread or rice or noodles).  The yellowtail jalapeno - 5/5 stars. Fresh fish and very subtle jalapeno flavors - delicious.  The bento box - 4/5 stars. Ordinary dessert, nothing special and small portion size (the chocolate lava cake at Max Brenner is 100x better).   Now back to my bad service experience. First, Roye mistakenly gave me the alcoholic lychee martini, when I distinctly ordered the lychee/pomegranate juice. The difference: juice is $7 and the martini is $14. He was nice enough to change my drink without much hassles, however, when we received the bill after our meal, he forgot to take the martini off. I politely asked him to change it and he agreed, however, he disappeared - we were left sitting there wondering what happened to him, then finally we noticed him chatting w/the folks at a nearby table and didn't acknowledge me when I tried to get his attention regarding the bill. FINALLY after 20 minutes of waiting, I flagged down another waiter and he was able to get the revised bill to me in less than a minute!  Roye totally left us waiting - if he was super busy, he SHOULD have asked someone to fix our bill - no excuse, especially after spending ~$200 at this place. I don't think it's wrong to expect better service and treatment.  Nobu - you should hire or train the servers to make sure the customers are satisfied, your food can't speak for itself."}
{"text":"There's really nothing that can even compare to Nobu. We went this past weekend on a Saturday night for my dad's birthday celebration in Vegas (it was 6 of us at a prime time, so keep in mind that I made the reservation about a month prior to it on OpenTable). The drinks were great, we ordered a variety of specials like this one that literally tasted like Christmas and fall, to this Lychee Martini, which was definitely a favorite among the crowd. You have the option to have the waiter order all of the courses for you rather than picking from the menu, which is exactly what we did. It worked out great since everything is family-style, plus we had half & half meat eaters vs. seafood lovers, so the balance of options and courses were perfect. Our waitress Amber was amazing. Her choices were spot on when we told her what we liked/didn't like. We were probably at the restaurant for 2 hours but took our time with everything. It's definitely extremely expensive, but 10000% worth it especially for my dad's 60th birthday. What a place."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I'm not a huge sushi fan but my friends are so we found ourselves at Nobu before the Mariah Carey concert.   I decided to be adventurous and tried a bit of everything they ordered and was pleasantly surprised, it was all very good.  Our server was super patient with us and very knowledgeable.  We scored a booth right next to the counter so we were able to watch the sushi being created.  Prices were pretty high, but I was prepared for that going in.  It was a good experience, no complaints, but nothing \"wow-ed\" me either."}
{"text":"Very Mediocre for a restaurant like this. You would expect quality to be better since Nobu has his own tag at the fish markets. And you would EXPECT the chef to know how to cook a lobster tail so it doesn't come out like rubber. We got the $200 a head Omakase and it was okay but definitely nothing to rave about. I've been to many other authentic Japanese places that were much much better. The service was exceptional tho and that's why I gave the 3 stars. The Manager knew it was unexceptable for the lobster to come out that way and took it off our bill. The sake list was sparse and very disappointing. If you're going to serve ONLY Nobu sake, it BETTER BE GOOD! Even the Premium tasted of cheap sake. Tsk tsk!! People who spend this kind of money EXPECT QUALITY! I wouldn't go back, unless something changed."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, their dishes were a work of art. Nice presentation with a unique flavor. Sat at the sushi  bar and had two dishes that our waiter recommended. Dish one was a salmon sashimi but with a light lemon sauce with a leaf of cilantro. The second dish was a baked cod which had seasoning and sauce on the side. Both dishes were great, like nothing I had ever experienced. I will most definitely recommend this place for their unique dishes and fine cut of seafood.  Can't wait to go back and explore more items from their menu."}
{"text":"We love going to Nobu and have been to many locations all over.  We had a party of ten so I got to try many things on the menu:  rock shrimp - always delicious yellowtail jalapeno - yum ceviche taco - yum wagyu taco- yum shrimp tempura- okay, nothing special wagyu dumplings- amazing yamakazi sidecar- drink was pretty yummy chilean sea bass with miso- ok- should have ordered the black cod dessert was the chefs tasting platter- this was the best part of dinner!   decor was dated- not up to current LV standards. Next time we will go to the new location at Caesars Palace  Service was mediocre. Not sure what was up with the waiter. He was barely seen. We had to order from 3 different waiters because ours was nowhere to be found. It was my sister's 21st bday and we wanted to make it a special dinner, but it felt like we were ignored. Thank you to the manager for making up for it.  Overall, I'm still a big fan of Nobu, but will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST! If you love sushi, Nobu is THE PLACE! The service is attentive but not overbearing. They have an order they want you to eat; however, are willing to change it up if you seem to know what you are doing.  The FOOD: The food here is OUTRAGEOUS! There were items I loved & items I loved even more! We didn't get anything we didn't LOVE.  Atmosphere: Extremely pleasant place to eat! Ambiance is perfect. If only all restaurants were this much fun! We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"First off...service is awesome!! That's the best thing about this place. The food is so medium. It's super Americanized Japanese food that has some modern cooking elements added to it, but nothing that elevates the food enough for the price. We went on a Travelzoo special deal, $95 for 7 courses for two people. If we had to spend the normal price, I would've been angry for sure. At least I get to cross this off of my restaurant bucket list.   The courses... - Edamame: regular cold edamame with chunky kosher salt. Nothing special! I make yuzu citrus salt edamame that would give this place a run for it's money.  - Salmon carpaccio and vegetable spring rolls: the salmon is covered in some mustard sauce that takes away from the salmon taste, and frankly, the salmon quality is not that great. It's the same quality as any run of the mill sushi joint that serves American rolls in OC. The vegetable spring roll in the center was kinda nice for the freshness and crunchy aspects.  - Sushi course: comes with a caterpillar roll and 3 fish types of sushi. C'MON!!! A CATERPILLAR ROLL? You can't even tell it's a caterpillar roll because the eel taste is too absent. Tastes like a rice roll covered in eel sauce. The quality of the fish for the Nigiris was again not as fresh as I would expect for this caliber of a restaurant. I don't know who picks the fish or the fish monger, but they need to do better. I forget the 3 types of fish now, but one did come with a perilla leaf nestled between the rice and fish. I liked that element added, the fish itself was covered in a citrus and salt, which is my favorite flavor profile for sushi. The others were covered in a sweet soy or something. I can't remember very well, because it was all very unmemorable.  - Miso black cod: the quality of the fish is spectacular in some parts and super dried in others. This fish dish is good, but I would say a bit too overly sweet. This was my fav dish of all the courses, but it's not enough to make me wanna come back ever. This dish wasn't executed 100% perfectly.  - Ribeye course: the meat is cooked to a super tender texture since it's braised for a while, but the sauce it's braised in is again sweet. There was a weird lemongrass taste somewhere in the dish that didn't belong. The heart of palm done two ways - pureed and fried - both did nothing for me. The fried ones tasted just like oil and no distinct flavor. The puree was mush and added no value to the dish either. I guess it's a rice substitute, but it's a poor sub for it.  - Mushroom soup: tastes like mushroom water with smoke added. The mushrooms in it are the stem of king oyster mushroom, maitake mushroom which is also called hen-of-the-wood, and one shiitake. I recognize all the mushrooms immediately since I cook with all these myself often. I'm not sure how they get the smoke taste, I'm guessing they cold smoke the mushrooms before adding it to simmering water. Could use salt or dashi or something else to take it to the next level.  - Dessert: 3 fried bland balls. The black sesame ice cream is good though!   Don't waste your time, money, or stomach space for this place. Would've put one star except for the service that night was really nice. I think Nobu needs to let me cook him or take him around for some real Japanese dishes with soul."}
{"text":"Impressive! I really liked Nobu. As stated in previous reviews, I don't mind spending a couple dollars on food, BUT I need an interesting flavor. It was my first taste of interesting flavor in Las Vegas. I started with the lobster ceviche. I was expecting a bowl of lobster served with nacho chips. Reckon I'm basic. But no. Nobu's ceviche was served on lettuce. Heavily citrus flavored, but not overwhelming. My friend had shrimp and lobster with mushrooms. The mushrooms were so tasty, there she was devouring them in favor of the lobster and shrimp. There's hope for veganism after all. What the Health?!?!? My steamed sea bass was interesting as well. The dry miso chips on top stole the show. I was not a fan of the green tea ice cream.  All that taken into account, I like a well oiled machine and Nobu is. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, personable, and prompt. When Nobu could've been stuffy and pretentious, it was an old friend putting you onto something new. I was impressed that the person keeping our water full knew the intricacies of the menu. That is a reflection of training and training is a result of an owner and management that demands greatness. I'm here for that. All I ask of a fine dining is that you live up to the price and Nobu does. I'll be back to order 1 of everything soon enough."}
{"text":"THE best sushi I've ever had!  The decor is fabulous, as well as the clientele and the staff.  Great food!"}
{"text":"I didn't find this place to be amazing for the price I paid.  But I guess that is to be expected when you're in Vegas.  Over priced food.  I ordered some salmon nigiri and their \"specialty\" roll.  Honestly, I would have had better at my local place (Maru).  The salmon portion is less than what I get at Maru and the \"specialty\" roll was so-so.   I know Nobu is a big deal in the culinary world, so I probably just need to shell out the bills to try the amazing stuff. -- One day."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was pretty good here, but the dishes were waaaay expensive. I tried this place with a group of friends.  We liked the food but each dish wasn't fulfilling.  You'd probably have to spend $50-100 to satisfy yourself."}
{"text":"Food and service was great! You have to order the signature dishes and the Tenderloin prepared Medium Well was perfect.  I really liked the jalapeño sashimi as well.  I sat at the Sushi Bar for the experience.  Ask for Scott and Mike, these guys will make sure you get EXACTLY what you want.  This place is perfect for a date and cool to meet someone new.... highly recommend if you're in the Caesars.  Bring your pocketbook, you have to be prepared to pay for the quality!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, food is good, but doesn't feel pleasure atmosphere , desserts were very delicious))))"}
{"text":"I've been avoiding Nobu because for the longest time I thought it was a hyped up, whitewashed Japanese restaurant that is all name. I was totally wrong.   I finally tried it when my friend's parents treated our group of 10 for a birthday. The service was pretty good and the food was amazing. The flavors of every dish were delicate and I love the use of truffle and yuzu in everything!! My favorite was the hamachi carpaccio and the sea bass. Even the drinks were yummy (barely tastes like alcohol) I cant believe Ive missed out on Nobu for so long but I am definitely going to go to the Malibu one!!"}
{"text":"Great food like in Japan. If you are looking for great sushi I would say here is one of the best. We have been trying a famous one in LV as I m Asian girl this is the best one. However the negative side is very expensive and the service is alright."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here before going to see Absinthe (which I highly recommend!). We were basically wandering around Caesar's and just came in without knowing much about the food. We'd had a late lunch at Holsteins and wanted something a little lighter.  I had a lychee martini, which was very good. We also ended up ordering the lobster ceviche, black cod miso, and some tuna skewers, I believe. Each dish was presented by a different person, who would instruct you on the best way to enjoy the dish.  The meal was surprisingly good - just be prepared for very small portions! It was definitely not a very filling meal, and pretty expensive. Overall, though, we really enjoyed eating here!"}
{"text":"This is the best meal we have had in vegas. The lobster is amazing and the tempora is worth mentioning. Try the free range chicken if you have someone in your group who is afraid of seafood. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What can you say about Nobu.  Probably my favorite Japanese restaurant on the planet and the location at Hard Rock is can't miss!  Dined in last night and had the yellowtail sashimi and blackened cod! OMG!  Both are absolutely out of this world.  The decor and service is second to none!  Make a reservation but be prepared, it does get pricey!  Especially with a group or even a date!  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Nobu completely lived up to all of the hype! I had low expectations, but I left completely delighted!  I went with a large group and we all ended up being completely blown away.  I had the Shitake Salad, Blackened Cod, a variety of cut rolls, and an assortment of Mochi for dessert.  I would say that their rolls aren't anything to write home about, but all of the hot and cold dishes were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Hard Rock Nobu. The sushi chefs are on point. Fresh fish.. excellent entrees.. and usually wonderful service. I visited alone Thursday night and sat at the sushi bar. The chef was wonderful and my server was very attentive. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and therefore was happy to leave a wonderful tip. Friday night my boyfriend took me for a date night. Again we sat at the sushi bar.. same sushi chef.. different server. This chick was an idiot. We had to flag her down to get water... then again to order an entree. That was the last time we saw her the rest of the night.  We waited 30 minutes to pay when another server saw us and took care of it. If there was any of the tip that wasn't going to the sushi chef....we wouldn't have even bothered to leave one. I will still go back for sure. Just don't sit in a chick named Tueys section."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar alone and the service was impeccable and the people watching was spectacular.  One Asian Bar tender in particular was absolutely hilarious, he made the experience twice as enjoyable. I ordered Phyllo wrapped Oysters and I think my eyes rolled back in my head. Best thing I have ever eaten. Then I moved to the Yellow Tail with jalapeño and I can tell you it was far and away the best sushi I have ever eaten.  Last I had the Bento Box Dessert and it was just as excellent as my first two courses.  Nobu is an art gallery of food equivalent to the the Louvre."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Japanese fine dining, and my goodness, I will definitely be back!  We had two omakase menus, the $100 and the $150.    The waiter asked if we had any food allergies, and what our preferences were.  No food allergies, and preferably no raw tentacles.  From that moment on, it was one exciting dish after another.  The order of the dishes were cold, hot, sushi, and dessert.  We were so stuffed by the end of the night, that we couldn't even finish the dessert.  Not that the dessert wasn't good, it was just a lot of food.    The environment was cozy but chic.  The staff were friendly.  One of my favorite restaurants.  I am looking forward to Morimoto's one of these days."}
{"text":"Never fails to be one of the best sushi places around.  Always the freshest tuna and salmon.  I highly highly recommend trying the dinners too, but with such good sushi its hard to not just eat the sushi.   Great place for a big large group and fun to eat family style.   Its hard for restaurants with multiple locations to maintain the high quality and consistent good service of the original, this Nobu does it."}
{"text":"Thanks for treatin us well!   we ordered the omakase and had a wonderful experience.  being a sushi snob, I was a little hesistant at first (only because a few of other vegas spots we hit with awesome reviews werent so awesome.....)   yes, it is a bit pricey but its worth it.  i would love to give it 5 stars but one of my dish was wayyyy too salty (believe it was the sizzling beef in a hot pot). it was overpowering with soy sauce flavor -- i also only say this because the same dish my bf was served wasnt like that at all.   it was to the point where I had to drink almost a whole glass of water.    other than that, we enjoyed everything to the last bite.     the place doesnt look too japanese - a lot closer to a contemporary modern cocktail bar.  our server was attentive, people serving our food described every dish very well.    we were unfortunate to sit at the bar, but i would highly recommend trying the omakase in front of the sushi bar for that full experience!"}
{"text":"It's a gorgeous restaurant,  no doubt about it, and the food was good, but it was just so dang pricey for what we got I can't say I was a totally happy camper. After deciding to say no to the 2+ hour wait for the Bacchanal Buffet, my two friends and I went roaming about Caesar's Palace for something more suitable. We saw the inviting environs of Nobu and thought a semi-fancy dinner would be OK. We were seated right away, which was great, and looked over the menu while soaking in the cool modern artsy asian ambiance.   Good thing we weren't that hungry, otherwise the damage would've been greater. We got an order of their Yellowtail Jalapeno appetizer, two orders of the Black Cod Miso with the lettuce cup preparation for easier sharing, and Beef skewers with the Anticucho sauce. I THINK we also got the chicken skewers too but now I can't remember. At any rate, everything was delicious; I'm not saying anything was bad, but we each ended up paying almost $50 (with tax and tip) for these little nibblies. The worst was the black cod miso--you get three measly bites per order, so that was $68 for two bites/per person, wow.   Maybe I'm a Philistine when it comes to fine dining, but this stuck in my craw (har har).  My only other experience at a Nobu was at the West Hollywood one during Dine LA and that was a great deal, so now I know that this just isn't the place for me at regular prices. Live, eat, and learn."}
{"text":"So I've been here a half dozen times in the past 6 months for birthdays and business dinners. For those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best Japanese in Las Vegas. When I read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so I'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at Nobu 101:  First My DONT'S: *Do NOT come here with a low budget in mind . You will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. I've come in here and tried to do it \"cheap\" and walked away angry and disappointed. Wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly.  *Do not order off the main menu . It's boring. The food isn't that great. Steak is blah. Tempura is blah. Seriously avoid avoid avoid. *Don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!!  *Don't blindly get the chef's omakase. You'll likely end up disappointed. *Don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. Order EXOTIC cool things you can't get at home.  Now for what to do!: *Peruse the \"special\" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. Literally all my great meals here have been 100% OFF the main menu. The off the menu items are by far the best *Be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. It will really blow you away. I've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. Tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations !   Lastly, I'll leave you with my favorites. Most are off the menu. Most are seasonal. Yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly I've never been disappointed when ordering this way !   Cold: *Barracuda. OMG. Best sashimi I've had in my life. Who knew! *Tazmanian Ocean Trout. My next favorite. Basically like a mild buttery salmon.  *Japanese snapper with pineapples *Kampachi. I do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalapeño way instead of the yellow tail. Once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again !   Hot: *Black miso cod lettuce wraps... WITH FOIE GRAS. Insanely good. *The huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. Definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. Get 1 of these if you have a huge group. It's big and heavy *Quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)  Cliffsnotes: Avoid ordering from the main menu. It's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. Be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best described as fast food sushi.  Went here with a group of 6 on a guys weekend. The atmosphere is trendy, hostesses are sexy, and the room is filled with excitement when you enter. We were there to sit back, spend some of our winnings, and have some laughs.   Two of us ordered the Chefs special - which was $175 a person. We were expecting to be wowed, but quickly realized this was nothing more than a gimmick to lure unsuspecting Vegas tourists. Several of the fish pieces contained bone or were not fresh. I sent it back, but only after having to haggle with the server. While they were ultimately appologetic, it was clearly not genuine. We kind of felt that everything was prepared with haste and mass production in mind.   Also, the Chefs special comes out in several courses - ideal for a relaxing time. My only issue with this is that it took more than two hours for our meals to be completed - after our other guests had completed their meals.   Again, the atmosphere is great, but if you are longing for good quality/fresh sushi, you are better off sticking with your local place, where you can look the chef in the eye and thank him at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Wow! Incredible service and excellent food. Now that we live in Ohio, we don't get the kind of food we used to get on the coasts. Our server was Chris- I explained to him that I had some pretty bad acid reflux, and Chris took over and did an incredible job! He was able to tell us what to steer away from given my reflux. We are vegetarian and Chris took over our menu. We basically told him to surprise us. After asking us some questions, he gave us an amazing meal! My husband is going back to Vegas and specially asked for Chris again. Highly recommend Nobu!"}
{"text":"This place is so over rated an is not worth the mony I spent. I have had better quality food at buffets on the strip then here. Man the reason so many people love it here is because they are drunk and really cant tell the quality or the taste of the food. I actually ate here sober and uhh I'll stick to the NOBU in LA. Never again will you get me to pay $100.00 on some small over cooked fish and minature sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Check your bill before you leave.  We used a gift card to pay for our meal, weren't sure what the balance would be. The server, who had previously been very polite, assured us everything was taken care of, but did not bring us a receipt. We had to ask to see the bill several times. He assured us the tax, tip, etc was all taken care of. When we pushed, we found out he had been about to keep a $95 tip on a $105 tab. This was corrected before we left, but we had to wait a long time, and our server was no longer very polite. When we spoke with the manager about it later, she said the cashier had run the gift card without checking to see what the table check balance was, and apparently told the server that everything was taken care of. In this day and age, with electronic table ordering and such, I do not believe that neither the cashier nor the server would have been aware of the large discrepancy. The manager was borderline polite about the situation and refused to acknowledge that the staff had made a big mistake, which would have resulted in fraud on a senior couple. Too bad, because it ruined an otherwise very nice birthday dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been dining here for several years...time to let you know how much we love this place.  Recently stopped in on our way thru Vegas and ate at the bar for a different experience. I highly recommend Ron the bartender.  Fantastic personality, very knowledgeable and great service.  The food, as always, is tops, especially for the adventurous.  Our standards, though, are the Hamachi jalepeno and lobster in wasabi pepper sauce. I highly recommend Nobu."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Nobu three times now.  The service is amazing.  The food is delicious and delicate.  A great place for sampling and sharing food.    Their jalapeño yellow tail hamachi is fantastic and my favorite is the blackened cod.  The cucumber martini is a must.   Be prepared to spend some bucks and enjoy everything you try."}
{"text":"Nobu was amazing! Each dish was more delicious then the next one! Definitely worth every penny! We will 100% be back here very soon!"}
{"text":"AN AMAZING RESTAURANT Nobu is like a magnet to my wife and I. Definitely amazing.  From the very beginning when Chef Matsuhisa was cooking in his restaurant on La Cienega in LA to New York or Las Vegas we always come out filed with joy, content and happy. There's absolutely no criticism possible on the food and the creativity. Service was excellent but as usual the price was ridiculous! we will keep coming back as long as you keep putting this kind of quality food on our plate. All the best"}
{"text":"It's okay, but I was not too impressed.   We had the yellow tail with jalapeño and kelp salad for starter.  We got 5 paper thin slices for $30.   We also had the sea bass with miso.  That was good.  My husband got the Hamachi Kama which is the neck part of the yellow tail.  It was oven roasted.   We liked that.   It was flavorful and meaty.    Lastly, it was the lobster and shrimp.  That was the worst order.  The plate was filled with some kind of kelp and mushrooms.   The actual lobster and shrimp were very few morsels and not very dry.  I did not enjoy the entire dish.  Our bill was $200,   Not a good value considering the sea bass was the only dish made well."}
{"text":"Came here and sat at the sushi bar alone, better than not coming at all. :) I ordered the tasting menu. They gave me a choice of $125 or $175. I figured go big or go home so I got the more expensive. All of the cold courses were amazing. Just what you would expect. The standouts were the 1st course octopus and 2nd tuna tartar. After that were sashimi and sushi which included no salmon (they asked what I liked in the beginning and I said salmon) and I was suprised they didn't give me any. Then came the prepared food. Scallop really good. Wagu beef melt in your mouth but very fatty and greasy. Would not get again and the beef was why I paid the $50 more. There was a cold noodle dish as last course before dessert that was boring and forgettable. Dessert was good. I had to order sashimi salmon and pay separately which was $ and unfair in my opinion seeing as I was sitting at sushi bar and voiced that I liked salmon. If I did it again I would get the $125 menu and skip the wagu and be more vocal that I wanted salmon when they brought my sushi/sashimi course. Overall, amazing sushi. That's why you go to Nobu anyway so stick with that and you won't regret it. Spent $280 for myself!!! Very $"}
{"text":"Had a great time for start to finish. Our server was very friendly and she knew the menu pretty well. We literally ordered everything from the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi to the squid pasta and sushi rolls. I don't like squid but I really did like this dish and the mushrooms in it. We enjoyed everything and will definitely be back.   PROS: Food, service, drinks, atmosphere CONS: Pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner last night.   We sat at the sushi bar.   We enjoyed almost every dish we had.   The sushi and sashimi come in very little pieces so expect to order a lot of orders.   My wife had the Hot spicy crab which she enjoyed.    The atmosphere is nice and very relaxed.   The only downfall was the waiter was trying to sell us on different dishes.   We know our sushi and the most of the food that was on the menu so be careful.   In all its a good sushi spot."}
{"text":"This is the best Nobu.  Better than NY, better than Milan, better than Dallas, better than LA...  I know it is in the middle of the desert, but this place always delivers and still has a great vibe.  The kobe beef nigiri is amazing (even better than the off-menu kobe sliders at nobu NY)"}
{"text":"Last night i had the amazing experience of trying out a course meal at Nobu. Every dish complemented another and the explosions of flavors in my mouth was nothing more than food made to perfection. At times I wondered how do they do it?  I had 225$ course meal that although might sound expensive to some it is in my opinion the best way to truly try why Nobu restaurant stands out as unique sushi spot."}
{"text":"Dishonest Establishment. Waitresses are shady; stripper shady. Always check your bill."}
{"text":"Went with a small group in October and had one of the best meals ever. We did the house specialties where they just keep bringing several courses of the chef's choice. It was waaaay expensive, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I'm actually kind of disappointed in the Nobu here. This was the first Nobu I visited, and it definitely did not live up to its hype. We ordered the nasu miso to start and then the sashimi/nigiri dinner.  Nasu miso was pretty good, and the sashimi and nigiri were average. The mackerel was probably my favorite, followed by the shrimp and salmon, but honestly, all I could think about was how we could have gotten this at a lower-end restaurant, and it would have all been the same.  We decided to order one more thing to see if Nobu could redeem itself, so we got a simple spicy scallop roll. BINGO! It was great. The nori was delicious, and so was the spicy scallop. Together, it was perfect.   I wish we had ordered more rolls, but we were way too stuffed. I'll definitely come back to Nobu, but I recommend getting their rolls rather than sashimi/nigiri."}
{"text":"UH-MAZING!  I made the reservation before arriving to ensure a table and time. I am looking at the menu and trying to make sense of it, and the waiter walks up, \"We want to ensure your experience at Nobu is a food adventure and we are able to create a custom menu for you if you give me a price point\".... *speechless* and then gave him a number, ordered my Yamazaki (Japanese whiskey) cocktail and sat back.  The FOOD ADVENTURE was absolutely delicious.  I cannot even name everything because I am pretty sure they were not all on the menu, but i took some pictures of stuff.  Some of the stuff was:  +Tofu and tuna tartare on a crisp cracker +Hearts of palm with jalapeno soy and mirin sauce +Palate cleaner which was a spoon with a grapefruit granita, lemon sorbet and fresh blueberry +Hot tofu in a spicy oil and asian broccoli +Veggie sushi and California rolls  Then they were cool enough to bring me a chocolate molten cake with ice cream and a sweet message =)  It was amazing (Kanye West song voice)  If you have some extra change to drop and want an amazing meal, then drop in or make a reservation.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Very attentive.  But I went for the sushi.  The chef was friendly and tried hard.  But he wasn't totally responsible for the quality of the fish. I had a moderately sized dinner,  $75 including tip, and, seriously,  I have had far better sushi in Little Tokyo for half the price.   The shoyu was unbelievably overpowering. The red snapper was not the highest quality,  served with no garnish or little brush of sauce, and almost tasteless. Unfortunate, as this is a favorite fish of mine.    The sweet shrimp was just passable, but whatever they fried the head in was not.  What passed for a tempura batter was heavy and salty.  When dipped into the extremely salty shoyu you got a saline bomb.   Their signature yellowtail and jalapeño was Ok, but certainly nothing you'd go out of your way to return for.  They do have an extensive sake and Japanese whisky menu,  and a couple of Japanese beers on draft.   So,  go for the beer and edamame. Skip the radically overpriced sushi. If you need to spend some serious coin, scrape together $600 and go to Masa.."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Server was very polite and recommend delicious entrees. Everything served was amazing!!! Will definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This place does offer good sushi and prefixed menu, but it is definitly way over rated. For the price they are asking, I would expect the fish to taste as good as the fishes in Tsukiji Fish Market, in Tokyo."}
{"text":"What can you say about Nobu at Ceasers Palace other than this place is incredible!  AN and I were in Vegas on business and we have a little tradition, we always have pizza and sushi where ever we go! So while looking for the best sushi in Vegas I kept hearing NOBU!  We made reservations for 8:00pm and our driver dropped us right at the door at Ceasers, when we walked into Nobu it looked amazing, you could see the sushi bar with the sushi chefs working, the ambiance just felt trendy and modern with an upbeat energy.  We were quickly seated and our hostess looked at me as I sat down, she could tell right away I was not happy with our table, she asked if everything was ok, it was not, and I asked if we could have another table, and I  told her where we would like to sit, she informed me it would be another 15 minutes but quickly informed us she would escort us to the bar and make sure we were taken care of and get us the table I wanted.  9 minutes later the hostess was back to the bar with a waiter to bring our drinks from the bar to our table and our hostess escorted us right to the table I requested.  Our waiter promptly arrived taking our drink order of a bottle of water chilled and another glass of wine for AN.  He went over the whole menu answering all our questions and asking us what interested us and what stuck out, AN and I told our waiter what we were interested in from the menu and he asked if he could make some suggestions one of which being Omakase where you allow the chefs to custom create a full NOBU experience!  AN and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a word we both knew we were going with that amazing experience!  When the first plate came out of yellowtail sushi with caviar and 14 karat gold shavings I knew we made the right choice, and plate after plate of the most amazing food experiences we've had in a long time came out, sushi and Wagyu beef flambéed table side for 37 seconds.  It was an amazing experience!  The waiter does ask you a few questions before hand if you go with Omakase because our meal for the two of us before tip was over $800.00 but that's part of the questions to inform you of what the cost is.  This evening was amazing from the food experience to our amazing waiter, the ambiance was perfect and Nobu at Ceasers Palace Las Vegas is another favorite, we will come here again and I highly recommend Nobu!"}
{"text":"Several different Nobu locations worldwide and the US. This Nobu is located inside Hard Rock Hotel - the first one in Vegas (and the better one). I had one of my birthday celebrations here.  We got yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, big eye tuna tataki with ponzu, chocolate banana martini, lychee martini, sashimi salad, shrimp with spicy garlic sauce, tenderloin of beef toban yaki, Nobu's house special, salmon skin handroll, kulfi and my birthday \"bento box\".  Sashimi and Sashimi Salad: The fish here is generously cut.  They're fresh and the sauces they come with accent the fish. 5/5  Shrimp with Spicy Garlic Sauce: If you like garlic and a little bit of spiciness - this is the dish for you.  The garlic sauce was amazing. The dish comes with some mushrooms. 5/5  Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki: Came in a sizzling plate. A piece of very tender and juicy steak with enoki mushrooms and asparagus. Simple but delightful dish. 5/5  Nobu's House Special: Salmon, tuna, hamachi, avocado and crab meat  wrapped in nori and daikon, sprinkled with masago. Each of the 6 pieces are not-so-bite-sized. 4/5  Salmon Skin Handroll: Salmon skin with just a very thin layer of salmon meat making each piece so crispy and delicious. That's all that matters in a salmon skin handroll. 5/5  Kulfi: Chocolate pistachio frozen custard, Nobu cabernet cherries, candied pistachios, chocolate feulletine.  Great textures: crispy and creamy. 5/5  Bento Box: Flourless chocolate cake, white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea ice cream. I'm not sure why it's called a bento box since it definitely doesn't come in one. It was free and yummy. 4/5"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant experience! Knowledgable service at the bar by Toshihiro. He loves the restaurant and takes time to explain and recommend the dishes. Cool view of 7 sushi chefs from the bar. Following Toshihiro's direction I ordered the salmon nw style sashimi and added edamame as a pre show appetizer plus Sapporo- on tap. The flavor of the thinly sliced salmon was unforgettable. I returned after the show and followed Toshihoro's direction again--tasmanian trout. Superb. The person sitting next to me wolfed down the cod, raving about it. That will be next time. Thank you for this special meal. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"I prefer eating sushi in a location where I can hear myself think, actually see my food, and talk to my fellow dining companions without having to yell.  Nobu doesn't allow for any of that, it is like eating at a disco.  That said, the food is INCREDIBLE, even though you miss out on the presentation since the lights are so low.  The black cod soaked in miso was unbelievablly buttery tasting...I also had some of their meat skewers which were excellent as well."}
{"text":"Yum!!! My friend and I shared the Black Cod Miso and the Shrimp and Lobster with spicy lemon. Both of these dishes were amazing but I especially loved the lemon sauce from the shrimp and lobster dish. So delicious! The cod was of course tender, and melted in your mouth with amazing flavors, but the lemon sauce stole the show!! For dessert we shared the bento box which included a delicious decadent chocolate lava type cake and home made green tea ice cream. We also shared a banana dessert that was very good. Warm bananas in a spring roll with pralines and praline ice cream. I loved the way the restaurant was decorated, it reminded me of a restaurant in NY. Which makes me very excited thinking about what the hotel rooms will look like! This was a great experience all around. Amazing food, friendly and knowledgeable staff and beautiful atmosphere made my visit to Nobu the highlight of my vegas trip this past weekend!"}
{"text":"Full of disappointment.   This is an overpriced, low-quality, fancy Panda Express (sorry Panda no offense) restaurant and I have dined at plenty of good restaurants in LV, including Gordon Ramsey Steak, Bazaar Meat, Cut, Fleur, Bouchon, etc.  We came to Nobu with high expectations and ordered quite a few items between me and my friend who came from overseas to visit.  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno -- Very sour and sweet, and the ponzu sauce completely overpowered the yellowtail.  Spicy Miso Chips with Scallops -- ok.  Kumamoto Oyster with Nobu Sauce -- ponzu sauce again.... really?   Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy -- tasted like bar food, nothing special, yeah, the sauce was sweet.  Black Cod Miso -- another sweet dish, omg.  Uni sushi -- not fresh, the uni tasted blend.  Yellowtail belly sushi -- ok.  Toro handroll & Spicy yellowtail handroll -- i found tendon inside my toro handroll, I ordered a toro handroll not a \"leftover fish handroll\"  Our waiter was attentive and nice initially.  However when we expressed our disappointment because all the dishes were sweet and soaked into ponzu sauce, he immediately changed his attitude 180 degrees.  He made us feel like it was our fault in ordering the wrong items!  In stead of turning our disappointment into a memorable experience, the waiter said, \" you should tell me you guys prefer the savory dishes, not sweet dishes.,\" Well, I'm sorry, Mr Waiter, we chose the dishes from the main menu, not the dessert menu. We simply didn't expect most of the dishes to be on the sweet side.   How does one come to expect miso, nobu sauce, cream spicy sauce to be all made out of the same ponzu sauce? Is this the Nobu experience??!?!?!  Dinner at Nobu was my suggestion for my dear friend from afar and i was ashamed of my poor choice."}
{"text":"We have eaten at several Nobu resaurants before, including this one in Las Vegas. This was one of the most unpleasant meals I have ever had. It began with the waiter deciding we would all have Omakase and didn't give us menus. We were seated at the worst table right outside the kitchen in full view of a screaming table of middle aged men who thought they were in Hangover 3. The food was at best, mediocre and the fish was nothing special...my local sushi joints in Brooklyn serve far fresher fare. The cod was not bad (I've had it before in NYC) but not up to par. The meal was paced absurdly, the cod came before appetizers. The waiter's explanation? There are several kitchens. I will never set foot in this place again. Give me Sasabune or Yasuda any day."}
{"text":"They cater to your taste! The first time I did the preset menu, vegetarian and non-veg. It was a fun experience. I wish it was pho-pa to use soy sauce and ginger with chef selected items - some people just grew up eating sushi wrong and want it. Going forward I know what I like and they will do whatever you want so we will be ordering non-preset menu items. A little pricy, but you will be happy (especially if you are vegetarian!)"}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I came here for the Dessert Tasting Platter.   I saw the dessert list and died a little at the unique, creative and hitherto unknown creations being offered. So did my boyfriend. We decided we had to make it to Nobu even if the apocalypse happened and giant flesh-eating gargoyles descended from the sky.  I did not plan to have a full meal at all but wouldn't you know it, I did. Ahhh, I love when upscale Japanese restaurants live up to the hype.  Yellowtail with jalapeño: Tender slices of my fish soulmate in an amazing soy yuzu sauce with just a little kick. Most perfect dish ever.  Beef tenderloin tabu yaki: Not quite as tender as kobe (is anything?) but delicious nonetheless.  Spicy scallop roll: Fresh and tasty. The boyfriend was blown away by it, I thought it was good but otherwise unremarkable. I think raw scallop might be his yellowtail, though.  Black cod with miso: Their signature dish. It's really hard to find fault with it. Tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish in a sweet, light sauce. It should be heavy, but it's not. That's the miracle of Japanese cooking.  Spicy seafood soup: My favorite kind of food--soupy, spicy, seafoody. Oh, and as an added bonus, loaded with more varieties of mushroom than a drug farmer. I have seen heaven and it's inside this bowl. Get it!  Now on to the Nobu Dessert Platter:  Bento Box: Flourless chocolate cake with a white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea ice cream. Like a Japanese molten cake. Did I mention that molten cake is like edible carnal sex? Well, it is. So get this. Just don't go all Matrix Reloaded in the restaurant.  Trio of mochi: Lessee, we got pumpkin spice, strawberry, and some flavor not known to man, stuffed with ice-cream and accompanied by sour Japanese mountain peaches. Mmm...  Bananas in phyllo dough with tropical glaze: Original creation not on the regular menu (haha!). It's crispy, fried bananas. Need I say more?  Haromajis in cinnamon and sugar and center is sweet potato purée: I totally didn't spell that right and since it's another original creation, I have no menu to look at. Already tried googling and found nothing. Anyway, this was incredible. I hate sweet potato and I thought this was da bomb. Yeah, I'm channeling 2001 lingo.  Eat here."}
{"text":"Everything was way overpriced and overrated!  I ordered two orders of Uni Sushi and it costed me $40! Not to mention they weren't too fresh neither. Also tried their Hamachi Kama and it was under cooked, nasty! The special white fish sashimi was probably the best, but too much oil and sauce.  Waiter service was good, nice and quick so two stars go here.  The way they manage takeout order was kind of strange; I can't order from front desk even they had like 3 people doing nothing (just chatting with each others). I had to go over to the bar area and ordered from the bar tender - odd.  Anyway, not coming back."}
{"text":"The food at Nobu is fantastic! I especially enjoy the Black Mi so Cod and the Yellow Fin Tuna.  I prefer the cooked dishes to the sushi.  If you are eating your last meal this would be one great place to visit.  The decor and setting set the perfect ambiance, perfect for a date or networking.  Be prepared to spend some moo la, your mouth will thank you, your wallet will slap you.  It is an experience and well worth the money."}
{"text":"Nobu is amazing.  My first time trying the food, and a 5 star experience all around.  We took advantage of Nobu's Room Service because we were staying at the Nobu Hotel (newly opened boutique 180-room hotel at Caesars Palace).   Please expect a $5 room charge as well as included gratuity in your order.  Black Miso Cod - So flaky, perfectly sweet, and seasoned beautifully.  Every bite was consistent and no portions were over-cooked in the slightest  Nobu Fries - A great add-on appetizer to your meal, consisting of traditional steak cut fries along with sweet potato fries.  Comes with two dipping sauces which compliment the seasoning perfectly  New Men Ramen - A pork flavored broth with succulent, tender char siu pieces, the only downside to this dish was the noodles were slightly over-cooked.  I prefer a firmer noodle, which Daikokuya nails anyday  Yes, a very expensive price tag accompanies your dining experience (or in our case, our room service experience!) but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"My cousin took me out to Nobu for my birthday! I have been to the Nobu back in Honolulu and I have to say that this Nobu is way better than the one in Honolulu. The portions are much bigger here.   We got the black cod saikyo miso, salmon spinach, otoro handroll, oyster shots, otoro, signature hamachi kama with jalapeño. And to kick it off, we ended it with a Nobu shaved ice. Our waiter also gave us a complimentary birthday brownie w/ a candle and he also compted the Nobu Shaved Ice. By far, the best dessert I had at any restaurant was the Nobu Shaved ice. Definitely recommend. It's a watermelon type of dessert with a hint of honey dew and with that, you get a cereal like topping you can add!   Nobu will always be my favorite upscale Asian fusion restaurant. It's a dress casual restaurant scene. Lighting is somewhat dim so if you do plan on taking pictures of your food, you might have to brighten it up for editing before posting it to social media."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here the night before the big party, and very glad I did so.  The place is pretty hip, not too loud, nor too expensive.  We were a party of 5 strapping fellas and seated next to 36 mafia and some ladies.  If you know me you'd imediately think I would try to hit on their women, but it was before I was drinking so don't get too excited!  Ok ok, well it can be expensive, but not as much as I was expecting.  The sushi was fantastic and probably the freshest I've had.  Get the blue fin, its worth it at $40 for the sashimi!  At least to me it was.  Your served chopsticks on a stone... maybe I'm uneducated but that seemed a little weird!  All in all the staff was super friendly, helpful, and very fast.  I'd definately recommend checking it out if your a party or a couple, and especially if your staying in the Hard Rock!"}
{"text":"Not worth your time or money, unless paying $8 for the tiniest single piece of fish is your thing. Payed $60 between me and my girlfriend and we still had to go to McDonald's across the street to get some actual sustenance. Plus the service is slow and not very helpful at explaining the menu. The sushi is the quality of any gas station meal. I can get better sushi plus all you can eat and pay less then half what I spent here in my home town. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"I stomach this place.  That's like saying, I heart it but with my stomach.  Anyway everything we had was SO SO SO good.  There were 8 of us and it was such a treat.  I loooooved it.  Except our waiter wasn't the brightest...apparently he can't do math very well...but aside from that, things were fantastic."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good. Had a ton of stuff here and the miso cod was easily the most memorable. Already looking forward to hitting up Nobu in another city.  One of the best Japanese experiences I've had in a while."}
{"text":"The level of privileged white guilt that comes with comparing Nobu unfavorably to Uchi and Uchiko in Austin is almost as disappointing as the actual meal."}
{"text":"You don't come to Nobu to just get a roll. That's what a sushi bar is for. You come to Nobu to enjoy a Japanese/Peruvian fusion of food that tastes delicious every single bite.  It's expensive, as it should be. It's fine dining. The decor, the service, the food.... amazing!!!!!   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our group of 11 dined here for dinner as part of my cousin's bachelorette weekend.  I was hesitant at first because my experience at their SD location was just OK.  Here, I was pleasantly surprised. From start to finish the food was delicious! We opted for the omakase ($125 pp) and it did not disappoint. My favorites were the:  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - light and acidic, with a little kick Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna - I could have literally eaten a bowl of this! The rice was perfectly bite sized and crispy without being burnt and the tuna was seasoned well. Chilean Sea Bass with Dry Miso - moist, tender & not overpowered by the miso Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy - popped those crunchy, sauce laden babies in my mouth like candy!  Service was on point and we all had a great time! Needless to say, this was definitely a memorable experience for me :-)"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place sucks.  NOBU should stand for NO BUeno! Their sushi selection is mediocre at best.  They serve my IPA in a fuckin wine glass and the lobster tacos, which were $20, looked like 2 pizza rolls.  F this place!"}
{"text":"During the last night of my trip to Vegas this year my friend and I decided to celebrate at Nobu in Caesar's Palace and it was a great decision.  We both ordered the Omakase (a meal consisting of dishes selected by the chef).  My friend had the Chef's Daily Creations while I had the Nobu Signature.  Both orders came out in tapas style dishes and contained appetizers, salads, soups, entrees (beef and fish), and desserts.  My favorite dish was the Black Cod Miso.  The fish was tender and the sauce was sweet and slightly salty and the skin was tasty too!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas hands down. The service is very attentive and they make sure your table is cleab at all times. One thing that is very unique about this place is you have plenty of options to how you would like to order. From how much you would like to spend, to family style or personal. One of my favorite restaurant ."}
{"text":"The customer service here is superb. I needed to push my reservation later due to traffic and they were very accommodating.   We got the Nobu Signature Omakase, please note that the whole course would take around 2 hours or more. We were short on time, but they were also able to help us customize our meal to fit our time limit which I really appreciated! The fish was fresh and the quality was unbeatable. The Miso Marinated Black Cod was my favorite, it wasn't too sweet or salty, and the fish was cooked to perfection! The other highlight of the meal was the lobsters, the meat was fresh and seasoned so well.   Besides what they have on the menu, you can also customize your meal according to your preference, budget and time. All the servers here were so helpful and friendly!  I definitely need to come back to try more things!"}
{"text":"Love it! Splurge on the 7 course tasting menu. I'm a vegetarian, and it was just as delicious! I have never tasted a better meal. Treat Yourself!!!!  The only thing I did not care for was the dessert course. I think it was mochi. The sorbet on the inside was delicious, but the mochi was tasteless: clever, but the glutinous \"skin\" was not needed. It tasted odd and gummy. My husband liked it though!"}
{"text":"Love inspired sushi? Then Nobu is for you!   We purchased the groupon, 5 courses, and it was the best decision we made in Vegas. The meal is perfect for 2.  If you don't want the groupon, get the cod. Who knew cod could be so delicious? Even none fish lovers would love this cod  It's a hustle and bustle place, I couldn't tell you who our actually waiter was  but they make sure the courses keep moving."}
{"text":"I simply love this place, the staff is fun and the food is amazing!! I have to tell you this would be on a short list of one of my last meals requested.   #TrueLove"}
{"text":"To start off, Nobu has, hands down, one of the best restaurant decor & ambiance. It's super chill & laid back. We were seated quite quickly (5-10 min wait with a reservation) at a low, round couch like table which was extremely comfortable and we also had a great view of the whole restaurant.  Our waitress was patient and very helpful in explaining the menu and also recommending Nobu's most famous & popular dishes (Sometimes her lip smacking got the best of me...but that can be overlooked). What we ordered: Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño (4 stars): I think this dish was well plated, really simple and delicate. The jalapeno complimented the flavors of the yellowtail well, a good hot substitute for wasabi. I would never think to pair the two, but the flavors really merged well. Nobu Sashimi Tacos (4 stars): We ordered 4 tuna, 2 salmon, and 2 lobster. I think all were really  tasty. The shrimp cracker like shell made each bite crunchy and delicious! I recommend the tuna and lobster. Broiled Alaskan Black Cod with Miso (3 stars): I'm not going to lie...I was underwhelmed. Yes, the texture of the fish is melt-in-your-mouth soft and flaky but the flavors didn't wow me. Tasted awfully similar to the miso my mother made when I was growing up. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary considering Nobu is \"Japanese with Peruvian flair.\" Not sure I tasted the flair part at all in this dish.  Overall, I think Nobu met my expectations. The decor bumps it to 4 stars otherwise I'd give the food 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"So first thing is a reservation for 9 people. Greeted by a tall pretty asian looking female host and seated near the back of the restaurant at a large round table. We order drinks and the host comes up and says she would like to upgrade us to a better table. She was very excited to upgrade us and I thought better is always better. Wrong!!! We were then seated at a small table near the entrance. I looked at the hostess across the room and she was laughing. Apparently someone else wanted our table. I should have walked out right there. It was embarrassing and my party was very humiliated.  I called the manager over and he of course apologized and comped edamame. $8.00 worth of free beans was not nearly going to make up for this humiliating experience. They later moved us to a quiet table in the back. Then the \"tasting\" menu was sold to us at a rate of $100 per plate. It wasn't worth $10.00 per plate I've had better sushi from a grocery store. I actually spit out two spoiled pieces of fish.The food made 6 people in our party deathly ill. Stay away. I hope that host gets fired. Who does that? She is a liar!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here on Feb 13 and everything was absolutely delicious! Our waiter was Marcus and he was excellent.  They prepared a variety of dishes tailored to our tastes and they were fantastic.  The drinks were incredible too.  I had a cucumber martini and also some other martini with passion fruit. Would completely recommend again. Even though the food is pricey, the serve much finer food that you get at a typical high-rated sushi place.  Will go there again."}
{"text":"Very pricey and tiny servings. Delicious, but delicate and not filling. The waiter was excellent, and everything tasted nice, but a 260 dollar dinner for three had better do more than elicit \"nice\" remarks all around."}
{"text":"I've had dinner at nobu over the decades from the old location in Malibu to the new one by the water - over in West Hollywood at the old L'Orangerie La Cienega location, London, etc. etc. etc. I am a fan of Nobu and I have eaten at matsuhisa for decades.  The service at this location was shocking. We were treated rudely. We waited and waited for our waiter.  This location obviously is very touristy but that doesn't mean you can charge the earth serve up second rate Nobu quality food and then be treated like a criminal for saying something about it. We honestly felt ripped off and that is no way a customer should feel in a restaurant they know so well. The Famous yellowtail and jalapeño at $32 a pop was close to the original recipe but was not right on the mark as I believe it should be considering it is such a trademark dish. THIS was the only dish close to the mark. The sushi was close but not up to par the rest was a miserable miserable effort. The gentleman serving up the miso soup in plastic cups trying to explain how to drink or I should say eat the soup was absurd. Obviously sushi 101 here at the lackluster location at Caesars Palace.  Despite the fact that you have tourist customers unaware of the legacy of this cuisine does not mean that you can treat them like cattle and serve up half ass nonchalant non-caring attempts with severity of attitude to the extent of personal insult.  At these prices we customers honestly deserve better than that - we entered the establishment in a jovial mood and left completely stunned and angry. The tables on both sides of us who we struck up conversation with both agreed that what they were experiencing was totally unacceptable. As a matter-of-fact the table to our right we made friends with left their meal early to go eat somewhere else! It's not very often that I feel as though a meal should have been comped in other words we shouldn't have had to pay however... I will warn people not to go to this location and if they do they should expect to be ripped off. The waiter we had was probably the worst I have ever had in my life which says a lot considering I've been all over the world and have eaten at restaurants in all corners of this globe! You should never and I repeat you should never get into a verbal conflict with the customer / server especially one that felt as though it could become physical at any moment. UNACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"A big disappointment: Every dish taste the same, salty and soy sauce flavored, can't even taste which fish is which...  Price: $790 dinner excluding tips for 2 Service is pretty good.   We had a similar dinner at Sen of Japan, very happy with quality of food, only $220 including tips for 2.  Service is super nice.   Yes we are huge fan of raw fish, black cod, oysters and Uni, and shoots, etc..."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name.   The waiters rush their diners to leave and expect tip asap"}
{"text":"I am not impressed at all with their 5 course tasting meal ($99- Groupon). The fish was dry and warm. The rice was hard and had too much vinegar. The California roll was pre made and they used imitation crab in the roll. The selection of sushis given were very low grade -maguro, white fish and salmon. We were so hungry that we ordered eight more pieces of individual sushis. Our meal was supposed to be paid for.... but because we ordered more sushis- our bill was $75 ( in addition to the $99 that we paid already)."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a SUSHI lover and this place...honestly took my breath away. I was here during CES 2009 for work and my manager and I got invited to dinner with one of our partners at this restaurant. This place was PACKED when we showed up. The sake was amazing, even though I couldn't take much of it down since I had alcohol poisoning that morning ;P, yeah I know...I party hard even when I'm at work. But yes, the Cod was intensely amazing and the miso soup was quite awesome as well...definitely gonna hit this place up again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I don't even like sushi but this is on another level. As the four dollar signs indicate it's pricey."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas and I've tried tons! The food is outstanding! Do not leave without trying the black cod - it melts in your mouth. And definitely order the rock shrimp tempura as an appetizer. You will not be sorry! Those two are staples. Their sushi is also fantastic! Nobu in any city never fails to impress."}
{"text":"Nobu, continues to exceed my expectation and raises the bar for the rest of the restaurants to follow suit. Incredible dishes which I continue to think about a week later. Billy, was amazing, knowledgable, friendly and created a wonderful dinner experience. Thank you to everyone at Nobu."}
{"text":"Impeccable comes to mind when I look back at dinner last night. Just wow!  We started with Shishito peppers and an amazing tuna sashimi salad, moved on to a squid and vegetable dish/casserole that was out of this world followed by miso blackened cod that was absolutely mouth watering.  Then came some of the best sushi! Yellowtail with scallion roll, yellowtail with jalapeño roll, and shrimp tempura roll. The wine was a lovely Napa Chardonnay.  The ambiance of this restaurant is calming and the service is excellent!  Japanese restaurants are plentiful in this town so an outstanding stand out restaurant in this category means a lot: this restaurant is outstanding and stands on its own! The prices are very reasonable. Not at all overpriced. Highly recommended. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"$36 Black Cod Miso $20 House Special Roll $36 Wagyu Toban-Style $10 Selection of 3 ice creams $12 Yellowtail Jalapeno Roll  I would try this place again to see if their other famous choices lived up to the hype, because honestly, the Black Cod Miso was not to my taste. I could tell the fish was very well-cooked, the way the flesh slid perfectly along its grain (pardon any incorrect nouns), but whatever umami moment I was supposed to be having, I was not. The same happened with the wagyu-beef. The flavor was very similar to an iron-plate steak I had before, an off-shoot of gravy with a stronger taste of onion. Anyways, didn't like it. What I ended up eating was the house special roll. It was like a rainbow roll, but with the assortment of fishes on the inside and the outside wrapped in a crunchy radish paper. Pretty good, but if I was going to get $20 sushi, I would rather go to Maestro's. Their rolls are more than good, they're awesome.   The best thing I had there was the ice cream: hojicha, matcha, and avocado. They had some weirder flavors like bubble gum, banana, and peach cobbler. The ice cream was smooth, silky, and creamy. Plus, the tea-flavored ice creams were spot on.   Service ====== A little on the slow side. We had to request extra wasabi three times before it got delivered. Same with asking for the menu to add on items. It took a good ten minutes, and I was severely tempted to go grab a menu myself, seeing as how I knew exactly where it was and it was within eyesight to mock me.   Decor ====== Dark, fun, possibly romantic. They also have a lot of fun with strange lamp-like shapes for the alcoves and the lamps are a little like jellyfish pods. Interesting, with a nod to Asian influence."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review as George Lipson, General Manager has redeemed our faith in Nobu! George called me and apologized for the experience. He acknowledged that the behavior of the Assistant Manager was not up to Nobu standards and promised to provide further coaching in this area. His response was spot on and indicative of a top rated restaurant. Thank you George. We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this restaurant. The servers are well equipped to help you with your selections.  I was not familiar with Japanese cocktails and they did a great job steering to something I liked. Total forgot the name of the first but the second one I had \"sidecar\" was my favorite. Also, if nothing else, you must try the black cod miso. It has to be the best tasting fish I've ever had.  It was one of those entrees that leaving you yearning for more, and so of course we got more. Money well spent.  I also had the wagyu gyoza, which wasn't bad but after the black cod was just, ehh.  I will return to this place just for another taste of that fish."}
{"text":"I've been to this Nobu Sushi in the past and it was good enough to come back for a second time. This review is strictly because of our horrible waiter (wish I had his name). He came across as being very impatient because it was some of the girls first time being there. It was a group of 8 girls and I would suppose with any large group you would need to be a little more patient. As he walked by to get everyone's orders of food, he would roll his eyes and look the other way because you can tell he was annoyed that the individual wasn't ready at that exact moment to order their food.  If management needs to know who this individual waiter was, we had reservations on 08/16/15 at 9:30 pm under Polis group. Management needs to really get rid of this guy because what a shame to the restaurant's name.  On top of this horrible service everyone at the table received their dinner and ate their dinner because it came out way before mine. My steak dinner did not come out until everyone was done eating and still waiting for me to receive my dinner.   I will never come back to this service ever again."}
{"text":"Super tasty, amazing sushi. Very tender and delish meat. Very fresh. Drinks were great and the dessert was amazing. My second trip to Nobu, first was in NY."}
{"text":"So many other reviews here provide great summaries of the food and the dining experience so I won't go into much detail other than to say I think this place clearly merits 5 stars both on the service and the food.  I strongly recommend going the \"Omakase\" route where you give the server a general sense of what you like, and a target price point per person for the meal and let him or her select the courses for you.  I've done that here twice before and both times the experience was remarkable and the selections much better than anything I could have come up with on my own.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had a beautiful time and tasty Omakase for my birthday dinner at this elegant restaurant attached to our hotel of the same name. I loved the hotel concept as I've always loved Nobu.   Our waitress was superb, helpful and just fun. And we were seated just beyond the kitchen away from the stand alone tables in our own booth and simply had a fantastic experience.   And considering the freshness of the sushi plus the inventiveness and beauty of each dish, the Nobu signature Omakase at $150 pp was perfect. Along with a large pot of a crisp dry sake, it made for a wonderful night.   Highly recommend staying at the hotel and dining at Nobu (the room service from this place alone is well worth it)."}
{"text":"We ate in the lounge portion of this restaurant and it worked out perfectly. We had just watched Zarkana at the Aria and didn't want a giant meal, so Nobu's small plates/tapas style dishes hit the spot. The bbq pork belly skewers and the rock shrimp tempura were the highlights of the meal for me. The black cod was just okay. For me, this place is more of a snacks and drinks vs. a full on heavy dinner, but there's no shame in that. We all thoroughly enjoyed the food and the extensive cold Sake list."}
{"text":"I've been to 5 or so different Nobu restaurants (Vegas, LA, NY), and this one was definitely the worst. I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the food. Everything else was good (atmosphere, waiters, etc.), but the food just lacked taste. Save yourself and go to that sushi place in the Wynn."}
{"text":"Over hyped and not worth the price.  Having been to the Nobu in Palo Alto and having had an overall positive experience, I wanted to check this Nobu out. Nothing was terrible, but not everything was up to the Nobu standard I expected.  The good: cucumber martini was easily one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Their creative mixing of lychee with cucumber really set this drink apart. Yuzu yellowtail appetizer was also very good and fresh, and their handroll (yellowtail with green onion) and house special cut roll were not only delicious, but reasonably good values for the price. Dessert (fried banana with passion fruit reduction and mango shichimi ice cream) was overpriced but a very creative and delicious dessert.  The bad: lobster with shrimp entree turned out to be stir fried mushrooms with just a tiny bit of actual seafood. That in itself wouldn't have been awful, but the sauce didn't actually even taste great: too tart without much other flavor. Lobster tacos were also a huge miss: the lobster had been fragmented and stir fried with so many other remnants that I couldn't even tell I was eating lobster. It was also ridiculous that I paid $9 for a \"taco,\" which was basically a tiny single bite sized morsel of mystery meat with a wonton skin shell.  I expect and am prepared to hemorrhage money when I go to Nobu, but I also expect a phenomenal dining experience in exchange. This was overall acceptable but far from phenomenal, and definitely not worth it for me to come back and drop over $100 per person on a merely acceptable experience."}
{"text":"In a word, this restaurant is simply fabulous. I've not been to other Nobu restaurants, but I can't imagine them being chicer than this. Multicultural waiters barking out orders in Japanese to the swift and focused sushi chefs, ultra trendy and modern decor, gorgeous breezy open space... And creative, masterfully prepared food to boot.  Not quite five stars since Nobu is actually no place for the sushi purist - I've had FAR better sake belly (my all time hands down favorite cut of fish), let alone regular sake, elsewhere - and service certainly could've been more attentive. Also I should state the obvious that you better be prepared to drop serious cash on your meal since dishes aren't served with garnishes or accompaniments (unless you don't mind eating pure protein). That said, my black cod miso was phenomenal and easily one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had (only behind the halibut at 3 Michelin star le Bernadin in NYC). The more-sweet-than-savory miso glaze enveloped the outer flesh of the fish in a perfectly caramelized crust, and yet somehow the meat was barely cooked to achieve an unbelievably juicy tenderness. It was actually so moist that the layers of flaky flesh simply slid off of one another and into puddles of juice upon the gentlest prod of the fork and dissolved onto the tongue. Not to mention the serving size was surprisingly HUGE - easily 6+ ounces.  Would def return with a big group and go all out. Def not the place to go if you're on a conservative work budget (like me)."}
{"text":"Most impressive from food to ambiance to service, nobu has it all. If you're going to pay top dollar for a dining experience nobu should be on your short list of places to visit. We let them make us a menu and I truly enjoyed every thing that was brought before us, including a few dishes that were the best I've ever had. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really am not fond of writing reviews like this. However, last night's Anniversary Omakase $225 per person was mediocre and not only that - I found a WORM in my blue fin tuna. And they try to say it's a piece of lime??? Please look at my photos and tell me that's a piece of \"lime.\" I've eaten my fair amount of sushi, and I know when it's a worm. I didn't bother to argue or make things difficult, but after that...I really wasn't happy with how they tried to play it off and hide it.  For a meal that was about $665 with tip - it is a slap to the face. :("}
{"text":"Shashito peppers, Black Cod with miso, fried crab legs, and Sake--makes this girl very happy!  Yummie!  Ubber expensive, great service, and super good!"}
{"text":"Living in Seattle, WA I was very skeptical that the prices I'd heard about would be worth it. I figured it was all hype. I was pleasantly surprised when our group decided to let the chef decide what we'd have based on preferences and budget. The sushi was amazing and I was really glad we let go of the wheel and let the restaurant do the steering."}
{"text":"I don't like huge crowds unless I'm at a concert, and I don't like lots of loud noise unless I'm at a concert, and I don't like teaming hordes of sweaty, pushy, annoying fat slobs, even if I am at a concert.    So I don't really get to Vegas much.    But one thing that is really cool about Vegas is that it has become ground zero for the biggest collection of some of the most amazing restaurants in - dare I say - the world.    Just about every great chef/restaurateur in the US and some from elsewhere have set up shop in Las Vegas.  It is too cool, and is what is going to bring me back to Vegas before too long.    Which brings me to Nobu, the worldwide chain of really great Japanese restaurants.    It was way too loud and way too crowded, but I had some of the most amazing food there Friday night.  I am still dreaming about the incredible mushroom salad, with like 10 different kinds of mushrooms, and the \"live\" scallops, the miso cod and the excellent spicy tempura rock shrimp.    And the Chablis we ordered - I wish I could remember the name - was outstanding.    Truly a great meal, with some great company.   I could easily see coming back here, but with so many other great places to try in Vegas, I probably won't for quite a while."}
{"text":"Of course I had to give it 5 stars, I would give it 10 stars if possible!! This was, quite simply, the BEST MEAL of my life! For Valentine's Day we were deciding between Craftsteak at MGM or Nobu. We called both locations and both said the earliest open spot for us would be 10:30 pm. I asked both places to take my number down in case of cancellations, and Nobu did- for 8:30. Yes, it was ultra modern, and a bit too dimly lit, and we WERE sitting behind an obnoxiously loud newlewed couple (she was still in her white wedding dress, spilling drinks, and talking loudly to her neighbors!) there were no restrooms (had to leave the restaurant) but all in all- this was a five star meal (in blinging bright Vegas styled neon lights-flashing!!) if there ever was one. And I am changed, as a result of this.  We decided to throw caution (and ugly thoughts of the recession) out the window and opted for the 150/head omakase. I kid you not, better, smoother, fresher, more buttery, more beautifully presented than I've had in Japan! Now, I don't remember all the individual dishes but I recalled that we were transformed into two little kids in a candy store, sitting there smiling in awe at what just went into our mouths and rubbing our hands together in astonished anticipation of just WHAT could top what we had just tasted? On and on... the dishes came. Beautiful and perfect, each shining in it's own vibrant manner, beautifully crafted and thought-provoking. Perfectly portioned... perfectly perfect.  The yellowtail with a slim sliver of jalepeno was awesome- my bf's pick of the night. The chilean sea bass divine. The trout with that sweet citrus.. the hamachi w/garganzola and balsamic- so unreal. The fois gras was smoother than butter. Everything just melted.  I'm not sure whether it had anything to do with shelling out SO much money but Nobu had just turned dinner into a culinary experience for us. A masterpiece. And once we've tasted greatness.... it's so hard to go back."}
{"text":"Our food was pretty fantastic, but what soured the whole experience was our service. Our waiter was unfriendly and his manner was short to the point of rudeness. One example: we ordered a sashimi dinner and instead of  indicating the various fish that the chef chose, he dumped the plate on our table and left immediately. I felt like I was being served by a brooding, bitter member of a failing rock band that had taken this job because he had to pay the bills. I would had some sympathy if the restaurant was busy, but half the tables were empty because our reservations were towards the end of the night. Maybe he was pissed because of that, but for $400, I'm inclined to not give a shit about that and want some proper service.  Having said that, I would have rated Nobu somewhere between 4-5 stars based purely on their food. The environment was pleasant but not that impressive. I'd like to come back some day, and maybe I will when the memories of the sub-par service fade."}
{"text":"10 star if possible! This restaurant is the only reason I go to the hard rock. The food is simply amazing. You must try the miso black cod....absolute favorite of mine, seafood soup is delish as well as the mushroom salad. I have had sushi there a few times but it's not the star of the show in my opinion. The place is always busy so I suggest making a reservation. Now as far as the price, it's $$$$...but you get what you pay for! Ladies I suggest going with your significant other :) I will be dining there over and over again. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"Wow,  wow, wow, wow! Did I say wow. We didn't want to come to this Nobu.  We really wanted to go to the Caesars location but it was all booked. We were pleasantly surprised. We were seated immediately.  It is a smaller dining room but it actually made for an intimate experience.  I wish I could walk you through what we ate.  But I can't remember the names. What I can say is that we let Ed, our server create a tasting menu for us. He did a fabulous job. We told him only to avoid anything with mayo. We had 3 cold sashimi courses,  some yummy cod dish and then the best steak ever! I didn't enjoy the carpacio,  but I have texture issues.  As such we got the finale steak well done and it was so juicy and moist that we couldn't believe it. We were too full to continue to the sushi course. They served us a great chocolate cake for our anniversary at no charge. I think our hotel concierge must have informed them.  Now. It's in the Hard Rock Resort, which is really sketchy. That is the only draw back. Once you get into the restaurant you overlook what you have to walk through and just enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food ok, and ambience too crazy! We felt we were in a concert. I couldn't even hear myself talk. Not a pleasant evening. We will not return."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing.  We came here on a Saturday evening without a reservation but we were able to snag a seat at the bar.  We started off with cocktails, I got the lychee martini and my boyfriend had the cucumber martini.  I think my martini was pretty average but his was delightful.  It had a hint of lychee in it as well and was really refreshing.    This was our first time here and we were not sure what to order, but our bartender was very helpful.  We started off with his first recommendation which was the Yellowtail with Jalapenos.  I was very hesitant at first because I dont like jalapenos unless they are pickled and on my nachos.  The combination of the yuzu sauce, jalapeno and cilantro on the fish was perfect.  The order came with 6 small pieces and my boyfriend and I were pretty sad that it was all gone.  Next we had the shrimps with spicy garlic.  Absolutely amazing, the shrimps were plump and huge and it came with mixed veggies.  I normally dont eat veggies but we cleaned up this dish.  I kept drowning my veggies in the sauce, it was super good and not too garlicky where our breaths were bad.  After this we got the new style salmon.  This normally comes in a filet but the bartender had it sliced into small pieces for us to share.  Again, very very good.  I even found the recipe online and am going to try to make it at home soon.  Finally, after all of this I was still hungry, so our bartender recommended the black cod miso.  They came out lettuce wrapped style.  Very tasteful and crunchy.  Service here was very good.  Out bartender kept checking up on us, he even gave us complimentary pineapple martinis and training chopsticks for me since he saw I was struggling.  It did get a little weird though, another guy behind the bar asked my boyfriend if he could grab him another drink.  I didnt think it would be a problem until a girl behind the bar gave him a dirty look and started \"telling\" our original bartender.  After the second guy gave us my boyfriends new drink, he started talking to us about craps.  I wish he didnt though because that girl was shooting him dirty looks for about 5 minutes.  Im pretty sure she was talking shit about him to the other guys behind the bar too.  Very weird and unprofessional.  -1 star for that.  I would totally come back here next time I am in town.  This was one expensive meal but totally worth it.  Next time, we wont come in wearing only t shirts and basketball shorts though."}
{"text":"Wow! This was absolutely outstanding food.  For our party of 4, we allowed the waiter to order for us and just sat back and enjoyed. Some highlights included the Yellowfin with Jalapeno sashimi, and really ALL the sashimi was incredibly fresh. The Black Cod was also amazing.  There wasn't a single dish that wasn't enjoyable.  In addition, the atmosphere is warm and romantic. The service was outstanding, with our waiter returning throughout the meal to see whether we enjoyed the previous dish.  My only criticism would be the price - was certainly expensive, ending at $220 per person after tip and wine. That being said, we ate A LOT that night, so we could have cut back a little.  This was an amazing experience and one of my favourite meals of all time."}
{"text":"BAD. BAD.  REALLY BAD. Forget the price, forget the menu, the fish was not fresh. The dishes from the original restaurant have all been \"Vegas-ized\" with sugary catsup like stuff on the shishito peppers, and sweetened tofu that made it taste like a weird dessert. It was so disappointing for all of us. The tuna was passable, but the yellowtail was inedible, and the salmon not so hot either. We were all gagging by the end of the meal.   This experience makes me question whether there is ANY fine cuisine in Vegas, or is it just a mall where all the culinary brands - banking on the ignorance caused by the beyond terrible general level of food in most of the US -- are making people feel like they are eating fine cuisine in huge portions  by designing the space luxuriously and charging 40 dollars for an entree and selling it in huge volume, while just industrializing the recipes and using low quality ingredients. Everything tastes like you are on a cruise. Yuck!  It's worth noting that we had dinner at Nobu in New York a few weeks ago and it was SUPERB!"}
{"text":"I came to Nobu on my literal first night ever in Vegas, and returned recently to discover that if anything, it's only gotten better with time.  On this visit we did a five-course chef's tasting menu that featured the signature dishes of the restaurant.   My favorites were the delicate, flavorful yellowtail and jalapeno sashimi, crispy rock shrimp (which I devoured, despite not being a big shrimp eater), the restaurant's legendary, comforting and savory miso cod.  Our server was passionate and knowledgeable about wine and sake pairings, and the service in general, all across the board, was impeccable.  Nobu is a genre-defining restaurant, then and now."}
{"text":"Black Cod Miso. That is all that I really need to say, but I will continue... AMAZING. Just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! We also tried the sashimi plate and was greeted with very fresh sashimi. The place is modern and decorated nicely. Great Ambiance! The service was wonderful too. Again... Black Cod Miso."}
{"text":"If you like sushi you have to try Nobu at least once.  It is well worth the drive to the Hard Rock just for the amazing food.  I've dined here at least 10 times over the years and I've never been let down.  Nobu is  amazing!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience. We had the lobster, salmon, wagyu beef,and the king crab tacos. I had oyster shooter which was great. I can't tell you what was in it but it was good!!!  We had the squid  pasta with garlic sauce which was superb  and shrimp and vegetables tempura to die for.  We had two of the house special sushi rolls. Best sushi I have ever had. I wanted to take this sushi back to New Orleans. The waiters were pleasant and the atmosphere was awesome. I can't wait to tell my friends and family about this place."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends to celebrate a birthday. The décor is pretty, ambiance is nice (not too quiet or loud).   We ordered the miso black cod, some sort of shaved artichoke salad, shrimp tempura and California sushi rolls, and shared everything.  After finishing our cod we found a hair on our plate. We informed our waiter who immediately had the manager come over. He offered us a new plate, but since we'd already finished it that didn't make much sense so we declined. Even though that is seriously icky I have to say that cod was life changing. I'm not a huge fish person. It's not that I don't like it, but most of the time when dining out I choose something other than fish. This was amazing. Sort of sweet, not \"fishy\" tasting at all, very moist (almost oily) and flaky. My two friends who both love seafood said it was some of the best fish they've ever had. The salad was also wonderful. All the components were shaved so finely it didn't even feel like a normal salad. Sushi is one of those things I want to like, but most of the time I really don't. I think it's the nori (when I eat seaweed by itself I want to gag. It's like eating ocean water, and not in a good way). The sushi here, though, was perfect. Best sushi I have ever had, hands down. We finished off with a dessert sampler, and I remember enjoying everything, but the only dessert that stands out was a miso cheesecake.  Portions are average to small. We were not very hungry going into this dinner, but if we had come in with empty stomachs we would have left and probably needed a snack.   Prices are on the high end, not exorbitant, but I'd say the entrees average $40. Because the portions aren't large I could easily see spending $100+ per person, especially with drinks.  Even though finding a hair in our food was gross, I know that can happen, and the manager was really great, and comped the dish, so it really didn't mar our evening. Our waiter, however, was pretty rude following the incident. I couldn't figure out if he thought we'd planted it or he was annoyed we weren't ordering more, but he was warm at the start of the evening, and following that was pretty detached.   The experience here wasn't perfect, and they really probably deserve a 4, but the food was just so amazing that I'll forgive everything else."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice.  The servers can be hit or miss. Food is generally ok, but way overpriced for what they are even by Vegas standards. I frequent Morimoto and based on my last visit I can finally conclude that Morimoto is far superior. I had a server argue with me that what they were bringing out was real wasabi when I know what they are. Maybe the chef made a mistake of giving her the wrong wasabi when I clearly ordered real root wasabi, but don't stand there and argue with me and then give me an attitude the rest of the meal. Not worth spending  $650  + tip for two to be treated like that."}
{"text":"As I was planning our trip to Vegas with my friends, a meal at Nobu was toward the top of our list.   We opted to make a dinner reservation and unfortunately the only time was 5pm. We showed up to an empty restaurant but had a nice table for 8 in the middle of the establishment. Here is where our  experience went to shit... One name, we met Alexandra our server. Alexandra, an overzealous brunette, greeted our table and immediately showed her true agenda, attacking our wallets as quickly as possible. \"I recommend you have one person to order for the table or have one of Chef Nobu's highly trained culinary professionals order for you\". The menu is intentionally vague so you have no choice but to rely on the recommendations of Alexandra, who was highly trained in the art of stealing, I mean selling. Only one Chardonnay choice for by the glass and it was $19.  To summarize, server sucked, my two sushi rolls were average at best and I walked out with a $300 bill for only me and my smoking hot wife. I'm not a peevish person normally but I left annoyed, luckily I immediately left Nobu and saw the Britney show which salvaged the evening. Note: if you go to Nobu, have a good group because I still had a blast because of the fellowship with the group at the table. Alexandra was nice to take a picture of the group on the way out.  Negative stars"}
{"text":"Simply, one of the finest meals I've ever had. One of the pricier ones, to be sure, but the food was so good you don't give that much of a thought. You're there for an experience you'll remember for some time, and that's pretty priceless.   Won't go through all the numerous dishes we tried, but each somehow seemed better than the last and the sushi and sashimi just evaporated on your tongue. The waiter chatted to us about budget and what we like and then we left it to him to just keep the food coming. He was similarly helpful on the drinks front, helping me pick some Japanese whiskeys that perfectly complimented the food.   One thing that raised our eyebrows was the inclusion of the Australian Beef dish...only because when we got the itimised receipt it was by far the most expensive thing on there... and as a table of seven traveling Aussies it was odd paying that much for something so common to us back home. Note to myself to remember next time to ask at the start for them just to stick to the fish dishes as they are far superior to the beef in my opinion, and much better bang for your buck.  Other than that, it was a fantastic evening. Strange walking out of there into the neon slot machines of the casino, but that's Vegas."}
{"text":"Okay- its Nobu so expectations ran high, but for the most part Nobu delivered.  Wait staff was phenomenol and were helpful guiding us through the menu and ensuring we tasted different flavors.  Setting was loud and much more open then I would have preferred but given its location inside a hotel casino, still funky, and still an experience.  The customized offerings were delicious but that miso glazed sea bass might go down as the dish you want as your inevitable last meal it was done to such perfection.  Slightly caramelized at the very edges with a bit more texture than the velvety sweet bites of the rest of the dish was heavenly, and we almost ordered a second plate ."}
{"text":"Unfrigginbelievable!!  I went last Saturday for a friends bachelor party and it was just an amazing experience of food.  There were 12 of us and after looking at the menu for 2 min, we just said f-it and just asked the waiter to bring the best stuff out.    Went down like this...  2 huge plates of yellowtail jalapeno and tuna tataki king crab ceviche which was incredible kobe beef served sizzling on hot stones which I would've just preferred rare but still excellent medium rare black cod miso filet (wait...things are still getting better??) huge plate of sushi to top it all off  Tasted even better comped :)  I cannot wait to go back here!!"}
{"text":"Eating at Nobu is like breaking out an old record collection and revisiting classic tunes.  Sure, I can get dishes like yellowtail jalapeno, rock shrimp and black cod with miso anywhere now.  But there's a special, fuzzy place in my heart for Nobu...it's where I lost my \"upscale sushi\" virginity all those years ago in Tribeca.  Every meal in any location has always been awesome and never has let me down.  Just like vodka!  This particular location is very pretty and the big cocoon-like booths look really cool.  Why are they still at the Hard Rock?  Does Mr. Hard Rock have nude photos of Mr. Nobu eating at Panda Express or something??   They also have the most expansive menu that I've seen from Matsuhisa-san, so branching out from the oldies but tasties was a must.   Their version of hamachi kama was (yooda, yooda) the best I've ever had.  Impressive in size, the heavy on the salt based seasoning and brick oven baked flavor was outstanding.  The yellowtail meat was so tender that it had everyone gnawing on the bones with bare hands just to get every bit.  The server almost lost a limb when he prematurely assumed we were done.    After very little convincing, so minimal in fact that I think I exclaimed \"YES! THAT!\" while pointing at the guy as soon as he said \"chu-toro\", we got the daily special of the medium fatty tuna topped with truffle, crispy garlic and greens.  They were indeed a divine couple of bites that had me wanting more.  I love tuna more than life.  Even my car license plate says \"tuna\" in Japanese.  Nobu still delivers after all these years!"}
{"text":"Peruvian/Japanese, I was here on business.  The food was excellent, but I have to admit that the waiters went overboard on the description of every single piece of food and drink they brought out.  The build up of how they cook it, where it comes from, etc. and then you get this tiny quantity of food......it was good, but then you get the bill......and realize you paid a lot of money for a little food and a lot of description....  but my company paid for the dinner.....the setting was great and I would go back, just not on my dime."}
{"text":"Nobu must be my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  Could it be my favorite anywhere?  I brought a co-worker with me who loves Japanese food.  After dinner, he said to me, \"Where I grew up, we were taught not to make a religion out of food.  But, after this dinner, I may become a true believer.\"    Don't think of Nobu as a typical Japanese restaurant -- even though you can order sushi and sashimi.  Think of it as a clever Japanese inspired restaurant that takes familiar flavors and brings them to the next level.  For example, the yellowtail came as very thin, delicate slices with jalapenos and cilantro, instead of wasabi.  The Black Cod with Miso is sublime.  When I asked for a second order, the waitress suggested the cod with pate in lettuce cups.  That was sublime."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!  They will make a tasting menu just for you according to your taste and budget. Our budget was on the lower end and we felt like the same care went into our menu. Each dish was more delicious than the next!! Definitely a place for foodies!"}
{"text":"Too hyped up. Though the yellow fin sashimi is the best I ever had. Now the issue I have with this....super expensive and you get tiny amount of food. We ordered the lobster taco and well....more like tiny tacos.....so disappointing. The rest of the sushi was ok.   Overall it is a very nice place and open.  .the service was a little slow though."}
{"text":"Nobu is by far my favorite restaurant! My boyfriend just took me for a birthday dinner and as always it was amazing! The only thing was that we found to be a little annoying was how long it took for our drinks to come out. Overall, a great dinner :)"}
{"text":"Must have reservations!  Eating at the bar is fun but again, reservations.  Food is amazing but the vessel between the kitchen and table is the service which can be very hit and miss.  Everything here is overpriced including the cocktails.  They will build you a \"custom\" menu built on your price point which can be a double sided sword.  When asked this question by your server, it seems like there is no right answer and whatever you answer, you may potentially sound like a cheap ass, ha!  The food is always amazing, the hostess's are always nice but once you are seated, it can be a shot in the dark.  Kobe beef is sold by the ounce and melts in your mouth.  Fish is fresh.  You can't go wrong on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific!  Food is always consistent and service is terrific. If there is one knock, it's the atmosphere. Tables are a bit squished together and narrow for 2. Signature dishes jalapeño yellowtail, miso salmon and tempura shrimp are musts!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night with some other colleagues from my company.  They are not really sushi connoisseurs but enjoy the atmosphere.  I can't believe that anyone would rate this higher than 2 stars.    They must have been drunk or on drugs because the quality of the sushi here is just a tad better than supermarket sushi and the price here for the poor quality is outrageously expensive.    I've been eating sushi for 30 years now and have been to some of the highest quality sushi joints in Southern California and let me tell you...avoid this place if you are expecting high quality and selection.   The only thing that was decent was the cold sake but I paid a premium price for it.  I guess that's what you get when you go to a Las Vegas Hotel / Casino and have sushi.   Good thing I expensed the dinner."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. Dining here for us was a happy accident.  We had originally gone to a place we had a travel zoo voucher for only to find that it had shut down. We got right in at Nobu without a reservation and sat at the Sushi bar. It was very cool to watch the sushi chefs at work. We had the yellowtail sashimi which was very good. Normally, I wouldn't touch sashimi, but this is Nobu and nothing here will disappoint. My husband and I shared 4 sushi rolls and that was plenty of food. Excellent service. The only thing is that it is quite crowded and loud in there, but still a great place for a very nice dinner."}
{"text":"My birthday is coming!! This is my go to place.  Never a bad meal here.  Still hands down best sushi in Vegas. Pricey but worth it.  Great service. I dream about this food. My vegetarian son finds a good selection as well."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I booked a week at Nobu Hotel inside the Caesar's palace and I had to give this place a try.  I am a sushi/sashimi lover, and the fusion of sushi/sashimi dishes I have seen in magazines, made me put this place in my top 10 sushi trips. I came for dinner, and there was a special menu.  It had samples of different types of sushi/sashimi, and even tapas style Japanese cuisine.  The plate, which included a variety of mini desert bites, was about $120, which was money well spent. This place is trendy, and definitely a spot to hit if you love sushi.    I didn't leave here bloated or wanting to explode.  I was satisfied with every bite1  Most people complain about sushi prices, or claim to love sushi, but order sushi rolls.  Which cover the taste of the actual fish.  The presentation is beautiful and taste is superb.  If you enjoy all-you-can eat sushi for $15.99, this is not a place for you.  You won't find poor quality fish here.  I ordered a 8 piece High Roller bento box for room service.  One of the pieces was lobster.  It was $250, now I see why it was called the High Roller, lol  This is a place I will be returning"}
{"text":"We visited for New Year's Eve and had a great time!   First and foremost Nobu has excellent service at all locations. In comparing this to Nobu 57 in NYC, both are similar and don't disappoint. However their menus are slightly different and the Las Vegas menu is larger.   They had champagne options for New Years so we started our night with Krug.   We had the following dishes:  Mushroom salad - surprisingly delicious considering mushrooms aren't my favorite food Crispy rice and spicy tuna - such a yummy app, but very salty   Sashimi platter - there are 12 pieces, a nice variety and very fresh Miso cod - this is my favorite dish on their menu, cod is very flaky and tender, while miso is just slightly sweet   Definitely recommend stopping in to Nobu as it's not as heavy a meal as other Vegas options. It's also a lower price point than the NYC location."}
{"text":"Black Cod Miso was BOMB. Yellowtail was absolutely delicious. Everything on the menu you have to try. The best server is Manny. He knows what to get when you are new."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but to be expected for the dining experience here. Been to many Nobu's (Hawaii, Hollywood, Malibu, Hard Rock Hotel) and must say this one in the Caesar's Hotel is the best by far. It's amazing that although they all have the same menu, the food quality and service is different at each location (fyi the Hollywood Nobu is horrible on all levels). My husband have become regulars at this particular one because it is just that good. We chose to sit in the lounge area because the booths are comfy and has a cheerful vibe.  My husband actually insisted I write this review because the manager Bryan Shinohara is so awesome and recognizes the regulars, such as us, and goes out of his way to make us feel welcome and appreciated. He is an important factor that makes us want to come back time and time again."}
{"text":"Next time you see black cod with miso on a menu, know where the inspiration lies: Nobu.  The Hard Rock space is large, light, and well done for a Vegas restaurant branch."}
{"text":"Um....wow! Had many many great dishes....enough that our bill was pretty much a mortgage payment! Bucket list for sure! Wagyu was to die for and I loved how they lit the whole thing on fire to cook at your table. That dish and many others we had were simply amazing. Service was on point too! Thanks Nobu for an unforgettable meal!"}
{"text":"Let's get the obvious out of the way first: omakase here is pricey.  But then again, so is a good vegas show - and chances are your meal here will last longer than a show and you'll remember it longer.   With that said, I had one of the best meals of my life here a few days ago. Certainly the best Japanese-style food since the last time I was at...   Nobu, many years ago.   (Most recent high-water mark of any cuisine: Beast in Portland.  But Nobu was even better than that!)  You have to remember that emotional strength is required when presented with a meal like this. Like any great art it'll reach in and pluck your heart strings when you least expect it. I nearly teared up at several dishes - the sashimi preparations are insane, the black cod lettuce wraps are amazing, scallops are incredible, and we were presented with the most savory high-end pork skewer I have ever tasted. There aren't enough superlatives in the English language to describe how this meal was; you really must go there to try it for yourself.   I admit when I walked in the decor looked a little dated by current vegas standards (and has not changed in years.). The tables and chairs are pretty minimalist. It took an extra couple of minutes to be served drinks and have our orders taken. But once we engaged with our server all of my concerns evaporated. I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again and again.   I also don't hesitate to award five stars to Nobu; they have earned every one of them.   And apparently they also now have two Michelin stars. Go figure."}
{"text":"The prices are high but the food is amazing. The best speciality roll of my life. This is a great place ask about the specialty rolls."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a nice date night here. The restaurant is chic with a romantic ambiance.  For starters we shared the snapper dry miso, a field of greens salad and a spicy acai martini.  We also had the spicy tuna roll, yellowtail jalapeno roll, and their signature dish: the black cod miso. The sushi and fish was fresh, flavorful and d'lish.  We were full from dinner, so we had a light dessert and shared the mochi ice cream - 4 flavors: chocolate, coconut, green tea, and mango with some hot green tea.  All the dishes were presented beautifully, tasted wonderful, and the service was great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of Nobu. They give you larger quantities and their menu is better than Malibu."}
{"text":"Sea Bass was very good , and oysters were amazing I cant wait to go back.Delicious food and great service definitely ask for Jeff he was awesome! Very informative, and had great suggestions."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for client dinners and overall I find Nobu to be slightly overpriced but a quality meal. Here are my takes on the food:  Drinks- yummy but not cheap Miso cod- an absolute MUST MUST get, it was worth every penny and it wasn't even that expensive Uni (sea urchin)- my first taste of uni and it did NOT disappoint!  Sushi- OK but I've had better  In the end, it is still a well orchestrated meal with decent service. I'm not sure it quite lives up to the hype but the miso cod could carry this place on it's back!"}
{"text":"If you want to splurge, go to Nobu. This place has been on my list for the longest time and  finally we visited their Vegas location. It's fine dining at its best. Everything from the service to the ambience to the presentation to he food is exceptional. What made our experience exponentially amazing: our servers knowledge of food. He asked one simple question to everyone on the table: tell me what you like eating and what you def don't want on your table and I ll help decide the nights menu. My husband who is a vegetarian was served beyond tasty and exceptional food at a Japanese restaurant. That deserves brownie points. He normally does not enjoy eggplant but gobbled down their egg plant dish: it was so yum.  We started with a yellow tail starter which just melted in our mouths. Their bite sized tacos, their main course preparations, every single thing is a piece of art and a treat to your palate. Heavy on the pocket but so worth it! I would def save this one for a special occasion or may be after winning a round of black jack at Caesars ;)"}
{"text":"The jalapeno yellow tail sashimi is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Order the Bento box for dessert (which they finally added to the LV menu) to share and it's just about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This place is not what we expected for the price they charge. We had the sushi premium dinner for $90 and it Only had 8 small pieces of nigiri with 6 pieces tuna roll.  We've had better. Ordered rock shrimp tempura from the kitchen and it never came out until after 40 minutes of just waiting and asking for it from server. Sushi chefs were also asking about it for several times. Server finally gave the food to us when we asked for the check and said he did not want to throw it away so he said we can eat it. Just waited for the check and left it. Worst experience at a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Obviously everything is amazing, food, service, ambience- all world class. Exceeded expectations"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of the one in NYC. Unfortunately, this one pales in comparison to its East Coast counterpart. Great ambiance, but that doesn't exactly make up for everyone in my party getting sick after. The cocktails need some fine tuning as well but the service was great. Unfortunately,  I probably wouldn't eat here again... just because I'm not a fan of all night long gastrointestinal misery... and because there are so many other options in Vegas."}
{"text":"While pricey, this is an institution and consistent across the country.  At the Vegas location, the waiter will ask you about what you like and then arrange the menu for you.  The sushi was delicious, and the sides were great as well such as the sashimi salad and soft shell crab.  I personally am not a fan of the black cod, but many people like it (oh ma gawd ya hafta get da black cawd) can be heard uttered by many a patron.  I prefer to stick to the sushi.  Oh and the drinks are delicious.  When you go to the bathroom, make sure that you remember where your table is.  I got lost as did many I saw coming back from a pee break."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The place was a bit loud as there were conventioners flooding the dinning area.  The miso cod was delicious. I also recomend the bento dessert box (green tea ice cream and chocolate lava cake anyone?!)"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience. I started with the mule cocktail which was great - not too sweet and came with a delicious spiced pineapple. My husband had the sangria which was good, but we liked the mule better. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and helped us navigate the somewhat overwhelming menu. We ended up letting our server choose our meal after telling him our likes/dislikes.   The first course was yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and cilantro. This was both of our favorite dish of the night - the flavor was incredible and the ingredients were so high quality. We then had an off-menu lobster salad with avocado. It was delicious. Third was a salmon sashimi with a sesame oil sauce - it was good, but I preferred the yellowtail sashimi because it had more acidity. We also had a plate of shishito peppers that were very flavorful and not too spicy.   We had tuna tacos, which were tiny but packed full of flavor! Our least favorite was the tempura shrimp. I didn't like it because it was too heavy and the sauce reminded me of mayonnaise. I should have told our server we don't love fried food. The final dish was a blackened cod, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I was stuffed by that point but it was one of my husband's favorites.  I can't wait to eat at Nobu again. Next time I'll definitely have the yellowtail sashimi and tuna tacos again!"}
{"text":"\"Amazing\" is the word to describe this dining experience I had with this place. I was lucky to have got a really informed server who told us the best dishes they are known for and what to order. I was taken here for my birthday surprise dinner from my girlfriend. They sat us down and first gave us the drink menu. We ordered one cocktail drink forgot the name of it but i knew it had Li Hing Mui powder around the brim of the glass. After we ordered our drinks, they then gave us the food menu. Really sad they didn't have uni at that time Becuase they get it shipped fresh. Which I understand for this high end dining it needs to be served fresh! We ordered a couple things so the server suggested the Black cod fish dish that they are known for. It was so good!!!!! We then ordered lobster tacos, oyster shooters, salmon rolls, and sea bass skewers. Trust me they may seem little but each bite was exquisite! Then lastly we ordered the Vanilla Tart and bento box for dessert with a happy birthday for me on them. Overall my experience with Nobu has got to be the best Las Vegas strip restaurant I ever had. Will come back again when we get that fat paycheck. Ahahaha"}
{"text":"The best Sushi Network ever!!! We have been at Nobu in Mexico City so wanted to check it in Vegas as well. And as expected it was awesome too!!! Service is great!!! Meal is fabulous! Worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Don't even think about it, just go. My boyfriend and I finished watching Absinthe on Sunday night and didn't feel like walking too far for dinner so we decided to dine at Nobu. We arrived at 9:30pm with no reservations and they were able to seat us. I would definitely recommend making reservations though.  My first thought when we arrived was how romantic and chill this place is. The ambiance immediately put me a relaxed mood. Now I haven't been to any other Nobu locations so I can't compare, but I really enjoyed our experience here. We started out with an Old Fashioned and Nobu Sidecar. The Old Fashioned was stronggggg. My Nobu Sidecar was deliciously made with Japanese whiskey. Moving on to the foods...  Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeo 5/5 - I'm not even a huge fan of yellowtail but this dish was prepared in a little ponzu sauce topped with jalapenos and cilantro (which I also don't like) which all came together so well. Fish was very fresh. Monkfish pate with cavier 5/5 - droolsssssssssss as I'm writing about this dish. So so good. Monfish pate just melts in your mouth. Cavier was delish. Sauce was a little on the sweet side but still good nonetheless. Black cod miso 5/5 - MUST GET! At first we overlooked this until our waiter said this is Nobu's #1 dish. I was definitely glad we got it. Who knew cod can taste so good?! You can definitely taste the miso that is marinated with the fish. We were told it gets marinated for 10 hours. Salmon belly, sweet shrimp, and sea urchin sashimi 3/5 - Don't get me wrong, everything was extremely fresh and good but after trying the previous 3 dishes the sashimi ended up being pretty mediocre. Bottom line - skip the sashimi and get their specialties. Flourless chocolate cake with matcha green tea ice cream 4/5 - chocolate cake has hot lava oozing out of it while the cold ice cream cools everything down; a perfect blend.  This is not a place for the cheap, but it is well worth the splurge for a special occasion. For a couple of dishes, 2 drinks, and dessert, our bill ended up being around $300 for 2. Some may argue it's not worth it but go see for yourself. =)"}
{"text":"Top 10 meals in my life. Easy. We did the omakase menu and hoped for the best. We got better than best. My only regret is we started dinner at about 11:00 p.m. and as many of my friends know, I'm usually a pumpkin well before midnight. Vegas Danni is at least consistent and I could barely stay awake. Next time, I'm going early-bird style."}
{"text":"Wow - we had the tasting menu and it was absolutely worth it.  The selections that were served were family style and there was not a single item I did not enjoy. Many were not items I would have selected for myself which adds to the experience. The service was good, drink options and ambiance are great. I highly recommend Nobu at the Hard Rock!"}
{"text":"Having owned Nobu's cookbook for years, I was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.  (which means my lazy ass never made anything form the cookbook but my excuse is that some of his ingredients are so hard to find....but I digress).  Drinks: Jyunmai Sake - \"masu\" size (wooden box cup) smooth and lovely to drink YK 35 - \"masu\" size.  This was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar. Note: Masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  You finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.  Food: Monkfish Liver - honestly, not my thing.  I tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  It had caviar on top which I ate.  But my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  He enjoyed having the dish to himself. Tiradito, Nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  One of my faves but not for hubby White fish New Style Sashimi - sashimi doused with soy sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. Also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby.  Sweet Shrimp New Style Sashimi - even better than the above.  YUM.  Hubby let me have most of this one and for that, I'm forever grateful. Uni Tempura - this was the one thing I wanted to try the most.  The shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and I greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  More for me!  The accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious. Miso Black Cod - I didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The serving size was reasonable.  Four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  Very enjoyable. Scallops with Wasabi Pepper Sauce - Again, a pretty good-sized serving. The sauce was phenomenal although I do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  I'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.    Dessert: Caramel Chocolate Mouse - I thought this sounded rather ordinary until I looked at the ingredient list.  Globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped with shiso citrus granite, topped with caramel \"caviar\"; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy Japanese rice.  BEST dish we had all night.  Loved it.  I could have had 3 more.  Service was great with several lapses here and there.  The busboys were impeccable.  Our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.  The quality of the food was excellent and did not disappoint.  I'm no stranger to paying several bills for dinner but for whatever reason, I did feel that food was somewhat overpriced here.  Or maybe for what we paid, I thought the food should have been 5-star."}
{"text":"One of the, no joke, top ten meals of my life.  This review is brief because I don't really know all of WHAT I ate, but what I can say is this:  * If you have a group, this is an amazing place to come.  They have large, 10 person, knights of the round-esque tables with rotating bezels for the different plates.  You can spin them around and share everything really easy this way.  Table size is perfect, too, because you can easily talk to every person in your group.  * Sake is a great play; easy to share, lot of unique (I think? what the hell do I know) varieties.  * If you have a group, they'll recommend a sort of \"chef menu\" thing where your server just brings a bunch of plates out in phases that accommodate your budget.  Our group said $100-$150 a dude (without drinks) and we had a perfect meal.  Everyone left full, we tried way more dishes than we would have if we were ordering ad-hoc, and there was no headaches splitting up the bill.  Our group dinner was broken up into a few phases: 1) ceviche plates, 2) hot plates, 3) tacos, 4) sushi, 5) dessert (on the house since they had a little wine snafu).  The favorite thing I ate was probably the different ceviches; the salmon one was particularly good.  Really tasted different than a normal sushi or salmon dish, which I think are generally kind of boring.  The beef taco was also really damn good, but I do agree that -- if I was ordering piecemeal -- it's way on the expensive side.  All in all, Nobu, for me, lived up to all the hype.  Usually these mega-restaurants from top tier chefs are solid but not amazing.  In this case, everything I ate was unique, well executed, and delicious.  Table was perfect. Restaurant was cool.  Service was great.  That's all you can really ask for when you are paying for a premium meal."}
{"text":"**************************** REVIEW 879 ********************************           \"The ideal destination to be seen and socialize!\" So that's what they say on their website. I love every Nobu resto, especially I got to meet the chef himself. This was the first-ever Nobu hotel, restaurant and lounge will offer a stylish new experience of luxury and hospitality, appealing to returning Caesars Palace guests and the alike.            This gigantic space of  11,200 square foot Nobu restaurant and lounge, located in the heart of the Nobu Hotel,  offer several teppanyaki tables, sushi bar and private dining area along with a large lounge and bar boasting over 300 seats. This is massively big for my taste and probably the biggest Nobu resto ever!           Modern, chic, but too big to be cozy and attentive service. They put us away as most of my RSVP would have the word LOUD next to my name :-) So that my friends and loved ones can be loud with laughter and joy when we dine out.         The food wasn't all up to the bar. Sadly to say that Blue Ribbon offers better for the same price point. Although I think I still get more bang for my buck at other sushi places in Vegas. Even if you go to Noby at the Hard Rock Hotel, same food for 30% less in price point.    FOOD:  - Spicy Seafood Soup $18   - Shishito pepers  - Hamachi Sashimi with Jalapeno $28 - Nobu signature dish.   - Ankimo Monkfish Pate with Caviar $30 - ouch, it was 3 pieces, nothing more special but good.  - Miso glazed black cod $34 - ouch, was 1 of Nobu's signature dish, consistent!  - Lobster ceviche $34 - 4 lettuce cup ceviche, refreshing.   - Shrimp and Maine Lobster with Spicy Lemon $38  SUSHI and SASHIMI single piece:  - Abalone $10  - Hottategai $ 6 - Aji $6  - Uni $10 - Shima Aji $ 7 - Tai $9  - Kampachi $8 - Otoro $20  - Wagyu sashimi - delicious, 1 of my FAV dishes of the night!   - Hirame sashime - delicious.           Instead of sake, we opted for a few bottles of Champagne, reasonable mark up, just about 350% which is nothing compare for Vegas standard - Nicolas Feuillatte Brut Réserve Champagne, Louis Roederer \"Brut Premier\" Champagne.         We left uncertainty how we felt about ths new sushi spot. It was just an OK overall for us. Do I go out of my way to come back here again, not really, but it's still a good spot to check it out."}
{"text":"Oh Nobu, but the question is, go Nobu Vegas style?  I hear that this Nobu is nothing quite like the other Nobus and this is the first Nobu I've tried. The fish is great, no doubt about that. The nigiri definitely has an elegant touch added which is quite graceful for sushi.  But I didn't like the feel of this place. Then again, this was Vegas so what do you expect? The people weren't mean like some have mentioned (maybe if you come in flipflops and mom jeans that might be the case but no one dresses like that in Vegas) but I just wasn't diggin the vibe all the much.  Nonetheless, the fish still stands as superior to most places, no doubt about that."}
{"text":"Great place in Las Vegas. I recommend the Omakase Nobu. It was delicious and featured the items that made chef Nobu famous.   Favorite Items:  Miso Cod Crispy Rice Tiny little deep fried crabs Uni  Toro"}
{"text":"As an AVID sushi chick ... I was looking forward to Chef Matsushita to WOW me.   The place was expectedly pretty ... the $14 cucumber martini (lame).  Ignorable since i came here to be \"wow\"ed by the food not the booze. The waitress was really REALLY REALLY sweet and the couple sitting next to us shared their sake with us ... which was sweet.  we were debating between sticking to rolls and your average japanese food OR the chef's specialty.  $100 for the omakase ... an extra $35 for \"better quality food\".  *ding*  1. gazpacho w/ a white asparagus eggroll. gazpacho = ok. eggroll = interesting. a lame start for a meal i was expecting to be great.   2. bonito, some other weird fish and a japanese fish i can't remember \"sashimi\" = interesting. the salsa made the dish. it was OK.   3. sashimi salad w/ sake and peppers and onions = ok. i was STILL waiting to be WOWed at this point ... then again ... this was JUST the start ... a small build up to what's going to be great... RIGHT??!  4. peppered sea bass w/ truffle sauce = ... the HIGHLIGHT of the meal. some parts had some SERIOUS pepper ... but it was good.   5. kobe beef with some sort of lame tabasco = the beef was good. the tabasco ... LAME.  *insert some weird apple sauce shot w/ a mandarin orange*   *this is where it gets bad*  6. soup. HOW DO YOU MESS UP MISO SOUP? ... put an UNFRESH clam in it with SERIOUS sand in it.   7. sushi. eel / half raw supposedly cooked but STILL SLIMY shrimp / ? / ? = i had NEVER gagged and vomitted into my napkin UNTIL this very moment in time. i choked on an eel bone and the skin of the eel still had scales. the eel itself was sour. the rest of the fish was disguised with the NOT OPTIONAL wasabi ball that was lodged into the rice ball. ... and of course MORE tabasco.   ... *insert bathroom runs 3x*  8. green tea weird thing with pineapple foam = good.  i was NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED. i left SICK and wanting the meal to end AS SOON AS POSSIBLE... i didn't even finish my cocktail. :(  ... i should have stuck to the rolls."}
{"text":"I've had friends recommend this place to me while I was in Vegas.  So we decided that we would stop here for my cousin's birthday when we were in town.  Disappointed to say the least.   8:00pm - Arrived - Drinks were order to my knowledge, however, 4 individuals from the table were not asked (including moi). Our drink order was lost about 2 times.  8:28pm - Still waiting for the menu...after asking about 2 times already (*WAVE WAVE* trying to get a waiter's attention.)  I just wanted the menu.  As a waiter, if another table that is not yours asks for something as simple as a menu, why don't you help out your fellow coworker and bring some over??  Close to 9:00pm now - food begins to come out...  Ceviche - way too fishy Black cod with miso - Good, but I would rather it cut off a bit of the sweetness Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - délicieux Edamame - the usual  Then 7 rolls came out - nothing special...was told \"This is all, did you want anything else?\" No.  Very dissatisfied to the point where there were still plenty of rolls left on the plate.  Finally, one of the guys remembered we ordered a Kobe Beef Teriyaki...It never came.  We notified two guys and finally when we wanted to pay for the bill and just go home. They brought it out.    Sorry to say, a bit of my distaste came out.  It's my cousin/best friend's birthday dinner and it was a disaster.  We sent back the teriyaki and wanted to leave ASAP after the bill came.    The 3rd star is for the waiter's apology and help with the bill.  It was nice that they made an effort after the shortcomings.  The place wasn't packed, maybe it was an off day.    Hopefully, if I return, my next experience will be much better."}
{"text":"Nobu.  Well, what can I say?  I've wanted to go to Nobu for a really, really long time.  Being in Vegas for the weekend, I decided this would be the time to do it.   We started with an assortment of sashimi.  Tuna, Mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  Then a large platter of raw Chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  A warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  MMMMMMM. Next came tempura King Crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  It was amazing.  My husbands eyes rolled back into his head- I thought that he was having a seizure.  Then came the spicy tuna roll and eel and cucumber roll.  Both good.  But the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  And I mean in a bad way.  So I've never had uni.  I know that is super lame.  But I've been waiting until I was at a really good establishment because I wanted to be sure that I was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   My fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     EEEEEEWWWW. So it came pureed and then wrapped and tempura 'd.  Wow.  Well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater I dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  Big mistake!  I take a bite.  The exterior is nice and crisp.  Within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  Maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes. -Abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear. Thank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  Super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw Kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  So we got to cook our own slices of Kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  Can we say FUN?  I've always wanted to do that. Dessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  I did like the Shiso sorbet though.  The reason why I have given Nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that I had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is Vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  Even as I am writing this I cannot believe what I am about to say.  I am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  In this instance I was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  But for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  Ouch!  Gees- I have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  Am I just a cheap ol' broad?  Or have I gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  Something just felt really wrong about that.    I just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  But, then again, I guess that pretty much sums up Vegas."}
{"text":"\"Nobu Nobu Nobu.\" I was told by a few people that the Omakase chef signature dish for $125 is the best way to experience Japanese cuisine. So I jumped on it! The food was so good that the chef prepared it to where you don't have to dip it in any additional sauces. You clean your palette with the giant pickled ginger sticks! I'm used to the thinly slices slivers, but these chunks are my new favorite.  I was truly impressed with the servers who were able to explain each dish they served without stuttering or adding \"uhm.\" They were very confident and knowledgeable of the dish served! The chef carefully placed each ingredient on the plate making it look like art!   So you may ask \"why 4 stars?\"  For a high end restaurant with 4 dollar signs, I didn't expect my chopsticks to be the wood ones where you have to manually break off yourself and hope it actually splits in half. I would suggest keeping the disposable chopsticks, but ones that are already separated. Also, the food was a bit salty. I went through several glasses of water and that could just be that I'm dehydrated from the Vegas heat. Who knows. I would recommend anyone coming here for their first time to try to sampler!   Unfortunately I don't remember all the cool names and all the fish that I ate but I'll try my best to describe them in my photos attached!"}
{"text":"5 star restaurant...5 star prices.  Add certain Sake selections and dinner for two can easily top $600.  In fact, it's uncommon to get out of there for less.  But, that aside, you get what you pay for.  With a wide range of dishes, there are generous portions if you order correctly and there's nothing on the menu that isn't first class in freshness, taste and presentation.  Probably not your everyday sushi place, but if you're trying to impress clients or friends, this place is the Disneyland of restaurants.  Located inside the Hard Rock Hotel and tucked away in a corner, seek it out...you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Nobu is my favorite Japanese restaurant.  Ever.  So far I've been to three- this one, Nobu Malibu and Nobu 57 in NY.  Out of the three, I'd have to say NY was the best and this one the least-best.  I say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and Nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  You cant go wrong with Nobu- but I did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.  So, of course of course you have to get the Miso Cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. In addition to the cod, I also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the hearts of palm salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a miso soup.  If you've read my Nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini I had was perfect (which is why I had 3), so understandably I was excited to have it again.  However, the one I received at Nobu Vegas was waaaaay to strong, and I had to request additional lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  My other major gripe was the hearts of palm salad.  I specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same hearts of palm salad with jalapeno dressing they serve at Nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  WRONG.  That salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  It tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at Nobu 57.  And, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite I swear I smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  Oh, and not to mention the fact that it was TWENTY DOLLARS.  Um, yea...skip that one.  The miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.  So, even with my complaints I still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  Maybe not as good as Nobu 57, but still the best Japanese restaraunt in Vegas, definitely."}
{"text":"Nobu is a superb restaurant. My brother and I ate there while staying at Caesar's Palace for a week and I must say every aspect of the restaurant was above satisfactory.  As a vegan, I was thoroughly impressed when the server was completely understanding and helpful in picking out many choices. In addition to having Tofu Toban-Yaki, he explicitly stated that the chef could prepare a multitude of dishes with vegetable/protein substitute!  I ordered the Omakase: Nobu Signature Menu Tasting option (Normally costing $125, while the vegetarian option cost $100). It came with 8 courses (desert included). Their skill showed, as they essentially gave me the same experience a regular customer would receive with that meal option. The vegan desert was also to die for.  The only downside is that most dishes are small portioned and high prices, save some $10-15 dishes.  Either way, excellent food and experience."}
{"text":"Before coming here, I literally knew nothing of the place. Didn't know about Omakase, didn't know about prices, didn't know about attire, didn't know what I was getting myself into LOL.   Literally wanted Japanese food with my co-workers and stumbled here. This place is totally packed and you have to expect a wait. If I had been prepared for this place, I would've totally knew what to order but I was literally just stuck. Ordered the salmon roll, hamachi roll and toro hand roll.   I have to say, this changed my perspective about eating sushi..it was so simple and clean (what i mean is no extra sauces, nothing fried, no extra veggies). It made me appreciate every bite of the fish. I loved all the fish I ordered..the hamachi was nice because of the jalapeño added to it and I just love toro..so mouth drooling! And the sauce was to die for!! I won't forget the taste of it and I wish I could describe it, but I would totally fail.   To be honest, this type of restaurant is not really my style. I'm giving this four stars because the service was good and it changed the way I like to eat my sushi now (as weird as it sounds). I used to get rolls that had sooo much stuff on it, but now, I love getting more simplistic rolls. Would I come back here again? Maybe, if it was with the right person."}
{"text":"Sushi with a twist. Yes, order popcorn shrimp, wagyu beef, and the yellow tail sashimi. This place is not your traditional Sushi joint, it's exciting to see how Nobu mixes flavors and textures unlike any chef I've ever tried.   Tip: Order the cod cups (not on the menu)   1 -5 scale Service 5 Food 5 Atmosphere 5  It's expensive so make sure you take a foodie who can appreciate the experience"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to writing this review, however, due to the sequence of events that transpired, I am now dreading it. We dined here on Sunday, 11/12 to celebrate our friend's birthday. Everything started out as expected, our servers were pleasant, cocktails were tasty and we were ready to throw down on some amazing eats. I'll add a few notes about what worked well first. The tuna appetizer was probably my fave over the yellowtail w/ jalapeño appetizer. The king crab kohlrabi salad was soooo good, we ordered it again. The black cod miso, which they're known for, didn't disappoint. It was so tasty with the glaze. We tried both of the Chilean sea bass entrees and the one with the black bean sauce was the winner. Having dined out with this group on several occasions, we always get an oyster or uni shooter. It's actually one thing I look forward to. We opted for a round of uni shooters. Whoah. It was like taking a shot of straight soy sauce, no uni taste whatsoever. And, it wasn't one person in our group, everybody had the same reaction. We brought it to our server's attention. The staff could have handled this better. It went from, the shooter is supposed to taste that way, to we will comp you the birthday dessert, to we can take 1/2 of the shooters off your bill to finally taking all of the shooters off our bill. Needless to say, we were all very surprised by the way Nobu handled this situation. 2 stars for poor customer service."}
{"text":"Okay. Amazing. Got Omakase, but not just Omakase....  Debated going here since we're vegans... thought I MIGHT have fish for the first time in over 4 years then decided against it and canceled our reservations. But then the night we stayed IN the Hard Rock Hotel and walked by the joint?.... well.... here's how it went down:  We stopped to just check out the menu to see what veg options were even available. The hostess and host were wondering what we were contemplating and why... We told them that we were veg and everyone at the hostess station said 'No Problem!! Come in, vegetarians here all the time!!'... but then we followed that up with 'Well, we're actually vegans.....' to which one waiter said 'Let me check with the chef, I'll be right back.'   Apparently the kitchen 'wanted the challenge'.... so in we went!  Sat down and decided to order the omakase meal. Usually this consists of six plates plus dessert but we actually got EIGHT and TWO desserts (one each, two different desserts)... Can I say AMAZING?! The food that the kitchen came up with was AMAZING. We actually were stuffed by the time the sixth course of food came around (and we thought last!) but TWO more came. By the time dessert was served we didn't think we could fit anymore into our stomachs. But we \"managed\" :)  Food, service, everything was impeccable. Def would highly recommend a visit. Worth every penny!! Very impressed with what they came up with for us as well."}
{"text":"I went with my girls. The service was great. All the wait staff were men! . The atmosphere was bustling. I ordered a few maki rolls, yellowfin with jalapeño, crab, and their house roll. I would opt for their house roll. Overall, everything was very fresh. They will do a tasting menu taking into account your budget and your taste and customize something for you. Oh, can't forget the alcohol. I had some Nobu. If you're into Sushi...it's a must go to at least once."}
{"text":"Best thing I ever ate. Walked in weary of sashimi. Ordered a glass of wine and told the server my spending range. After a quick consult of likes and dislikes a fast cascade of the freshest, most unbelievable food was delivered until there was no more room.  Go with your friends who aren't afraid to try things. Life changing!"}
{"text":"Yikes, what happened?  Consistency isn't one of Nobu's strengths, apparently, which I believe should be a priority if they are going to charge their customers as much as they do.  I ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which I do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.  The signature hamachi with jalapeno?  Devoid of all velvety tenderness.  The salmon sashimi?  Like chewing a rug.  The maguro nigiri?  Stringy and tough.  On top of it all, I ventured out and tried the hamachi kama.  Not bad, but terrible for $20.  In San Diego, you can get the same size hamachi kama with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  There is no excuse, honestly.  If you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  Half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.  Nobu isn't a complete loss, though.  Like I stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  It comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than I remembered it being last time.  We also tried the miso almond cake and edamame ice cream, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea ice cream that is the bento.  Never be tempted to order a different dessert here at Nobu.  Ever.  Same goes with the black cod.  Yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  It should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).  One item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  Perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but I could taste that warm sweet flavor that I know is associated with high quality freshness.  Gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  The set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  Still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!  I also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  Can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  Wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  I highly recommend that you get it served hot.  While I maintain an A-OK for Nobu, I doubt I'll be coming back.  There are other places to get better Japanese food--and for better prices."}
{"text":"Yum. The best tempura(so light and crispy) ever and great desserts. Yeah, it's pricey and the seats could be more comfortable, but I still loved it."}
{"text":"Originally posted on winodepot.com  *** Date: May 18, 2007 Location: 4455 Paradise Road @ Hard Rock Hotel Corkage: $15 or $20 - can't bring bottle in that's on their list Cost: $180/person including tax & tip Phone: 702.693.5090  Hummm.....where do I start. This was recommended to me by my dinner companion when I went to Ame, a palate I trust. So even after many disappointing fine dining restaurants on hotel properties, I figured I would give Nobu a shot. Should of known better...  Standard menu as well as two different tier of omakase available, $100 & $135 if I recall correctly. We decided to do the $135 version for all three of us, three cold course, two hot course, followed by soup, sushi, and dessert.  Writing this up a week later, can't remember exactly what we had, weekend in Vegas tends to short circuit one's memory.   Think we started with a course of Bonito sashimi, which was fresh and nice flavor combinations. The two other cold course wasn't particularly memorable, very apparent since I can't recall much details on them. Moving onto the first hot course, which I do remember, but for the wrong reason. Some sort of white fish (Cod or Halibut), done in a sweet and sour stir-fry style with touch of spice. Sorry, but if this is what I am looking for, I'll take my money to Panda Express or any food court at a local mall. The second hot course was a steak, filet is the cut...I think. Topped with a piece of seared foie gras, couple slices of egg plant, and Shitake mushroom. Probably the best course of the evening and one of the very few steak course I've enjoyed as part of tasting menu, definite a rarity. Soup, sushi and dessert were brought up to conclude the omakase menu, all pedestrian, nothing to write home about.  Not only was the food not very interesting, the decoration of the space also seem kind of odd. What's suppose to be a fine dining restaurant, really has a very cheap feel to it. For anyone thinking about trying this place, think again, avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Again this place delivers the food.  The new is the ice cream stuff pastries that are an off menu item. It is a serious crowd pleaser.  Get the tenderloin over the wagu. It is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Had so much fun here the first night of the SHOT show!   We sat down and told the waiter to just keep the best dishes coming. We brought our own wine, they don't have a corkage fee.   We enjoyed sooooo many items including the lobster, the little crab and beef tacos and the beef that catches on fire ;) I don't know the names! :) this was definitely the way to go with ordering.   Ambiance and service is great and the vibe was so fun and \"Vegas.\""}
{"text":"This particular Nobu is not great but also not bad. It doesn't quite compare with the Malibu location but still has a bit of charm for a Vegas sushi joint. Once you arrive, you'll notice the decor is gorgeous and the place is often pretty freaking crowded. The menu is fairly substantial and the cocktails/sake are pretty on point. The food at this particular locations falls a bit short, relatively speaking of course as compared to the other Malibu location. The rolls/sashimi lacked a bit of the wow factor that you've grown to love from a Nobu. I mean the presentation is great, but the taste is just meh...   Pros- Beautiful decor  Nice location (within Caesars Palace) Good cocktails  Nice presentation  Great menu   Cons- Small portions  Pricey  Food lacked the wow factor  Not quite the Malibu Nobu"}
{"text":"Great food. Not life changing, but meets expectations for its price point. I was actually surprised by the portion sizes. The black cod miso and beef tenderloin tobanyaki were larger than I was expecting, they looked smaller in the pictures here on Yelp. Overall enjoyed Nobu."}
{"text":"SO F'ing good!   The sushi is amazing, and the flaked sea salt on the edamame alone makes it worth a trip back!   This is a place you will defintaley see celebs, we sat a few table away from 2/3 of the cast of freaks and geeks!   Skip dessert, it was just eh...save your money and grab another cocktail."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Japanese restaurants which I have eaten at.  I literally could not resist this meal.  The fixed price menu options are delicious, hearty and gourmet.  This place is not cheap but the food, service and ambiance are first class all the way. The sushi, cooked fish and meat and fusion food are original and mouth watering.  If you have too much premium sushi the Nobu Hotel next door is a trip too.  Fun atmosphere and a culinary adventure."}
{"text":"I was in town last weekend and dined at Nobu last Thursday night. The food was spectacular also the service was as well! The mushroom salad was my favorite by far! The beef tenderloin comes smoking hot and was amazing! The drinks were also fabulous! It is super pricey! Fish was fresh and delicious!  We ordered 1 drink a piece, some sake at the end, 2 spicy tuna rolls, 1 beef tenderloin, 1 mushroom salad, 1 shrimp tempura, and 1 scallop ceviche. It ended up being close to $300. It was amazing though!"}
{"text":"My second time dining at nobu and once again it was great. Some of the best sushi in Vegas . The waiter was amazing . He was very knowledgable and recommended some great options. The yellowtail sashimi was great, we had to order 3 servings. The Eel roll was great. We ordered a filet that came out in a covered sizzling skillet and it was cooked to perfection . The manager came and greeted us at the table and brought 3 desserts. The banana ice sorbet was great. I'll be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Perfection. I LOVE sushi and have been to several Nobu restaurants (both New York locations, San Diego, Bahamas, Los Angeles) and this place is my favorite. I've been to this Nobu countless times and always look forward to returning.   The food at any Nobu is consistently out of this world but what makes this location my favorite is the staff. Not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting.   Things to order: - yellowtail jalepeno sashimi - butter lettuce cod - new style toro sashimi - negi toro hand roll  - Kobe sashimi with hot rocks - rock shrimp tempura - soft shell crab special  - artichoke salad (without noodles) - YK35 sake - peach Bellini - Japanese whiskey flight  - coconut-lime sake - bento box  Last time we were in we had Andrew as our server. Super great guy. He gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. I'm going to request to sit in Andrew's section every time I go back.   Of course I wish Nobu wasn't so expensive but I still think it's well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Horrible service along with rude hostesses. Can find better sushi anywhere else on the strip. Yellow tail roll tasted old and stale."}
{"text":"I work at an all you can eat sushi place. I go here when I want the good stuff."}
{"text":"Jeff is by far the best waiter here. He made our first experience very enjoyable and the food is bomb!"}
{"text":"Nobu was on my list of restaurants to visit while in Las Vegas. I'm glad I made a visit!  I'm not a big sushi eater, so I was a bit worried about visiting. But I was told it was a great place for beginner/mild sushi lovers on Yelp and by some other Las Vegas visitors. Evidently, sushi is serious business.  Not to say Nobu isn't- once you see the prices on the menu you will know that they are very serious. The service is on par as well, as our waiter was very knowledgeable and had great suggestions that fit me and my more sushi knowledgeable friend. We had a great meal of 3 entrees- the Rock Shrimp with all three sauces, Salmon tacos, and Toasted Rice Cake. I would definitely recommend to a friend. No, it isn't budget friendly... but seriously, considering the type of restaurant it is and the place it's at, why would you expect it to be? Be prepared to spend some money."}
{"text":"seriously overpriced; no special flavor or creativity at all. Would be nicer if the price was halved"}
{"text":"Ok, this was an exceptional dinner. This is NOT all u can eat. Sit at the sushi bar and watch masters at work. The \"toro\" is $24 a slice and worth it. The shrimp were perfect.   Must try the Kumamoto oysters. We r coming back"}
{"text":"I was resistant to eating at Nobu because they are notorious for being one of the only restaurants that still serves endangered bluefin tuna. So minus one star from the get-go. That being said, I came here for a celebratory work dinner (there is clearly a theme here in my reviews of expensive restaurants) and it was a delicious meal. We had the chef's tasting menu and it was really incredible, although bluefin WAS served, which pained me. Had I known, I would have requested an alternative."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here while I was at a conference.  There were 11 of us and we all had the chef's tasting menu. All the courses were spectacular and while I am not a fan of raw fish... their presentation/flavor combos were superb.  My favorite courses were: - 1st course- palette cleanser - 4th course - filet mignon with lime - 6th course - lava chocolate cake  Would I go here on my own dime...probably not, but still worth trying."}
{"text":"Didnt really like the kobe beef.  i liked the lamb tenderloin better.  the meal was expensive $160 for just me.  The service was great i just expected more from the kobe beef"}
{"text":"I can not wait to go back!! =D Absolutely LOVE this place from the ambiance to the food to the service!!!! Everything was AMAZING!!! Make sure to try the king crab in the ponzu sauce and for dessert get the shaved ice cream (kinda like the korean paht bing soo)!"}
{"text":"Nobu is celebrating more than 5 weeks in Las Vegas!! In Vegas restaurant years, that's like going back to 12,000,000 BC! I've been to Vegas 25-30 times. So, I've easily eaten at 50 different restaurants over the years. And probably closer to 100. Almost every single one of them is gone, even the last one I dined at: the Grand Wok at MGM Grand just four months ago!!  Nobu is an incredible experience for a bon vivant of Japanese cuisine. This is not an AYCE buffet restaurant; don't expect to stuff yourself like a pig at a trough. You'll broach into the world of fine dining here, which is why there's 27 different forks at each place setting. Um, chopsticks, in this case. Understand this, you'll be paying a lot of money, for tiny portions. This is about epicurean presentation and culinary aesthetics, not about seeing how many sashimi slices you can fit in your maw. The delicacies you shall consume were designed and created by a master chef who sat meditating on a mountaintop until a culinary epiphany hit him like a bolt of lightning. Luckily, he survived and came down the mountainside to bring his dream unto the world.   I loved my dining experience here. It was during a solo trip I made to Vegas. Don't think I'd want to bring my young daughter here. She can be a handful at times, and it was nice to be able to just relax, and enjoy myself. And have some great food. I can't wait to come back here. Maybe after I win the lottery! Dining here will set you back a bit, so don't come whining to Yelp about how expensive it is, especially after you just blew your kid's college savings on the Walking Dead slot machines!"}
{"text":"Expensive place to eat sushi. The bill can be up to $500 for two if you order wine. The server is alway provide excellent services. The sushi is fresh and quality is excellent. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit Nobu for a long time. We finally made it!   The sushi was nice and fresh. Good service. Unfortunately we did not have a reservation and the place was packed! So we sat at the bar and ate there. This may have taken some of the positive experience away. But regardless, I was impressed by the freshness of the fish. Beautiful cuts and big variety on their menu.  The only negatives is the price. A little pricey.   Make a reservation if you decide to go."}
{"text":"Food is good.  I like especially the kumomoto oysters.  They have four different sauces all is great!  It's a little outdated though with it's decor and Hard Rock's Hotel crowd is little loud for the clientele at Nobu.  I don't know if they are planning to stay open after they open the one in Ceacars Palace this fall of 2012.  Running into celebrities there is always fun.  Last time we saw Usher!!  Who cares if the food is just good after you sell a kidney just to eat there!  LOL"}
{"text":"Started off with the hamachi appetiser which is delicious. What really stole the show was the black cod with miso which is amazing! Also, their sushi was so delicious. I had salmon and yellowtail rolls. It's not just plain sushi they mix a ridiculously delicious spice in the sushi. The toban yaki mushroom was also excellent. I'm basically going to order every single dish I mentioned here next time I eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Nobu.  Been here twice this year at this particular location.  Yes it's on the pricey side but if you're in LV chances are you're here to celebrate something.  So dress up, splurge on an amazing dinner here and dream of the next time you'll be dinner at a Nobu location in the future."}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious. Yeah, it's pricey but damn, it's totally worth every mouth watering bite. I had the chefs selection ($125) and enjoyed a wide variety of amazing courses of sushi, miso soup, black cod, and (I think) beef tenderloin (8 courses if I remember correctly). If you're looking to indulge and treat yourself to something special, this is the place to do it. Be prepared to sit for a while, however, as it takes time to complete the dinner. I think we finished in a little under 2 hours. This is not a place to jump in, grab something, and zip out."}
{"text":"We planned to have dinner with our friends who live in Vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. After scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on Nobu. Sometimes I have to be in the mood for sushi, I don't always crave it like other people I know, so I was worrying about committing to a reservation. I was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (True story, I made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the Flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for Manischewitz.)  OK - Back to the matter at hand: Nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all Japanese food all the time. Not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, BUT THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I DIE. We had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on.   We dined on:  -edamame -miso soup -tempura fried rock shrimp with some type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce -yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (OUT OF THIS WORLD) -red snapper with dry miso (also, amazing) -salmon new style sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious -soft shell crab roll -spicy tuna roll (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)  The dessert was good but unremarkable. I'm more about the main event.  Cap that with some amazing gin cocktail that I now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals I have had in my little life thus far...   In short, take your gambling winnings to Nobu and order everything the server suggests."}
{"text":"I really love Nobu. I came to this specific location very very late at night (with reservations, of course, but still) and the food was still out of this world!!!! I definitely recommend this place if you're an asian food lover like myself! It's worth the cab ride!"}
{"text":"Sushi is ok, nothing special. Service is great, I'll give that. Had better sushi before."}
{"text":"We were able to get in on a Friday night without a reservation, I was feeling very lucky at this point.  We sat at the sushi bar which was great because we got to see the chefs working their magic. The server asked what price point we were thinking and he then made all of the decisions from there.  His choices made for a very memorable meal.  Outstanding."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to be treated to this amazing restaurant.  Amazing sushi.  Creative and fun and delicious dishes.  Excellent service.  Our party let our server pick our courses for us (with some guidance due to dietary restrictions of a few of our members), and everything was spot on."}
{"text":"this is my second time here and both times i've come with my cousin. as much i love nobu, i only go there with her, since she loves it so much, but i never regret it.   the nice thing is i just let her order, since she knows what's good, but then if i ever go alone, i won't really know what to order. i did have a nice acai cocktail to start the night. it was delicious and refreshing, great way to start the meal.   we ordered the yellowtail with jalapeno which i loved since i love the spice. then we had the seafood spring rolls which weren't on the menu, but since they go there all the time, they knew about it. those were also really good, along with the sashimi salad. loved the dressing and there was so much sashimi! we also had the rock shrimp tempura, which was kinda like popcorn shrimp, but really tasty and some grilled beef thing.   at the end, we ordered the bento box, which was a flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream. everything was really good, but service was a little slow. my other friends were also there and they were a party of 10. they started a little after us but finished before us!! other than that though, it was a great night."}
{"text":"Went in with high expectations, but was deeply disappointed.  Let me preface this review by saying that we went in with a Groupon.  Yes, Nobu is offering a Groupon haha!  For $100 you get their most popular dishes for two, including the hamachi with jalapenos, rock shrimp, miso black cod, plus dessert.    OK, I get that we're Groupon customers, I understand sometimes we get treated like second class citizens, so my expectations were adjusted, but they managed to not even meet my Groupon expectations.  First of all the portions were way too small.  There were only five thin slices of Hamachi to share between two people.  The rock shrimp came out in a nice size bowl, while that's good enough for one person, this is meant for two!  There was also one piece of black cod too to share between two people.  I would say if you do this deal you guys better be very comfortable eating out of the same plate or bowl haha.    I also must say I'm not generally a big fan of fusion cuisine.  Nobu did not change my mind.  These are their most popular dishes, but they feel dated and uninspiring.  Perhaps because they've been around for a while and many other places now carry the same things?  The rock shrimp was slathered in this orange color mayo sauce, which reminded me of the walnut shrimp dish so often served in Chinese restaurants these days.  The cod had a very sweet miso sauce that kind of ruined the natural flavor of the fish itself.    Not good value and not a place I would go into looking for high quality and inventive food."}
{"text":"Food was ok and service was great.  Definitely overpriced.  I am checking off this restaurant from my list of been-there, done-that places.  The bento box for dessert was the only thing memorable."}
{"text":"Amazing service and superb food.   The knowledgeable waiters serve you and explain how it was prepared, what main ingredients it was prepared with, and the best way to enjoy it.   I tried several dishes, everything was delicious, but my favorites were: the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño, toro with truffle, Ankimo monkfish liver topped with caviar, and the black cod lettuce wraps- in that order.   Dinner ended with the most delicious green-tea shaven ice- perfect ending as it was very refreshing.  From this day forward Nobu will be a must-go when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Have faith.  That's all I can say about this place.  Have faith, and trust, that they will KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF!!  Everything was smooth and heaven, even if the portions aren't that big.  Don't worry, the flavors will satisfy you.  Every bite was a small explosion in my mouth.  Every bite made me jizz a little bit in my pants.....and it's only 8 at night!!  Things you have to try: -yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno -toro tartar with caviar -black cod with miso -rock shrimp tempura  and  FISH/LOBSTER TACOS!!!  If you don't see it on the menu, just ask for it.  Trust me, Just Do It!"}
{"text":"Man... A dinner for two and $400 poorer.  I can't justify that price for the experience I had here.  I'll start by saying that I'm the type of person that'll throw down stupid cash for a good meal, and that was not the case at nobu.  Sat at the bar and wanted omakase.  It was my first time here and I didn't feel like filtering through the menu, nor did I know what was worth trying.  Server shot us down and said it was too late- fair enough, but not really cause they sat a couple RIGHT NEXT to us  ten minutes after we were sat who clearly had omakase.  That was rather painful to watch cause they kept getting dishes I was interested in trying.  Both the server and sushi chef were useless in offering up some suggestions, so I just picked a bunch of stuff from the menu ($400 worth of shit).  Nothing stood out. Fish was ok, not any different from what I could get at kabuto or something.  Kept asking sushi chef to make something worth my while, but maybe I had higher expectations than he, cause he did not deliver.   Was trying to experience nobu the way it was intended to be experienced but that didn't end up happening.  I won't be back. Don't believe the hype. Sushi samba is 10x better."}
{"text":"Luv chef nobu..my go to sushi place in las vegas..u cant go wrong..sashimi and sake and beautiful women"}
{"text":"Nobu is one of my favorite restaurants to visit. It never disappoints.   The two times that I have eaten at Nobu we told the waiter our likes and dislikes and budget, and he chooses the dishes that come out and the order in which they come.   Honestly, I don't remember everything we ate; all I know is that they were all delicious. Nothing disappointed.   The service is fantastic- helpful staff all around. Polite and warm, they help make the experience better.   Lastly, the atmosphere is great. Upscale without being stuffy.   Make a reservation, save your money, and go to Nobu. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This location was truly underwhelming. The price is so high, the quality is average and the service, pretentious. The menu has so many choices, it makes it VERY HARD to order and then you hope what you ordered is the right size fr the party size. The service is severely lacking, for these prices, I would expect the servers to smile, maybe even levitate.  Plenty of other sushi joints with just as good quality in Vegas. Mr Nobu would be rolling over in his grave, if he was actually dead, which he is not."}
{"text":"Probably around my tenth return visit here over the years, and I'm afraid I have become a creature of habit of my favorite dishes.  Shisito peppers flash fried perfectly, and in season!  Rock shrimp tempura with the ponzu sauce.  Sable fish (Buddy Holly wasn't much of a waiter, he may have been new, as I had to explain that what they call black cod is not the right term).  The dai ginjo sake (no more bamboo for awhile now)  Ahi tuna sashimi appetizer with the amazing sauce and fruit  Perfect, so why short a star?  Service was rushed (to be fair we were  late), and when I called to rconfirm the reservation, I asked them to put a bottle of Veuve on ice for us, couldn't do it without an email and seemed like a hassle.  Really? For a cheap bottle of champ to be put on if, you need a deposit?  Strange, no big deal, and was amazing food as always"}
{"text":"This new location is absolutely fantastic.  The one at hard rock is still there but it was always less impressive than the one in NYC.  This new location is in caesers palace and it is as good as the NYC one.  I had 3 orders of new style sashimi it was heavenly.  Melted in my mouth!  So much better than most ordinary sashimi.    Umami sea bass was ok.  It was good but not something I would seek out at Nobu.  The black cod miso was the absolute highlight of my dinner.  The meat just pealed off layer by layer...it had a great sweet and salty balance..and it melted in my mouth.  I only wished I ordered one less new style sashimi so I can order another one."}
{"text":"Finally crossed Nobu restaurant off my bucket list! I came in here on July 5th 8:30 pm. Not really a wait but I made a reservation beforehand. Let me tell you, the service and food was phenomenal! My girlfriend and I were going to order by a la carte but our server recommended the omakase because it was personalized to our taste. It was pretty pricey at $125, but the quality and the surprise of the food really made it worth it! Definitely will be a regular here anytime I stay in Caesars"}
{"text":"Good sushi, not great (at least when we went). What really impressed me were the appetizers (especially the lettuce wraps)."}
{"text":"I loved Nobu, however while the food was delicious the service was lacking. It took around 15 minutes for a server to approach our table and provide us with drink menus. And then another 15 for food. Needless to say we were very hungry. The food however was worth every penny, the sashimi salad, scallop chips, rock shrimp and creamy crab were definitely my favourite. I also had probably the best miso soup I've ever tasted. Every dish was very fresh. I would definitely go back for the food"}
{"text":"When Nobu opened in New York City, it created a sensation.  Reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional Japanese food was widely praised.  This led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; Nobu can be found all over the globe.  Meal #1: I found Las Vegas Nobu's sushi highly variable.  The overall quality was OK, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  Orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.   Meal #2:  Since my first meal, I went to Nobu in Miami Beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  I enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the Vegas location another shot.  The restaurant looks OK, but nothing great.  It's very noisy, in keeping with the Hard Rock atmosphere.  The crowd is mostly young, but I think anyone would feel comfortable here; I did.  Service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.  Now, on to the meal:      * I chose Jyunmai Daiginjyo sake.  It wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.     * Small Japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  Good.     * Trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  All served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  Good.     * Seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, with garlic chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  A good combination.  Very good.     * Uni (sea urchin) and some white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  The uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  There was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  Very good.     * O toro and a spring roll with Jalapeno sauce and radish.  The o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  Good to very good.     * Palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.     * Service lapse.  Up to this point, courses had been timed well.  At this point, I waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  This was a little annoying.     * Grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  Very good.     * Foie gras and Kobe beef.  A large hunk of foie gras; good flavor.  Kobe beef very good.  Overall, very good to excellent.     * Service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by miso soup.  They reversed the order, and apologized later.  A minor matter.     * Miso soup.  Better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  Very good.     * Sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), shima aji (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  Very good.     * Fruit papillote.  Like a crepe.  The raspberry seeds were very distracting.  Fair.     * Honey ice cream.  Very strong honey flavor.  Strange, but I liked it.  Very good.  Overall, the meal was good, but not as good as Nobu in Miami, and not nearly as good as Okada.  At the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.   Meal #3: Based on past meals, I hadn't planned to return. However, I found myself at The Hard Rock Hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. I decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. This worked out better. My selections:      * Ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). Standard but still very good.     * Hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar). This is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. It may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. I was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. If you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at Okada.     * Live shrimp. These Santa Barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so I guess that means they're fresh. They were big and rather chewy; I'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. The heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.     * Live octopus. I'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. Pretty good.  This was the most satisfying of my meals at Nobu. Nothing was stellar, but everything was good.    Nobu's strength is its new take on Japanese foods.  Its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in Las Vegas, and suspect service.  Given such high prices, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Never tried the Nobu in NYC and I figured let me try the one in Vegas since I was on vacation. Nice decor but you can see the casino floor .No privacy which I didn't like. Went with my girls and we ordered drinks which took forever to arrive. I was already annoyed by that. We split a few dishes and can't really remember them,which dosent say much about their food. Very overpriced and overrated. After a big bill and bad stomaches the rest of our night was ruined. Not a good memory and won't go to the one in NYC ."}
{"text":"You absolutely must get the Black Cod. Oh my goodness, any explanation will simply not do it justice! I would come back and only order that. Otherwise, this place is way too overpriced for most of what is on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was amazing, chef was awesome. Everything was on point. Special shout to  miss Brooke, she was on point in our service this evening and a special tha ks to the manager Kenny who took a bit of his busy time to meet with me so i could tell him of my wonderful evening here. Will be back"}
{"text":"The food was excellent can't expect anything less from nobu but the price was quite high black cod costed $49 just for the fillet seemed about $10 to high but it was really good"}
{"text":"Dining out in Vegas often means an \"experience\".  And Nobu, at the Hard Rock Casino, is just that ... a true dining experience. We ended up here when our Sushi-place-of-choice was no longer in business. We really didn't know what to expect, but this dining experience is very different from the \"norm\". There was no menu, so our \"waiter\" (seems like a very inadequate title for him) spent a few minutes asking probing questions about our food likes and dislikes at the table in order to build a customized food experience for us. We were a little uneasy when he said, \"we're a bit different here, but trust me, we'll create a meal that will thoroughly please you\".   Well, he was entirely right. Various Sashimi and other Oriental-style dishes were brought out one at a time, \"family style\" for us to enjoy.  The choices were spot on and the flavors were absolutely amazing.  Each plate seemed to raise the bar over the last dish. Even though we were completely satisfied with everything they served to us, we never quite felt like we over ate.   The meal was complimented by a more-than-adequate saki, wine, and beer menu, including a \"craft beer\" from Japan (who knew?). We walked away talking endlessly about the total dining journey that we had just enjoyed. We would highly recommend that you consider trying this experience.  It is not cheap, but it's well worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Nobu never disappoints!  The only thing keeping it from a 5 star is the excessive prices.  I'm all for paying for good food and experiences, but their prices take it to the next level.  The food was delicious and fresh.  We did the tasting menu which came with some sushi dishes, some hot fish dishes,  and a red meat dish.  I highly recommend the tasting menu because you get to try a lot of different items on the menu.  However, it will cost you an arm and a leg!  The service is excellent.  You usually have about 3-4 different people working your table which means that they never leave you wanting anything for long."}
{"text":"Omg I can't say enough about how good the food is. The black cod melts in your mouth!! I can't wait to go back In August, all of the fish is so fresh as well. Best sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been waiting quite a long time to eat a Nobu, and I finally had the experience last week.  Luckily, I have been in Vegas for work, so have had the opportunity to try some great restaurants.  So far, Nobu may have been the most expensive, but also the most delicious!  We opted to let the server make the menu for us and gave him a price point.  We went with about $100 - $125 per person, and we were all blown away.  I don't know what most of the dishes were called because we let the waiter pick.  However, I will describe the hightlights.  1) Favorite dish was the Miso Cod.  I'm not sure what Chef Nobu does to make it better than all of the other Cod dished I have had, but it was amazing.  This dish just melted on my mouth.  2) There was a raw whitefish with some chili powder flavor on it.  It was what we started with and was delicious  3) Seared Salmon Belly was also awesome.  It was tender and the sauce it was paired with was great  4) Dessert was a shave ice bowl with green beens, mochi, and other flavors.  It was a bit sweet, but also really good.  The only thing that I was not crazy about was the sushi selection.  There were 2 rolls that came, that I did not particularly enjoy.  The lobster roll was nothing fancy, and the nobu roll was a bit too \"fishy' of a taste.  The Tuna sushi was really good, as was the seared salmon sushi.    Overall, a great meal with great service.  The price was a little much, and for me I felt it was a little excessive.  Definitely a 5 star evening."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  We ordered the $125 omakase. So so good and totally worth the money. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This was one of the best experiences I have had in fine dining.   Great food: Spicy MIso Chips with Big Eye Tuna was awesome. The presentation and the taste was excellent. The Jidori Free Range Chicken and the Tenderloin of Beef were succulent and tasy. Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head as well as the Yellowtail and Jalapenos were delicious.  Our server was hospitable and accommodating. He made us feel so comfortable throughout our dining experience.   I really recommend this place for any special occasion or just a splurge for dinner."}
{"text":"Best service ever for me. Last night in Vegas and decided to order Teppan Yaki. They made an exceptional effort to accommodate my request even tho I'm the only one in the whole Restaurant ordering Teppan Yaki at the time! Makes me feel like the King ! Everything was perfection! Fresh sea bass , Nigerian shrimp, Wagyu steak , etc! Best meal I've ever had. The attendant was very thoughtful and spent a lot of time explaining the process of cooking and ingredients. The XO soup was incredibly fresh and crisp ! Nobu deserve a Michelin Star on their own right! They did justice to the ultimate Japanese culinary skills! Wonderfully surprised in every dish! Thank you Nobu Caesar Palace in making me feel like the King of Teppan Yaki for the night!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have eaten at many of the now 22 Nobu around the globe. There are great fun restaurants.  The waiters are generally very good and our last trip to Vegas landed us with a great waiter.  I think his name was Chris but his sister also worked for the company and he was very knowledgeable and entertaining with the food selections.  Spicy popcorn shrimp are not to be missed!  Anyway, I almost always enjoy this place and struggle to break out of this \"rut\" and go someplace else in a city like Vegas.  We just have so little alone time (without our kids) that a sure thing like Nobu is just that a \"sure thing\".  Very hip, great food, great drinks (our waiter made me a special martini with infused serano peppers in it, fantastic).  Thanks Nobu!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I do believe Austin has way better sushi then this place. Not to mention double the cost here. I'd rather wait to have better sushi at home and spend half the cost. Glad I had the experience to try it out for myself though."}
{"text":"I had the best dinner of my life at Nobu. I had never experienced a dining service like this before and I was moved by each course that came out. Not only was the staff exceptional but the chef catered to my pregnant food restrictions and that really added to the wow factor. We started off with the Shishito peppers and our server explained that good luck falls upon the person who bites into a hot one as most of them are mild in comparison. That was when I knew that this dining experience was different. I dined with my mother in law and fiancé and this starter really opened up our conversation; we laughed and joked and felt lucky at the start of our meal and unlike most dinners, hunching over a plate and ignoring each other, we shared a plate and opened up. Next, we had the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño and my fiancé described it as the best sashimi he has ever had, truly melt in your mouth. The chef also prepared bamboo shoots for me done in the style of a sashimi plate with excellent flavor and texture and made me feel included in the experience (my fiancé and mother in law ate some of my bamboo shoots too!) Then came the salmon sashimi for them and the fritters with wasabi aioli for me, presentation as beautiful as ever. The taste excelling on every level with crunchy and creamy to tender and rich. The hits kept coming with the mini tacos. These were not your average tacos! Filled with wagyu beef, lobster and king crab, each taco was a two bite masterpiece. A zest of lime over each taco added a bit of zest to the richness of flavor in an amazing way. The rock shrimp tempura came out and dazzled all 3 of us. The shrimp tossed in a creamy, spicy sauce complemented the tempura crunch so well, we considered it addictive. We enjoyed squid pasta and I had never had squid so delicate and delicious. We were taught the story behind this dish and the presentation was truly phenomenal. The beef tenderloin was probably one of my favorites. We each had our own, cooked to the appropriate temperature (a bit more medium well for me, still considering my pregnancy throughout the meal) and again, melt in your mouth flavor. We finished up with the black cod with miso which I can understand now is one of their most famous dishes as the fish was expertly prepared and the miso flavor complemented the richness so well. Lastly my fiancé and mother in law indulged in a full plate of sushi in many varieties and the chef sent out vegetable sushi for me so as to feel included again and it was absolutely delicious and thoughtful. Throughout the dinner we enjoyed education on the dishes and conversation amongst each other. It was an incredible experience that ended with the bento box dessert with a cantaloupe sorbet that my fiancé and I still rave about today. We can't wait to go back after I have the baby! Thank you so much, Nobu. Thank you, John Laverde for a fantastic dining experience, it was truly magical and unforgettable."}
{"text":"good but not amazing. black cod was the best dish during the omakase course. meal was about $300 which is over priced"}
{"text":"My wife and I got the omakase menu to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. It was an 8 course meal. It started with 4 cold raw sushi dishes, 2 hot dishes, miso soup, and a dessert.   Ok, here was my one gripe with the omakase menu, we were served mackerel for our first dish. It was fishy and tasted the way it smelled. Some may like it, but I wasn't a fan. All the other sushi dishes are delicious. For the hot dishes, I wasn't impressed at all with their black cod or the meat dish. It was just too sweet and tasted caramelized. I kind of wished that they just served sushi for the rest of the dishes.     For what we ate, I think it was over-priced. I've had much better omakase at a better price. If you want to impress a date, take them here. If you want the same tasting sushi at a lower price, go somewhere else. Not sure why they have such high reviews. I guess when you're paying so much money, you convince yourself that the meal was just that good."}
{"text":"I had sushi and sashimi that I never knew existed here.  Thank God the server knew what to recommend because by reading the menu, as a Nobu neophyte I had no idea what was good.  Yeah, I ended up dropping over $100 per person but I knew it was going to be expensive anyways so come with a fat wallet if you want to eat here.  I remember the Black Cod melting in my mouth and the exotic trout which shocked my tongue in a good way.  The Kobe beef was heavenly...  Just thinking about this meal has me wondering when I'll be in Vegas again.  Just don't order the regular sushi though, I heard it's good but it's probably something you can get at any decent sushi joint that you live near.  You have to get the \"special\" menu items."}
{"text":"nobu was a woodsy haven inside the loud and blaring music of the hard rock hotel.  but this was vegas so it was bustlin' and movin'.  the list of sake was impressive with lots of varied ways of preparation. on a plate, in a bamboo container, cold or hot.  sure sure sure, the toro and hamachi were bloody amazing.  soft and silky cuts that just melted in your mouth.  but the showstopper was the truffled and bread crumbed lobster special. a beautiful blend of hot butter and bread crumbs which added a lovely texture to the smooth and sinful lobster. and at 100$ a pop, it was worth every bite.     besides it was much better to eat and drink my money than losing it at the black jack tables."}
{"text":"Omakase!! I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night  I got a seat at the sushi bar.  A great way to see the action up front and personal.   I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice) 13 cold dishes 3 hot dishes Desserts  Here's the rundown: Cold dishes: Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeño Sauce - a great way to start things off.   Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness.   Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!  Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)  Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good.   Hot dishes.  Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!  Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!  Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal.   Dessert: Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it.   Service was SUPERB! From start to finish, I was pampered.   For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be.   My Rating: 5 Star Plus!!  Try it for yourself and decide."}
{"text":"Nobu is a must eat at. Yellowtail is like heaven in my mouth. Took some friends here and everyone LOVED it.  Had a sample of just about everything on the menu by the time we were done. Will easily return to any location whenever I'm around one."}
{"text":"I ate here for a business dinner and sat at one of the tables but ordered omakase from the sushi bar.  My colleagues and I went big and went with $150 a person so we had high expectations...  I will try my best to remember everything that came out...(not in order)  The first dish was a salmon trout sahimi with ikura eggs inside.  The fish had some chewy veins in it, and there wasn't any type of sauce on it - I guess we were supposed to enjoy the 2 components together.  There was a dish of fatty tuna (otoro) on top of a rock salt.  This was unique and the fish was melty  there was a miso soup type dish that came out that used delicious dashi broth - anyone who understands umami would've enjoyed this  kobe beef with special mayo sauce was good, but nothing spectacular  scallops in a green guacamole sauce was edible, but the balance wasn't completely there  kanpachi with ponzu sauce and jalapeno was good too but trendy  in the end, a full platter of sushi came with the trademark \"Nobu\" mark on the egg sushi - this was perhaps the most dissapointing.  The fish tasted bland, the rice was somewhat hardened like it was sitting out for a while, and I really would've liked to end the night on a high note but this last platter of mediocre sushi ended the night on a low note  and the bill at the end was not a pretty sight...  I probably will not go back to Nobu again unless it's free.  I was just expecting so much more because of all the hype.    however on the plus side the service is excellent - the servers are all very attentive.  and the atmosphere, being inside the Hard Rock Hotel, is hip and lively."}
{"text":"So my co-worker & I thought we were invited to a company dinner at AJs Steakhouse but were discretely booted from the party since there were too many accounts to entertain.  My co-worker, we'll call her Shirley, put her betting face on and said to herself, \"Ok, we'll see your AJs and raise you a Nobu\" and off we went to plan B.  We arrived at Nobu during a bustling dinner hour but were promptly seated at a table sans reservations, btw, Shirley was looking hot as was our server whom we advised to surprise us with the sushi and to keep it coming.  I can't even tell you what we had since a lot of it wasn't on the menu, but most of it revolved around a spicy tuna or halibut creation of some sort since we told him that that was what we really liked fish-wise.  And the dishes we got were divinely yummy!  Now I don't know if Vegas is a good place to judge attention of service when you're dressed for the town in heels that can double as a weapon, but I've always had exceptional service at the 2 Nobus I've been to (try the Nobu at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong if you get the chance) and the sushi & sashimi has always been creatively presented and fresh.  Now the story ends with Shirley and I winning our heady bet by our check averages per person, but it was worth every shot of sake for the trouble we got it in back at the office ; )"}
{"text":"Obviously, the sushi is good, but the atmosphere is blah.  You can get great sushi at many other places that are less expensive and with better vibes.  Here, you're paying for the name."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm vegetarian, and was hopelessly looking at the menu, and the waiter offered to see what the chef could prepare for me. We decided to both do the 5, or was it 6 course meal? And my goodness, it was amazing! Everything melted in my mouth, I remember we couldn't finish the last two courses and went straight to dessert. I am not a big fan of fishy sushi seaweed, and one of the dishes brought was some kind of cucumber roll, which I have tried at other places, and spit it back out. I'm so picky. But this, was so good, I couldn't believe it!! I can't wait to try this place out again."}
{"text":"ambience = simpler then expected especially all the hype service = impressive timing with amout of food order food = Peurivan spin on Japanese food, i'm not really familiar with Peurivan food but didn't feel it was worth the attention.  Definitely wasn't bad, just not great price = $$$$$ crowd = ranges from couples, mature gathering, as well as gentleman with fee for service friends personal favorite = black cod, and scallop worst thing = quanitiy meal for two = $250"}
{"text":"we had a live bug crawling  in our food!!! So we went there last night with reservation as they get great review. plus we love sushi. The servers are beautiful and attentive. The atmosphere  high end...over priced but we expected that with this kind of place.we r celebrating my birthday with my husband so wants some place nice. the appetizer  is delicious. the rolls are so so... nothing special. so at the end of meal we decided to order a mixed seafood ceviche.the taste is great but as we were halfway through the food.... a bug fell off his fork and crawled in the plate!!!!!my husband tried to grab it with the  napkin. We were grossed out and spit our food. We showed the waitress and she right away took our food out and tried to hush me with my hysterics. After awhile, I think it's the manager who came out and apologize. But the best she did was not charge us for our 2 drinks and the ceviche! They still expected us to pay for the rest of our meal!. We did pay, but did not leave a tip. This made us feel that they think we r just trying to scam out of the meal.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good...but cleanliness and client satisfaction is not their priority. Never to go back there again."}
{"text":"Simply the finest sushi restaurant around.  Troy was our waiter and was awesome. Gotta try the sushi tacos!"}
{"text":"The sushi and seafood here are just spectacular. I am especially a fan of the yellowtail and jalapeno sashimi, the miso black cod, and the rainbow roll. The only disadvantage is that this location isn't right on the strip, and it can take awhile to taxi to/from during high traffic times. But the food is delicious enough to warrant a trip over!"}
{"text":"wow.  what a treat.  I went here last minute and was able to get seated even last minute to an awesome table.  I had some sushi (very fresh)  Then I was fortunate to be able to share in the baked lobster, chicken and the shrimp dish (best shrimp dish ever)  I would go back here in a heart beat.  I found the service to be impeccable, the menu extensive, yet not 20 pages.  HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Nobu is simply a fantastic restaurant! My family of 5 got the Groupon for couples for food tasting. It's a 5 course meal where they start you off with appetizers, entrees , then dessert. The appetizers given to us (Edemame and peppers) were alright. Nothing special, as you can get them from any restaurant or store. However, what really impressed me greatly at Nobu was the Yellow Fin Tuna Sashimi! I love sashimi, and eat it all the time. However, after eating this, it simply couldn't compare to any sashimi I've had anywheres. The servers were kind enough to recommend us that we don't use Ginger and Wasabi, for this could ruin the taste that the chef wanted in the first palace. I was glad I didn't use ginger/wasabi for this sashimi, since it was simply so tasteful and great! Afterwards, they served us Black Cod and rock shrimp which were great, but nothing crazy. I was sort of disappointed in the last entree they served us, a plate of sushi. It was simply slices of Tuna and Salmon on balls of rice. Nothing special. They also served spicy tuna roll and California roll on the entree. These sushis were simple, nothing great or special. It seemed that Nobu really lacked in that dish. It was just.. Plain. Couldn't Nobu do better than serve a dish that any sushi restaurant could make?   To conclude, service was amazing ! Great and honest staff. The feel and ambience was good and quiet. The lighting was good as well.   I would highly recommend this restaurant, especially the yellow fin tuna sashimi!"}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Creativity/Authenticity: 3.5 Atmosphere: 3 Service: 5 Bang for your buck: 2  I love caesars palace and I love my friends and Host for once again hooking it up with reservations and free food!! got the chef tasting menu got bombarded with an array of yellowtail, salmon, snapper, halibut sashimi with a salt brick. Than came the wagyu beef cooked over a hot rock with a sake demi glaze. By this time we were on our second bottle of black label sake and with all the sashimi and condiments and vegan dishes we were stuffed, overall this place never fails, matter fact it always gets better! Def be back matter fact next week thanks nobu never let me down"}
{"text":"First time to here, definitely an amazing experience! Our server Juan adked us if we would lile him to choose the courses and we opted in. We can explain the just how good everything was. We even spoke to the manager John are sincere gratitude, he was very polite and gave us suggestions to visit while in Las Vegas. One of the most memorable exsperiances of our visit!"}
{"text":"This review is for a poor access to this already remote restaurant. Unless you stay at the hotel, consider other dinning choices near the strip.  After a pretty good dinning experience, we took Lyft/Uber back to our hotel, the Wynn. The restaurants drop-off for ride sharing is a far far walk, in hot and dingy spot. This shows poor understanding of your guests preferences and forcing upon us your personal preference: rude, expensive and dirty taxis.  So avoid until there is a better way if getting back to the strip."}
{"text":"We wantd to avoid Nobu on a trip to Vegas last week because how good could a Vegas version of what used to be a special place in NYC have truly good food. But this one does. It's Vegasy, sure, but it's far less annoying than other restaurants in that town, and my friend and I had an ubertasty dinner and fantastic memorable evening. Try everything. It's expensive, but compared to its other expensive competitors it's the place to keep returning to, even if you think it won't be."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I go here every chance we get. We love the yellow tail, rock shrimp tempura, white fish new style, and seafood salad. Everything is so tasty. It's not exactly cheap, but we always go away satisfied."}
{"text":"If you understand and know Peruvian cuisine than you will more than likely appreciate the magic of Nobu.    Chef Nobu has merged Japanese cuisine with Peruvian (and some Argentinian) styles of both preparing and cooking.    My husband and I love Peruvian and Japanese - so together this place is a dream.    The service was impeccable, prompt and delightful.    Some things off the menu were very good and some were very bad.   The good: the mixed seafood.  Similar to Peruvian Ceviche.  Plentiful, too.  The Spicy seafood soup.  Nice and hot and full of forever garlic.  Perfect for a cold night.    The bad: We let our server convince us to try the Cod.  We should have known better.  It was not good.    We were in a hurry to catch Absinthe and I was not finished with my wine.  Our server gave me my wine in a Casino glass and we were on our way.    My only complaint is they did not have Japanese sparkling wine.  This is a huge fail IMHO.  Our server did explain that they were working on changing that little mishap since so many people were asking for it... Yup.  So 4 stars until then.    Kanpai!   ?????????"}
{"text":"This place was not as good as I expected. But nevertheless I was excited to eat at one of the kradashians favorites. The salmon was weirdly mashed and not very fresh in the hand roll, but the wagyu gyoza and everything else was good. The rolls were pretty decently priced."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the food here!  Excellent sashimi!  Service is wonderful!!  Pricey, bit worth it!"}
{"text":"Negative stars, our sushi had hair in it, when we told our waitress, she apologized and said \" non of our sushi chefs have hair\" really!!? As if she wanted to blame me for throwing hair in the food.  Bland, bland, bland, not worth any price. Cheap quality, no seasoning, horrible service. Worse birthday ever!!"}
{"text":"Honey, you need no boo at Nobu... as you will fall in love with the food and experience! I had a girls night with my mom before seeing Rod Stewart (he was adorable) and we had no clue what to get! Our wonderful waiter gave great advice and now I shall share it with you. We started with the yellowtail and jalapeño sashimi appetizer. It was \"like buttah\"! A mild taste with appropriate sweetness, savory and 'kickiness' (I'm inventing words today). We then had the crispy rice with tuna... we would have had five more orders if we weren't pretending to hang with the Jones peeps. Next we had the crab tacos. Save your money here... two bites of deliciousness, but I wanted about four. Then it happened... the miso black cod came to the table. I managed my foodgasm moaning sounds so as to not get my mother and I kicked out of the restaurant. We succeeded, but it was hard. The fish was tender with a crispy skin. The combination of miso and saki worked magically together. This signature recipe is online! But apparently you need a brick oven to make it... off to buy bricks I go! Not really... I'll just come back again. We closed with the crab tempura. While it was delicious, I won't get it again. How could anything compare to the miso cod?! I left with a happy, full belly and will definitely be back. Now to work those extra shifts I need to afford this meal! But totally worth it! Thanks Nobu! Ps. Let the waitstaff know if you are seeing a show so they can speed up your order... but go with enough time to spare so you can enjoy a drawn out foodie experience and the company you came with."}
{"text":"Suggest you go for the tasting menu! Too many good choices, let them take care of your selection, you won't be disappointed. A must try..Yellowtail Sashimi w/jalepeno for starters! Do not skip out on the dessert. Excellent service, can't say enough..except can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fresh and good sunomono.  However, something was definitely missing.  I agree with the reviewer Dan.  I think it's great fish but poorly prepared.  I'm not one to complain about price either but honestly after spending $600 on dinner for 3 people...I left feeling a bit unsatisfied.  Like something was missing.   I'm hoping it was just an off night  for them because I want to really enjoy this place since I stay at the Hard Rock often and it's convenient."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty sushi!!! I was rather impressed with the quality of the food and the interesting tropical environment. The prices will get to you, but the sushi is incredibly satisfying. Only thing that got to me was, that i learned the head chef was french. Not that I have anything against the french, but i came to a japaneses restaurant for a reason. Anyhow, YES, go here if you have the chance and some extra $. plan to spend 50-75$/person."}
{"text":"Nobu @ Hard Rock is a really trendy, cool place to bring a date. Relaxed but upscale Atmosphere and ambiance seems to drive a predominantly hip 30-something crowd.   We got the 7-course omakase. Tasting menu offers a variety of chef selections that give you a broad experience of the menu. Highlights:  various nigiri, black cod miso, snapper carpaccio. Best:  Wagyu steak. The other few courses were meh. Not worth mentioning.   Courses were rather small, especially if you are sharing. Half way through, I knew I would not be completely satisfied, so I ordered a few more items off the menu as fillers. Waiter recommended some sushi rolls. These rolls were \"un-inspired\" (to be very nice). To be honest, they were subpar for a place like this. I have way better rolls at all you can eat places. @ $25/roll, they should live up to the price.   Very good service overall, but its very odd that they seem to not want to show you a menu. They would rather recommend things to you. It took several requests to actually get a menu. I see why. Their prices are crazy sky high for the quality. Examples: Min $6-15/piece nigiri. $25/sushi roll.  We've been to Kabuto -  Nobu is no Kabuto in terms of quality and don't rate these prices.   We've had a few truly memorable meals in vegas more than $300/couple. Guy Savoy, Alize, SW Steak, Kabuto.  This was probably least memorable."}
{"text":"The experience here was one I will never forget! Our waiter and his team were all amazing! He suggested that we let him bring courses out for us so that we would enjoy the experience more...and boy did we! Starting with the best yellow tail appetizer so simple and fresh just melts in your mouth, then some yummy fried shrimp, followed by the best I think ahi with shaved truffle omg I couldn't stop eating them... then crab which was awesome we just ate the crab like kings! Last but definitely not least was the A5 wagyu we all tried to just devour! don't even eat the sauce they give you when you're eating a cow like that! Our waiter even had the kitchen do a special birthday dessert with perfect hand written suprise message for her! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi experience I've ever had. Having dined at previous locations in New York, San Diego and the Bahamas, the customer service single handedly provided by (who we found out later to be the General Manager) Bryan Shinohara was above and beyond our expectations and previous experiences. As two twenty two year olds (yes we're young but we're second generation fine dining foodies), my best friend and I were craving the best sashimi Sin City had to offer and after a Nobu siting we had decided there was no where else to go but here.   Each staff member we had been in contact in were of the upmost respectful and delightful waitstaff in town. Offering personal recommendations tailored to our tastes and the extra insights from the GM Bryan himself truly made our experience. By taking the time to understand our taste and cravings they were able to custom make the ideal menu for us.   Must try all of their sashimi, seriously, do it! And don't forget my new favorite: the black cod lettuce wraps, an off the menu item specifically recommended to us by Bryan. The perfect way to end a delightful dinner.   Beautiful ambiance. Exquisite sushi. Superb staff. This will definitely be added to my \"Las Vegas Must Do's\" alongside the likes of Cirque and Olives and continue to be one of my favorite chains of all time...'til then I hope my San Diego location will offer an experience comparable to that of Caesar's."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Vegas - maybe anywhere! I always make a point to visit when I am in town.  Best dishes - rock shrimp (they should call it crack shrimp SO good) Yellowtail and jalapeno roll Toban-Yaki beef (sizzling perfection) Black Cod - absolutely melts in your mouth  amazing service, perfect ambience. It doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Always been a big fan of this restaurant brand. Unfortunately they have lost my trust and at this point going forward my business.   We had a business dinner at 8pm with plans at 10pm the same evening. They sat us 30 minutes late, service wasn't great, not even a \"we're sorry for the issue\"  The food timing was so poor we missed our event, it was a chicken dish that made this happen that took forever. When we passed it along it went through our servers ears and out the other.  Passed along our concerns when departing with a manager. His response, \"thanks for the feedback\" didn't offer to make anything right.  Next night while passing through the hotel, spoke with the GM. Also clueless, he said \"sorry you missed your event, we messed up. We should have bought you a round. If you would like a drink let me know.   Nope. You guys ruined our night. After the last number of years joining you, we won't be back. His response \"we have lots of fans, I'm sure they will take your seats\""}
{"text":"Seriously - best food I have EVER HAD - and I have had a LOT of great food. Every course was perfectly balanced and the overall combination was out of this world. Word of advice - if you are going to do it just go for the full Monty chefs tasting menu and don't look back. Leave yourself at least 2 hrs to savor all the flavors. We had to dash out before dessert to make our 9pm show. Still a meal I will rave about for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Based on its reputation, I had high hopes of a phenomenal dining experience.  What I received was mediocre-to-good food delivered through horrible service.  A genuinely disappointing dinner.  The dishes showcased an exotic selection of fish.  However, the portions were exeptionally small.  And while I truly appreciate the fine-dining approach of quality over quantity, I feel that I shouldn't leave a $200 omakase meal feeling genuinely hungry.  The dishes themselves ranged in quality, but nothing was truly memorable - a shame for a place as esteemed as Nobu.  Service-wise, my impression was that our waiter was anxious to get off work and we inconvenienced him by trying to enjoy our meal.  He waiter made a point of repeatedly recommending items that \"came to the table quickly\".  His disappointment was evident when we ordered the long omakase menu and he said \"are you sure - that meal typically takes 2-hours?\".  His poor attitude continued throughout the night as he tossed the dishes on the table without explanation, served our paired flights well after the dishes were presented, and cleared our plates before we had finished chewinng."}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere that you can brag about to your clueless friends back home, feel free to go to Nobu.    We got the chef's special menu, which was a sampling of their most popular dishes, and it was well over $100 a head.  I had to stop at In-N-Out on the way home because I was still starving.    None of the food was bad, it was just tiny and costs about 5 times what it should have.    I take back my first sentence.  If you want to go somewhere to brag about, skip Nobu and head to Tao.  At least I was full after that over-priced meal."}
{"text":"Made reservation for this location on labor day weekend, decided to call back to confirm my reservation, the host told me I never made it. Horrible."}
{"text":"Nobu in Vegas . It is one of my favorite restaurant . I can not go wrong with the choice"}
{"text":"Whatever god you believe in, thank them for the creation of Nobu, because dear lord it is by far and away The BEST SUSHI I've ever laid my taste buds on! It may also happen to be the most expensive sushi on the planet, but it if you love sushi, it is worth every penny!   I would be willing to bet that just about anything on the menu is nothing short of amazing, but my favorites included the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, garnished with cilantro (which they also offer as a roll) and the Spicy Scallop Roll. Now one of the cool things about Nobu is that not only do they know how to do sushi, but they have perfected a number of imported Kobe/Wagyu beef dishes as well. My favorite was the Wagyu Beef Tataki, which is thinly sliced (similar to sashimi), perfectly marbled, lightly seared beef that requires little to no chewing...I'm telling you, it literally melts in your mouth! My drink of choice was a very refreshing Pineapple Martini, which was the perfect balance to the spice of much of our food selections--if you like a sweet drink, I highly recommend it!  The atmosphere is what I would call \"high class-zen\" with river rocks, bamboo and ambient lighting abound...and it's even more hip and beautiful at night! Vegas has a ton of great restaurants, but if you find yourself with a sushi craving in Sin City, do yourself a favor and rush on over to Nobu...and if your mouth doesn't water over raw fish, head over anyway...it's sure to be one of your best dining experiences in the city!"}
{"text":"Expensive but definitely an experience I'll remember. The scallop roll was amazing and so was nearly every dish we tried. The waitress who served us was exceptional - she was attentive, provided great recommendations, and pre-emptively helped us with a lot of the questions we had. Amazing service."}
{"text":"Having never had the opportunity to try Nobu in Malibu, I was very excited to dine at this restaurant at their Las Vegas location. Tucked magnificently inside Caesar's Palace, this restaurant provided an amazing and unforgettable experience from every spectrum.  Jonathan was our waiter for the night and he took care of our group in every way possible. We were here for a work conference and we had a moderate budget to work with. He was more than understanding and made sure that having a budget would not take away from our experience at the restaurant. He was right!!  Dishes at Nobu are served family style. Jonathan constructed an 8 course menu for us and every dish he brought out provided an unparalleled experience to our taste buds! My favorite dish of the night must have been either the Black Cod in Miso (his most famous dish) or the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu sauce.   The kicker was that Chef Nobu was at the restaurant! In my brief moment of meeting him, I would describe him as humble, down-to-earth and genuine. I know I don't know him at all beyond that point but first impressions can be very telling.  If you are new to sushi, be open-minded. More than likely, you will not regret it.   Simply, A+!"}
{"text":"Given that I've been to 2 other locations in Miami and Melbourne, I felt like this one did not compare. $1K for 4 people and we left scavenging for more food at a different establishment. The biggest let down was our service. Empty glasses, sauces that never came out with the dish, bathroom out of order, being served incorrect drinks which were still on our tab but the waiter could never be found to tell him about it. No sight of a manager either. We asked for him to just bring out dishes and I personally believe he just rang up the most expensive items. I was disappointed he never asked about likes/dislikes or allergies. Everything was lobster and salmon - absolutely no variety. One sashimi dish and no sushi. 3 dozen oysters (overkill) and it was so salty we had to send it back. Chef agreed it was salty and tried to fix it with lemon. Drinks and ingredient quality were the only redeeming part of the meal. Bit of a let down considering the reputation and price. I wouldn't visit this location again."}
{"text":"5 stars all-around for this awesome establishment. We had a Groupon, which we paid $100 bucks for the Signature Five-Course Tasting Menu for Two People. Every single piece of fish was fresh and delicious. You could tell this wasn't your average sushi restaurant.   1st course: tai sashimi dry miso (FAVORITE DISH!!!!) 2nd course: yellowtail jalapeño roll, two-piece salmon with wasabi salsa sushi, two-piece scallop tiradito sushi, and two-piece tuna sushi 3rd course: rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce 4th course: black cod with miso  5th course: dessert (chocolate cake, green tea ice cream and mixed berries)  I have zero to no complaints about the courses offered. My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the quality sushi at this place. This is a fancy restaurant, so the portions were expected to be small. If you walk in expecting huge servings, you definitely picked the wrong restaurant, lol.  We went on a weeknight with a reservation, so service was super quick and attentive. I ordered the Peruvian Caipirinha cocktail too, which had an awesome kick with the ginger beer.  Overall, this was a steal of a deal. We paid an additional $20 bucks + 20% tip (~$20) for the course. All in all, we paid about $140 for a delicious five-course tasting menu. The service was also great. We were treated really well even with our Groupon and was checked upon multiple times throughout the night. I was really impressed and left feeling satisfied with the entire experience. I'd highly reccomend this place for any date night!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, never had this bad Omasake! ?????Everything is salty and sour, the fish is horrible tasting. I can't believe there's a place that's charge this money serve this kind food. Unbelievable service too."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner and we were excited to eat. We've been to Nobu before so we already had our favorite dishes in mind.   We had the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeños, of course, and it was perfect. The spinach salad was heavenly, we could have ordered 5 more. We tried a couple salmon tacos and they were ok, nothing memorable. We got a yellowtail roll and tried some new style sashimi, both very good. We ordered another roll that was off menu and really enjoyed it. We finished with two desserts and we're definitely stuffed.   Nobu dining is always an experience and we were very pleased with our meal. Service was on point and the environment was very hip. Nobu is never disappointing so we will be back."}
{"text":"Ah sushi.  Sushi, sushi, sushi.  I love it in theory but in reality it makes me a bit squeamish.  However, this place is off the charts good.  Not that I am a connoisseur, but it is by far the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this, I could eat here every week. Had the yellow tail which is a must have, Pork belly and Miso Cod and a lovely dessert. Ask your waiter what is good and what is in season you will not be disappointed, The manager and staff is really nice and really on top of their game. Super knowledgeable and friendly. Can;t wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Second time at Nobu, first time in Vegas. The food was great and the location layout and atmosphere makes it very easy to hang out here and enjoy some good food.  The new style sashimi and Wagyu gyoza are amazing and definitely worth a try. The presentation and delivery add to the unique experience of this restaurant.   The service was good however it was a bit slow, so be prepared to come with some time to spare if you are planning to grab some food here."}
{"text":"Nobu is probably hands down my favorite restaurant on the strip. Yes a little over priced, but comparable prices to any \"upscale\" restaurant on the strip. I live for consistency and Nobu never disappoints!  Every restaurant these days has a variation of Nobu's menu items. Everyone now has rock shrimp, the jalapeño yellowtail, lychee martinis.....but nobody can compare!   If it's your first time at Nobu try the Miso cod. It's phenomenal!! The Rock shrimp (spicy) is a classic fried shrimp in a spicy mayo sauce (can't go wrong) and not really so \"spicy\".  I love that they use real lychee juice in their martinis rather than lychee puree or liquor.   No dinner is ever complete without dessert! We always get the chocolate bento box but this time they had BUBBLE GUM Ice cream! Very subtle flavor and anyone that knows me knows I'm a sucker for anything bubble gum or cotton candy flavored!   If you are debating on going! Go! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went last night for 9p dinner. We were a group of four. We were given a no e table and our server was Troy. Two of us ordered cosmopolitan Martinis and they tasted off. They swore they were tequila. The manager came back and explained they were made Nobu style and not with contreau so that was most likely the issue. They did remake them. The service was very good. Issues were with the food. The server advised of three specials but never gave prices. We ordered a tuna sashimi appetizer with truffle and watercress. It was six SMALL pieces. The cost was a crazy $80. Shame on us for not asking but shame on them for not explaining. CRAZY OVERPRICED. When we ordered the Wagyu beef tacos at $13 each Troy explained they were each one bite literally. They were. Rey good though.  We purchased the following Tiradito white fish $28 small but nice. Seriously very little fish Edamame nice size and fresh. Heck it was the only filling thing $7 A spicy tuna roll $12 a shrimp tempura roll $14 Two grey goose and sodas $12 each Four grey goose cosmopolitans at $16 each Ice tea $2 Three wagyu beef tacos $13 each One black bean cod which was a hot entree.  With a 20 percent tip our total was $408. YES FOLKS $408 and we were hungry. We ended up going back to Mandalay bay and having turkey club sandwiches at 1AM. We were lliterallyy all hungry. NEVER AGAIN! Iwill pay for quality but felt as though we were robbed without a gun. Just wrong. Remember any specials ask the price first. Sticker shock isn't the word."}
{"text":"Forget the hype....your neighborhood sushi place in a strip mall is probably better.  Sure you don't get the Vegas scene, but you also probably get better service, similar quality and a whole lot more money in left your pocket.  The only brief star of the night was the hostess stand.  Friendly to a fault, they patiently waited for my entire party of 6 a full 30 minutes after the reservation time - and they didn't punish us with a poor table or attitude.  The server was fair - guests at my table had to ask who they had to bribe to get their beer delivered - but what do you expect on a Sunday night at 8pm.....hmmm.  BTW - this restaurant is so noisy you can barely hear people at your own table.  Good luck."}
