{"text":"This was the place to go to until they kept messing up the Pho sizes.. The guy with the long hair that looks like bruce lee gave me a Medium and told me its an XL. Argued with them before another employee made him to and exchange it for the right size.  They bring me back the correct size and dropped the Pho on the table, half the broth burnt my hands.  I asked for Ice and they took a while to understand what Ice was.  I literally had to explain to them what Ice was before they brought me 3 Ice cubes in a bag.... no impressed.   They also leave a empty flower pot by the door which is a tripping hazard,  a child slipped and cut his lip and they didn't bother going to help nor offer any band-aids.  The couple took pictures and left, not sure if they ended up with legal action.  Eitherway, not the best place as the employees are unprofessional."}
{"text":"It hit the spot, not amazing, but I sure did enjoy. Been a few times and they are consistently tasty & its close, so I tend to go back. I always get the veg broth veg pho."}
{"text":"I went from 1 star to 5. Gave them a second chance. Was probably an off day. Food was great and they are super friendly. Highly recommended wonton soup"}
{"text":"This is our usual go to spot for quick and decent Vietnamnese east of Yonge.  Found ourselves again at the Peach Garden this week when we were too lazy to cook.  Here is why we like to go to Peach garden: -service is rapid -pretty good quality ingredients -portions are generous -prices fair -accepts Visa -free parking -can conveniently go for a walk at the Home Depot in Gerrard Square after getting full on noodles -the pork bun vermicelli with spring rolls is a solid dish   Some things that could be better:  -the pho broth is too salty -I echo Amy Z's comments about the satay noodle"}
{"text":"I'm still trying to find a favourite pho place in my new hood, and, alas, nothing about Peach Garden blew me away.   The good:  big, lots of seating fast, competent service standard (but not great) pho prices (my small bowl was 6.99$ or so) pho is fine  The bad:  the pho is just fine - fine noodle to broth ratio, fine selection of toppings - but the broth has none of the delicate and delicious complexity of any of the three pho places in my old hood.  The verdict: If you, like me, live nearby and occassionally find yourself in need of some hangover-curing pho, this place will do fine. No reason you should go out of your way to visit if that's not the case."}
{"text":"Reliably tasty with fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Don't know what people are talking about in the reviews.  This place is awesome.    I can't comment on a lot of the menu, but the pho and rolls (fresh & fried) are awesome, some of the best in the city.  Try the curry chicken soup.  It's usually not the best service in the city, but it's typically very fast.  You want great service?  Go pay $15 for pho somewhere else, this ain't that place."}
{"text":"My pho with grilled meet was awesome. Better than in the other 3 places I've tried downtown anyways. They also brought it fast. Oh, and I loved the music :D"}
{"text":"Great pho and amazing vermicelli. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants to go to for good noodles. Their dining space is a little tight but that's mainly because they're so popular. My husband and I have always been attended to pretty fast with polite service."}
{"text":"An above average Vietnamese joint. But many Vietnamese joints are holes in the wall so that's not saying a whole lot.  I've been here several times now and it's pretty consistant: extensive menu, fast service, friendly staff, decent food, and tea in plastic cups.  For various reasons, tea shouldn't be served in plastic cups.  But here, it is. I feel SO NAUGHTY. *sips tea* SOMEONE SPANK ME."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!    I had the most horrible experience.  Went for lunch with four friends.  I ordered the curry goat with rice.  A piece of meat still had fur and hair on it!  I almost vomited!!!  I told the waitress, who took the meal away and still charged me for it!  Horrible service and horrible food.  I called the city health inspector on the place."}
{"text":"The banh cuon was so bomb. I went there on a Sunday and it was full. Bun bo hue was not spicy at all which is a shame but still delicious. Very clean and fast."}
{"text":"Food here is good. 7/10. If you are driving to this location, parking is free but can be limited.   Service here is not the best.  Prices are reasonable. Not any cheaper than china town. My gf and i had a huge delish meal for $40 inc. Tip."}
{"text":"Service = terrible. Waitress glared at me every time I tried to ask her something.  Portion = GREAT! huge portion. Lots of noodles and lots of beef.  Food = Ordered the large pho tai (rice noodles with rare beef). The soup was so-so, nothing special. Beef was thicker cut than I like. Noodles were just dried noodles.  Price = awesome. $6.50 for a large pho.  Nothing special. I only came here because I was at Gerrard Square and was too hungry to walk to Chinatown for noodles."}
{"text":"Food wise, this is among the better vietnamese places in town.  The menu is extensive, and spans from Vietnamese through Chinese and on into Thai.  The vietnamese is great, the chinese offerings are pretty good, and the Thai.. well, it's Thai, but not comparable to actual Thai restaurants.  We go for the Chinese and Vietnamese -- our kids love both.  Service, however, needs a lot of work.  I've been twice with my family since the reno and each time we had to wait a least a half hour before anyone took an order -- the first time it was 45 minutes!  The kitchen is quite fast when the order is in but, again, wait staff take forever to pick it up and bring it to the table.  During the last visit they neglected to bring a dish, left it on the bill and then argued when we asked to have it removed.  Very disappointing; we will be trying takeout next time.  Given how full it usually is, I think a head waiter might help keep an eye out for underserviced patrons."}
{"text":"This place deserves far better than the three average it currently enjoys on Yelp. I have been coming here for 15 years and have yet to have anything but a great experience with the food and the service. Unlike many (most?) Vietnamese places, they use broken rice, which makes all the difference when you drizzle that fish sauce (don't forget to load it with chilli sauce first!) all over it. The satay pho is to die for, the spring rolls are a head and shoulders above most places, but I save my highest praise for the broken rice dishes. #168, right from the name of the resto, is my favourite, five colours broken rice. I got it take out the other day and since it comes with the steamed egg thingy and not a fried egg, I fried one when I got home and threw it on top. Heaven! Yes, it is probably a smidge more expensive than the Vietnamese places further west on Gerrard Street in Chinatown East. It is also a lot cleaner and brighter."}
{"text":"Out of all the Pho chains i've tried, this has been the worst i've had. Their Pho's are relatively more pricey and yet the selection isn't that great. Their food is average and not memorable. They're also quite stingy in their servings, my beef balls were tiny and few in numbers when i ordered beef noodle soup with beef balls.   I would recommend going to 88 or Train instead if you're looking for Pho."}
{"text":"Was around the east end of downtown, and I had never been around that area (Leslieville?). Drove by this restaurant and noticed there were a lot of people waiting in line. It is a Vietnamese restaurant, and it had a very authentic feel to it. Place is quite spacious, and they have enough seats so you won't have to wait long. Good thing it didn't take long, I had the biggest hangover ever in history and I needed food asap.  Ordered the Grilled Beef Short Ribs, Shredded Pork Skin, and steamed egg on rice. This is one of my favourite dishes, and I have to say that it was an average dish compared to other authentic Vietnamese restaurants.   What was good? - a lot of options on the menu - portion sizes are huge, and I eat a lot  - perfectly cooked short ribs and tasty but a little bit on the oily side  What was bad? - service was a bit slow, as they were clearly understaffed. At the time I was there, they only had 2 people working, while the restaurant was near full  Recommendation: I recommend this place if it is the only and last option. There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants just down the road, that are more delicious and cheaper."}
{"text":"we eat here at least once a week. Food is good. service not so much. Dont expect to be waited on. just go eat and leave"}
{"text":"Reliable Vietnamese. Managment and menu have changed - it used to be called Peach Garden. The goat in goat curry soup was tough but the soup was delish. Great grilled beef short ribs and pork chops. The pho is a bowlful of beefy goodness. Service is excruciatingly variable. Cash or debit."}
{"text":"You might want to keep on driving and not stop here. Today I had the curry chicken on rice. Very little chicken on a bed of glass noodles and a fare portion of rice. The curry tasted like nothing I have ever eaten before. Way too much glass noodle and rice and just a couple of pieces of factory chicken. The place was busy and frankly I don't know why. Does anyone know a good Vietnamese place in the area please let me know."}
{"text":"This place really turned itself around as it was previously a below average pho place.  The entire place has been renovated and the menu has been tweaked and changed to fit with other bigger and better Vietnamese restaurants around the GTA area.  I have to say the food now is great and I rathee enjoy sampling all the different items they have to offer in the new menu.  My personal favourites are the Special pho noodles with all that tendon and tripe goodness and I also love all the rice noodle and bbq meat combinations.  I have yet to try every single one on the menu, but maybe one day!   Also their avacado shakes are top notch along with their classic Vietnamese coffee.  I will be coming back for more in the future!  It's my goal to try all the combinations for rice noodle bowls!"}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at this place, I bring my friends here all the time. The prices are really good, although they did increase recently. You get big portions and the food is very delicious. I'm vegan so there is a vegetarian broth and soup option, also a whole section to vegetarians in the menu. The menu has a wide selection of different Vietnamese foods, from crispy spring rolls to fresh rice rolls, from pho to rice platters. The service is usually really good, the workers are friendly and come around when required. You are always given complimentary tea as soon as you sit down, then the food comes fairly quickly after you've ordered . I've never had a bad experience here! It's your above average pho-Vietnamese restaurant, ideal for family, friends, and an affordable meal."}
{"text":"I come here often on bike rides with my BFF. We both love Vietnamese food and this place is cheap and good (I won't say cheerful, because the service is freaking awful!). I love the rice papers with grilled pork and vermicelli. You can't find this dish at every Vietnamese restaurant and when I order it, they always ask me if I know what it is because a lot of white people don't know how to wrap up the rice papers.   Once, I came here craving these. The server informed me that the chef was not in and they could not make them. WTF? Nothing is cooked except for the pork, which is available on many of their other dishes. Give me a plate of vermicelli, shredded cucumber and pickled carrots (which I'm sure they have on hand) and I'll be fine. The server stomped off and after some time she returned to say that the cook would make it for me. Geez... THANK YOU! I shouldn't have to BEG for my dinner!  Why did I come back after this? Not really sure. The food is usually consistent and good value. For some reason the attitude is secondary to me."}
{"text":"Our experience at Peach Garden was not a stellar success, instead it was an experience in staff not knowing how to communicate with their customers and restaurant process.  Firstly, the food there is medicore at best depending on what you decide to order even with a vast menu there are traps and pitfalls abound. I've tried lots of pho places in Toronto and this does not impress me.   We had ordered the Satay noodle soup and Chicken & bamboo shoots noodle soup.  The satay soup came with a really thick and slimy soup base and noodles that were cooked to mush.  We then talked to our waiter about the disappointment with the dish and how it looked gross. He proceeded to tell us the ingredients (pineapple?!) in the dish and told us to order something else which we did.  He didn't send it back to the kitchen but left it on our table instead.   they then wanted us to pay for the Satay noodles dish which I didn't touch.  Eventually we did not end up paying for the satay noodle soup but were still tortured with paying for the medicore meal we did have.    Overall I would not recommend this place and suggest going up further into chinatown for a better pho experience."}
{"text":"Great place - consistently tasty options; we've eaten here a few times and continue to get take-out if we can't dine in."}
{"text":"Love this place, everything is delicious. Staff and owner are welcoming and the prices are reasonable. PH01 is one of my faves and so is the beef stew. Try something, anything, you will totally enjoy it."}
{"text":"Clean, well-priced, yummy Vietnamese (with a few Thai menu items) that's open late. Last night they were open until 11 pm, although they started putting chairs up at 10:30 pm. Nice people serve the food without pretension, and pay no mind to (or maybe listen in to?) passionate political conversation.    The mango salad is huge, and so good that my companion who normally dislikes mangos ate a third of it."}
{"text":"We like Pho and we come we come here quite often. All the dishes are delicious. The Pho is always piping hot. The soup is very tasty.  Pork Chop, Short Ribs are done very well. Spring Rolls and vermicelli are also some of our favorites. The only compliant is sometimes the table smells."}
{"text":"I've only been the once so far, but they seem to have lots of mostly-asian regulars, which I consider a good sign. On a weekday lunch, they were pleasantly busy.    I had the deep fried pork spring roll and the hanoi-style rare beef pho, both of which were good if unexceptional.   The staff was friendly, the food arrived quickly, the restaurant was reasonably clean and bright, the price was reasonable.  I'll go again."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.  Lots of room and good for kids.  It even has some parking. Huge menu but we've mostly stuck to the classic pho and bun rice dishes, which are tasty with large portions. Not the finest Viet food in the neighbourhood but great value for good quality."}
{"text":"Had the PH01 house special pho, large size, dry noodles (with the beef balls, beef slices, tendon and tripe).   I really liked the chewiness of the noodles, and the broth was good too. The beef slices were a bit thick and there wasn't much tripe or tendon. It was mostly beef slices.   Tip: I mix some sriracha and hot sauce into the whole bowl, but I like putting the garlic with each spoonful.  Overall, had a good experience here! Would certainly come back to try their vermicelli dishes. My friend got the vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork and it looked soooo good. She said it was really tasty too.   The large pho was quite a lot, I might stick to medium next time."}
{"text":"Your eyes say \"A standard Vietnamese place\", with plain tables and chairs. And like many other places you may go for Pho, the menu has so many variations it would be better presented in excel. But the Pho is top notch, and the place is always busy with regulars. The staff are great, making this one of my favorite Vietnamese restos. Has a small parking lot in front of it, and it is located just east of Gerrard Square."}
{"text":"The noodle soups are always very hot and fresh.  I like the seating designs in this location better than the one at Pacific Mall as it is way more open and spread out instead of all crowded together.  They give always of mints and bean sprouts for the noodle soups.  I always go there for Bun Bo Hue or the roasted chicken rice (you will not be disappointed).    The only complaint I have is I went a few days ago and it was very hot yet they DO NOT have their air conditioning on.  So the whole time I was there eating, everybody inside the restaurant was sweating badly.  I will probably not go back until the weather gets cooler."}
{"text":"Decent pho place if you are in the Riverdale area. Broth is not salty and the portions are reasonable but check their menu carefully because the noodle soups start with a base price and then if you add meat, you have to pay an extra $2 for whatever size you get..so for a small you're paying $8-9/bowl which is a little on the pricier side for this area.   Service was also mediocre. We had asked for the beef to be separated from the soup and on the side because my grandma wanted to dilute the flavour a bit but they immediately said they couldn't do it. This was pretty unaccommodating."}
{"text":"I've had better pho, but it was okay.   I got the House Special Pho (which should have everything in there). There wasn't enough meat for my taste, and too many noodles. There were also some fatty pieces in there.  The hot sauce had no taste, and the soup wasn't overly MSG like. A medium bowl (decent size) was $6.00. It would have been $4 else where!  There's not much other options for viet food in the area. But there is a really great and diverse menu, and I feel their specialty isn't limited to just soup noodles. I'm going to try something else next time."}
{"text":"The dishes here are pretty average nothing special but still good. It's a quick go to place to grab some food and I have no complaints about the service so I'll always keep coming back. Just keep in mind that they don't accept credit cards but overall a decent place."}
{"text":"I grew up in west end of Toronto (Weston and Finch) and some of the best pho restaurants were only a short drive away. Needless to say I had pho on a weekly basis. Ever since moving downtown, it was difficult to find a good, authentic pho restaurant. I've tried the \"top\" pho restaurants downtown (Pho Tien Thanh, Golden Turtle, etc) but didn't find them to be as good as home (flavour was off or too oily).   I decided to give Com Tam Pho (formerly Peach Garden) a try since I recognized the name, I was pleasantly surprised! The rice and pho dishes here are very tasty and quite authentic.   The pho had two noodle options: dry noodles (typically what you get a pho restaurants) and fresh noodles (I prefer this...noodles are little softer/chewier). The large #101 came with plenty of meat and enough to keep me full and very satisfied. The broth is not as oily as the \"top\" pho restaurants downtown.   I always loved the rice at Peach Garden...they have the best shrimp in bean curd. I tried the rice dish here and sure enough the shrimp in bean curd was exactly as I remembered (yay!) Another plus is that this place actually has broken rice, I've been to a number of other Vietnamese restaurants downtown that only had regular rice. The rice dish I usually order comes with a fried egg but the servers always lets me substitute that for a steamed egg at no additional cost. Since it's a Vietnamese restaurant, I count that as great service haha.   Tips:  - Keep in mind that this is a Vietnamese restaurant so dishes like curry, pad thai (or any Thai dishes), fried noodles etc are not going to be great.  - Every time I come after 8pm, the restaurant seems to be out of fresh noodles so if that's what you're looking for, try to come earlier.  - I've noticed this at many Vietnamese restaurants: service and food portions seems to go down the later you come. I would suggest getting here before 9pm.  - The restaurant only accepts cash and debit (no credit cards)   I am now a frequent customer and this is the only place I go to when I am craving Vietnamese downtown."}
{"text":"I no longer go to this restaurant. The last few times I ate here has been an utter disappointment. The pho was terrible. I'm not sure what had changed (management, cook had a bad day/s) but it doesn't serve the same quality food as it used to. I want consistency, so I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good clean Pho fun! Love the broth."}
{"text":"Excellent pho, flavourful and not too salty. I really like that they offer a choice between dry noodles and fresh noodles for the pho. I also like that their condiment containers are always clean (compared to Pho Hung on Spadina that looks like the condiments are never ever cleaned). The grilled meat appetizer is a bit over-marinated and sliced too thin and is a bit dry."}
{"text":"Eaten here numerous times but I think the quality has went south over the last little while. Ordered chicken soup and very little chicken meat, it was 80% chicken fat, like the skin. Totally disgusting. I think we'll stay clear of this place for awhile."}
{"text":"I've never dined in, always take out. Staff is generally friendly and helpful with the menu when you have questions. Clean restaurant and food is reliable. My go-to dish is lemongrass pork or chicken with vermicelli and a spring roll. I usually order this at most Vietnamese places and this one is pretty good. The reason I give it three stars is that I've had better in Montreal at a variety of places. This one comes close but not the best I've had. Although I do have to say that their house special pho is pretty tasty and it's my husband's fave."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood place is good for quick pho but sometimes the meat is a bit fatty or overly chewy. I also worry about the cleanliness but since I get pho most of the time, I tell myself any bad stuff might be boiled off. :) good for take out."}
{"text":"We had this a couple of weekends ago, mostly because we were walking by and hadn't been here before.  Pros: Lots of tables Relatively clean  Cons: It's truthfully not as tasty as a couple of places located east of Logan on Gerrard.  There were pretty fast.  The price was ok.  My overall experience was very...*meh* I was hungry.  I ate, became unhungry, and left."}
{"text":"Typical Vietnamese pho place, so you really can't go wrong here.   Great pho and other dishes. The portions are also quite decent and will fill you up.  The price is a bit higher than other pho places such as the one in Ossington or on the west end for the quality here.  Service is nothing special; sometimes it can quick other times it can feel like you've aged 10 years before they get to you.   There was one incident where they actually forgot my order. So after everyone's order came out, we had to wait another 15 minutes for them to prepare my dish. By that time, my party's dishes were pretty lukewarm/cold.   They also only take cash, NO CREDIT, so be prepared.   With DD's right across the street, it's hard to convince myself anymore to go to Com Tam 168. Overall I would totally recommend going to ossington/Chinatown if you're craving pho."}
{"text":"A great option for a cheap lunch.   Peach Garden brings all the Yum of other places further west on Gerrard without the vaguely dirty decor.   A good mix of kids, families, pho people, and the odd couple.     I really love the special pho - a mix of tripe, meat balls, beef, and loads of noodles.  As good as you'll find in Toronto - trust me, I've tried a lot.  They also do takeaway - buy yourself some big-ass bowls first."}
{"text":"I frequent this place usually after a long day of volleyball at the beach. This place hits all the right spots; fast, cheap, tasty and convenient. We are very fortunate to be in a city where there's an abundance of decent Pho places. I can't say this is the best Pho but it's quite good and consistent. Most of their items are very well made and quite tasty.  You get good value for your money (as with most Pho places) and the service is lackluster; which is typical of this type of joint. If you're in the area and craving Pho, just do it. You can't really go wrong or you can head further west on the same street, there are a few more options in the nearby China town."}
{"text":"It's pretty much same as another Vietnam restaurant but I always come here for my spicy sour seafood pho. Good portion, good value and delicious. They have fresh noodle and dry noodle options."}
{"text":"I find that ever since coming to this place I can't have pho anywhere else without being disappointed. The broth is the most tasty that I've ever had. The staff is fast and friendly. They also have free parking. My only issue is that I wish they were open really late night."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was not so hot.  A friend and I stumbled on this place while trying to get to the Danforth and finding many obstacles in our way. Stopping at an intersection outside this place, my friend pointed and said \"we could always go for Pho!\"  The signage outside was very intricate making the building very inviting. We arrived towards the end of the dinner hour and were led to one of the few open tables. The menu was extensive with many Pho, stir-fried and congee options (just to name a few of their categories). Both my friend and I decided on Pho. I can't recall exactly what my friend ordered but she liked it.  I ordered the chicken with rice noodles. Initially, I felt the dish was missing something and began to peruse the condiments sitting on the table. Decided garlic would probably do the trick and it did. The medium size was just enough for one person who was relatively hungry. My friend and I shared an order of their deep fried vegetarian spring rolls which were also very good.  Service was really poor. After we hadn't taken a bite of our food for about 30-60 minutes our server came over and asked if he could take our plates because he \"didn't like the smell of old soup\" adding that it was likely the result of working there for so long. A little TMI but we took it in stride. After an additional hour, there was no sign of our server, we headed up to the counter to pay and the server who was standing there, asked if we were there to order take-out.   Overall, the food was pretty good but the poor service makes you forget about the food. Hopefully, if you have the opportunity to go you'll get better service and a better experience."}
{"text":"This is a cheap Vietnamese eatery. Typical bad Toronto service and disregard for  health rules. If they cook you a wrong dish, your problem, or they will just remix the wrong dish with something else so that it looks like the dish you ordered, etc.  Thai dishes are really bad here, stick to the Vietnamese ones.  I have tried:  * appetizers: mostly good, if you know what you want. K10 has a ton of shrimp in it. * pho -- it is a bit above average for Toronto * Quail (K17) -- horrible * Rice with grilled meat (197 and such) -- tolerable * Stir fry (203-212) -- decent, but stick to beef/shrimp. Chicken is some fake substitute.  Beef could be fake too, but it tastes better. * Pad thai -- big no. Go to PAI, Thai Princess, or Khao San Road instead for that. * Vermicelli dishes (B01-B28) -- below average for Toronto, but passable.   Overall it is nothing special, and all the other options in the immediate vicinity are worse.  So it is quite popular for lunch, actually.   Be careful and do not come when they open (10am), you might get leftovers from yesterday."}
{"text":"Service is very efficient. Clean and bright, a little nicer to look at than some other Vietnamese restaurants. And they accept debit, right at the table! That is Pho Unbelievable.  Pho was large portioned and inexpensive compared to others around town.  Curry goat soup with vermicelli noodle was tasty and fresh, though I prefer having rice noodle in my soup, there was only 1 vegetable, and the goat pieces where very small and boney, but only 1 bone had any marrow.  Recommended."}
{"text":"If you get take out, check your order before you leave. I've gotten the wrong thing twice."}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese restaurant. Nothing too out of the ordinary here. Since their name is com tam (broken rice), I ordered that dish and was pretty content with the portioning. Their ca phe sua da is quite strong as well! If you're in the area and craving pho, why not?"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Com Tam 168 (previously known as Peach Garden) regularly.  It costs slightly more than the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown (at Broadview and Spadina).  Nothing to complain about this place.  The soup base for their pho looks less oily and taste less fattening compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown.  Their vermicelli is alright- it is filled with beansprouts on the bottom.  The word \"com\" in Vietnamese means \"rice\" in English so they are known for their rice dishes.  When you order a rice fish, other Vietnamese restaurants just give you \"regular rice\" and this place gives you \"small rice\" which makes it more authentic.  I personally prefer to have the \"small rice\" when I order a rice dish from a Vietnamese restaurant and it's actually hard to find."}
{"text":"Don't let the word \"Express\" fool you, this is a full-on restaurant with waiter service and everything.  There is also plenty of room to sit.  If you're looking for a good pho restaurant, you're out of luck - this place is probably the first place I've gone to where I could not finish the pho, not because it was too big, but because it was too bland.  Come here for their \"other\" dishes like their rice, vermicelli and pad thai dishes.  They are large proportioned and are prepared really quickly - perfect for when you're super hungry!  I wouldn't say it's the most authentic place, especially to have pad thai and such, but it does the trick.  Their smoothies are also very good."}
{"text":"Below is my report to Toronto Public Health.  My wife and I used to eat here all the time and would have rated this a 7 or 8 if it wasn't for what happened below.  Needless to say, my wife and I, and anyone else I know will NEVER step foot in this place again.  Seeing a mouse is one thing, but to strike it multiple times in front of everyone just makes me sick.  Com Tam 168 1018 Gerrard St e  My wife and I were dining here for lunch from 2:15-3:00 on August 20, 2017. We were sitting by the window in the southwest corner of the restaurant closest to the door. I spotted a live mouse walking along the south side of the wall. We decided to quickly finish our meal and cash out. I didn't want to cause a scene or a commotion so I discreetly told the employee behind the bar area who was cashing us out that I saw a mouse. At this point I saw it on the ground in the front Vestibule and pointed it out. At this point a kitchen worker came out with a broom and started striking it multiple times. A simple sweep out the front door 2ft away would have been enough but she kept striking it multiple times in front of us and other customers. She then swept it outside into the parking lot in a corner and continued to strike it multiple times. At this point it was very upsetting to my wife and I so we just left  Josh"}
{"text":"Pretty much the same experience, maybe a bit better, but not by much.  I ordered the house special, i think it had less meat in it this time, and only 2 small beef balls.  This is a Large House special.. it should be full of stuff.  The broth was a bit off.  Napkins is an issue again.  1 per person, a really thin one. Beg for more!!! or bring your own.  Plastic glass of water came this time, but no re-fill.  Reminder - Cash only, maybe debit."}
{"text":"You know this place isn't bad. The pho is fresh, tasty and what you would expect for the prices you pay. It's cheap and the value is high as a result. Now it's not close to a homemade authentic pho experience, but i you compare it to pho 88 or pho xelua, then this place does pho justice.  The service is terrible and you are only ever allowed one napkin per person. So use your napkins sparingly and make sure only to dab on them every now and then. for big messes, use your sock instead."}
{"text":"It was first time trying this new PHO place where my friend told me is a very good place to have a good Pho!  I went there in -25C weather for a hot and warm Pho for dinner.  I also ordered fresh Shrimp and Pork Rolls that I was craving for after a long days work in this freezing cold winter.  I was kind of disappointed that I don't know why there were too many pork fat that personally I am not fond into type of meat I would not eat.  I had a great but things could improve a bit more than I was going to be expected for a meal that almost cost $20.00 in total."}
{"text":"The food is okay.  The rice was soggy but the meat is good.  The service is horrible n I'm used to okay service from my people.  Got our food 35 mins later.. pretty horrible  for a pho place.  The spring rolls fell apart on us.  N it took 40 minutes  to get some water...  not very good  service or food.."}
{"text":"This place is average at best.  I never had Pho that taste so bland.  The soup has little flavor and not hot enough.  You know its not hot when it can't cook the rare beef.  Their Smoothies taste gross.  Service is ok.  Not the fastest but they are there when you need them.  The restaurant is large with more then enough seating.     Only good thing is that there is free parking.  Or you can park at the mall."}
{"text":"If I could describe this place in one word: it would be CONSISTENT. The PHO is always good and it always helps me when I'm cold or come down with a cold. Its also great because it is in my hood!   I love the fact that I can stumble on over to this place when I need some warm goodness! Its a legit spot."}
{"text":"To be exact... 2.8!  The best thing about this place was the size of the meal for the cheap price, but that is only if mega portions are important to you.  For me, I would prefer less of something if the quality is better.  Because of food allergies, I always get Bun, usually with grilled chicken and a spring roll.  This was not an option here that I could find on the menu, so I went with pork.  The spring roll was cooked decently but didn't have the lemongrass flavour I am more fond of. The pork was pretty dry and also relatively flavourless though fairly fat and gristle free.  The sauce was stanky!  There's fish sauce and then there's completely stank fish sauce.  Honestly and perhaps not surprisingly, this meal upset my tummy about an hour after.  The worst thing about this place was the service.  Our server wasn't surly at all, but it was damn slow to get our meal.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"For me this is one of the best pho downtown... consistent, option with fresh noodles.. other items are OK... service is fast... I don't get why there are so many bad-average review, compared to Pho Thien Tan or Pho Hung..."}
{"text":"Great pho, usually very busy at lunch 12-2pm! The large bowls are definitely enough for two people to share, I couldn't finish the small. They have fresh or dried pho rice noodles to choose from and I would recommend trying the fresh noodles!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible and awful. This is a review based on my visit there from months ago. I ordered the special pho only to be brought out their broth concentrate and noodles!! Omfg the salt. I don't know how a Vietnam resto works but it appears as if there is a stock that is concentrated, and it is diluted to make the soup. Based on the saltiness of what I got it would have to be one spoon if concentrate to five spoons of water to make the normal broth.  I complained, it was sent back, I wasn't charged but no apologies either. Not going back ever again."}
{"text":"i come here often as it is close to where i live.      not bad... standard vietnamese food...taste is quite good... but can someone say MSG OVERLOAD...  when you go to the washroom you might see giant sacks of flour in brown huge bags... but upon closer inspection.. you will find that this is actually MSG.  i will take a picture next time.. prepare to die of thirst after.."}
{"text":"This place will soon become our go-to spot for pho and more. We were seated promptly and service was good. We ordered plain congee, fritters, pho with rare beef flank and tendon, and noodles with seafood and veggies. The food was delicious and definitely satisfied our cravings. For all of what we ordered it came up to about $35 for 3 dishes and a side.  Overall, great experience and will definitely come back!"}
