{"text":"12 years ago when I moved to Fairview, I was blown away that the convenience story was not a 7-11 but a natural food store.  Over the years they have grown to include a deli making fresh sandwiches and soups.  Often on Friday they have the most amazing fish tacos made from the fresh fish sold outside by Cape Fear who brings up fresh fish and sells on Friday and Saturday.   Except for the winter months, they sell fresh produce mostly from Fairview farmers.  The selection of canned and other products is fairly limited...it is a convenience store after all.  When we feel like splurging we go for the frozen pot pie locally made.  Yum.  Hooray for Trout Lily."}
{"text":"The Trout Lily is a small market.  They don't have room for lots and lots of stuff; however, so much of their stuff is made within a 10 mile radius...it screams local and fresh.  For example, Imladris Farms (the amazing jams and jellies you find at Tupalo Honey, Early Girl and Corner Kitchen) they farm just down the road in Fairview.  Roots and Branches Crackers are amazing and produced in Swannanoa.  Tito's Foods does preservative-free local Hummus' and Pimento Cheese.  So yeah, it's not as big as the co-op, but they definitely focus on local and fresh...maybe Melanie should have just asked the cashier \"what's local?\" or \"what's fresh?\""}
{"text":"Randomly decided to stop by Trout Lily for a quick sandwich. I got the breakfast biscuit with egg, cheese, bacon. (Breakfast options available all day) and my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich. The biscuit comes with cayenne aioli which I substituted with a berry jam. The owner was very accommodating and simply let me choose whichever jam I wanted straight from the shelfs of the grocery store. The breakfast biscuit was huge! Perfect temperature, quality ingredients and it was delicious. Pricing is great and the store offers lots of local products."}
{"text":"As a Fairview resident and frequent shopper at Trout Lilly, I have decided not to go back. I've never experienced employees as aloof and expressionless like the ones that have come and gone, and the current one in any business. I've actually wanted to say something to them about it. Believe me,  it's not once that this has happened. I was going once a week for 6 years. I don't understand it, I can't support local businesses that act like a customer is a bother."}
{"text":"Aww, I hate seeing a negative review for Trout Lily!   I am so very glad to have Trout Lily as an alternative to Food Lion & Ingles, which in Fairview are pretty pitiful if you are on the hunt for organic food items. It is a very tiny store, so the selection won't be the same as our larger organic grocers AND again, it's Fairview. What are you expecting? Now, if they ever want to expand, I'll be at the ribbon cutting ceremony, but what they have in stock is what is in demand, so I can't fault them for that.   I do wish they had more \"to go\" items but the freshness can't really be blamed on the store, as they are made at another restaurant. I prefer the burritos over the sandwiches, personally.   Trout Lily introduced me to the hummus by Roots. Their black bean hummus is my most favorite hummus ever. I think it's neat they have all our little local organic companies along with the national brands.   I have never encountered a customer service problem there, either. As soon as I'm ready to ring up, they are at the cash till in less than a minute.   Sorry, I had to give this little store some love. :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of Leslie made progress like no evil food Rosetta's looking glass and more!!! Great staff too!"}
{"text":"A great little local market. This place is on our way to and from work, so very convenient location. We buy our Haw Creek honey and Hickory Nut Gap meat here. It might be pricier than a large store, but that's because they can't buy in large quantities to get a discount like large places. Guess what...it's a small \"mom n pop\" store!"}
{"text":"The only thing that makes this Organic or Natural \"market\" worthwhile is they recycle cooking oil.    I went in to look around and get a bite to eat.  They have a poor selection of pre-made sandwiches that are small & unappetizing looking and for $6.99 are decidedly over-priced & not fresh.    I also looked at frozen dinners & veggie burgers & they are over $6 a pop, too, and the one I got wasn't  great, either.  They have a very small selection of frozen meats & things and the prices are just way too much.    The store itself isn't at all neat or tidy and just looked disheveled & a bit grungy.  I think what the experience the most miserable is that 3 people including the manager/cashier never even said anything to me the whole time I wandered around.  Even when I came up to the counter to check out the two people in front didn't even move or look at me or anything.   The manager/cashier simply waved me forward so I walked between them & she rang me out without any greeting or goodbye.    I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go shop here again, but I would go out of my way to avoid it.  (there were some ladies outside selling fresh(?) seafood from coolers & they were very friendly - but didn't seem to have anything to do with the store itself.)"}
