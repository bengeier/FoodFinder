{"text":"Thai food meal prep?! Amazing! The food is delivered same day & stays fresh in the fridge. Still delicious after a few days. Green Curry & tom yum stir fry are my favorites! Id give this company a thousand stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Honestly,  aren't we all guilty of being a little hungover, or a little drunk, or really just hungry and treating ourselves to some Thai food delivery? Then there are all of the guilty feelings afterwards of what we just ate and how we should have just had a hard-boiled egg instead right? Well Mr Bangkok takes the guilt out of your Thai delivery, with healthy meal prep, and delicious taste tasting Thai food. You won't even know it's good for you! It's actually hard to believe it's low calorie..."}
{"text":"Love the concept of healthy and tasty food. Especially nowadays, everyone is super busy that this convenience also helps with the busy daily schedule. Now don't need to go to fast food restaurants to fit in eating time during the hectic daily schedule. Please continue providing quality and tasty food while keeping me healthy at the same time."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. What I don't love are the calories that come along with it. I was super stoked when I discovered Mr. Bangkok but was a little skeptical. I went big and ordered the Panang Curry, Phad Thai, and Pineapple Fried Rice. A little heat does the trick for me and it's chicken all day every day.  The meat was tender and juicy, the sauces were creamy, the rice was cooked to perfection. Not one dish was a letdown and they deliver!?!?! It's a win win because once I'm home from the gym, it's hard to get me back out of the house.  Guilt free Thai, packed with flavor and protein? I'm so into this style of meal prep, especially when I wan to indulge but not stray from following my macros.   I'm really looking forward to getting back in town from my holiday travel so I can place my next order. Party at my place?"}
