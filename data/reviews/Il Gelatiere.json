{"text":"Not truly gelato (not in the real Italian sense of the word), but decent enough.

They should add yummy toppings to their menu - only places with mouthwatering gelatos can get away with not having hot fudge, chocolate sauce, etc."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times now hoping the experience would get better. The gelato is meh compared to other authentic Italian ice cream places in the city. The disinterested service however is the reason for the lack of stars. I understand that working at an ice cream shop may be someone's summer job but come on, take a little pride in providing your customers with some service. Not only did the two girls behind the counter look at us AND still completely ignore us to continue their conversation, they kept it up even as we tried asking about the different flavours and selection! Major service fail. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Compared to other places in the city the gelato is definitely sub par (I had banana and pistachio) and the prices are more expensive than most. Couldn't even finish the whole thing it was so bad."}
{"text":"Great gelato and coffee bar in Mount Pleasant Village. Very reasonable prices, many flavours to choose from, and friendly staff! The quality of the gelato is one notch above Hollywood Gelato a block away IMO. The pistachio gelato, compared to that of Hollywood's, is much creamier and richer. They also have a nice patio and indoor seating as well."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the gelato has to be one of the best in the city, and the staff are incredibly helpful and courteous.  The coffee, from espresso to Cappuccino's are also very good and would highly recommend this beautiful location to the many other \"gelataria's\" around the area.  Make sure to stop by and try the Pistachio - DELISH!"}
{"text":"In spite of my frugal Scottish blood I find myself paying $8 for a damn good scoop of gelato. I was stoked to find chili chocolate there a few years back but bummed to see it melt away with the spicy/sweet trend. 
Overall, the gelato is kick-arse, but one should brush up on one's Italiano to aid oneself in deciphering the glorious flavors they have to offer. One can also have a wee taste of the mysterious treats if one asks. I would just feel bad asking to try each one when the line-up is jutting out the door. 
Def. check this Italian ice cream shop out in the sticky sweat of summer! BRING BACK THE CHILI CHOCOLATE......and i'd be raisin the star! heheheh"}
{"text":"Went the other night for a Gelato...no complaints about the gelato itself just about the service.
The flavour i ordered had some fig and nuts in it...and since its the texture and crunch that appeals( and i didn't notice either the fig or nuts in my serving), i asked the girl if i could just have some with that in it...as my serving didnt have any.
I know they are busy but the manner in which she replied \"it will have some in the middle\" was a turn off. 
By the way it did not have\" any in the middle\" at all.What ever happened to keeping the customer happy ?"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighbourhood and got takeout gelato from here last night.  We had 3 flavours in one container, enough for 2-3 people and they wrap it up nicely.  This is by far the best chocolate gelato I have ever had!
Will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Easily best Gelato in the city. Closest you'll get to the real deal in Italy. Some dude suggested Hollywood Gelato over Gelatiere, please don't take that advice. There is an art to ice cream and Gelatiere has introduced Toronto to that art form. Hollywood Gelato is just your typical North American ice cream shop with servers struggling to scoop and damaging your cone!"}
{"text":"The reason Im giving this place two stars is because of the service.  I went in on a Saturday afternoon, and i believe the boss/manager (lady) and this other girl were working behind the counter.  My boyfriend and I didn't know what to choose from, thats why we wanted to sample a few flavors before buying it.  I mean, that is what sampling is right? to see what I like.  There wasn't a limit saying we can only try a certain amount of flavors then why not try them out as much as we can?  

So we tried three flavors, and then we asked \"do you guys have the passion fruit flavor?\" since we saw people are talking about it on yelp, and that girl was like \"no\" but the manager next to her is like \"passion fruit? we do! its at the back!\" and that girl went and took it.  When she came back, she gave us a sample of that.  At that time that girl was already giving us attitude but I didnt think i was wrong.   Afterwards, i said \" can i have the passion fruit flavor and the lemon flavor in a small cup?\" and of course she didn't hear me and just gave me the passion fruit flavor.  I didnt even want to deal with her so I paid.  My boyfriend then threw out all the sampling spoons while I was ordering.  The girl didn't give us spoons, so i was like \"can we have two spoons please?\" and she just replied \"you don't have any spoons left?\" I was like \"no i threw them out\" and she just gave me a face, i mean come on, maybe I was wrong about throwing the spoons, but you didn't have to give us attitude the whole time i was there.  The gelato was great though, too bad I won't be returning because of the service."}
{"text":"I came here on a cool day to have gelato for the first time. Yes, I know, I've been living in darkness!

Luckily I didn't have to experience any line-ups and I found myself standing over glass and looking down at what you call gelato- it looked beautiful! There wasn't a lot of selection at the time, and many of the flavours I could not pronounce or come to any grasp as to what they were. The staff was kind and helped me pick out what I wanted. I got the 'small' and it was pretty small, nothing generous and pricey too.

I sat in their somewhat small, clean and shiny place in front of a flat screen TV and really enjoyed my mango and coffee flavour goodness.

The gelato was very good and not too sweet. However, it wasn't anything outstanding for the price."}
{"text":"best gelato i've ever had, better than Dolce Gelato, Hollywood Gelato, The Mad Italian. 

Rich flavour with just the right amount of sweetness. Smooth texture without the random little icy chucks at Dolce Gelato or the playdough-like consistency at Hollywood Gelato. And you can actually taste each distinctive flavour unlike The Mad Italian (where i could barely tell which flavour is which). I love Il Gelatiere!!! 

I tried Hazelnut, pistacchio, caffe, maria. (their pistacchio flavour is my favorite)"}
{"text":"Seeing as gelato is verging on one of my life's passions, imagine  my excitement when a friend recommended this gelateria! On a recent trip to Italy almost all of my espresso's were complimented with a piece of Cioccolato al Peperoncino (Dark chocolate with chili pepper), and although many gelateria's claim to have such a flavour,  they lie! The cold of the gelato itself tends to diminish the effect of the chili...except of course at the Gelatiere! The 'Pistacchio' is also marvellous! 

Their selection is extensive and their gelato fantastic! Most certainly worth the line-up!"}
{"text":"First off I'm not a gelato connoisseur by any means but I know when something I like tastes good.

Lots of flavours to choose from - yes the signs are in Italian except for the banana flavoured one but the server I had was fine with translating.  I had trouble choosing since I wanted to sample everything.

I ended up with the mixed fruit, melon and hazelnut flavours in the half kg styrofoam container.  Nicely wrapped in ice cream printed paper.  By the time I got home (about half an hour) it was a little soft but I quickly put it in the freezer.  

I went after work so there was no line up and tables were free.

Can't wait to savour some more!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice small shop. It is not cheap but not expensive either. The gelato is not too sweet and I like it. Their fruits flavours are very good.  II Gelatiere is satisfying gourmet tastes."}
{"text":"Gelato is not ice-cream, and texture is a major difference. The base is less sugary and flavour is more intense. Il Gelatiere knows that, and for those reasons I prefer gelato here than any other places.

 I like purity of flavour and I find Nocciola, Cioccolato, Pistacchio and Caffe' some of the most basic yet popular flavours where its possible to feel \"La difference\".  In over two years of my pilgrimage to the place I was able to contain my urge, and not to become addicted to it.

My five stars go to \"Il Gelatiere\" because their product speaks for itself, and it has been consistent in the long run."}
{"text":"(Closer to 4.5 stars.)  

My cousin and I each opted for medium cups (5.25 vs La Paloma's 6.50), me - chocolate/lemon and her - cappuccino/pistachio.

OK, all were delicious, but let's get to the pistachio.  It was like no pistachio I've ever tasted, except the actual nut.  All other pistachio ice creams I've tasted had that acceptable, fake-pistachio taste.  This tasted like the actual roasted nut.  I swear I could taste the crispy skin of the nut.  It was amazing.  Try it.

NB  I preferred my lemon to the chocolate, and I'm a chocolate lover."}
{"text":"Kind of pricey for what you get (quality).  Dolce is still my favourite."}
{"text":"Fine Italian Gelato, on a patio in the summer? YES PLEASE!

This place is open late, it always seems to be busy and has 20+ flavours of delicious gelato to choose from. They create their own flavours (the most unique we had was cake batter). 

It's run by a husband and wife team but teenagers man the counters. 

There is both indoor seating as well as an outdoor patio. 

All I can say is I'm glad I don't live closer to this place...it would be a constant struggle of will power not to come here too regularly.

It's a must try!"}
{"text":"This is my fav gelato place in town...so far. They have a super friendly staff that takes the time to walk you through all their flavours and may even offer you a taste sample. One can get 3 flavours per serving. They have a few tiny tables cramped inside the store and a few chairs on a side street. Try their hazelnut and coffee flavours...damn! You may find it a bit pricey but its worth it."}
{"text":"Simply incredible on a hot summer evening. It Gelaterie has the best flavours in the city (my favourite is the Chile Chocolate--reminiscent of Roma!) They are always happy to let you have a taste of any of the flavours before you buy. This, along with the quality, helps me justify the price point.
I haven't had gelato like this since Italy and since I'm not going back any time soon, It, Gelaterie, it is!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend who lived in the neighbourhood and she always raved how good the gelato was at Il Gelatiere. She made it a point that it was one of the Top 10 Gelato places on blogTO. I'll be honest, I'm not sure what good gelato is. I've had gelato a bunch of times but I could never taste the difference from a low vs high quality store. 

The store is easily accessible because it's located near Eglinton station. As soon as you walk in, the cute interior design of the store put a smile on my face because of the bright colours and the sweet smell of gelato. They have a large patio right beside the store, so it makes it an awesome place to visit on a hot day. 

They have a wide selection of flavours, from fruits to desserts. Whenever I get gelato, I typically get the Tiramisu and something citrus like Grapefruit. Both of the flavours had a deep taste which I liked. I got the small cup and you can pick two flavours! I find it to be a bit pricy though."}
{"text":"Craving ice cream, but not heavy ice cream. Il Gelatiere checked off all my requisite boxes. 

As I would bastardize in even trying to remember and write out the iced gem's actual name...I will just say that it was a creamy vanilla with chunks of dark chocolate. 

Like Kat, I got a small take out container to go. I could not believe how much of the ice cream got packed into this container. I would have stopped about half the way! 

The decor is my style - modern, clean lines. Pretty and simple. The owner, a very handsome gentleman, added to the perfect ambiance!!! 

Once I got my package of goodness home I was not disappointed. Light, just sweet enough, all round perfect."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot to get gelato in the city. 

I am more prone to get the fruit flavours. My favourite flavours are grapefruit and fig. You can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"To date, theirs is the best pistachio flavour I've tried in the city. Its flavour is reminiscent of the actual nut, which is refreshing and the way it should be. I really enjoyed the other flavours I've tried as well: dark chocolate and coffee. Everything tastes the way it should, which makes me a happy customer."}
{"text":"Rude fat lady refused to let us try more than 3 testers though we buy 3scoops, no policy..., just said sorry \"you had enough and \"cherry is cherry okay\". Like...okay are those little spoons expensive or something?... will not go back."}
{"text":"This weekend was apparently made to remind me of my Euro travels!  First France, now Italy.  Walking into Il Gelatiere, it made me very happy to see that the gelato was set out just as it would have been in Italy.  The flavours were written in Italian, and there was a piece of fruit or something else to indicate what it was if you didn't understand.  The major difference of course was the price!  I remember going to a Gelato place in Florence twice a day for a week, and it was only 1.50 euros for a cup with two flavours.  But whenever specialties are imported, the price inflates, and I'll take it for gelato this tasty!

It was very warm so I definitely wanted refreshing flavours.  I chose raspberry and coconut, and the boy got stracciatella and strawberry.  The raspberry was exactly how it should be with a nice sharp flavour.  The coconut also had an amazing taste.  It wasn't like other gelato I've had in the city where I can't really tell what the flavour was.  With these, you knew immediately.  The strawberry and stracciatella were good too, but I preferred the strong and refreshing flavours that I had chosen.

All in all, fantastic gelato at a rather high price point - but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"After eating dinner at Viva Napoli, I decided I needed some Italian dessert to go along with it, so I headed to Il Gelatiere.  There were several families with young kids in there, but the service was good at getting them all taken care of quickly.  The selection of gelato was impressive... a lot of flavors that I hadn't seen before, and they all looked great.  For me, the sign of authentic gelato is a very pale green pistachio gelato, and Il Gelatiere had just that.  I had a small cup with pistachio and chocolate/nutella, which was an amazing combination.  I mentioned to the server that I was going to be moving to Toronto in the next couple weeks, and he spent a few minutes chatting with me about all the great things I needed to check out.  Very friendly and welcoming-- Italian hospitality (and gelato) at its best."}
{"text":"I finally found a LADY Gelato server but sad to say, I was a bit disappointed...  I'll stick to Gelato guys instead until further notice.   :(

This place has a patio for Summer usage and 2 LCD to watch the news as this setting of metallic tables & chairs along with those classy spotlights gives this place a Cool/Hip feel that is probably more suitable to the Yonge & Eligible rather than the Young Children.

Medium Gelato(Yogurt/Passion Fruit/Strawberry, $4.50) were pretty good I guess but that Yogurt as described to me as European-style tasted quite different.  I'm thinking it tasted like Ricotta Cheese or something of that sort, I'm not exactly sure.

I wanted something clean and refreshing on the palette and the Fruity fridge was referred to me.  Strawberry was nice while Passion Fruit was okay and then that Yogurt I'll have to skip next time and forever more."}
{"text":"Another amazing gelato establishment. This place is always busting at the seams with patrons dying for some sweet Italian flavour. 

This place boasts by far the most flavours of any place I've been; pistachio, hazelnut, strawberry, and so many more. Every time I come here I get the chocolate ( I know, I'm boring) but they just do it right. The simple rich, buttery cocoa flavour just melts in your mouth. It's one of those things I get a mad craving for every couple of months. 

On a hot summer day, nothing beats this place. Just make sure you give yourself enough time to wait in line for a while."}
{"text":"A review all the way from the states! Every time i come to Toronto, i always stop by here for some of their ice cream! This place even had sugar free gelato for my uncle, (Diabetes). There ice cream is made with all natural flavors! You can even see the strawberry seeds, pistachio nuts, and raspberries mixed in with the flavors! I loved this Gelato so much, i bought 1 FULL KILO OF STRAWBERRY FOR NEW YEARS EVE!"}
{"text":"Speed read:
1) Pistachio gelato - great! (natural color, not the radioactive green color)
2) Chocolate hazelnut - not much hazelnut taste
3) Service - borderline rude

This place has one of the best gelato, especially Pistachio. 
I think Hollywood gelato has better chocolate hazelnut.

Staff is pretty rude and unknowledgeable.
When we walk in a place, we were all excited about sweet but being indecisive on what to get.

We were not the type of trying 10 flavor and can't make a decision type.  We tried one, ask about couple flavors

When we ask the staff about the flavor, we got the reply that \"everything is good, everything is popular.\"  Another staff is a little impatient with us and told us to make a choice..  It's not busy at that time, and nobody was waiting."}
{"text":"Pistachio won my heart. It's so silky and smooth.  
I got the size small, which comes with two scoops.  

My tip is if you prefer one flavour over the other, order the one you like better first.  They'll give you more portion of the first scoop than the second one."}
{"text":"Get the chocolate. It's intense, flavorful, deep and creamy. It's not cheap, but it is good."}
{"text":"In my view the best gelato in the GTA.  Certainly the best pistacchio.  very good chocolate chile too. The range of flavors is impressive as well, with few that are too out there or weird. Very clean and attractive, feels like being in Italy."}
{"text":"The hardest part of going to this place is choosing what flavours to consume. 

Everything I have tried so far has been unfogettable, and therefore added to the problem when coming back and trying to choose something new but clearly remembering the awesomeness that was had before. 

Dilemmas, dilemmas."}
{"text":"Total indulgence:

- They have gluten-free cones!

- The yoghurt flavor is both tangy and creamy-- delightful! I have no idea whether the yoghurt is actually healthier than the gelato, but I like to pretend it is. 

- Marzipan awaits at the checkout-- in the form of fruits like cherries and pears-- filled with chocolate!

- They don't laugh you out when you make feeble attempts to speak Italian. That's service!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am severely lactose intolerant.  Which as you might imagine often presents a problem when having milk-based products like, oh, I don't know, gelato, which is frozen, flavoured milk.

And yet...this place is so good that I'm willing to spend several hours praying to the Porcelain God just to have a taste of their wares.  (I now go everywhere packing Lactaid pills just in case I happen to end up at this place at the end of the day - true story.)

The gelato is freshly prepared every day, comes in about 40 flavours and is honestly so good it'll make you wanna slap your pappy.  I am not condoning violence against anyone, mind you, but damn.

One warning: if you are either lactose intolerant or obese, miiiight wanna steer clear cause it's bound to get rough..."}
{"text":"The ice cream here *was* good - not sure what's happened, but this year it lacks any flavour at all.  

I've been coming here every summer since the day they've opened, usually 1x per week.  Loved it, pricey, but worth it for home made ice cream, which in Canada usually means the junk from Baskin Robins or worst, Dairy Queen.

Is this place the best ice cream in Toronto?  If it is, wait till you go and try ice cream in Switzerland or the best in the world, Argentina.  These places make the best ice cream going by far.

Back to the review...

My usual is Chocolate and Lemon.  A classic.  Two visits this May, and both time the flavour was flat.  It was much worst then usual.  I won't be coming here anymore.  Now we go to Gelato Hollywood on Bayview about 6 blocks away.

Sorry, make better ice cream if you want us to return."}
{"text":"Best gelato I've had in Toronto! They have a good variety of traditional gelato flavours and everything tastes fresh and authentic (nothing I've tried has an overly artificial flavoured taste). Highly recommend the \"ciccolato\" for chocolate lovers. It's the most delicious and rich tasting chocolate gelato I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Gelato: 4 stars

My boyfriend and I shared a medium gelato which allows you to choose 3 flavours. We got chocolate hazelnut, vanilla with chocolate chip, and pistachio. The pistachio came highly recommended by a friend and we weren't disappointed. I think there's a smaller size for 1-2 flavours and a large size that allows you to choose 4 flavours. My boyfriend loved the chocolate hazelnut, but I thought it was only ok. The pistachio was actually my favourite. Good strong nutty flavour and not overly sweet.

Ambiance: 3 stars

Small little corner cafe with an outdoor patio area. Clean and simple decor. Nice big glass refrigerated case with many gelato flavours.

Service: 3 stars

Staff was helpful when we asked what some of the flavours were. Not fluent in Italian at all lol."}
{"text":"As a self-professed gelato-holic, I've tried most gelaterie in the city and many in Italy. This is by far the most authentic Italian gelato in Toronto. The owner is from Rome and still has two other locations there. 

Their prices are pretty well in line with places in Toronto and you can also order a bucket of the stuff to take home. Decor is modern sleek, very white and silver, and they play popular Italian tunes overhead. 

Now on to the ice cream: nocciola (hazelnut) of course is fantastic, as is the pistacchio, cioccolato al peperoncino (chocolate with chili), orange chocolate, and limone. Gelato is made with milk rather than cream and flavoured with real fruit or nuts, so it's much lighter and more flavourful than American-style ice cream. In the summer, the lines are enormous but totally worth the wait. Of course, their business goes down in the winter, but still merits a visit as they serve Nutella crepes and fantastic cappuccino and espresso too! 

Finally, this place is extremely addictive...so don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"I always prefer a Gelato guy... but the Gelato lady here Il Gelatiere is as Italian as you can get! :P Italian Mama serving me Gelato! :P

On a cold winter afternoon.. no wait and no lineup.. who in their right mind would be having Gelato aside from a bundle of toddlers.. who will have ice cream for breakfast/lunch/dinner regardless of what time of the year! Aside from kids with the poor parents...and me!

Small Gelato with 2 flavours (Pistaschio/Tiramisu) for $4. Love the Pistachio and Meh for Tiramisu.. Not cheap for a small cup...

Wearing my Down Jacket, eating Gelato, looking out at all the snow....."}
{"text":"Il Gelatiere has all the hallmarks of a typical gelateria:

* random pedestrians namedropping it from more than six blocks away
* lineup out the door
* dozens of flavours, 75% of which you can't pronounce/translate from Italian by guessing alone
* overwhelmed customers struggling to decide on a flavour
* sweating, increased saliva production and heart palpitations in anticipation of gelato consumption.

I picked up a mixed cup of fiordilatte (cream/vanilla - the original gelato flavour) and cioccolato (chocolate) as well as a tub to go. They have two sizes of to-go styrofoam packed containers and I opted for the smaller one.  They pack it super tightly with as many flavours as you like - I went fruity with banana, kiwi and lemon. They seal the container AND wrap it, then bag it and hand it to you - very professional. It was about $15 and I imagine it'll last a while as the quantity is quite substantial."}
{"text":"This is by far the best gelato place in town!!!

- Top-notch authentic gelatos with lots of flavors to choose from
- Friendly services, some real Italians so I imagine they know their gelatos
- Not cheap, but worth every penny
- Oh yeah, they have Italian music in the background too (really adds to the experience I tell you)

The only problem is that there are only a couple of tables and chairs outside, no patio, and a few inside.... So if you want a sitdown, you have to be really lucky!!

All in all, I give this place 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I loves me some Gelato and Il Gleatiere knows how to please! It's a family owned business who claim they are the best in town. I wouldn't dare give them a run for there money cause from the line up of happy patrons I'd say they got to be doing something right!

There's seating inside but try and get yourself a table on the patio!

Good assortment of flavours. I got a medium size which allows you to get two flavours.
Like always I like to get one fruity flavour and a chocolaty or coffee one.

Fragola - aka strawberry gelato, sweet and tart, with real pieces of visible strawberries, creamy with a little crunch from the strawberry seeds

Cioccocaffe - Chocolate and freshly made espresso coffee evenly blended. The perfect combination of my two favourite flavours! Creamy, smooth, and down right yummy!

Perhaps they really are the best in town!..."}
