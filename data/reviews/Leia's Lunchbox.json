{"text":"Outstanding cheese curds and mouth watering gourmet burgers, Leia's Lunchbox was incredible at the farmers' market.  Cheese Curds have a moment of glory where they are hot, crispy, melted, and wonderful.  At Leia's Lunchbox, you watch them pull them fresh from the fryer and hand them to you.  And don't miss out on the cookie dough!  Holy cow fried cookie dough was amazing!"}
