{"text":"It was my first time at Steak Frites and I loved it!  I went there part of a Bachelorette party and the service was great.  We all ordered the steak & fries table d'hôte and i liked that we could get smaller portions of the steak (4 oz) which ended up being more than enough.  I got the escargorts on a portobello mushroom  to start and it was delicious.  Then the steaks arrived and we were all super happy as they were all cooked perfectly to our liking. Yummy fries too! For dessert,  i ordered a crème brûlée. That was my only slight disappointment since the crème brûlée was a bit too brûlée for my taste! This is a bring your own wine place which is great!  Prices were decent for what we got. I would totally go again!"}
{"text":"we are staying at the Le Westin and someone suggested this establishment which was a short short walk away.   The steak was excellent and the scallops were very good.   Only criticism would be that it noisy."}
{"text":"Service médiocre. 3 serveurs pour une table mais il y au eu 3 ou 4 fois un délai de 10 minutes entre le moment de commander du pain, de la sauce, frites.... Manger un steak froid n'est pas agréable."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I can't believe I got stuck in a tourist trap in my own city. Just wanted to sit outside and have a steak. Wish I could say it was a decent meal. We had the 8oz steak frites and the plate was not worth $28. Don't waste your money or appetite here."}
{"text":"Amazing filet mignon and salmon dishes. Only fault is lack of air conditioning. As like numerous places in Quebec you can byow."}
{"text":"Correct. Je n'ai pas commandé de steak car je n'aime pas en manger le midi, j'ai seulement pris la soupe à l'oignon, qui était délicieuse. Le pain avec beurre est servi chaud, le service est bien, j'ai quand même exigé qu'on change mon ustensile car il était sale :-( j'ai goûté aux frites et elles étaient bonnes mais j'en ai mangé de bien meilleures dans ma vie. La salade en entrée de mes collègue était très basique. Le dessert était succulent (profiterole).

Bon endroit pour un lunch d'affaire, mais honnêtement je trouve les prix élevés pour ce type de qualité. Il manque un petit \"quelque chose\"."}
{"text":"Loved it! Amazing bone in ribeye for two, could not help knawing on the bone.  Unpretentious, yet it has all the ingredients of a great steakhouse sans alcohol, byob. Escargot and fried chèvre starters- yum. The vegetables and sides dishes were great. Green beans were crisp and perfectly cooked, mushrooms were perfectly seared and juicy. The bread was crusty and warm. The service was friendly and professional, but I also don't expect fast service - your in Montreal not the U.S., no one has their cell out, everyone is talking and enjoying their company. So, take a deep breath and enjoy the dining.if you ned to be in and out in a hour, goto a sandwich shop.  And for three diners, 2 appetizers, salad, main course with side dishes-$130usd, not bad.  The ribeye was Ruth Chris or Flemings grade; the same meal would have cost $200-$225. Would definitely go again. Note: I am a beef lover, only critique would be I ordered my beef medium and it was closer to medium well, next time I would order it medium rare, but the flavor was great and I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Ok slow service.  Food was just ok. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and bring your own wine. 
Casual to date night atmosphere. It was not busy when we went around 9pm in September and there was no wait to be seated. The waitress did a great job of keeping our water glasses filled and checking in with us. Our food orders did not take long. I ordered the lamb shank with fries and my wife ordered the filet mignon. Both dishes were good. 
Expect to pay around $50 a person for an appetizer and main course.
We recommend this place for a nice dinner date or nice group dinner."}
{"text":"What a wonderful way to spend our evening!  To start, however, we got a bit lost.  Our taxi driver wasn't familiar with the place so all he could do was drop us off somewhere on Saint-Paul O street.  The address is a bit misleading, in my opinion.  I called the restaurant and the hostess kindly talked me through navigating the streets and getting to their restaurant.  It seems to be actually located on St. Laurent street, towards the water.  Tell your taxi to drop you off at the intersection of Saint Paul and St. Laurent,  then walk 1/2 a block towards the water. You'll see it, has an awning.  We were seated right away without a reservation.  Our waiter immediately greeted us and asked which bottle we'd like to open first!  Yes, it is BYOW and we had two bottles in our party of 4.  He also brought us English menus, although the French versions are written on a chalkboard on the wall.  We had several questions about the preparation of some of the items and our waiter was incredible knowledgeable.  He provided his honest opinions and he didn't disappoint.  I had the Steak Frites served medium rare, although I would admit it was a little on the medium side.  I was really nervous about ordering mine MR, although everyone else in my party did.  Theirs was definitely more on the reddish center than mine, so I'm not sure if the waiter said something to the chef and he specifically cooked mine a bit longer.  Either way, it was one of the most tender pieces of meat I've ever eaten.  Others in my party agreed.  We also had him get us the 4 most popular deserts and we shared them - the lava cake was to die for.

I'm giving this 4.5 stars because I loved the interaction with the waitstaff.  All so friendly and even taught us a little French.  I wish I could give it 5 stars, but honestly this wasn't better than some of the absolute top steakhouses in the states.  This was similar to a Smith and Wollensky, I'd say.  I think we're known for our beef so it's difficult to expect Montreal to compare to best of the best, located in say....Omaha, NE.  Eventhough it is a chain, it's something I would definitely recommend.  The BYOW part is the best...being able to drink the wine you know you love and not paying the 300% markup at restaurants is awesome.  That alone made it worth it!!"}
{"text":"We ended up here on a drizzly evening after being exhausted from walking throughout the city. The restaurant is close to our hotel so we decided to give it a shot.

Good: Tasty all you can eat fries. Prompt and attentive service. BYOB and the hostess makes this clear when you walk in.

The salmon was prepared well. 

Mediocre: Steak was done to the right temperature on the inside and was even though out, but disappointingly did not have anything comparable to the steakhouse sear one gets at a quality steakhouse. No hash marks. To the eye, it looked like the \"London broil\" you first tried to make into a decent steak on your frying pan in your first apartment. 

Fortunately it tasted a lot better. Put a sear on that steak or drop the price - and this place gets 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere was great and the bring your own beer and wine was awesome. The only problem was that when we took money out to pay the waitress said that in \"Montreal\" you should tip 15%! Mind you we would have tipped 20% but when she said that we stuck to the 15% because she was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Steak Frites is a great bring your own wine restaurant. I love the side dish of thinly sliced French fries. It is classy and casual all at the same time. The ambiance is nice. The service is fast. The food is great love the grilled salmon."}
{"text":"good food, friendly waiters, and great location--right near my hotel! I can't wait to come back to Montreal in the future and eat here again."}
{"text":"Went to this place for an early dinner with my boyfriend before we left Montreal. Service was excellent. I like my steak medium well and it was cooked exquisitely with angus beef. Beans were good cooked. Fries were a little small but still OK. We came for steaks and they gave to us!"}
{"text":"Unlimited fries.
Had the Steak/Canard:
Steak - I ordered rare, it came rare. Good.
Canard - Not too dry, not too wet. Good.
Fries - Too soft for my liking, but it's unlimited.

Also ordered Tuna Tataki - Not bad, needs more Tuna for the price."}
{"text":"The steaks were great, the service was excellent, and the bring-your-own-wine system really makes sense considering how expensive alcohol is in Montreal. The menu is a little short, but they do everything on it very well. The only downfall is the ridiculous wait in the middle of the summer to get a table, but that is typical for all restaurants in Old Montreal. They don't take reservations for outdoor seating, but they do for indoor seating. Don't forget to bring your own wine or beer, because they have no alcohol on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor and a great ambiance. Why 3 stars??? I am a waiter and I can't believe that waiters like the one I had tonight can keep their job. Rude and had absolutely no character or expression. Never asked if everything was good. Took the order, gave us the bill and that's that. I hate being a waiter too but a job is a job, either u do it right or get out. Besides that the meat was great and I still had a great time with my girlfriend. The runner(busboy) was very good. Much better than our waiter. Will I go back to steak frite? Definitely but maybe another location."}
{"text":"The service at the restaurant was great, the food was also really good! To start off, I ordered the fried calamari and it was one of the best calamari I have ever had! There was a dill pickle sauce on the side that was really good as well. For the main, I ordered the steak frites with mushroom sauce. Let me tell you, I have no complaints about the food there at all. 

In addition, it is also a bring your own wine place! (which is always a bonus :))."}
{"text":"My first problem was that I couldn't find the entrance of the place...  The wait staff is very young and polite but can be spotty.  I sat there for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me.  

The Cesar salad was prepared in the middle of the dining room and it was quite fresh.  I had steak frites for dinner (how original...)  The quality of the meat is just ok, but for the price I paid it seems fair.  The fries are the best part - it's freshly fried and they come back to offer you seconds if you want."}
{"text":"My first memory to write this review was the next morning when I was sober and saw the charges on my check card statement.  It was clearly my first experience with a trendy restaurant allowing us to bring in our own bottles of wine.  That is not something you experience in the U.S. and by the end of our second bottle of wine I must have thought I was a baller and picked up our friend's tab as well, thankfully the food and company was worth it.

The service was nice, several people came to our table throughout the night to make sure we had everything.  Everyone at the table went with one of the specials that night targeted towards couples.  It was the 20 oz ribeye, that included salad, one side dish, and unlimted fries.

We ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was excellent, our friends went with the escargot.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium as we requested and was so delicious I had to go caveman with it when my wife was done (see photo)

This may have been a lost in translation thing, but I was surprised they did not ask us if we wanted a box.  There was some steak left over among other food, and for the price I paid I was surprised they cleaned the table in front of us without asking."}
{"text":"Après 2 visites cette semaine, je dois avouer que je suis marquée par un service peu personnalisé après 2 soupers consécutifs, étant pour le travail dans le vieux Montreal. Le premier soir, je me suis faite appeler Madame après chaque terminaison de phrase. Ce fut à la limite agressant, malgré sûrement de bonne intention. Ce soir, ce fut très peu personnalisé, sec et expéditif!! La meilleure connexion et ce à chaque visite, fut cette dame à à l'accueil! Le repas furent ok... mis à part un manque de saveur pour le steak et poisson. Une meilleure approche client ferait en sorte que vos clients d'affaires auraient le goût de revenir pour l'expérience, malgré que les repas sont corrects."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the night before flying out of Montreal. Place seemed interesting enough. Ordered French onion soup and grilled salmon dish. Soup had too much cheese for my liking but that's just a personal preference; taste of it was alright though. The salmon was apparently fried on some cheap oil because it tasted just like it. So either they had a substitute chef or ran out of normal oil, it wasn't successful in sitting well with my stomach. Fries and beans on the side - meh. Maybe I should have ordered the steak since that's part of their restaurant name."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Both the steak and the concept.

It was a lot fancier inside than I expected.  My boyfriend and I were dressed fairly casually, but it didn't seem to matter.  We wandered in on Saturday night about 7:30pm worried that we might need a reservation.  The host asked if we wanted to sit right away, but we wanted to get beer first!

He directed us to the closest place to buy beer and told us that he'd hold a table for us - how nice is that!!

We stopped into the little store, got ourselves some amazing Belgium styled brew and headed back.  We were seated promptly and were helped by the most delightful waiter.  Actually all of their staff here is amazing.  At any given point, someone would ask if were okay - it was a real team effort.

Our waiter was funny and asked if we wanted English menus.  He didn't want to assume we couldn't speak French, which was nice for us stupid Americans.  We gladly took the English menus but joked about how we could just guess what we wanted - Steak. 

He explained what the different options were.  My bf and I got the 7oz steak, which comes with a salad, vegetable (green beans) and unlimited fries.  I asked if there was cheese on the salad (that happens to me all the time) since I'm allergic.  He said no but returned a few minutes later and mentioned that the salad dressing might so offered oil and vinegar instead.  I thought this was such a great suggestion and couldn't have been more pleased with his attention to detail. 

My bf ordered the french onion soup, which was delicious!  The salads were crisp and tasty.  

They spaced out the meal perfectly.  Enough time to digest in between.  They put out delicious hot rolls on the table with butter.  I usually don't eat the bread on the table for fear of spoiling my appetite, but they were too good to pass up. 

The main course finally arrived and it was to die for.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way I wanted.  The green beans still had a nice crunch to them and complimented the steak well.  The fries were amazing - cooked to golden perfection.

It really was an incredible meal.  After we were done, our waiter took our plates and told us to relax, enjoy the rest of our beers and call him over if we wanted dessert or coffee.  Exactly what a waiter should stay to two stuffed pigs!  

Overall the experience was delightful.  We were treated like kings and queens, ate like them and in the end our bill with a generous tip was only $60.  You just can't buy this type of meal in NYC for that price.

enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went for my friend's birthday, and we were brought upstairs to a nice dining room. I couldn't find the menu and then I was told it's on the wall. So for starters, I couldn't even read the menu because the room was so dark so I just ended up getting what everyone else got: steakes frites. 
It came with a salad, it was fresh but it wasn't anything special. Giant pieces of lettuce with some sauce and 3 slices of onions on top.
The steak came, most people ended up getting the wrong sauce with their steak. Mine was really tender and the sauce was good, however it hardly came with vegetables and the all you can eat fries were so greasy they made me sick.
I then got a dessert, which was 3$ and was actually the best part of the entire meal. I was also really disappointed by the coffee I ordered too. It hardly tasted like coffee and was basically in a cup just a slight bit bigger than an espresso cup. I've had better coffee from McDonalds.

All in all, I don't think i'd ever go back there considering I still have no idea what is on their menu and I paid 40$ for a supper that I could have paid 20$ for and have a way better experience."}
{"text":"It might be a chain, but it's good. I've enjoyed it a lot on my visits to Monstreal."}
{"text":"A very good steak house in the neighborhood with a very reasonable price. And the best part, you can bring your own wine!!! I had the Filet Mignon last time and one of the best so far I had in Montreal!"}
{"text":"OH, the bread that I taste in my dreams! Salad was fresh and the salad dressing was devine! 

Everything about this meal was great. The outdoor seating was nice. As stated before the bread was amazing and came to the table warm. I would kill to live closer than 6 hours away! The steak and frites were great and a good price also. It is BYOB, FYI. I referred Steak Frites to someone who grew up in Montreal and they took  their family and everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Chateubriand for two with three signature sauces for the meat and the pomme frites was impossible to pick a favorite. The mushrooms and green beans were so good our kids ate most. No kids menu and BYOW and you can add a wonderful lobster tail to your steak for the same price as an appetiser.  The onion soup was the perfect starter or meal for kids with the mini bread loaves that are rustic pillows of heaven."}
{"text":"This is definitely a solid steakhouse the fries are excellent and the steak was high quality. The best things on the menu are definitely the appetizers and they don't charge a corking fee for BYOB. Great solid place to go if you're going with a big group."}
{"text":"First off, it's conveniently located only a couple blocks from the old port, and a couple steps off both metro square victoria and bonaventure.

For the food, my wife and I shared the 20oz bone in ribeye for 2, whcih included a salad, green beans and unlimited frites (fries) as well as some special sauces for dipping. The overall menu is limited, maybe 8 main course options that include duck confit, salmon, filet mignon, rib steak and others.  Appetizers include calamari, French onion soup, escargot, etc.  We had the soup and escargot...delicious.   Service was also exceptional, they were friendly and responsive.  I wore jeans, and when we went they were playing a hockey game on tv, so pretty casual overall. 

The best part is it's byob, and their is an SAQ in the old port and a couche tard across from bonaventure metro stop.  

With appetizer, tax and tip, figure about $50 per person. Would go again and recommend to a friend.  Provided 4 stars because they did not offer for us to take home the left overs, instead they just took everything."}
{"text":"We came here for our Valentine's dinner. This was an excellent choice.

Service: 5/5
The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and the rest of the wait staff cleared our table frequently, and brought out the food quickly. The flow of the meal was timed nicely. 

Food & Service 5/5:
I loved the warm bread they served here, this and a touch of butter made this awesome. For apps we ordered the tuna, escargot, and calamari. I really enjoyed the tuna and the escargot. Tuna was flavoured nicely and cooked perfectly with a light sear. The cheese on the snails was amazing and had that great gooy texture of melted cheese. This paired really nicely with the warm bread. The calamari was ok, I've had better at other restaurants. I think that the batter was ok, but the calarmi itself a bit underdone. Ironically enough we didn't end up getting steak here. Instead I opted for the lamb shank. This was cooked perfectly until it was almost falling off the bone. The meat was tender and flavourful. It didn't have the strong lamb taste - that you can sometimes get when ordering lamb. The rosemary sauce on the lamb was delicious. I enjoyed the green beans, which were crunchy and give the dish a nice textural element. I also enjoyed the fries, which are the thin type and they weren't too oily and had nice crunch. My boyfriend ordered the lobster with scallops and asparagus. Everything was cooked perfectly. There was this amazing lobster sauce that accompanied his dish that was creamy and had a really nice subtle lobster taste to it. After all of this we decided that there was enough room to get dessert. We ordered the molten lava cake with vanilla ice-cream. This was baked perfectly with the soft centre in the middle. 

For the entire meal with apps, main, dessert with tax and tip it came up to about $100. This is a great place to bring that special someone, or to celebrate an event. For wine lovers, you can bring your own wine and they don't charge a corkage fee.

Decor: 4/5
The restaurant is fairly big and the dark wood, white table clothes, and black chalk board signs, give the place a clean yet elegant feel. It's a great spot for both a romantic dinner or if you want to celebrate something special.

I'll be back again the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came for an evening meal in shorts/casual attire after sightseeing, which was fine. As we entered, they made sure to inform us it was bring your own wine/beer (we'd already picked up a 6 pack from a couche-tard 10 mins away). Server was very friendly, attentive and brought out an ice bucket along with frosted beer mugs, which was a nice touch.

Ordered the steak frites for $27, med-rare with mushroom sauce, which was a flavourful accompaniment and my favourite of the 3 (other options are peppercorn - good, not too spicy, and Dijon). The steak was done very nicely, albeit a thicker cut than I've had during a previous visit, but still tender. Surprisingly good value, considering I've paid $30-70 elsewhere for similar. 

Unlimited fries were ok, but loved the beans! Nicely seasoned/sautéed and gave a good crunch alongside the steak. 

At the end, they happily obliged in packing up our leftovers (other reviews indicate that they don't routinely ask you). 

Ambience is ok. The lack of table decor makes it seem a bit casual, despite being dark and moodily lit. I much preferred the light and airy decor of the one that closed down near the old port."}
{"text":"These are a chain around the city and around Canada, so look at other locations for reviews.

I was underwhelmed. The beef I had was adequate, the salad was OK, and the frites were good, but the only \"sauces\" for the frites were mayo, catchup and vinegar. I'm used to the boutique \"frites\" eatery \"Brugge\" in Indianapolis, where there are scores of sauces to choose from for your frites including a garlic aioli, and curry spice. The emphasis in this place is on STEAK and not FRITES. That's not a bad thing, and if you're hungry for some pricey red meat it isn't a bad place to go.

The nice thing about this place is that if you order a soda it is served in a chilled glass bottle and you're given a chilled glass for it."}
{"text":"The decor was nice. The place is a BYO wine type of place so since we went in hungry and unaware we didn't feel like going to find a liquor store. Skip the tuna tataki. The bruschetta that comes with it completely overwhelms the delicate taste of the tuna. My parter ordered his steak rare and it came out overdone. I had the duck confit salad and it was very delicious just the right amount of tender and crispy. The service was also good. So overall it was ok. Nice but nothing special."}
{"text":"Used to be amazing everyone would go there for bdays but now that the menu has changed its not the same. 
 
Also there were drunk guys screaming singing happy birthday 5 times over and over again I mean I love a party but settle down and the restaurant should of done something.

They put their prices up took off the best part of the plate( oven baked cheery tomatoes) 

Reuined the salad with a wedge salad when it used to be on Boston lettuce with onions.

Way to go"}
{"text":"The ribs and the service were good.. Unfortunately that was it. Both steaks at the table were under seasoned and bland. The skin on the duck wasn't nearly crispy enough and the appetizer salad was also weak. I care more because each steak dinner was 58 bucks each.. I'll pay for good meat and have come to expect the best in Montreal but this was not even close to good enough at that price."}
{"text":"Le steak était très moyen et pour 27$ + tx + tips, c'est vraiment dommage. Au goût, ça ressemblait a de la viande de mauvaise qualité et il y avait beaucoup de nerfs dans mon morceau mais aussi dans celui de plusieurs personnes avec moi.
Les frites aussi sont médiocres, peut être justifié par le fait qu'elles sont à volonté. 
J'ai très peu apprécié le message sur le menu qui dit que comme c'est un \"apportez votre vin\" il n'est pas permis d'avoir une facture sous les 20$. Je trouve cela hypocrite, déplacé et impolis. 
J'ai été aussi un peu étonné de voir que le tips était directement pris sur la facture. Je n'apprécie qu'on décide du tips pour moi cependant, et c'est peut-être le seul point positif, le service était très efficace. Sympathique et rapide, il a valu une deuxième étoile sur ma critique."}
{"text":"Apportes Votre Vin (Bring your own wine).  What a concept.  Steak and fries restaurant that doesn't serve beer or wine but recommends that you bring your own.

My husband and I enjoyed our dinner here at Steak and Frites as we were searching for a reasonable steak dinner to remind of our prior vacation in paris.  The meal came with a salad which was beautifully seasoned with a light cream sauce.  There are three steak sauces ( you can ask for all three) dijon, pepper and mushroom.  For the frites (its all you can eat) and it comes with ketchup or mayo.  We also shared the escargo (snails) and it was absolutely delicious topped with cheese.  We had a side of mushrooms and they were seasoned with pepper and parsley which was a nice pairing to our meal.

The service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't too crowded but we enjoyed our meal and savored every bite."}
{"text":"If I had Steak Frites in my hometown, I would definitely have heart trouble.  Why?  Because I'd be here every night!  

The menu is what you'd expect from a steak frites bistro:  limited and perfectly edited.  It is, after all, a steak frites restaurant, not an international buffet.  Sometimes we Americans don't get simple elegance.  If you've been to Paris, you know what you're walking into at any bistro.  A few things done well...or medium rare, for that matter.

BYO Wine means you can have wine without the typical and ridiculous restaurant mark-up.  Don't let it deter you.  It's definitely a benefit.  Take advantage of it.

Our server was attentive, funny, and even a bit flirtatious.  Smart way to earn your tip!  

The steak was tender and perfectly-portioned, served with delicious haricot verts, and a wonderful green peppercorn sauce.  Did I mention the 'all you can eat' frites?  No?  Well, come hungry, and leave happy!

Overall, Steak Frites is a winner in my book.  Now, who do I speak to in order to get a Steak Frites franchise in the US?"}
{"text":"Assez dispendieux pour ce que c'est. 
J'avais commandé une demi portion de bavette-frites pour 16$ (sans compter l'entrée et le dessert, ce qui peut montrer très haut en termes de prix). Autant vous dire que le plat ne méritait largement pas son prix, tant la quantité était faible. J'avais même encore faim après le repas pour tout vous dire.
Cependant, je note le très bon service qui était efficace (malgré une légère lenteur). Mais pour un jeudi soir et avec une faible affluence, je ne vais pas faire le difficile.

À noter qu'il y a d'autres plats à la carte : confit de canard, le steak-frites classique, pavé de saumon grillé et j'en passe.

D'autant plus que c'est un BYOW, ce qui est vraiment plaisant et intéressant.

Si vous avez vraiment faim, je ne vous conseille pas ce restaurant. Vous avez vraiment de quoi bien manger ailleurs, pour ce prix là. Seul l'argument du \"apportez votre vin\" peut jouer en faveur du \"Steak Frites\""}
{"text":"Un groupe de 36 personnes et toute les assiettes arrivent avec fève verte et une tomate cerise... Frite molle servi avec ketchup et un cup de maillot.. C'est n'importe quoi !!!! San parler de mon entrée . Pour le prix je n'y retournerai jamais le steak est san gout et très très ordinaire. Je ne recommande pas ce restaurant a personne."}
{"text":"The Village location listed under Steak Frite........read my review for that location"}
{"text":"We had the time of our lives here. Granted, we were on vacation, so this review is through the rose-colored glasses of having nothing to do but whatever we want. 

First and foremost: this place is bring your own wine. This is not uncommon in Montreal, but that doesn't make it less awesome. No corking fee and they brought over a bucket of ice right away because we brought a white. 

It's a little pricey here, but so are many of the restaurants in this area of Montreal, and this was a great place to get classic steak-frites! The service was top-notch, polite and friendly but not at all overbearing, just there when you need them. 

The steak was really nice and flavorful and the frites were thin and crispy and they brought us more when we ran out! Quelle service! We also split a MASSIVE side of asparagus... maybe it's just that they were in season but they gave us a TON, and it was the best. 

But the cherry on top was the Profiteroles. We thought we were ordering the $4 tapas plate of them but turns out we ordered the full dessert. Normally I might be sad that I suddenly had to pay twice as much but these babies were so worth it. Generous hot rivers of chocolate sauce, puffy crisp pastry, cold vanilla ice cream... they were the height of desserty fantasy. Seriously, best I've ever had. Ever. Get them. Must. 

Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Another spot that I forgot to bring my own wine...quick 4 block or so walk and I was back to sit down for dinner!

I had steak.  With beaucoup des frites.  The steak was actually quite awesome...I ate the St Paul, wow, surprised me how tasty it was!  Then there are unlimited fries, and when they say unlimited I feel it my duty to at least have a second helping...and since I was already so stuffed I ate desert as well...

The place lost my reservation, but it ended up that I didn't need one for 6 people anyways on a Tuesday night.  Still, a bit annoying.

All in all was very good.  I would return here."}
{"text":"This was a good spot for old-fashioned steak and frites (French fries).  This is no frills and I liked that.  The only thing that was a surprise was the price point - it was pretty high for a place that came off as a bit casual. The service was good and attentive and I left a satisfied customer.

Also, as a note, no wine, but they welcome bringing your own bottle."}
{"text":"Ate at the Boul St-Laurent location in Montreal and had a very good experience. They know how to make a very tasty medium rare steak et frites. If you get the \"table d'hôte\" (host's table) you get all you can eat french fries and dessert. For appetizer we had the \"escargots gratinés sur portobello\" (au gratin snails over portobello, topped with emmenthaler) and they were great. Had the Napoleon for dessert and it was the weak portion of the meal, not being as flaky as I'm used to in Europe. Yet a great experience I'd recommend."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I kind of expected it to be as good as the food in Paris since it's Parisian themed, but it was ok. The fries were overcooked and oily and the steak was fine, but kind of bland. The service was A+, but the food was OK. There are definitely better places in Montreal to eat, especially a couple blocks down in the Historic part."}
{"text":"Aprés mon examen, mes amis et moi-même décidons d'aller manger un ptit bout ! Réfléchir, ça creuse ! Un de mes amis propose donc le Steak Frites St-Paul ! A première vue, d'extérieur ça à l'air sympa ! Une fois arrivés en haut, oú se trouve la salle de restaurant, là, je vois, tables nappées et bien dressés (ce que je n'aime particulièrement pas, j'ai l'impression de devoir manger avec le ptit doigt levé), bref passons, et décor assez vieillot. 

Le midi, ils offrent une petite carte avec des plats (simples) à des prix tout à fait abordables, ouf car j'ai eu peur en arrivant. J'opterais pour un simple hamburger avec frites pour à peine 10$. Un peu plus tard, mon assiette arrive et rien qu'à l'apparence je me dis: ouille ça ne va pas être terrible ! Et en effet, ça ne valait même pas un bon burger de fast food et les frites pareilles ! Encore une fois, je préfère payer plus cher mais au moins en avoir pour mon argent. Donc premier hic ! 

Deuxièmement hic, mon amie commande un hamburger au poisson frit et demande bien à la serveuse ce qu'il y a dans ce dernier et on ne lui mentionne pas qu'il y a du fromage, or elle a une intolérance au lactose donc une fois l'assiette à table, elle demande pour en avoir un autre sans fromage. Bon, ça, ce n'est rien de très grave! Toutefois, lorsqu'on lui amène son assiette pour la 2ème fois, elle se rend compte qu' ils n'ont fait que gratter vite fait le fromage fondu et hop resservi comme ça !  Pas très correcte et on remballe l'assiette ! Pendant ce temps, nous, nous avions quasiment fini de manger ! 

Pour rattraper le coup, ils nous ont offert quelques cupcakes en dessert. Mais non, je ne me fait pas amadouer aussi facilement avec quelques petits gâteaux.

Peut-être un coup de malchance ce jour là? Les plats offerts en soirée sont peut être d'un niveau supérieur ?! Ça reste à tester mais pour le midi passez votre chemin."}
{"text":"Ce Steak frites est l'original et selon moi le meilleur de la franchise. Il fût complètement rénové, il est plusieurs fois plus grand. Ainsi il est conforme avec le reste de la bannière. Malheureusement, cela lui fait perdre un peu de son cachet, les salles étant beaucoup plus grandes. Si vous faites la demande, vous pouvez encore prendre place dans la salle originale. Par contre pour les groupes, de toutes tailles, c'est maintenant l'endroit parfait. 

Comme le nom l'indique bien c'est un restaurant pour le steak frites. Le meilleur rapport qualité-prix en ville pour ce type de gastronomie et de beaucoup meilleur que les grandes chaînes. Les portions sont généreuses et raisonnables, en plus les frites sont à volonté!!  Si le steak n'est pas pour vous, l'on vous offre salades, poissons et fruits de mer. 

Petit conseil, si vous prenez le steak, la sauce aux champions est simplement sublime. Il y a aussi une petite salade qui est servie avant l'assiette principale. 

Le décore de style bistro français avec menu à l'ardoise, lui confère une atmosphère chaleureuse et accueillante. 

Depuis maintenant plusieurs années c'est apporté votre vin. Si vous l'oubliez à quelques pas vers l'ouest sur Saint-Paul l'Aviron Super Dépanneur (http://fr.yelp.ca/biz/aviron-super-depanneur-montreal) qui peux vous sauver. Il y a une section SAQ Alimentation. Ce n'est pas l'idéal, mais c'est mieux que de l'eau."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big fan, actually. It was our first time to Le Steak Frites and a very cheerful staff sat us and explained (Laughing about us preferring English too..but in a cute, not chastising way) to us how the menu worked. We then were nearly immediately offered bread and salad by a smiling woman who wouldn't try English with us. Our regular waitress was however more than happy to speak in English with us, and didn't even laugh at our pitiful attempts at French. 
The chorizo from the tapas menu was delivered steaming hot, and was one of the more palatable (I *hate* chorizo but was too tired to remind my boyfriend of this fact) that I've tried, but I only took one bite. Our steaks arrived quite soon after. It was a pretty good quality steak (reflected in the price) and cooked nearly perfectly to order. Mine was just past where I had ordered it, but not so much so I felt compelled to send it back. It really was if the cook just left it on for 30 seconds too long and it started going toward medium.  But it really wasn't that big of a deal to me.
If your fry bowl becomes empty, you can expect a man with a giant silver bowl of fries to stop by and offer you more. It is unlimited fries, so don't be shy. You'll also get mayo and ketchup for dipping .
Our after dinner espressos were pretty good as well. I'd definitely go back.

BTW: It is a BYOB establishment, but there is a convenience store very close by if you don't have anything and want something. Otherwise they do serve a fair amount of soft drinks."}
{"text":"The good: The waiter saw us empty handed and was nice enough to remind us that its a BYOW and advise us on the nearest SAQ. The beef tartar was quite tasty, and our steaks were perfectly cooked. They'll make you love veggies, I swear those green beans must be boiled in butter or something.

The bad: The goat cheese app left something to be desired. Not a great portion, and an improper fried-to-cheese ratio. The fries are all-you-can-eat, which might explain why they were pretty awful. I mean, I love all kinds of junk foods, and fried/unhealthy items like fries are irresistible to me. So when I hand you back a plate with 80% of the fries you gave me still on it, there is a PROBLEM. The fries thing stuck in my mind as I particularly noticed it by the end of my meal. To add insult in injury, the creme brulee we ordered wasn't even fired to order. It was put in the fridge post-\"brulee\" which meant instead of a nice crispy caramelized crust right on top that you can crack into, we got a soggy burned sugar that needed to be scraped off our dessert, which tasted mediocre anyways.

I still love the brand, but mostly 'cause I'm big on BYOs. Steak is good and all but they messed up 2 of 5 dishes... barely a pass."}
{"text":"Friendly, prompt service- no complaints.  Menu actually has more to offer in terms of variety than some other steak frites bistros that strictly serve just that.  My wife loved her Greek Salad, which is served deconstructed (in pieces).  I enjoyed my Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer (fried shrimp coated/ tossed with an \"Asian inspired spicy mayo\").  

The BYOB with no corkage is definitely a plus!  Unfortunately, the most important element of the restaurant, the steak frites itself, was unremarkable- just borderline bland and the all you can eat fries left me not wanting a second serving as they were soggy... 

If you have been to L'Entrecote in Paris and expecting that experience, there is no comparison.  BTW, there happens to be a L'Entrecote in Montreal, off of Rue St. Catherine, not sure if it's affiliated w. the famous original in France.  Unfortunately, it was quite a hike from our hotel so we passed on that...Bottom line, this place is okay if you're in the neighborhood- it's not a tourist trap like many of the other nearby restaurants, but certainly not compelling enough to be a reservation destination."}
{"text":"We had a huge group dinner here of 19 people and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves! The fantastic thing about this restaurant is it is bring your own wine/beer so we brought a healthy 19 bottles with a 12er of beer! For this evening I ordered the Calimari as an app followed by the Steak Frites (St Paul cut). I ordered it rare and it came out a bit more medium rare. Served with a nice mustard sauce with some nice crispy fries! Everyone in the group seemed satisfied with a full belly! A great evening!"}
{"text":"This was close to our hotel so we ate there last night. I had the scallops (perfectly cooked) and lobster (overcooked). My mom's lobster was well cooked as was my daughter's burger. The goat cheese appetizer was tasty. Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Last meal before departing my 24 hour stay in Montreal and of course, leave it to the Americans to end up at a steak and fries joint. 

It's obvious what their specialty was but I wanted to try somthing different. A local told me they are big on duck here so I opted for the duck confit. It was good but a bit on the dry side. I like my meat more tender and juicy. 

As far as the appetizers, calamari and escargo were good. 

Next time, I'll just stick to what the sign says and get steak and fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on our last night in Montreal. We usually go to fancy steakhouses back home that cost $170 US when all is said and done. This was almost as good as those only without the price tag. I ordered a Filet mignon with a side of asparagus. My husband ordered the steak and duck with a side of the pan fried mushrooms and truly everything was delicious. I don't know why people are complaining about the frites. Both of us thought they were great. The mushrooms were out of this world, especially with the steak. The beans were great. And my filet was wonderful. My husband raved about the duck. If I had to search for something to complain about, all I can come up with is the water tasted weird and it was pretty slow while we were there and they seated everyone near the window to make the restaurant look fuller from the outside. This made it feel more cramped than it needed to be. But the food was great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Une belle terrasse dans le vieux port de Montréal, une bonne ambiance, un bon morceau de viande avec un bon verre de vin australien. Tout va bien dans le meilleur des mondes, mais quand l'addition arrive, tout s'écroule! 

Le serveur nous a proposé des plats en dehors de la carte (sur la carte, le steak 7 Oz est à 22$) comme le Châteaubriant de 6, 12 ou 14 Oz mais sans nous mentionné les prix. Vu les prix de la carte, plutôt corrects, on ne s'attendait pas à payer 70 pièces pour un Châteaubriant.

Le cadre est très agréable mais payer ce prix pour un morceau de viande, plus jamais!!"}
{"text":"We went 6 people and all took their specials. The place is dirty, food is terrible and service just OK. One star. There are many better places around."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner at Steak Frites while visiting Montreal the week after Christmas, 2010. When we arrived at about 6:30, the tables were starting to fill up. Although we didn't have a reservation, we arrived just in time, as we ended up waiting only about 15 min. while several other couples and groups arrived just a few moments after us. 

We're both fans of great (read: medium-rare) steaks, and they didn't disappoint. We shared the 10 oz. filet mignon - \"for two\" as the menu says - for about $52 Canadian. The meal was served with warm bread, a large bowl of salad, and bottomless fries. We also recieved three kinds of sauces, each of which were tasty with various flavors.

Most importantly, though, you should note that they don't serve wine, so stop by a local liquor store and pick a bottle up beforehand.  

The restaurant was highly recommended to us by someone we met at a spa in Burlington, VT, and Steak Frites did not disappoint. Just be sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had delicious steak frites and seared salmon. The half portion option was a welcome change from full 3 course meals we'd been eating during our trip. Our wallets were happy with the $16 (Canadian) price per half-sized entree. But for the server who disappeared and never returned, this would have been a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Went here last week while I was at a conference in Montreal. It is right in the downtown hotel area and thus I was surprised to see it was BYOB. I was lucky enough to go in and lunch and get a reservation for 8 pm that evening and we also found a Couche-Tard close by where we could pick up some wine.

We arrived on time and in less than 10 minutes we were sitting at our table and open up the wine (interestingly no corkage fee). I ordered the Calimari which was quite good - crispy yet still tender and I had the escargo which they give you the option of having served with grilled cheese on top, if you are into that sort of thing.

Since it is called Steak Frites I thought I would go with that ever so French meal and had the Saint Paul cut which was supposed to be especially tender and I had no complaints. The fries are served from a larger server bowl onto the plate and are soft rather then especially crispy and of course, in honor of the French focus, I had them with mayo rather than the American favorite, Ketchup. Oh, all the main courses came with a salad, which was quite fresh, and then slightly blanched french green beans and some grilled cherry tomtatoes as well, both which were exceptionally fresh though didn't really wow me.

As I was on an expense account I asked if they could provide separate checks for our party of four and that was not a problem. Overall I thought the prices were reasonable, the service was good, and the place has a nice friendly atmosphere. Definitely a place to go if you have never had Steak Frites before or you just really like red meat - bottom line, the food was good and a good value."}
{"text":"This is a solid chain that has above par food..a great menu and you can bring your own wine.  Never had a bad meal here..."}
{"text":"We ate her after the lunch hour and the restaurant was empty, so it was nice and quiet.

We ordered:

Calamari Frites: It was just okay, typical calamari. the sauce that comes with it that makes it even better.

Rillette de Canard: It was just okay and I mean just okay. Bread was stale and rillette was small and nothing to it.

Steak Frites: it was so good and the french green bean was so delicious and buttery. the frites was on point and steak was little too small, however it was good.

Salmon Tartare: really good, highly recommended. a lot of good flavor on them.

It was so close to the hotels, we were in a pinch. if we weren't that hungry, I probably went somewhere else.

Service was good though!"}
{"text":"Ideally located for  a business  lunch  downtown.  The food is good and the service is  quick..."}
{"text":"The food was good but the place looks very cheap! Not comparable with it's old location on st-paul street in the old Montreal. Was very deceived. The restaurant is only equipped with foldable chairs, cheap tables and no place mats. We have less but for the same price as before. For example, the salad was included before and now you have to pay for it. Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their online menu.  Went in and realized that their tapas menu was missing key dinner items.  

Left the restaurant after explaining to the waiter why we were doing so.  Waiter and manager gave us both unpleasant looks."}
{"text":"29 août 2012, heure du midi. En quête d'un petit coin pour dîner j'ai décidé de mettre à l'épreuve Steak frites St-Paul. Je vois au menu des tapas (on dit bien au pluriel... tapas... amuse-gueules, car tapa c'est une seule bouchée, petite). Il est clair que pour rater ce plat il faut donc servir très peu, même en entrée. C'est donc ce que Steak frites a décidé de faire. Malheur. 9 $ pour une maigre creuvette en tampura + un petit 8e de poivron rouge en tampura + un petit quart d'échalotte en tampura. Dommage. LES TAPAS sont faits même en entrée pour être servis à plusieurs dans une même assiette. ÇA commence mal.

Puis, pour VRAIMENT tester un resto de steak, il ne faut pas prendre le steak. Si je veux manger du steak, du vrai bon, je vais aller chez La Queue de Cheval ou au KEG pour moins cher mais tout aussi bon. Si un resto RATE un steak c'est vraiment dommage mais un resto qui RATE son hamburger double avec fromage à 13 $, c'est IMPARDONNABLE. Pour 13 $ vous avez 2 boulettes de steak haché bien ordinaire sans préparation, ni goût particulier ni assaisonnement + du fromage en tranche Kraft + des cornichons industriels tranchés et quelqu'autre accompagnement (laitue, oignons, etc..) servis avec des frites fines peu croustillantes sans saveur particulière et 3 petits contenants cartonnés de moutarde-ketchup-relish. Ah j'oubliais, le hamburger est servi avec un Coca-Cola ! Attention.

Pour finir, si vous payez par carte de crédit, il n'y a qu'un seul choix de pourboire 15 %, c'est tout. J'en conclu qu'ils RATENT LA CIBLE LAMENTABLEMENT et qu'on peut trouver beaucoup mieux chez KEG !

August 29th 2012, diner time. Looking for a nice corner of old Montreal, to eat something I decided to test Steak frites St-Paul. I see tapas (said in plurial form... tapas meaning many bites for a snack... because tapa is singular form for one bite only, little). It's clear to me they poorly missed the bull's-eye. If you serve so few bites, even for appetizer, you call it tapa. Bad choice. 9 $ for an all tampura appetizer : 1 shrimp (small) + 1/8 of a red pepper + 1/4 of a french chalote. It starts really bad.

Then, for a REAL test in a steak house, don't go for the steak. If I need steak I'll got to the Queue de Cheval or KEG. If a restaurant MESSES UP a steak, it's really bad. But if they MESS UP a double hamburger with cheese for 13 $, it's UNFORGIVABLE. For 13 $ you get 2 meat patties without any seasonning or particular taste + Kraft cheese singles + industrial pickles sliced + oinions and all served with shoestring fries not really crunchy and without seasonning or taste + 3 paper containers with mustard-ketchup-relish. Ah I forgot... it comes with a Coke ! Watch out !

If you pay by credit card, you only get ONE selection for tip : 15%. So I come to the only conclusion... they HAVE PITTYFULLY MISSED THE BULL'S-EYE. You can choose KEG for a better price !"}
{"text":"Mehhhhhhhhh. steak was cooked perfectly but there was no flavor. The fries only came with mayo and ketchup. While they were unlimited, they were thin cut and nothing special. I'd pass. Also, we were there for 2 hours, I understand that it's slow european style, but we were hungry and the food was too slow"}
{"text":"Chose this place for dinner because you could BYOB.  The menu was limited and food was meh. Our salads came after the entree arrived and after we reminded the server that we had ordered them.  We ordered the salmon and part of mine was undercooked. Food was not delivered to the table hot. The frites were tasty and refilled with no added charge and the refills were hot and tasted much better than the ones that came with the meal. No ketchup was provided or offered.  The coffee was not very fresh.  I would not come here again as it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Un jeudi soir plutôt calme. Un bon service, un bon plat (steak frite), viande très goûteuse et cuisson parfaite, on aimerais un accompagnement plus recherché (frite classique + haricot vert). Concernant le dessert un fondant au chocolat correcte mais rien d'exceptionnel. Concernant les autres plats, filet de dorée et filet de porc St Paul, et saumon très bon aussi."}
{"text":"Overpriced, tourist trap. Overpriced for plain everyday food.
Rude, pushy waitresses.

Don't get hustled."}
{"text":"NPS = 6

The steaks were alright and this restaurant is a BYOWine type of place.

The price we paid for the steaks was a bit much for what the steaks were.

The service was on point though.  Very nice fellow that help us tourists out.

The menu is written in chalk on a board.  Definitely make sure to bring your own wine though!

I love the concept of BYOW.  I just wish I would've known about it before coming to the restaurant (even though alcohol, wine, and beers are taxed heavily in Canada).

It was convenient to eat here while staying at the Intercontinental.

But with so many great other places in Montreal, I'd say save this place for last resort.

You can definitely have a lot of other unique places to eat around here on a short trip.  This place is just simply....okay."}
{"text":"walked in out of desperation (hunger + heat) on a friday afternoon, in search of a decent steakhouse. service was great; waitress was polite and attentive (though i find it rather too \"french\" to be asked if we had bought our wine. it's 1pm on a friday!!! xD). menu seemed \"limited\" at first glance as they only offer few things: steak, shrimps, duck, salmon, salad. but then, smaller menu probably means better quality, since it's generally preferable to do one thing and do it best, rather than trying to please everybody and ending up failing them all.

my bf & i shared a calamari appetizer ($9), and we both had steak & frites from the lunch menu, which included a house salad and coffee at $16 each. calamari is crunchy and hot; salad consists of butter lettuce and red onions in a tasty, creamy dressing. steaks were cooked right, although i felt like my bf's was more tender than mine (knew i should have gone for rare instead of medium rare), while he found the opposite true (grass may really be greener on the other side of the fence). the fries are freshly made; crispy, hot, well-seasoned. the \"ketchup\" came in a small container instead of straight out from the bottle (can you imagine?!); tasted almost like homemade, but i couldn't be sure.

desserts are $6 each; was tempted to try the profiteroles, but was too full. didn't even get to drink the coffee that came with the meal! shoulda, coulda, woulda...

this place, while nothing super fantastic, is still a good choice to have a great meal at affordable prices."}
{"text":"I love this place, byow always helps and unlimited fries aren't a bad call either ! I always have the half steak half duck plate and never been unhappy. It's always cooked perfectly! Just a bit expensive for the size. Still would recommend!"}
{"text":"La formule est très simple, le choix de plats est limité mais la préparation est tout à fait correcte. Comme son nom l'indique, l'endroit sert du bon steak et les frites allumettes sont bonnes même si elles pourraient être plus craquantes.

Pour un lunch d'affaires ou une bonne bouffe BYOB, c'est parfait. Je ne vois cependant pas l'intérêt d'y aller dans le Vieux le soir alors qu'il y en a maintenant en banlieue.

L'addition du midi est très raisonnable. Pour le soir c'est discutable pour ce qu'on a. Mais avec son vin..."}
{"text":"Quite a tasty place.  I wasn't in the mood for steak but what did catch my eye was duck confit and escargot. Both were delicious and the bread served with the meal is quite tasty. My only mistake was not bringing a bottle of wine to this place. They only have soft drinks so if you want something a little stronger, bring a bottle of wine. They're very bottle friendly and if you didn't know better, you'd swear it was a wine bar from the amount of wine on people's tables!"}
{"text":"WTF - Wow that's Fantastic! Sorry for the scare Steak Frites St-Paul. I came here with business associates, mainly because of the proximity to our hotel, the Intercontinental. Its right across the street. They are well known for their steaks, but many other options with a French flair. I had the French onion soup and the Duck Confi Salad. Both made very well and service was good. The only complaint I could think of was the noise level. Outside of that, it is on my list to return here."}
{"text":"This location of Le Steak Frites is in a nicely renovated old building, with a large patio for outdoor dining. Our server was friendly and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for steaks. My co-workers liked their filet mignons, but I thought mine was only ok... not the best cut of meat, but flavorful enough. 

The unlimited fries were really good, but if you're looking for wine here, you will be disappointed. They don't offer it... Instead, you have to go to a nearby convenience store and walk your bottle back to the restaurant. It's good for bringing your own, though, so if you're local, that could be less expensive than a typical high-margin bottle"}
{"text":"Overall very bad experience, will not return. We were ~15 people around Holiday season (we reserved so they should have known that they had big groups coming in). 

They messed my order: I asked for an app and made sure to specify I wanted the app size because it was also offered in a bigger portion. 

The food was bad, my salmon tartar was not fresh and tasted nothing. 

They forgot my friend's order. Everyone else was eating while he waited for a good 45min before THE WRONG ORDER came out of the kitchen. And that was after we reminded them 3 times. 

The entire table was eating except one person for a good 45 min! How hard is it for the server to notice that? Unbelievable. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place rocked! We happen to get 100$ gift card between two of us, so we really splurged and tried everything! We got Onion rings, Calamari & shrimp to start. All great choices, the shrimp is a little smaller but the calamari made up for it, amazing! We then each got the Lobster Scallop main dish, (around 30$ plate), it was unbelievable. Served on too of a helping of veggies and unlimited fries and salad (as if we had room)! We brought our own bottles of wine in, which is such a cool thing about montreal, and took a cheesecake to go. It was huge, and so yummy! The service was very professional, not overly speedy but I understand that comes with fancier restaurants! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We visited the Vieux-Montreal location on our first night after arriving and had a very enjoyable time. For starters, the restaurant is located inside a renovated historic site not too far from Notredame cathedral. The food was fantastic and the portion sizes were satisfying enough. The steak was cooked to perfection and the frites were as good as those I have savored in Parisian restaurants.The server makes a round or two, every so often around the tables, to refill your plate with more freshly made fries. The meal was ended with a fabulous desert. Highly recommended for first time visitors to Montreal."}
{"text":"Rarement vécu un repas avec autant de bruit ambiant. Cette place vous impose un niveau de décibel très élevé. Le service est plutôt ordinaire mais ce n'est qu'un avis personnel. Finalement, la carte est chère par rapport à la quantité et surtout la qualité de la nourriture."}
