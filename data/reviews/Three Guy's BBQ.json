{"text":"First time to be here,  but will be my last time.  This place has many types of food,  majorly BBQ meat,  but unfortunately they all tasted so bad!   All meat is not fresh,  very strange taste .   Hopefully I won't be sick tomorrow.   Good luck everyone!!!"}

We usually go to  Yang's BBQ in Markham for skewers, but decided to give this place a try because of the convenience (right by Finch station, so we can walk there from home). 

The food is  decent... not as good as Yang's or some of the other skewer places I've been to. But the portions are generous, and like I mentioned its extremely convenient for me, so I will definitely return. 

Tried a few different things:

-the chilli chicken dish came with a LOT of chicken. I've had this dish at maybe 10 different places, and never got this much chicken before. There was a great combination of flavors, BUT there was way too much salt. If they had reduced the salt, it would've been a really good dish. I still devoured it though. I'm hoping they just made a mistake with the salt this one time, so I'll give it another shot next visit. 

-few different skewers including lamb, sausage, squid and chives. The lamb skewer has more meat  than most places, and it was fairly good quality. I would've preferred a little more cumin though. Chives were good. Will pass on the other two... the sausage was just frankfurts. And the squid had a lot of sauce that didn't compliment it well... I think it was Siracha. 

-pork noodle dish was okay. Pretty average, but I wouldn't be opposed to ordering it again. 

In summary, decent food with good prices. Will return"}
{"text":"Was slightly hesitant to give this place a try at first but was happy we did. A diverse selection of dishes. From skewers to fried noodles to hotpots to dumplings, they really have something for everyone. Portions are on the small side but nothing unreasonable. All of the dishes we have ordered arrived quickly and tasted very satisfactory. 

Decent food, reasonable prices, OK ambience with slightly sloppy interiors. Overall a great place to have a few drinks with your friends.

Been here three times and will likely return."}
{"text":"Second time being here and I can say that the quality of food and service went down. Waitress was rude, food was mediocre and expensive. On top of that my stomach didn't feel well after leaving that place. I can say that I'll never step foot in there again!"}
{"text":"Second time ordering from this place. First was a seafood fried rice, lobster balls skewer and beer (its 10 buck a small pitcher). Small order just to try it out, sat on the patio to eat. Servers were accommodating and pleasant. It was great and tasty, lobster skewers had a nice spicy kick to them. VERY Reasonable price. Second time I ordered takeout, had fried rice with shredded meat (160) spicy fried chicken (105) grilled beef fillet (146). Wow! Food was great, just enough grease to let you know you ate takeout but not too much to make you sick, nice and spicy. One of the better Chinese restaurants in the area even though its fairly new."}
