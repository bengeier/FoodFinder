{"text":"Cheap good food, with good mix of Korean food.  They have a great \"Donkatsu\" or Pork Cutlet dish, which is very popular and often gets sold out.
One of the great things about Oh Geul Boh Geul is their great variety of banchan (Korean side dishes).  I regularly visit Oh Geul Boh Geul whenever I need my fix of Korean food."}
{"text":"I ordered this ginseng chicken soup and I was stunned how bad the restaurant served it. There was no ginseng nor dates or anything that the soup is suppose to have. There was simply a half, dried up, and \"freezer burned\" cornish hen soaking in tasteless broth. I just think that if the restaurant can't make a dish that's decent, it's better left not included in the menu. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here once recently and once about a year ago.

As mentioned before, they give a veritable treasure trove of banchan. The last time I went with a friend we got 11 and had about 8 the time before that.

I've tried their gamjatang (pork bone soup) and soondubu (tofu stew). Nothing too notable about it, merely competent (which isn't a bad thing). I've also had their broiled mackerel since it was only like an additional 2 dollars to get a soondobu meal with it and that was fine. Not undercooked, not overcooked. I don't really feel excited about perfectly cooked mackerel, I just kind of expect it for some odd reason.

My friend really likes their samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup) and goes on about how clean, healthy, and good it tastes (despite noting how it was better the last time as opposed to our most recent excursion).

Really.. I just enjoy having a lot of banchan so this place satisfies that craving. Price point is pretty much the same as everything else in the area (although if you think about how much more banchan you're getting, it really does provide more bang for your buck). Haven't had anything bad yet (haven't had anything great yet either) but hey, I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"When we walked in, the middle aged waitress didn't want to acknowledge us and was so unfriendly while seating us. I find this to be rare for Korean restaurants. She seemed so unhappy to be serving us. The pancake appetizer arrived and it looked so gross it was inedible. Our bulgogi hot plate arrived and it wasn't even hot! The spicy pork hot plate had barely any meat, the pork was all fat. The pork bone soup we ordered was bland and watered down. There was also extremely little meat on the bone. There are so many better korean restaurants than this place."}
{"text":"The service and food here is inconsistent, but I am a sucker for their pancakes and banchans - particularly their kimchi cumcumbers, seaweed salad, chap chae noodles, and soy beans.

The first time around my guest and I only had about 6 banchans with our kimchi pork and seafood dish. The second time around, my guest and I had 10 banchans with our pork bone soup and white fish stew. Definitely enjoyed my experience the second time around and the service was slightly better, except for the lack of tea refills!!"}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch during school with my friend since we both were craving bulgogi and on a budget but wow this place shocked me. Although the food was okay, the service was not and it was absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced. My friend asked for a refill of side dishes, but the waiter said they can only refill 3 types for the entire meal even though competing nearby Korean restaurants refill all of them. The experience continued when we were paying and waiter was complaining that we didn't give them 15% tips, so I added some more for tips. When we got our change back, I received a ghetto receipt that stated nothing except for the total of our meal. When I pocketed the change, and already walked 100m away from the restaurant, a server ran after me bitching that I didn't tip them even though tipping is not mandatory. After their rant about how it doesnt include tips, I just gave them what they wanted and placed this restaurant in my DO NOT EAT list.

In short, don't come here if you're looking for at least mediocre service or is planning to give less than 15% tips."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go during cold winter days when I could really use a good soup. Their Soon Dobu never disappoints, it has the right amount of spice and goes perfectly with the purple (wild rice) they serve. Price is also very reasonable. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"It's not the best Korean food in town. However, we keep coming to this place. Funny, eh! We come for its free 10-side-dish, affordable main dish, and quick service. It's solid!"}
{"text":"Wicked patio spot for some charcoal Korean BBQ! A Korean home feel with great food and even better prices. Drinking always acceptable here"}
{"text":"One of the Korean places I keep coming back to. They have a good variety of ban chai including the pancake. Soups are flavorful. The portions are good size. Korean bbq is not bad either but outdoor set up slightly sketchy. I'd still recommend!"}
{"text":"So many good side dishes! (Especially the potato pancake~)
Whenever I go there, it's always busy though... But I love the food. :)"}
{"text":"I love their Kimchi Chigae! Their service is good and you always get many free yummy appetizers! Very good prices too."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. 

Ordered the cold noodle dish (mul naeng myun) and the dish came out with noodles that were uncooked and hard. I usually like my noodles al dente, but this was close to being raw. Requested that they replace the dish - now instead of getting the same dish I requested another one as I figure the cook that evening didn't know how to cook the cold noodles. 

Waited 15 minutes and still the new dish did not come out. Now, I notice an old man coming out of the kitchen with the dish I ordered and figured that he was bringing my dish. To my surprise, he sits down and starts eating it himself. Asked the waitress how much longer the dish was going to take while pointing her to the old man and she says that she'll check. Waited another 10 minutes for my dish to finally arrive. Now this all happened late evening around 9 pm during weekdays when the place was not that busy.

Needless to say, I would never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best Korean restaurant in the area. The gamjatang (pork bone soup) and beef short ribs soup (galbitang) are delicious, and the number of side dishes is very generous (usually 8 to 10 plus a pancake). Try to get to know the staff and they'll treat you nicer. If you're in the mood for Korean I highly recommend this place."}

Extra information:

* Open late
* Patio in the back for Korean BBQ
* Serves lunch & dinner

Oh Geul Bo Geul is a Korean restaurant that is somewhat hard to notice even with their bright yellow store front sign. And don't even get me started with the name of the restaurant, even I have difficulty saying it sometimes let alone telling my non-Korean friends about this place.

But all jokes aside, Oh Geul Bo Geul (let's call it OGBG for short) serves home style Korean food and they do it well. Don't get intimidated with the length of their never-ending menu, just take time to read it and be thankful that it comes with color photos.


I've been to OGBG 3 times so far and tried different items everytime. Last time I went I had Korean BBQ in their back patio and didn't take any photos but I will combine photos from my first 2 visits and do a post here.

Once you walk in, it's all Ajumma's (older Asian ladies) working at this restaurant. There is no fancy chandliers here nor skanky girls in tight black dress, it is def laid back and feels as if you are going to a friend's house for a home cooked meal.


Ordered: Porkbelly BBQ (Sam Kyup Sal)

* Pork belly BBQ served with mushrooms, onions and veggies for wrapping
* You cook this on a BBQ grill at your table
* Served with green onions and you can add it to your 'ssam'

Green onions with chili powder and some vinegar for you to eat with the grilled meat

Ordered: Marinated Beef (Ju Mul Luk)

* Beef mixed with veggies in a sweet sauce
* I much prefer this over Bulgogi which I find it to be too sweet
* This you also cook at your table with the grill

Ordered: Kimchi Stew (KimChi JjiGae)

* It was interesting to see vermicelli in a Kimchi stew
* The soup was just spicy enough and not too sour
* Usually you eat this with a bowl of rice

Ordered: Dumplings (Mandoo)

* These were Mul-Mandoo which means it is cooked in boiling water
* You dip this into soy sauce

Ordered: Spicy Soup (Jjam Ppong Tang)

* This is usually a noodle dish but this specific one was made without for drinking
* It makes a nice dish to order when you are drinking soju
* Filled with seafood and veggies

Ordered: Seafood Pancake (Hae Mul Pa Jeon)

* There wasn't much seafood in the pancake
* I didn't really enjoy this

Ordered: Spicy octopus & pork

* This is a table top cooking with veggies, octopus and pork
* You can adjust the spiciness of this dish
* Usually comes in 2 portions but we added an extra serving
* Because there was so much food it did take a while to cook


Conclusion: Now that I've been back 3 times and tried couple things off their menu, I am convinced that even from their never-ending menu- they serve good Korean food. It's nothing fancy but who cares when you can leave with your belly full and happy? If you like Korean BBQ, make sure to drop by and try their backyard patio which has TV and is undercover."}
{"text":"I have no idea how to pronounce the name of this mom and pop joint (\"oh gee boeggee\"??) but it seems like a reliable place to get authentic Korean food. 

I can't really tell the difference between it and some of the many family owned Korean restaurants on Yonge and Finch. I suspect only hardcore fans can really discern the nuances. 

That said, the food was fine, the atmosphere was smoky. A cheap and cheerful meal though Chowon on Drewry Ave. has a slight edge on quality."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and it was really busy. There were only two servers whereby when we pressed the ordering button, they didn't come to serve us. I would say The side dishes were there only main thing that was really delicious and stood out to me."}
{"text":"We were really excited to go to this restaurant because they have gopchang on the menu. We ordered the gop chang gui, kimchi pancake, bokeum soon dae and the chicken pa mu chim. 
We thought the gop chang would come ready made because it is a stir fried dish but we had to make it ourselves. That was still okay because we enjoy the cooking process. The issue was that the gop chang was frozen and looked like it was for a long time. My suspicions were found to be correct when we cooked the gop chang but the fatty parts on the inside never even melted. The whole thing tasted like cardboard! We complained about it to the very nice and sweet server but to our surprise, she claimed the gop chang was never frozen and suggested perhaps it was because we cooked it for too long. The soon dae plate was alright, we just felt that the liver was old and dry. The chicken pa mu kim tasted good but it's not different from any other sweet and sour chicken (it's actually supposed to be sweet and spicy but it was not spicy) from any random Asian resto. The only things we were satisfied with were the kimchi pancake and the soon dae itself. 
So, even though our server was super friendly and attentive, the food did not satisfy our need for that's the only reason we were there in the first place, not the service. 
Thank you for the great service, but our search for the perfect gop chang dish continues!"}
{"text":"I've tried pork chop BBQ, which comes with a soon tofu soup and two rices. They are not bad, and enough for two people. By the way, their side dishes are awesome."}
{"text":"My go to Korean restaurant! Great small free dishes.  Food quality if usually very good. I go back once a while."}
{"text":"My all time go to for Korean BBQ. They use charcoal so the flavour of the meat is amazing!! 

Highly recommend the Kalbi and the pork shoulder. 

The outdoor BBQ is only seasonal but you can get the BBQ inside during the off season but it doesn't taste the same as ye outdoor charcoal version."}
{"text":"We usually do lunch here during our office break.  I end up having either the hot bowl bibimbap, or the LA kalbi (ask for the purple rice).  My wife has either the cold noodles in the summer, or the spicy soup in the winter.  Fantastic stuff, along with the 7-8 side dishes that no other korean restaurant on yonge st. can match.  Free parking in the rear too."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! A treasure mom and pop korean restaurant! Lots of panchans (side disbes) and feels like home! They serve you a delicious Korean green onion pancake with every meal with the panchans. I highly recommend the Sam Gyup Sal (bbq pork belly)! It's a meal for two with lots of meat, lettuce, soon tofu soup, and rice. They are open super late till 4am! Can't go wrong with this place, my favourite Korean restaurant!"}
{"text":"The hubs keeps telling me that people love this place for its authenticity, the low prices, and the convenience of being within walking distance to the subway.  

It just seems like any other Korean resto to me, save for that ubiquitous blue-capped plastic water bottle featuring a sticker with a picture of a miniature girl group (I think it's the Wonder Girls, if anybody remembers them?).

There's a small patio area in the parking lot at the back with umbrellas for those who would like to do the sliced meats on an aluminum grill thing/Korean BBQ.  If you're hoping for a pretty view to go with your dinner though - don't expect to get that here. You're literally in the gravel-filled parking lot, although the owners did add some twinkly lights wrapped around the wooden fence.  Inside, there isn't much to say aesthetics-wise about the functional small tables and handful of small booths either.  The only mood-lighting you'll receive comes from the glow of two television screens showing Korean dramas. 

Prices are in the $10-18 range for dinner entrées, with lunch capped at about $15.  My LA Kalbi lunch (roughly 8 individual kalbi ribs plus a large bowl of rice) I believe was ~$12.  All in all, average pricing for this kind of place. 

The best thing about Oh Geul Boh Geul is the banchan/free side dishes. They offer more  varieties of these little dishes than most: a salty dish of greens, bean sprouts, kimchi, chap chae/clear glass noodles, a pickled and spicy cucumber, a whole pancake the size of your hand, plus more.  A fun place to grab some super-casual meal with friends, but somewhat tight seating and average quality."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend for a dinner. We ordered gamjatang and haejangguk. They served a good number of side dishes to enjoy along with the main dish.
The quality of the main dishes and the service that came with it were passable. I did not have issues enjoying my food. I may come back since I am in the area."}
{"text":"The worse service I have ever experienced. The food was decent though! 

I went here with my family (family of 5 including me).  My mom and my sister went in to grab a table while my other sister, dad and I tried to find a parking spot.  They had a parking lot in the rear, but it was hidden and hard to find off Yonge St.  

When we finally parked the car and went inside, I saw my mom and my sister sitting at a table that hasn't been cleared yet! That was disgusting, they have been sitting and staring at some other group's half eaten trash.  They asked for the staff to clear the table but never got around to it..  The staff even tried to give us the \"end of meal oranges\".  We just sat down! Clean the freaking table!! Please!! It took them about 20 minutes to actually clean the table and to get us the menus.  

We got the huge family dinner that came with the pork bone soup (came in a portable stove), grilled ribs (grilled at the table on a portable stove), mixed fried glass noodles and fried pork with a sweet and sour sauce.  The food was mediocre, somewhat bland in my opinion.  Another thing that bothered me about this place was the lack of table space! having two portable stoves with blazing heat blasting from them was not only a huge hazard in a small area, it was just uncomfortable! I had no room in front of me to eat, just so so cramped.  

We ended up tipping about 10% of the bill, the waitress chased after my sister and told her explicitly that she didn't tip 15%.  My sister told her that it was because the service that we received did not deserve the typical 15% tip, they were lucky that they even got the 10%.

Not going back there ever again, I don't want to stare at someone else's garbage for 10 minutes before I eat."}
{"text":"This place is SO BAD that I wrote my first review just because it was the worst experience I ever had. 

Food: The side dishes were not good, did not get pancakes like Yelpers said. For the main dish, I ordered beef bibimbap.  In my bibimbap I only got 3 pieces of beef... Seriously, THREE SMALL PIECES of beef. I remember this clearly because at that moment I all could do laugh at how bad this place was. I scooped up the three scraps of beef that could fit on a TEASPOON and held it up to my friend laughing at how THIS was my \"BEEF bibimbap\". What a ripped off.

Experience: Aside from their super miserable attitude, we sat at a cramped table next to their dumplings. They had raw meat next to us and were folding dumplings literally right beside me during dinner. 

BUT the worst part is after we paid the bill and I got up to leave, the Korean lady was still sitting beside me making her freakin dumplings. She was in my way and it was a very tight space so I said \"excuse me\". She looked up miserably at me without moving. After awkwardly standing there in silence she finally got up but she left her chair blocking me. I had to pushed the chair along while maneuvering out of the tight space. I was also holding a big parka and my purse while she just stood there and watched me. She could have pushed her chair in or out of the way when she stood up but nope she didn't, SO rude! FYI we were nothing polite to them the whole time, their customer service was just that appalling.

Overall, I will never come here again even if I was starving. They may have some good reviews but all their bad reviews are true so pay attention. 

Negative 100 stars!!"}
{"text":"Another great Korean restaurant. Super friendly staff. Amazing food. Amazing sides especially the sweet potato slices, we always ask for refills which sometimes they are reluctant to give. I love bulgogi and they not disappoint. Parking is a bit chaotic in the back. I would try to park elsewhere. However if you want free parking you'll have to contend with the zoo back there. They are often busy, try to reserve ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and most recently two days ago. Didn't even realize I've been here before until I walked in and recognised the booth I was sitting in last time. 

Anyways, I had a good experience the first time. Ordered a hotpot for my friends and I to share and were blissfully stuffed by the end of it. This time around, the service was lacking a bit. It was hard to grab their attention and the help button at our table wasn't even working.. They also messed up my order even though the lady who took my order repeated it to me. 

On top of all that, they automatically charged 10% to the bill (I don't know how that's even justified, but whatever) when the lady was tendering the amount on the credit machine.. I mean it's not that big of a deal, but at least put it on the bill instead of just entering it on the machine slyly.. 
Not sure if I'll be back, but the side items were pretty good if anything.. 

3.5/5."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch on my last day in toronto and the food is good but service is sparse if not non-existent. They have a huge menu and each come with at least 7 banchan side dishes and a potato pancake. Ive never had a pancake as an appetizer in Vancouver so I loved this little touch. Ordered 3 dishes being the dumpling and rice cake in egg drop soup which was really tasty but a little lacking in beef and too full of rice cakes. Their bibimbap was really good though and my brother seemed to enjoy his pork bulgogi hot pot with rice! 

Overall, good prices for good food in this mini korea town."}
{"text":"Small family run hole in the wall on Yonge between Sheppard and Finch. They have really good deep fried chicken with some spicy sauce.. I wish I could remember the name. I came late to meet with my party so I didn't get a say in what to order but we did get gam ja tang (which was good - not as flavourful as I'd like), the fried fish (I think mackerel) was good as well although I usually don't like it. Their seafood pancake wasn't too doughy/floury like other places I've been to so that's definitely a plus. They have a large variety of side dishes that comes with your meal so try not to get too full off that! What I didn't like was the app they served you in the beginning - it's like a pancake? It's so oily.. I couldn't barely finish it because all I could feel was how nasty it left the taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I always leave here very satisfied. One of the best parts is that they have many side dishes - one of them is even a kimchi pancake! Their seats are also in these sectioned booths, which is great if you have a group because it makes it more intimate. 

I typically order the gam ja tang and also dukboki or spicy chicken. It is always waaaaay too much food - even for 5 people. There is free parking in the back but it is often full so it would be good to come early or very late. (Or TTC to North York Centre)"}
{"text":"The food is authentic, no disptue. But the service from the tall lady who seems to be the head server? Wow. It's like we have to beg for our food! Hey, lady, this is not free food and I hate to have to remind you: we are the reason you are working? 

My hubby and I would forget and go back after a long stretch, and suffer miserably the same indigestion from having to beg for food AND pay for it! 

Dear owner: please let her go. I guarantee your business will prosper at such exponential rate, that you may not need to open till 4:00 am to bring in the needed revenue!"}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED!

The price of a kalbi (rib) is $19.99 + tax for three little pieces poorly grilled (burned) meat. Very disappointing. For the restaurant next door (Owl), adding a few extra bucks you got triple amount of meat for kalbi for two people.

The service sucks. The waitress/owner/whatever got attitude and rude. The only reason it's full of people is because of ignorant people who have no idea about korean/east asian cuisine in general."}
{"text":"Ordered two of the lunch specials (available from 12-4pm) soon tofu is always good here, and the Korean fried rice with chicken is really good too with the chicken chunks really tender.  Soon tofu is spicy but fried rice is not. This place had known to be the authentic go to places for the local korean residents In the area, and thus far has not failed."}
{"text":"the food served here tastes awful. the place is also pretty much a dump. the service is quite slow. I'm not sure why i went here again for the second time as both were equally disappointing experiences."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave place for Korean food in North York. There is a parking lot at the back and you can enter at the back as well. This place open super late I believe 3-4 am.  I love the side dishes especially the potato pancake. The Gam Ja Tang here is good and meaty. The soup itself is tasty and perfect spice.  The JaJangmyung is good as well.  I will be back here soon for sure."}
{"text":"extremely racist restaurant with poor service 
Even the old Korean lady yelled people in Chinese about some racist comments! 
Garbage restaurant"}
{"text":"Seafood soon tofu was sooo good. And they give so many side dishes. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The one thing that keeps me coming back to Oh Geul Boh Geul is the wide variety of side dishes.

Their usual assortment of banchan consists of 10 different side dishes - Kimchi, bean sprouts, tofu, chap chae, seaweed salad, and they switch up the remaining. Sometimes it's potato side dishes, kimchi cucumbers/radish, and/or peanuts with anchovies. First time I came here, I thought, \"This is pretty sweet.\" Five minutes later, I received a pleasant surprise in the form of a pajeon/pancake. This pancake is amazing. Now, I don't want to overhype this pancake. Yes, it tastes delicious, but what makes it super awesome is the fact that it's part of the free side dishes! Typically, you would have to order a pajeon off the menu. So, 4 star rating for the fact that I can get my fill pretty much solely on the 10 side dishes.

Sadly, I believe they've changed their refill policy so that you can only get a refill of 3 side dishes. But you start off with 10, so I can forgive them.

So now that I've finished my ranting and raving about the side dishes (namely the pancake), onwards with a review of the actual food from the menu, pricing and service.

Oh Geul Boh Geul's soups, stews, tonkasu, samgyeopsal and kalbi are all decent, yet very average tasting. In other words, you won't be disappointed (assuming you go in with regular expectations), but you also won't be dancing in your seat because your tastebuds just had a foodgasm. 

On the upside, your wallet will be super satisfied. Prices are a tad cheaper than the surrounding restaurants around Yonge and Finch. And prices in the area are already pretty damn cheap. 

Customer service could use some work. During peak times, it'd be nice if they hired a part-timer to help out. Every time I've been, it has been only the two ajummas who are on duty to wait the tables and work the cash register. So, service is usually a little slow, where the two ajummas won't come hustling to your table when you press the  button. Sometimes you even have to press the  button twice. 

Overall, a nice small Korean restaurant with a small parking lot in the back that provides great bang for buck. I'll be going back again because I'm hooked on their banchan."}
{"text":"If you eat here I think you're in for a good deal. Well, for lunch anyways, since that's the only time I've been. I ordered the porkcutlet (or tonkatsu), which I know, is not a very Korean dish, but I think they did a great job with it! It was a thin cut of pork, that came with a salad, purple rice, and like 10 banchans. The pork was really crispy, but I would have enjoyed it more if they went easier on the brown sauce. However, the banchans totally won me over. They were all really yummy, and some of them even had Chinese influences in them (the place also serves Chinese items I believe, and has Chinese menus). Though admittedly the pasta salad banchan was kind of funny to see. However, for the Koreans out there, my boyfriend who is Korean ordered some form of soup (forgot which) and was really disappointed. Apparently to him, this restaurant wasn't that great from a Korean perspective, so just something to keep in mind.

Despite the boyfriend's disappointment though, I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. For a bit over 8 dollars, I had yummy pork cutlet, filling rice and salad, and so many banchans I couldn't even finish. Definitely got the money's worth, and the food quality was pretty good in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food isn't particularly good but they have a whole bunch of side dishes. I've been here numerous times and no one dish really stands out. However prices are on the cheaper side."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean place to go to. They don't offer any vegetarian dishes, as it may come in contact with their plethora of meats and fish, but their food is incredibly tasty. I wasn't a fan of their beef bulgogi, as I found the meat to be very tough and chewy, but I've had no other problems. The staff can be a little hard to understand if you don't know Korean, but do speak English. The menu is in both Korean and English, explaining what the dishes are. My personal favourite dishes are the bi bim bap and the black bean noodles. The portion sizes there are enormous, and for very fair prices. Their side dishes are also incredibly delicious. The kimchi is very fresh with a pleasant crunch, their spicy potatoes and simply delicious, and the others are seasonal and exciting. They are open late (between 2-4 am) which makes this a fantastic place if you need a late night bite. Be prepared for an incredibly tiny store with a massive menu! I believe their menu has 6ish pages, and the restaurant is no bigger than a double sized dorm room. However, I definitely recommend coming here at least once, if not for the food, then for the cheery, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly; tons of side dishes! By itself, the KBBQ tasted bland, but together, quite good."}
{"text":"What up with this place? Apparently it's crazy popular (which is impressive, seeing how it's right beside the local celebrity Owl) - but I can't quite put my finger on what makes it awesome.

We arrived on a weeknight to a fairly busy restaurant, but they take reservations so we had a table waiting. I love that they give you an onion pancake to much on while you go through the menu, and who can say no to the appies? Service was hit and miss, after dropping off our food it was near impossible to flag down anyone for more appetizers and lettuce (even with the cool buzzer system). It started to get pretty frustrating, since lettuce wraps for bulgogi is essential before the meat gets cooked to a crisp. 

Other than that, the food is good. They got a patio area out back (great if it's really hot in the restaurant). The prices are reasonable. I guess it lands a 3-star overall, but just barely."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Korean food! 
Tons of great side dishes! Even a hot potato pancake they make as you sit down! Prices are amazing! Around 10$ and you will be full! Great food! Always leave happy! Outdoor seating, free parking in the back! A few private booth seats. Very friendly staff! Bathroom is tiny but I can over look that! It's the food and price that gets me going back time after time! Love this spot!!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy and full after the meal. I ordered the Pork Bulgogi Ddukbaegi (marinated pork in sweet & spicy soup cooked in a hot stone pot). It was my first time trying it yet I fell in love with the broth instantly, it came in a generous portion and all the lunch specials came with Korean black rice (or purple rather) and ban chan (side dishes). Although I think I was charged more because maybe I was foreign since I was charged $15.75 (tax included) but the lunch menu said it was $11-12.99 ish, so make sure you check the bill. Besides that I was totally happy with the food."}
{"text":"The staff here are friendly and courteous, as well as quick to fulfill your request. I had the combo, Bibim-naengmyeon with LA galbi, $23! And worth every penny. The ribs were so tender and smokey, the noodles could have been a little spicier, but they were still delicious. 

My girlfriend had the bulgogi bibimbap and it was delicious as well. Full of fresh veggies and the beef was super tender as well. 

The best thing about this fine place is all the banchan they give you. Hands down, the kimchi cabbage was the best, followed by the tofu, and then the veggie pancake. This is all so delicious and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 8/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10

There isn't much to say about this place. It's just good. Service is fine and the servers are nice.

I like the booths. Because the restaurant is kind of small and cramped in the front (I think there may be a second level - basement, maybe), it can get cold if you're sitting at the open tables near the door because there's nothing stopping the wind as people come in. 

The grilled mackerel + soup combo is a great deal at $10-11. I opted for the spicy pork ($14), which was alright, but it's literally a big plate of pork and a bowl of rice, so in terms of a balanced meal with vegetables, it's lacking. The pork was good though. 

The side dishes are pretty typical of Korean restaurants, neither more or less than your usual good Korean restaurant. 

This place was good. I'd have to try a few more things before deciding whether this place is worth the trip when there are several options in Markham."}
{"text":"This is my all time fav Korean restaurant for now. Been coming here since school. Nice family style restaurant with traditional dishes and tonnes of side dishes! Honestly, I eat Korean food for the side dishes only. 

As with most Korean restaurants the service is so-so. They are quite nice and friendly if and once you get their attention. Also I find that the system they use for customers waiting for a table is not that great or organized, which is really no system at all. But they make up for it with the side dishes! They always give the pancake and noodles and potatoes and other rotating dishes, at least 8 total. I do get full from just eating the side dishes. Our fav go-to dish is the bulgogi table cooking. The meat is generally tender and well mariniated. You can cook yourself and get it freshly cooked from the hot plate to your prefered wellness. Also comes with some yam noodles and your choice of soup! I usually get the tofu soup with seafood because it's not spicy.

The decor is a bit outdated but it's a very traditional Korean style. It would be nice if they could update it a bit. The parking lot at the back is a bit run down but at least there's free parking, if you can find a spot. This place is our all time fav and we come back regularly for our bulgogi cravings, but it does get quite busy on the weekend. We are never disappointed when we visit this little gem, except one time when they ran out of bulgogi!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. I've been to this restaurant with my parents many times in the past and it was great. Service was good, food was good, everything was good. However... my boyfriend and I came here for a late night meal yesterday and let's just say things were much different. We ordered ddukbokki and it was pretty bad. Also, there were no fish cakes in it.. which okay, I get it, they're spicy RICE CAKES but don't advertise that there's fish cakes in it if there isn't. Will admit though... the banchan and dukmanduguk were good. But let's move on to the service.... 

The service was ATROCIOUS. The worst service I've received in my entire life. The waitress was so rude.. literally tossed the banchan onto the table, acted pissed every time we called her over, and just threw the bill onto our table without a word (didn't even ask for it, we were still eating). They also didn't give me a spoon after asking twice, so I went to another empty table and grabbed their spoon. Upon seeing me do this, the waitress THEN decided to refill our utensils box but she looked so irritated doing it. We barely gave any tip and just left. Thank god they didn't chase after us or ask us why we didn't tip a lot like others have said. 

NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Went in by myself around 4pm on a Monday for a quick bite. Verdict: great food, LOTS of side dishes, reasonably priced, servers were nice

I went at kind of an awkward time of day so it was pretty quiet. They don't take credit for transactions under $20 but when I got in, I told them it was all I had and they made an exception which was nice. I ordered the kimchi and pork soup which is my usual order at Korean restaurants and it was great! I got about 9 side dishes (including a choice pancake!) to start and then a piping hot bowl of soup with a side of purple rice. Flavours were on point and I liked that this soup had some rice cakes in it as well. All in all, I had a great meal.

In terms of service, they just sat me down with some tea and more or less left me alone at that point but came right over as soon as I flagged someone down. I prefer that style but some people may see it as inattentive I suppose. Also just from observations, one of the servers didn't seem to be too great with communicating in English with a different table for some special requests, but another server came by quickly and smoothed things out.

I would definitely come back. It's a great bang for your bucks and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Oh Geul Bo Geul (OGBG) seems like a very popular restaurant. It has two distinguishing factors aside from the mystifying name which most people can not pronounce properly: 
1) A lot of the servers can speak Koreand and Mandarin, eliminating some language barrier to a significant portion of the customer base.
2) They serve ~10 side dishes

Aside from these 2 things, it's a very standard Korean place with your typical mom and pop atmosphere. You can find all your traditional and fan favourites like pork bone soup, bibimbap, and rice cake. They also have table cooking like BBQ meat and also hot pots. Their menu selection is larger than average so you're very likely to find what you're looking for. 

We had BBQ pork belly and a pork bone soup. Decent portion and Ok-prices. Not the cheapest but far from expensive. I like how the pork belly comes with some mushroom. I love mushrooms. The pork bone soup was very good. The meat was very meaty. The soup was good. The BBQ comes with a stew and 2 bowls of rice. I felt the rice was really dry. Usually I can eat Korean rice by itself. Not here. 

With so many Korean restaurants in the area, it's hard to pick a definite best. But you can't go wrong with OGBG. I'd say just hedge your bets and try a different one each time."}
{"text":"This place has excellent gamjatang and better service than Nakwon (which has great food but poor service). Hands down my new favourite korean restaurant in North York. I like being greeted by friendly faces, accommodating staff and treated nicely :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be, still is like my food court or the place to go when I couldn't think of what I wanna eat. 
Just, just, don't get me started on their service.

I could stand that they ignore you when they are busy, or you stop getting teas or they just stop refilling your side dishes. BUT! Last time they had me over the mustard sauce bottle for cold noodle. The bottle was sticky !

I still like their food, till last Friday, the rice I got looks like left over rice from the morning.  I was so disappointed, since I was the one who suggested the place and I've always ask friend to go with me.

I still love their side dishes, the cold noodle with beef ribs. Still love their pork bone soup. Still love the green onion to go with BBQ. The yellow fish grill combo is still my favorite. 

Just, the days I walk 10 mins just to get the black bean noodle are gone. 

It really become a -okay to me now. SIGH!"}
{"text":"I passed by this place once and thought it was a sketchy restaurant. But after reading some reviews, decided to try it out! 

The atmosphere is really nice and they have these cute booths on the side. Before we even ordered, we got a green onion pancake - I hate green onions, but the pancake ddnt taste like it and it was yums. There was about 8 different sides, but I only really enjoyed the japchae and bean sprouts. Ordered the Kalbi (kbbq ribs) and Dukkboki (spicy rice cakes). The Kalbi portion was huge but it was a bit pink in the middle (which I don't mind) and kinda chewy - not the best, have had better. The rice cakes were a perfect amount of spicyness but didn't have enough fish cake in it :( 

Service was kind of slow, but I went for lunch on a weekend so it was busy. However the staff are very friendly :)"}
{"text":"Came here the past weekend to grab a quick lunch -- while the quality of the sides are still good, my main dish, dare I say, was bland.  I had to add soy sauce."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with some friends. The staff was a little slow for a weekday. The pork bone soup was good but I have had better. I loved the banchan selection. I would give it more stars if the staff hadn't ignored us so much."}
{"text":"Very delicious, great value, excellent side dishes and a ton of variety on the menu. The only drawbacks:

- It would be nice if they hired some extra help! Everytime I come its clear the staff are working very hard, as this place is always packed and they are simply understaffed

- Sometimes have to wait (although well worth it)

In this area there are MANY Korean options. Oh Geul Boh Geul is my favourite go to!"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here today. My family wanted to try a new Korean restaurant at Yonge and Finch. 

Firstly, this place has amazing ban-chan (side dishes). Lots of options and a Korean pancake (nice!). 

I ordered the LA kalbi with purple rice on recommendation from one of the Yelpers here and it did not disappoint! 

When I walked in with my baby and stroller, I could tell from the expression of the ladies that they were not amused (old timey Koreans don't hold back their facial expressions lol) but they accommodated us and made room for the stroller. For future visits, I would try to just bring the car seat without the stroller because it is pretty tight. 

Will definitely be coming back to try the crab dish!"}
{"text":"Their hot pot broths are good don't get me wrong but the service needs alot of work and the other dishes that we ordered weren't so good.. had to ask for water and tea so many times cause they kept forgetting and when I went to go pay the bill I gave a TIP that I thought they deserve but the lady chased me and said your have to TIP 10% of the bill.. I was in shocked.. they need to know that tipping is what the customer thinks the restaurant or the service deserves.. I can say this will be the last time I go here I spent 85$ and got chased on a tip which isn't right"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite korean restaurant!! They give you a lot of delicious side dishes and they have many different type of soups on their menu. The price is very good, not too expensive"}
{"text":"This is ur general mom and pop Korean bbq restaurant. You can't expect service or cleaniness to be like a 5 star restaurant. The service is alright, but isnt the greatest but this could be because of the language barrier. We weren't really understanding each other lol. But they did flip out meat for us whenever they thought it was nesseccary. The quality of food is superb tho. The Sirloin beef table top bbq is amazing, it was so tender, juicy and melted in your mouth. The variety of side dishes they offered were all really good. And were unlimited refills! This meal is def enough for 2 people and at a very reasonable price ($45). I order the black bean noodle on the side cuz I've always wanted to try and I didn't enjoy it. Tasted like Italian spaghetti but with black sauce lol. I don't think I would order this again but this is my first time trying this and it could be i don't like this dish in general. I would def come back here for the table top bbq tho."}
{"text":"Open til 4am on Thursday night. We came in a little after 2am (on Friday, I suppose). Odd thought. I believe we had a bit of miscommunication at the front door (my brother asked if they were closed. The ladies running the restaurant said yes, so we left. While loitering outside deciding what to eat, one of the ladies from Oh Geul Boh Geul came out and told us we could go in and eat). Seeing as technically, they close at 4am, we still had about almost 2 hours before closing time. I'm assuming they thought he had asked if they were still open, and had said yes to that. 

Ordering. I was craving soondae (Korean blood sausage). We were a party of two, and I wasn't particularly hungry. I was looking for a snack. They had modeum soondae, which means the blood sausage plus steamed internals, for about $20. I asked if they had a smaller portion. They said that they could do that, but it would be just the sausage. That's what I wanted, so I asked them how much it would be. They said it would be the same price. Um...okay then. They're just going to give me less food. I decided not to do that. I figured soondaeguk (soondae in soup) would fix my craving as well, so I ordered that ($8.99?). In about two minutes, our server came back and told me they were out of soondae. So sad. No satisfying that craving that night. 

I ended up getting a combo which included tofu stew and a piece of grilled mackerel (on a sizzling plate) with rice for $11.99. Totally worth the price. I asked for the soup and rice to be taken to go, and that my mackerel be served to me at the restaurant (my brother was eating his entire meal there). They packed my soup and my rice very well. No spills even though the bag fell over sideways in the car. Impressive stuff. 

I'm fairly happy when a Korean restaurant gives me 7 banchan (side dishes). Oh Geul Boh Geul gave us 9. Included were a number of different kinds of kimchi, japchae, potato salad (with cauliflower. Cauliflower isn't cheap), marinated bok choy, sprouts, and soft tofu with a spicy soy sauce concoction). The kicker was that included in the 9 banchan was a piece of green onion pancake that was absolutely delicious. Freshly made, it was crispy on the edges and oh so tasty. Had I not ordered food, I think the side dishes would have made for a good light dinner.

Taste-wise, the soup was spicy (I had a spoonful of my brother's), but there was a good amount of seafood in it. The mackerel was delicious. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and the natural fish oils were plentiful. It was, however, just slightly salty. That was easily taken care of with the lemon slice they provided. The side dishes were equally as delicious.

One of my favorite Korean restaurants in Toronto. Just to show how good this place was, my brother came to Oh Geul Boh Geul a second time within that 24 hours, this time, for an earlier dinner."}
{"text":"When I visit my parents and we want to go for Korean food, this place is where we go the most.

The menu offerings similar if not the same as the many other Korean restaurants in the area (except those that specialize in Korean fried chicken or \"the golfers combo\") but what sets this one apart is the amount of sides they offer.

The potato pancake is a nice free side that is not included at many other Korean restaurants as a side. You usually get about 7 or 8 other sides as well. In my most recent visit, there were a couple of new side dishes I received but still, the total was about 9 so they must have about 12 different sides in their rotation.

The quality and taste of the food doesn't set itself apart from the other places but at least it does no wrong. Pricing is also around the same and the food comes out in a very reasonable time frame once you make your order.

Owl of Minerva is a couple of stores down and if that's where you planned on going but didn't want to deal with the lineup, you'll do right by choosing this place as a substitute."}
{"text":"There is a front door entrance and a back door entrance from the parking lot, which can be difficult to find a spot sometimes. When you enter from the back you walk by a bunch of old boxes and their kitchen. It is a small place with about 12 tables, they also have a room in the basement but it is rarely used, I have eaten down there once and its quite dark with low ceilings and not very pleasant. But upstairs is ok! not decorated just what it is. As said by many others the service can be really hit or miss, they are often forgetful and sometimes unresponsive, but when they are having a good day its not too bad however they are usually nicer to their korean patrons. Its always a mixed bag of people who eat here from families to old korean folks drinking heavily with table top cooking.

I usually get their half cornish hen stuffed with sticky rice with ginseng soup and it comes with red dates and lots of garlic - it is served boiling on their black stone bowls with a side of purple rice. The chicken soup/stock has great flavour, It feels homey and I always think this must be so warming and soothing to eat when you are sick. ($12) Their bibimbap and jampong is pretty good what you expect it to be. Their servings are always good for the price. 

The best part of the place is their side dishes, they have a large variety about 8 different ones each time. You also get a mysteriously grey pancake that is surprisingly good with crispy edges and lots of black pepper taste. Coming just for banchans is already enough reason."}
{"text":"The beef in kaibitang taste really not fresh! Has a strong weird taste. Side dishes are good. But still the soup is bad. Cash only under 20. Bad service"}

This was the 2nd time we've been here. We were craving Korean bbq but the other place we had intended to check out was too full.

We ended up getting the samgyupsal (pork belly) for 2 and an order of mandu. The side dishes were great, although I personally like my kimchi to be a little more fermented. The dumplings were good, but the sauce that came with it could use a little more flavour. The pork belly was a decent thickness, and the green onion/lettuce was seasoned to complement it well.

The service here can be a little slow, but nothing really to complain about. 

The decor and atmosphere is pretty plain and simple. 

The prices are reasonable. The combos are reasonable, the samgyupsal was ~$32 before tax.

This place has good food, but if you're not patient I can see why you may be irked by the service."}
{"text":"Okay finally found the best Korean place in Toronto that serves the best pork bone soup. The meat is very succulent and meaty they have half potatoes in and lots of spices the meat pieces are tenser and cooked right the soup and smooth and spicy at the same time. The side dishes are WOW there's 10-12 depending on day or night. Minus one star because the place is small and its easily over packed with guests and also the pork bone soup only comes in spicy. The ambience is rowdy to quiet depending on day. I am happy to discover this place and will try other food menu items."}
{"text":"My go-to Korean restaurant. 

Food 4/5
- Loads of sides including pancake and potatoes and if you ask politely (and depending who) you could get extra pancake too :p
- Me and my friends tried the Samgyeopsal BBQ platter and it is HUGE, two servings will feed 3 and it comes with a side of soup (we got Soontofu). 

Service 4/5 
- Good service, very attentive.

Check it out if you're in the area. They are also opened late so it's great for late night dining."}
{"text":"This is one of the first Korean restaurants I tried uptown and I was impressed with the side dishes, as well as their stews. The only dish I didn't like was the spicy fried chicken with green onions on top. Their gamjatang has always been delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was fine but the service was terrible, like you wouldn't believe. Everything was extremely slow and chaotic. We had to ask million times for menu, tea, water, bill etc. we were very unhappy about the service and left a small tip. Guess what, the waitress said you have to give more!!!! We explained why we were not happy with the service. And she still insisted, give more tips! Very aggressive and rude. We will never go back for sure."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a very long time, but I used to go frequently.  I'd say the only downfall is the cleanliness and speed of service.  Their prices are decent and their portions are great as well.  I would say there are a lot more korean restaurants around the area that are better now."}
{"text":"Oh Geul Boh Geul is probably the best Korean restaurant in town---well it is my first choice if I am in this area. 

First of all, I love their side dishes. They always give you min 6 sides and they are all tasty. I especially like their kimchi it goes well with everything. 

We come here often and we love it here a lot. The portion is decent, very flavourful, services are pretty good. Even when they are busy they still manage to give you a quick service. 

Will definitely come back, you gotta eat here."}
{"text":"Used to be much better.  I don't know if there is a new owner but just not as good or generous."}
{"text":"Various kinds of delicious Korean food provided here. The patio for barbecue was Really Awesome!! It was totally same as the restaurant in Korea. Some aunt staffs were very nice.

We three people ordered fish hot pot ( great portion of fresh pollack stewed with kimichi and vegetables)and bolgogi (fried marinated beef). It provided steamed rice and eight side dished for each table. All the food were very tasty. I'm really a fan.

PS. The restaurant provided parking lot for free behind."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good, but it has been on a steady decline for the last 3 years.

Their prices keep rising, and their food quality keeps declining. The service has ALWAYS been bad...like, you feel you're inconveniencing them when trying to get your order in or to ask for the bill - bad... but it was tolerable back when the food was pretty good, for a reasonable price.

The thing that kept me coming back to this place was their variety of banchan (sidedishes) I always felt they mixed it up regularly and provided a pretty good assortment with every meal ordered.

However at my most recent experience, i was a little taken aback when we asked for a refill of banchan and they said we can only get 3 extra ones, and did not allow us to pick which ones.This bothers me since we had a table of 4 people, and we all ordered a main. If we all went seperately we would have each gotten our own assortment of banchan. But since we went as a group, we had the same amount as a single person eating there. I'm not asking for unlimited refills, i'm just asking the restaurant to be reasonable.

Anyways, for the prices they're trying to charge and the service you get, there are many waaay better korean restaurants to go to. This will probably be my last time at Oh Geul Boh Guel."}
{"text":"**WORST SERVICE YOU CAN EVER GET! 

As many Yelpers have given this a pretty good review, I decided to come to give it a try while I was craving for some hot Korean soup on a chilly day.

Came here on a Saturday night with 3 others. Parking was terrible, even though there was free parking in the back, the lot is super small and quite a dead end. The lot is shared with 2 other restaurants that were beside it. There's rarely any lights in the parking besides the back lights of the restaurant itself. Once, you drive in all the way to the back of the lot and noticed there'e no parking, then it's time to test out your backing up skills in the dark. What makes it even more challenging, try to avoid the bumpiness of the road with holes all around.

The place is very small inside, 4 booths and only 5-6 tables and barely any room for you to stand while you wait. They seem really busy or rather UNDERSTAFFED. We sat down at our table for a good 10 mins and we didn't get drinks or even the menu. Good thing there was the service call button on the side of the wall, so we just kept ringing it until someone came to our table. 

We ordered the hot table bacon for 2, a pork bone soup and a beef broth soup.  Usually at other Korean restaurants from previous experiences, side dishes come fairly quick after you order. We WAITED OVER 30 MINS to get side dishes and after another 10 mins, we got our pork bone soup. The pork bone soup was COLD!!! Like I was actually able to put both my hands around the bowl of the soup and it was room temperature! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!

We told the server and all she just did was swap me another one that was coincidently coming out to the kitchen to another table. Seems like she DIDN'T CARE that the SOUP was COLD!!

As we were waiting for other food to come, we finished some of the side dishes and wanted refills, the server wasn't too friendly when we asked and told us you can ONLY choose 3 to refill. I've NEVER been to any other restaurant that limits how much you refill side dishes. Apparently as I read reviews from fellow Yelpers, they also give you a free pancake with your side dishes, which we NEVER got! =(

When we got all our foods, we had to wait for rice, which took another 5 mins for the server to bring to us. Food was decent, nothing spectacular comparing to other Korean restaurants but the amount of times we had to ask the server for things that they should automatically bring to the table just RUINS the whole meal.

You get a slice of watermelon each after you're done your meal because to help cut the MSG that they put into the soup so you won't get thirsty later on.

*Overall, I WOULD NEVER come back, food is average but SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND STAFF ARE UNFRIENDLY!!"}
{"text":"We were craving for some jajangmyun so my friend recommended that we should eat here!

Inside was tiny (like super tiny) and it can get very crowded! If you go during a busy time, expect to wait! The decor was your standard Asian wooden decor and the cute little Korean ladies knew how to speak both Korean and Mandarin! I thought that was pretty neat.

Onto the food, when we got seared we were first greeted with a plate of fresh to made Korean pancake as the first side dish and it was delicious! After that our side dishes came and holy moly, there was a lot and each one tasted good! (I especially liked the apple side dish one, it was addictive). 

It took  while for our food to come but with our banchans, we had enough to tame our empty stomachs. My friends and I all ordered the supreme jajangmyun while my other friend just ordered the basic jajangmyun. To be honest, the two didn't really have much of a difference between each other except that one was cheaper than the other.

So finally after the long wait, all of our jajangmyuns start appearing before us. It looked great and smelled great, but I'll be honest...I've had better jajangmyun at another restaurant before and this one was just lacking flavour. It tasted plain and very underseasoned. 

Overall, cute little restaurant with a lot of yummy side dishes and little Korean ladies who can speak more than just Korean. I'll definitely be back to try the BBQ part of their menu because it looked so good when the other tables ordered them."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner with a friend and it was pretty decent.  The interior is a little bit dated/old, but apart from that it's a very cosy Korean restaurant.  I got their cold noodles to try -- it's not as great as Cho Sun Ok's famed cold noodles, but it got the job done.  The noodles were a bit chewier than I expected, but overall the food was decent as well as the service."}
{"text":"Very good quality Korean food! I love this restaurant because they always offer so many sides. They also give a pancake to each table. I came here for lunch and got jampoong. It was spicy. Portions here are very large and it's hard to finish everything, especially if you eat a lot of the sides. The staff is pretty good about topping up your sides if you ask, minus the pancake (only one per table)."}
{"text":"A lovely place with authentic Korean food and delicious side dishes!
I ordered the soondubu and my fiancé for pork bulgogee bibimbap and we both loved it! I can't wait to come back for the kamjatang. I also loved their side dishes, so many varieties and they were all fresh and delicious. The woman was so sweet too :)"}
{"text":"This is our spot. We come here pretty much whenever we want to go out to eat. This hole in the wall place is charming and delicious! Our favourites are the ddeokbokki, steamed mandu (SO GOOD), grilled mackerel, bibimbap, mul/bibim-naengmyeon, and honestly most soups. The banchan is where they really shine as well, plentiful and delicious - they don't skimp.
Don't expect \"western-style\" service - the people there are sweet, just rushed! There are a few \"bad\" servers, but most of them are awesome. It's no fancy date spot, but if you want tons of good food at an extremely reasonable price, this is the place to go."}

{"text":"This was my first time dining in Toronto's new Koreatown up north of Sheppard.  I was told the culinary center of gravity had left Bloor & Bathurst and that this place in particular was one of the best, so I had rather high hopes.

This place is definitely cramped: if you don't get a booth, you may end up sharing a long table with two other parties, and it's hard to get in and out of your chair to use the restroom.  In fact, it's so crowded that apparently not all the cooking is taking place in the kitchen: the pajeon griddle is set up out in the hallway!  Kind of cute, this level of disorganization quite reminded me of many small restaurants in Seoul.  Despite being crowded, it feels airy (nice high ceilings) and bright.

On the appetizer front, it's all good.  We all know that Toronto Korean restaurants hold back when it comes to panchan.  Most places give you 3 or 4 (compared to 8-12 or more in Cali!).  And where are my tiny dried chewy fish and fermented tofu strips?!?  Here, you get at least 6 -- including sweet potato kuroke & ggakdukgi (essentially kimchi made from chunks of daikon: my fave) -- and they're of decent quality.  They throw in a small spring onion pajeon (pancake) as well, which is customary in Korea but unusual in N. America; nice touch.  (Mugubuka in SF's the only other place I've been to that does it.)

I'm sad to report that the main dishes were disappointing across the board.  The haemul (seafood) pajeon was uncooked in the middle, with little unpleasant pockets of batter around the seafood pieces.  The dough was too sticky, and underseasoned.

The LA style (cut across the bone) kalbi was not especially flavourful, and a little greasy.  The kimchi chigae (stew with tofu, pork, and kimchi) was a big letdown.  It was quite watery and not sufficiently pungent.  This stuff is really supposed to knock your socks off with heat and umame but it really just tasted like sour water.  I actually thought of asking for some gochujang (hot pepper paste) to mix in, which I've never done at a Korean restaurant in all my life.

I wanted it to be better, especially since they have some neat stuff (including ja jang myun -- thick noodles in black bean sauce) that I haven't seen elsewhere in Toronto, but it didn't live up to my hopes.

The search for plentiful panchan and delicious non-BBQ K-food continues!"}
{"text":"I had quite an interesting time at Oh Geul Boh Geul.  We initially were in the patio area for the korean bbq.  We were quite excited, because we've never ever had korean bbq OUTSIDE before.  We got out food quickly, but our stove (which was being made by the Korean owner outside, by using charcoal, was kind of slow).  

However, what happened was this: there was a sudden torrential rainfall.  Sort of like a Korean drama.  I kid you not.  You know how in most Korean dramas have this SUDDEN rainfall?  Yup, that was it.  The first thing that came across in our minds was, \"SAVE THE FOOD!\"  (I kid you not).

We got to go inside, but they didn't place us upstairs with the rest of the patrons, mainly because they ran out of seats.  So they placed us downstairs in this random room.  They provided us with a portable korean bbq thing.  We realized halfway through that we were downstairs eating with the owners (and their family).  It was pretty funny.

In terms of what we ordered?  We had the kalbi + soon tofu, and the seafood + soju.  It was pretty filling for the 5 of us in the end.  Banchans were pretty good.

Service was a little bit \"meh.\"  I think I would've had a better experience (and if they had replaced our food) if it wasn't for the rain."}
{"text":"Very good place for everyday dinner. Easily the best Korean restaurant in North York . Lots of side dishes and 'service' (free dish on the house). Service is very friendly"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food. They always have so many side dishes and their gamcha tang(pork bone soup) is the best! The place is not upscale , more like a hole in the wall but the best jumulruk(steakettes) table top cooking. It comes with lettuce and seasoned lettuce. Very authentic. Also some servers speak mandarin!"}
{"text":"I'm a korean girl who recently moved out with her chinese boyfriend. I desperately had to find a replacement for my mom's homemade korean food and thank goodness that Oh Geul Boh Geul is literally steps away from our condo! Super yummy and super cheap.

{"text":"I love coming here because of the appetizers and variation of options. It ranges from table top cooking, hot pot to regular korean dishes! 

Pros
- Price: Great pricing for the portions that you get! 
- Parking: A few parking spaces at the back which is great when your in the area where typically there is no parking or you have to use GreenP. 
- Food: The food is not bad, it is okay. I mainly come here for the appetizers though, it really makes the dish taste great!
- Service: The service is quick and the servers are very nice! 
- Hours: This place is open very late at night! Great if you wanna eat something around 2:00-4:00am. 


Foods I like
- Appetizers: There are tons of options for appetizers. I personally love the potatoes, glass noodles, kim chi and bean sprouts
- KamJaTang (Pork Bone and Potato Soup)
- BulGogi Besot Jun Gol (Beef & Mixed Mushroom roth in hot pot)
- BuDae JunGol (Combination of kimchi, ham, pork, sausage with ramen)
- SamSunJaTang (Noodle with grounded Meat, shrimp, squid, egg in black bean sauce)
- LA Kalbi (Marinated Beef Ribs)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to enjoy Korean hotpot .. fantastic food, reasonable prices and HUGE portions.

We ordered the Bul Nak Jeon Gol which was hot pot with beef sausages, octopus, clear noodles, tofu, mushrooms, Korean cabbage, zucchini, watercress, hot peppers and onions. It comes with two bowls of purple rice as well but we barely touched those. If you're craving hotpot, THIS is the place to get it. Huge portion and very generous amount of ingredients. The menu states that it can feed two people but like Chris C said in his review, it could have EASILY  fed a third person.

Another note: holy moly, they give a LOT of banchan - atleast 8 different kinds of banchan with even a huge pancake! I could get full just eating the appetizers.."}
{"text":"We all know when you go to an Asian place, do NOT expect too much of their service! This is one of my favorite Korean restaurant. It gives you most side dishes (9) and some of them you can't find from other restaurants. 

I recently fall in love with their cold noodle. They use watermelon in the soup instead of standard Korean pear which turns out really well, perfect for a hot summer evening!"}
{"text":"Took the recommendation of Justine H's review and ordered the beef sirloin (Ju Mul Luk). It was priced at $45 and the menu says it feeds 2 people but I'm sure it could have fed a third person. I like how the menu has pictures throughout. I basically pointed at the picture on the menu and before I knew it there was14 different dishes on the table (refer to picture and you will see what I mean).

The beef was top quality and you can tell by how marbleized the meat was with fat. Sadly we over cooked the meat and it didn't come out as soft as it should have been. There is always a next time to correct this.

For $45 the meal came with the beef sirloin, two bowls of purple rice, lettuce wrap, seasoned lettuce, onion pancake, an assortment of 8 side dishes and a bowl of seafood soon tofu soup. I am a big eating as my user name suggests but I guarantee this will stuff even the biggest of eaters. Come with an empty stomach if you are doing the Korean BBQ option. Its not an AYCE but I definitely ate all I could eat. You get a good amount of quality beef for the $45.

When I come back I will order the exact same thing"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant in the area. It's a cozy little space that is run by (usually) 2-3 people. On my last visit, I had the gamjatang. Flavours were rich, just a tiny bit on the salty side, and the portions were fair for the price. They're really generous with the side dishes. Be warned that they're usually busy, and there's not a huge amount of tables."}
{"text":"Family-style, tasty and good service (even when they're busy). 

I've tried many dishes in the past and I've enjoyed everything. 

They have 8 side dishes and they are all very good!

Go go gooooo! :)"}
{"text":"I have been here many times but it's a gamble each time whether or not I will receive good service and decent food.

On many occasions they are short staffed and there is a tendency for bad service. On one occasion, the lady serving my friends and I ran out because we apparently did not tip. Of course we did but she assumed we didn't because we had paid half cash and half debit.

The food is at best average. I have tried the soon tofu, dolsot bibimbap, rice cakes and some other dishes as well but none were very impressive. At times, the soups can be too salty and the kamjatang isn't spicy at all even when requested to be spicy. 

A couple of positives of this restaurant is price isn't too bad, good variety of side dishes, open late and a lot of dishes to choose from. But the negatives outweigh the positives. I definitely will not be back here when there are many other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Solid 4/5.

This is one of those places you would go on the regular since it covers all three of my main criteria for an exceptional restaurant.

OGBG was a delight and definitely surprised me when we decided to randomly come here one night. This place is all about their side dishes and the portions in which they are served in. We got a total of 9 side dishes. The good thing about these side dishes are that they also taste quite good as well and do a good job in filling you up. My favourite side dishes from OGBG are: Soft cold tofu, glass noodles and potatos. The fried pancake is also quite chewy and crispy when it is nice and toasted as well. 

For an affordable meal, the gamcha tang - pork bone soup for 2 is less than $20 dollar and comes on a barbecue dish served with lots of garnishes, dumplings, tons of potatoes and approximately 6-8 pieces of large pieces of delicious pork bone meat. This meal felt way more than enough for both me and my partner and I believe this could possibly feed 3 people or more. 

I recommend eating the dumplings as soon as they are cooked as it does fall apart when it gets boiled over for a prolonged period of time. 

Overall OGBG has covered all their bases quite nicely and I believe they deserve more credit for their pork bone soup than their neighbours next door (owl of minerva). I will be looking forward to coming here late at night knowing that they do open quite late as well. 

The reason I will take off 1 star is just the fact that the level of service is not always the greatest. The woman serving does not seem quite happy with her job. Hopefully she cheers up, otherwise regardless of the service I believe this place holds a place in my heart."}
{"text":"They have changed over the years. Down sized the side dishes, tastiness decreased, prices increased, mandatory tipping, slow customer service, I absolutely will not be back."}
{"text":"Located in the same parking lot as owl. I normally choose this over owl. They have a lot of side dishes and portions are really generous. However I do taste a lot of msg as I feel very thirsty after the meal.

Regardless still a good Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh Guel Boh Guel is but just one of the many endless Korean restaurants on Yonge st. What keeps me coming back to this location? Nothing. 

The food is decent, the service is decent, parking is considered good for Yonge st. Overall acceptable.

3/5 would return because friend's \"favourite\" Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. I did not like the side dishes tho, my friend and I only ate the pancake that tasted like dumpling skin. I ordered the pork bibimbap, it's just rice, vegetables, and there wasn't that much meat. I'm very happy that a lot of resraurants have buttons now. You press the button at the table when you need assistance, and they come. No more waving, or calling waiters over."}
{"text":"not quite too sure why this place is so popular.

first warning: the waitresses have difficulty with english. this problem was quite apparent the moment we stepped in and asked for a table of four--she pointed at various tables and said things while pointing at them...and I'm pretty sure I heard korean, english, and mandarin all thrown in the mix. we wandered around the (small!) restaurant from table to table as she pointed, confused about where she wanted us to sit. eventually we snagged one of the side booths (luckily! it looks like the tables are really small, crowded and uncomfortable) but it took them a few minutes to clear off the booth table. even after we sat, we noticed big spills in the middle of the table that had been missed.

it took forever to order. the waitresses never came around. when we tried to ask questions about the menu, she just gave us the chinese version (not particularly helpful, but we had a fun time cross-referencing the korean and chinese like some second-rate linguists).

we finally ordered and the side dishes came...with one spoon short (?). we asked for more spoons and more tea three times before they came back with a huge pitcher of tea and abundance of spoons and napkins...well, I guess that's effective.

The soju we ordered never came, even though we asked for it three times.

As far as the food went, I ordered the bibimbap, which came sizzling hot. The stone bowl was so hot for so long that the rice got really crusty and dry. I tried some of a friend's \"zha jiao mian\" (not sure what the korean is--basically chinese noodles with this kind of sauce) and it wasn't really authentic zha jiao mian either. the flavouring was all off.

either way, not a good experience, and not really tempted to return."}
{"text":"Four stars for the taste of my pork soup. Two stars for service. Three stars for price. Am I making it clear? The restaurant is okay if you are looking for Korean food simply"}
{"text":"The food here is cheap and the taste is slightly above average. Their biggest draw is the variety of side dishes but they give you a hard time for refills occasionally. The staff is very \"cool\", as in really stern and sometimes rushes you to order things but they're friendly overall."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of 7. This restaurant doesn't really specialize in korean bbq, but they certainly did have a couple options on the menu for it.  We ordered #1,2,3 off of the Korean bbq menus, and 1 of us ordered a chicken cutlet dish. The amount of meat given wasn't worth the money, IMO. Each kbbq menu item was suited for 2 people, but the amount of meat given was probably only good enough for 1 hungry person and 1 not so hungry person. Came with a soup (I believe it was kimchi jigae).

Anyways, like others have said, they provide a huge variety of side dishes, and also provide a small onion pancake dish for every 2-3 people. Their kimchi is awesome quality, they provide 2 types of potatoes, seaweed, bean sprouts, and more. They also provide lettuce for making lettuce wraps. The waitress demonstrated how to make the lettuce wraps (multiple times, to note). As others have said, the waitresses don't have the greatest English skills, but surprisingly, one of the waitresses speaks decent Mandarin. Oh, and apparently there's a Chinese menu but we weren't notified about it. 

The Korean BBQs - they waitresses come by to stir and put the meat on for you, so it's not really self serve (in terms of the cooking), as done at many Korean BBQ places. The meat quality is pretty good, and they allow multiple refills on the side dishes. The strange thing is that they serve brown rice as default (I don't even think they have white rice). 

There is even a button on each table to ring in the waitresses, which I thought was pretty cute and convenient. 

Overall a great place for some legit Korean food =)"}
{"text":"I hate to do something like this but I have to call it as I see it.  I can only give 1 star because I was never given the chance to give it anything else.

Pros:
No opportunity to experience any

Cons:
Completely ignored by staff at the door for 10 minutes

I was out with a friend looking to grab a bite before the big fight Saturday.  We stepped into Oh Geul Boh Geul and waited behind another group of 2.  5 minutes later the duo in front of us get their tables and are seated.  No one has even acknowledged our presence at this point.  A waitress walks by twice and doesn't even look our way.

Couple more minutes pass by and we're still not greeted.  We try to call someone but no one is listening.  Waitresses pass us by 3 more times and still nothing.  We give up after another 5 minutes and leave.  

I don't understand it.  The place wasn't super busy.  There were empty tables.  Hoping this was an aberration on their part but as far as this review is concerned, this is what I dealt with on my visit."}
{"text":"I would give it a negative rating if i could. The food is aweful. It is not tough to make Korean food so there is no excuse."}
{"text":"Environment: Small, stuffy hole in the wall; cleanliness is clearly not a top priority here. Washroom reeked of some awful stench. My bf advised me to avoid making a trip down there. 

Parking: A small parking lot at the back of the restaurant, though it's shared with two other restaurants. 

Service: Prompt and reasonable until the moment they process your transaction.

Food: The ban chan was plentiful, as mentioned previously by fellow Yelpers, though it was not fresh. A free scallion pancake was provided but nothing to write home about. 
My bf and I ordered 2 Kam Ja Tangs and it was served with purple rice. The soup itself could have used one more ladle of broth. Nothing to write home about.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
Bill: $20.34 
I gave the woman $25 expecting $4.66 in change ($4.65 now because of the penny), and she only handed me $2. I gestured to her to tell her that she short-changed me in which she responded very rudely \"10% tip!\" Mind you, she owes me $2.66 change which is 13% that she kept. I've been a server for many years now and I understand servers need tips. I was more than willing to tip but I want to have the option of how much I tip. She basically stole my money at this point. 

Here's another tip: $2.66 is not worth a customer not returning to your restaurant AND definitely not worth the negative word-of-mouth marketing."}
{"text":"Have not been there in years and went back this evening.  Food was so-so, panchan not spectacular except for the fresh tofu.  Champong - ok.  Yomso tang was tough.  Someone's out of control kid behind us screaming did not help the situation.  I remember when they first opened the restaurant and Halmonim from Korea (Jeolla-do, Namwon) used to oversee the kitchen and the preparation of the panchan.  Let's just say that times have changed.  Underwhelming ..."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful. Service is however extremely slow, or negligent to the point where nobody would bring us our bill after 15-20 minutes of asking (we asked two different ladies and both said yes, and never came back). And then we thought the wait just getting ridiculous and decided to go up to the front and pay. But even going up front to pay we had to wait an additional 5-10 minutes when we were the only ones up there waiting to pay. My god. These ladies love to take their time.

We had a table of four people and ordered the samgyeopsal (set for 2) and the haemool jeongol (set for 2). Both very delicious and very good portions. However the table was quite small and made our eating space quite tight... maybe we should have only ordered one type of dish. We wanted more potato side dish, and asked the lady, she said she would check if there was any more in the back, but never came back to let us know... The buzzer at our table must be for decoration, because nearly every single time we used it, nobody came by to check up on us. Sadly this place just seems very understaffed. Servers are friendly, but they are way too busy or just don't really seem keen on doing things timely."}
{"text":"Visit here regularly as they are one of the better Korean places in the area.  Prices have gone up but still reasonable.  Many apps/side dishes including a pancake that's pretty nice.  Portions are decent but is an eat and go place as they depend on high turnover.  They can get pretty crowded.  I have been seated in their basement a few times during busy periods but was still able to get service on a timely basis.  Definitely worth going if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place to come, very private if you get a booth. But loud because the restaurant is so small."}
{"text":"Another pretty decent tasting Korean place in Toronto!

What really set this place apart from other places is the sheer amount of side dishes that you get. We had 6 decently flavoured side dishes served to us before our meal came to us. Loved it!

The food is pretty decent. Oh Geul Boh Geul and it's neighbour across the road, Ottoogi, are certainly spicier than many other places down in K-town. 

The service here.... uff... They use buttons (which is fantastic) but the folks running the place seemed to enjoy ignoring us when we used it. That's not something I've run into often in Canada or Korea. The ladies running this place were more intent on eating their own lunch and watching K-dramas than responding to us. Which was baffling since helping us would have gotten us out of the restaurant faster. I have a lot of patience for slow service in these sorts of family owned joints (see my Ottoogi review), but this was a bit much.

Come here for the food, but prepare to be buzzing often."}
{"text":"I come here a lot~ 
They give a lot of side dishes (maybe 10), all of which are pretty good. And their serving size is decent. (Not huge portions) 

I really like the spicy rice cakes here, they're really flavorful and spicy! The table cooking is also really good and those are the two things I usually come here to eat :). I've tried a bunch of their other dishes including their dumplings, pork bone soup, tofu soup, jajungmyun, the deep fried chicken/pork with sweet & spicy sauce and they're all pretty decent! 

The place is pretty cozy and there's parking at the back so it's convenient to drive to!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Smaller portions over time. Service can be a little slow"}
{"text":"Not the best Korean food I've had but the portions are large and the side dishes are plentiful. We had a group of 12 and they were barely able to fit us in. One staff was very friendly but the other was easily angered. 

Lots of food, but not the best taste."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Yonge St. and Finch Ave, across the street from Metro Supermarket, 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Our server was very friendly. I always like how Korean restaurants give us banchan so we can nibble on those side dishes while we wait for our order. 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5 
Restaurant was almost full when we came here on a Saturday night. We shared a table with another group. It can also get chilly if you sit by the door when the weather is cold. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
High-quality ingredients and homemade hotpot. Very comforting and hearty for cold winter days. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
DakDoRiTang - $22.95: chicken and vegetable hot pot with spicy sauce. Suitable for 2 people and comes with 2 bowls of rice. Chicken was tender and juicy, there were rice cakes, lots of potatoes, and a few slices of carrots. I tried the spicy sauce a few months ago but it was too spicy for me. So, I ordered it as \"Less Spicy\" this time and it had the perfect amount of spice!

[OVERALL] - 4/5
I would definitely recommend this place for homemade Korean food, especially their steamy Hot Pots for 2 people!"}
{"text":"Went to one of the dozens of Korean food for (late) lunch with some girlfriends last friday.

Food: I was craving something warm so I order a kalbitang (beef soup), and my group had a jajangmyung (korean black bean noodles), o-dengtang (fishcake soup), and dwenchang chigae (seafood and tofu soup). First, we had the complimentary green onion pancake. We split it amongst our group; it isn't as crispy as chinese onion pancakes are but more on the soft, oily, and chewy side. Omg so many banchans - purple rice, kimchi, beansprouts, etc. Some interesting ones I've seen at this place and not others are potato salad and broccoli. My kalbitang was not bad, pretty standard - there were I think 3 peices of kalbi in the soup. I also tried some of my friend's food. The sauce to noodle ratio for the jajangmyung was so that the noodles mixed together were really saucy. And a heads up that the o-deng tang is spicy! Didn't expect it because the broth was white in colour but there was so much pepper put it, my friend didn't expect that it would be spicy judging from the description and looks in the menu. The dwenchang chigae was pretty spicy as well. We didn't get any desserts so I think that's only for dinner?? Price is average leaning towards the cheaper side around the area. 

Service: I don't get what people are saying about bad service?? We were immediately seated and the waitress was just sitting for the front waiting for people.  The young waitress seemed super sweet and, people, you know there is a buzzer right?? She even refilled our glasses of water without asking..But then again, I came in around 3pm so it's wasn't too busy inside. 

Atmosphere: Nothing really fancy inside. The space is small and isn't really good for large groups. Had a very home-y traditional feel to it."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant uptown to go to when i'm with a large group.  The layout of this place is typical with a bunch of tables and booths, but they also have private dining rooms downstairs that'll seat large groups of people.  If you're tall watch your head on the way down.

Kind of on the cheaper side of things, but the food has always been delicious.  I've never had a bad meal or poor service here.  Portions are generous and i haven't left hungry.  Domestic beers are cheap if you feel like having one with your meal.  Worst that's happened is they've been busy and things have been slow, but that's fairly rare (unless you go peak times like Fri/Sat night).

Parking can sometimes be a pain in their parking lot when it gets busy, but there's tons of street parking nearby so it's never been an issue.

Nothing is amazing here but they're VERY consistently good."}
{"text":"Always my favorite.  I was there late night with my friend but the service and food is always great.  My favorite is always their free potato pancake and their side dish.  Nothing can best 8.99 pork bone soup the best value tofu soup and Saba combo!!!!"}
{"text":"Great taste and friendly staff. The seafood sea pancake is thick and is not greasy with a good portion of seafood and green onion. The sauce is a tasty mixture of soya sauce and a little of spice. The other traditional dishes comes in a generous portion of meat. I really like the kimchi here."}
{"text":"Good food at moderate prices. There are plenty of options in Yonge/Finch area, but I keep finding myself returning to Oh Geul Boh Geul time after time. It can get crowded, but service is usually quick and servers are attentive, as long as you flag them down. It's open late, so that is a bonus if you are craving Korean food.

Also, it has Korean-style Chinese food. Pretty good all around."}
{"text":"Love the many side dishes they offer, especially the pancake!!! Unfortunately, they kind of burnt ours this time. We encountered no trouble when asking for a second helping of the side dishes and the ladies were nice to us overall. 

Pork bone soup was very delicious! Not very spicy nor very salty compared to some of the other places I've been but I'm more about the fall-off-the-bone meat. In that aspect, meat was very tender! It's dependant on the pieces they give you but this is second time ordering it and I've enjoyed this dish both times. 

As for the Sam Sun Ja Jang, I liked the firm chewy texture of the noodles and the black bean sauce was good too. My bf complained that the portion size is a little small; I agreed on that one. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite late night eateries!"}
{"text":"Where have you been all my lifeeeee ?!?!!

I love this place :'). It smells amazing the moment you step in. Kbbq, hot pot..pork bone soup..what to eat!! I smell all sorts of smells coming from each table and they're all eating different food. The wait wasn't too long. Maybe about 10 minutes? Service could be better. The staff are not exactly the friendliest, but who cares! When you're eating delicious food you will forget about everything else.

The $29.95 La Kalbi was so amazing my toes wiggled in agreement! We got a good amount of side dishes which included some pancake appetizer. Came with soup and ribsssssss. Mmm.. I wish there was more ribs but the meal was pretty filling for 2 people. Not stuffed to the point you'll throw up, but just full. One or two extra slices of ribs would have been perfect, but regardless it was such a satisfying meal. Definitely go for the table cooking! 

We are so coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite places to enjoy korean food! Love the many side dishes they offer and the food is never a dissapointment! Definitely try their pork bone soup and black bean sauce noodles! 

My only concern is where they cook the pancakes. It's being fried in a tight spot at the back of the restaurant. You can see it when you make your way to the washroom. It's unsanitary. All foods should be made in the kitchen and not out in the open. 

Lastly, free parking at the back which is great! Since it's always a headache to find FREE parking around yonge and finch!"}
{"text":"Oh Geul Boh Geul is one of the few Korean Restaurants I drove and walked by so often but never visit. ( I even took a photo of their storefront and uploaded that on Yelp back in Jan 2011!!)

I guess I didn't really miss much as OGBG seems to be quite similar to most of the ones I have been with similar menu selection. The banchan though looked impressive with 9 and pancake! 

I was a little full... I had a beer or 2 in a pub (it was on St Patrick's Day).. OGBG was 3rd restaurant we visited this evening... And my Yelp Friend ordered:

Budae jjigae 
- A huge hot pot of hot dogs, pork, ham , veggie, instant ramen and even a Kraft cheese
- I felt like I am back in my University years that I would just throw anything in some spicy broth and start eating, the good old days...
- Portion is enough to feed 2 really hungry people, I should come back and eat again when I am hungry! Instead I just stared at the food.......

Service here is homey! The Korean ladies are super nice to us. 

My Yelp friend ended up packing 2 big containers of leftover to take home.  Maybe he can eat that when he sleepwalk in the middle of the night!"}
{"text":"Best gamjatang ever!!! They are very generous with the side dishes and a fruit for dessert. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Similar to other Korean places in this area; nothing crazy special, but it was a good solid Korean restaurant with good variety of banchan. Good prices, good food."}
{"text":"I ate here a while ago but I'm just getting around to posting the review now. Here's a quick summary (I use ^ to indicate a half-star and * for a full star. So, ***^ means 3.5 stars):

**** Gamjatang (pork bone & potato soup): Pretty good. The soup was flavourful & the pork bones were tender

*** Jajang myeon (noodles): Fine, nothing special, but perfectly okay if you're in the mood for this kind of noodle

***^ Grilled mackerel was pretty good.
**^ The kimchi/pork soup accompanying the grilled mackerel was flavourful but the pork was too tough 

**^ LA kalbi was so-so. Some was very burned & it was rather pricey ($22.95 for 3 pieces)

***^ We got a free potato pancake, the crispy parts were good!

Side dishes were good: kimchi was great (flavourful, intense). I also enjoyed the potatoes, glass noodles. Sliced zucchini was fine too.

Fruit: We were given complimentary watermelon to finish up the meal (during summer). This was a pleasant bonus.

The service is uneven, depending on your server. The first time we went, the service was very good, friendly. The service on our second visit was not quite as good. Our waitress was a little brusque but generally okay. Service was still helpful.

About 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The food was good, price not too high, a lot of side dishes, food came pretty fast......... 

 1. One of the side dishes had a slight rotten taste. its color looked a bit darker.
2. I left too much food so I tried to pack them as take out, but the server told me not to take the side dishes....... what does this mean? does it mean that they \"reuse\" their left over food?
3. I didnt tip them for the above reasons. When I was about to leave, the server was like, \"well someone is not leaving a tip.\" 

I will come back anyway, just be aware of the old foods. And dont hate them for complaining of the tips."}
{"text":"Seriously I will never recommend this restaurant just had a very bad experience with'em tonight. Never go back again."}
{"text":"Oh Geul Boh Geul have been one of my go to Korean restaurant for Korean Table BBQ for years and it got even better when they added a patio at the back. Being a big Korean food fan, I was so excited to be invited a few weeks ago for a tasting and got to try some dishes that I never got to try it here.

One of the reason Korean food is awesome, all the free side dishes (banchan).

Really wish we got some rice for these following 3 dishes, they are definitely meant to eaten with rice

LA Ribs - Kalbi (Short Ribs) 
~ Love kalbi, always perfectly marinated with the perfect amount of fat.

 Grilled Mackerel 

Bulgogi (beef)
~ Usually love to order the spicy version since I do find this usually too sweet for my liking. If I do eat it, I like it with some spicy kimchi.

Pork Belly BBQ
~ That's the only type of BBQ that you can enjoy indoor year round in Canada, this is cook at the table.
~ It usually comes with lettuce, bean sauce, raw garlic slices and rice which you could make your own lettuce wrap with. 
~ You'll hear a lot of people going ewww when they hear raw garlic slices but trust me, it taste perfect with the meat and sauce here.

This spicy salad  which is usually a combination of thinly slices scallions and lettuce which you eat with the BBQ meat or in your diy lettuce wraps.

Soon Tofu (Spicy Tofu Soup)
~ No one ate this somehow which is great since I love it. 
~ This is usually eaten with rice, which is great for a quick meal and lot how hot it is which is great for those cold winter days
~  I also always have the craving for an extra spicy one when I have a hangover.
  
Kang Poon Kee (Deep Fried Sweet & Spicy Chicken)
~ This my favorite drinking dish, perfect with a glass of beer or some soju (korean rice wine). 
~ Love how it's served extra saucy!

 Jook Sam Kyup Sal
~ squid spicy sauce with veggies, pork & rice cake
~ Another type of table cooking, I love to munch on every thing here and rice is added at the end to make fried rice with the leftovers in the pot.

Boo Daw Jung Gol 
~ Kimchi hotpot with all the ingredients you can think of and it will varied from restaurants. 
~ Here, there's beansprout, sausage, spam, mushrooms, veggies and of course the instant noodle.
~  It's as if you raid the fridge in the middle of the night for things to add to your instant noodle. 
~ This is the ultimate dish to end a rather heavy drinking night ;)

Dduk Bok Gi (Spicy Rice Cake)
~ With fish cake slices, all immerse in a thick spicy sauce.
~ Filling, yummy and cheap dish that I will never get tired of.


 Verdict :
~Everything is as good as always, there's a reason I have been coming back for years.
~ My faves are the Pork Belly BBQ, the Kang Poon Kee (Spicy Fried Chicken) & Jook Sam Kyup Sal, especially with the added rice at the end.
~ Can't wait to come back for patio season."}
{"text":"This resto came highly recommended by other foodie friends of mine.

So after hearing so much about it I had to check it out!

ATMOSPHERE: Very casual. Good for families or groups. The vibe is like that of Owl of Minerva.

SERVICE: Good. I went on a week night, and at the start of the evening only one server was taking care of all the tables (but I was there VERY early, like 4:30pm), but towards the end of our meal a couple more staff were there to help. 

Response time was good, and server kept our tea topped up throughout the meal. She also refilled our banchans without us asking.

FOOD: As my friend said, there are indeed a record number of banchans served: you get 10 different side dishes! 

Food was tasty. The pork bone soup and the family-size bulbogi for grill top were good. The larger combos for grill/bbq top are very large and great portion for party of 4 or more. We had plenty of leftovers from the grill top bulgogi we ordered (there were 3 of us).

The seafood pancake was average - could've been a bit drier and dense. Ours was too soft. Flavour was good though. We left with our Korean-food craving satisfied.

PRICE: Average. Pretty typical of home style Korean fare.

Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My last visit was great. Maybe because it was 3 in the afternoon on a Monday, we were the only one there. Service was great and food always good. Side dishes were extra yummy that day. The Bulnak jeongol was amazing, perfect for this weather. I will only go there only during their down time, this will ensure I get better service and better dining experience."}
{"text":"This is my go to Korean spot close to home. The owners are friendly and you get many  side dishes (which rotate) and a green pancake (I could get full from the amount of side dishes there are).

I've tried many of their stews and kbbq. Love their kam ja tang as the pork is tender and it literally comes right off.. I also love getting the army stew (with the ramen) if everyone around the table decides they want that. A bonus is that they serve purple rice. 

This place has always been busy every time ive gone (even for lunch) and there's a reason why it is. Good, cheap, and delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very homey-like feel when you walk in where all the Korean aunties warmly greet you and feed you delicious food. It comes with a complimentary onion pancake and so many appetizers (banchans)! We ordered army stew and fried dumplings and both were so good. One pro tip on the army stew is that it normally comes with ramyun (which we got) but you can also sub it with glass noodles or udon instead. The menu says the pot serves two people but the portion is more for three or four - we had a lot of leftovers and was too full to finish. I believe this place is usually busy during the night time but we came in the middle of the day so we basically had the whole place to ourselves. Overall a very good place to go if you're just craving for some delicious Korean food!"}
{"text":"Open until 4am. They have 8 side dishes! I was so excited! Got the pork one soup hoppy. Fall of the bone meat and there were dumplings the hotpot! Such a happy bonus surprise. The staff was very nice and the food was amazing! Will definitely be back for late night eats! Been here once for table cooking kbbq, it was pretty good. They have charcoal grill outside in the back porch in the summer, definitely someonthing to try :)"}
{"text":"Had a chance to try this place finally... after hearing about how great the banchan was from different people. They really do have probably the most/best banchan I've had here in Toronto so far! I also think their kimchi is one of the better ones I've had. 
The two of us ordered the same dish, dol soht bibimbap, except my friend had beef and I asked for no beef on mine.  I don't like how they use ground beef on the bibimbap.. it's just not right. It's gotta be bulgogi to be GOOD! But unfortunately, they're not the only one that do this and there are several others that cheap out and use ground beef instead. 
The dol soht bibimbap was alright, there was a good amount of veggies in the dish, but it wasn't hot enough.  I usually gauge that by how the rice gets at the bottom, and this one barely got that crispy/crunchy layer. 

The service at this place was great though, the ladies are friendly and I would definitely give this place another chance and try something else."}
