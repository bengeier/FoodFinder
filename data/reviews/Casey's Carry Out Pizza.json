{"text":"I finally tried Casey's pizza and I was extremely pleased. My favorite spot for years has been Godfather's Pizza but we no longer have one near here. Casey's pizza tastes so much like Godfather's it's unreal. No need to order extra cheese because it comes with plenty. The crust is perfect, not too thick and not too thin. My favorites are the supreme pizza and the breakfast pizza. I was hesitant to try the breakfast pizza because I was afraid the eggs would be dry and the meat would be terrible, but I was completely wrong. The eggs were perfect and the sausage and bacon (I got half and half) was perfect. I have a new favorite pizza place.

{"text":"My family loves Casey's pizza.  My favorite is the taco pizza. They have many different pizza choices.  Great place to go if you want take out.  They a Also deliver.  A must try."}
{"text":"Pizza from a gas station?   Yep !   And it is decent, too.    Ready in 20 minutes, tasty cheese, and very good garlic cheese bread sticks.   My kids were raving about this pizza and the bread sticks.  

In Mahomet, I prefer Filippo's pizza, but we will probably get this pizza as a change of pace, once in a while.

This restaurant is take-out only."}
{"text":"I was starving and had to grab something really quick so I ran into this Caseys. This is a really nice Casey's, either that or I have not been to a Casey's in such a long time I forgot what they are like.  Years ago I used to order pizza on a regular basis from Casey's but I haven't done that in years.  I picked up a slice to go with a little cup of chocolate chip cookies and a water.  All for $5!!  The pizza was hot and really good.  The little chocolate chips cookies were excellent too.

It's OK to once in while eat something totally and all around bad for you at lunch isn't it?

The people working in here were super friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Casey's is a big disappointment when it comes to pizza. Cardboard crust, lousy ingredients, and a fairly high price tag make this a poor value. I've had much better frozen pizzas, frankly. There are so many better options in the neighborhood. In fact, Filippo's is kitty corner from Casey's and has a much wider menu. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I have tried the Casey's Breakfast Pizza so that  you do not have to. It is wrong, and I was wrong for eating it. Non-spicy nacho cheese, shredded 'cheddar', eggs, sausage, 3 tbs of salt, and a pastry-ish dough. 

I love breakfast food, and I love pizza, and in the hungover state I first tried this abomination, Breakfast Pizza both seemed like both a good idea and a great idea. Few times in my life have I been so wrong. Casey's Breakfast Pizza was my Katrina."}
