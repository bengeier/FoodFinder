{"text":"Waitress Susan was pissed off for no reason, no greeting, no smiling, just tired and angry at us from the beginning. Went for All you can eat lunch. Great decor, it`s a new clean place, entrance from the parking lot, the usual food that you have everywhere else is served fresh and tasty here, reasonably priced. Happy to have them nearby!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch here today. Arrived shortly after 12:30; with only one other table seated the place was kind of empty. We stressed to the server that we were in a rush & he politely catered to our needs. Ordered the shrimp & veg tempura bento box. It was fresh & delicious and was served shortly after the miso soup. Finished off with tea. Yum"}
{"text":"Bought takeout due to location.  Worst I have ever eaten, even the most basic is crap. Fish not fresh.  Not sure how you get even good ratings. C'mon people, before you rate some place good, try to remember where else you have tried . If you have not much experience in sushi, I can understand how you can rate this high."}
{"text":"First time coming and I will definitely be back! My family came here based on a friend's recommendation. The decor was very modern, which is something we are usually not used to seeing in this area. I would get the the volcano roll, it was amazing. The fish is very fresh and buttery. Services was pleasant, no fuss. The price is very reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place. Been going to the Richmond hill location for years. So happy they opened a location in Vaughan! The all you can eat lunch is great! I would highly recommend this sushi restaurant- it's always consistent and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is our go-to dinner restaurant on a regular date night. The service is good - often checking to refill tea when needed. We like to order their bento dishes. There is one time I decide to try their green curry chicken dish with rice. It surprised me. It was sweet and spicy, just like how I like it. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went to this sushi place when it first opened. I've been to a lot of sushi places before but that was definitely one of the worst experiences I've had.   Back then this place was only serving a-la carte sushi and not \"all you can eat\". Typically this means better quality food and presentation with a heftier price tag. The price was expensive, but the food and service was god awful. We were one of only two tables in the whole restaurant. We ordered a salmon teriyaki and a sushi combo. The salmon teriyaki came and was just a small piece of fish on a bowl of rice. Quite disappointed with the sad looking presentation, but it tasted ok.   And then we waited. Waited, waited, and waited. For 30 minutes we waited for our sushi combo. The Salmon teriyaki that had come already was now cold. The sushi chef and waitress was just chatting away. Eventually we complained, along with the other table in the restaurant, who had not yet received their food either. After 10 more minutes the food came. It was subpar and uninspired.  We paid the bill, got out of there, and swore never to go back. Eventually after a while this place turned into an all you can eat sushi place. WIth that level of service and food presentation there was simply no way it would have survived as an a-la carte sushi place."}
{"text":"Came here with family on a sunday night and ordered a bunch of different meals. Although the ambience was very promising when you walk in and looks nice and clean, the service and food was the exact opposite.   beef bento box - stale salad, beef was chewy and hard and lots of tendons. seafood ramen soup - tasted worse than instant noodles spicy salmon sushi- tasted off, might not have been fresh    overall the waitress just stood there and didnt bring our drinks or give us timely service. so wouldnt come back here again."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this restaurant because of its proximity to my home. Most of the sushi restaurants I have eaten at, when you enter, the sushi chefs usually greet you with a \"hello\". Did not happen here, nor did they offer a goodbye upon leaving. We choose the AYCE option which was slightly more expensive than most other places. The sashimi offering was fairly fresh, however they did not have  some offerings which other AYCE restaurants have. All in all, I will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"My first time there was terrible, the rolls were packed with rice and falling apart, the waitress seemed annoyed was constantly on her phone,very unprofessional. I went back a week ago to give them another shot. The rolls were still jam packed with rice the quality of the sashimi was lil better but I would not go back there.they close at 10 I was there at 9 and they were rushing me out and forcing me to order at 920 not impressed"}
{"text":"crap. service was bad and the waitress was so rude. selection is bad and portions were small. there are soooo many other better places than this that's much cheaper. for the chirashi rice (basically sashimi and rice) they gave me like..5 fucking pieces.   absolutely ridiculous.  never going back cause lbh. they didn't even have freaking green tea icecream for heaven's sake! what sushi place doesn't have green freaking tea icecream?"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi place for all you can eat. For that price nice variety and quality. Not very impressed with service, they are ok. Interior is nice. We only go for lunch their for $13, but I would not spend $23 on dinner."}
{"text":"Worst I have ever eaten!  The fish not fresh!  Small portions, expensive, terrible service.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Tried this for dinner a couple of times right when it opened (not sure if it was an AYCE at that time). Came in pricey, but had few very interesting offerings (Snow White rolls), not sure if it was just a promo though. Moved away so we haven't been in a while, but if in the area would definetly stop by."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here when I am craving sushi. Nice variety and service is good. Sushi is fresh and better than most places.  Take out is quick as well and the 10% discount helps."}
{"text":"Walking in and seeing the mural on the wall immediately setup for a great after movie meal. Couldn't decide on what type of sashimi we wanted until we hit the big times and ordered the party plate 100 pieces for 4 people!!   In order of service.  Sashimi assorted set (all of them were fresh and well portioned slices, highly recommended!!) Salmon  Red tuna Butterfish Octopus (this one was on the chewy side) Whitefish Surf clam   Sushi (rice was very well seasoned, perfectly balanced the sashimi on top, score one for well prepared rice.) Salmon  Tuna Whitefish Butterfish Crab Surf clam   Maki rolls (well made, aptly sized and did not overwhelm any individual tasting aspect) California  Salmon Spider Chicken teriyaki (not exactly welcome, only one I didn't like) Sakura Green dragon Tuna  All in all a very well made and presented meal. They have won me over and will receive a repeat visit, sushi bar over all you can eat any day!"}
{"text":"I've eaten and ordered take out from Senbazuru for years and I've vowed to never go there again after this last time. For a while now, I've noticed the service deteriorate especially from one waitress in particular. As a non-Asian patron, there is a noticeable difference in treatment received. The service has gotten to a point of downright rudeness, with plates being slid across the table rather than placed. Not to mention plates and glasses are not washed well and noticeably dirty. This last time we walked into an empty restaurant and we were told to sit anywhere we liked. Only after we received our drinks and a party of 10 people (no reservations) arrived, we were asked to move. Normally, I have no problem with that but there was plenty of room in the restaurant to accommodate the group size, however, they wanted to sit together in the area where we were. Of course being of Asian descent, the request had to be accommodated. To summarize, with a influx of sushi restaurants in the area, there is no reason to frequent this place. Food is mediocre, the place and dishes are dirty and the service, as I've mentioned is completely disgusting."}
{"text":"Very cozy place with darker lighting than most.  I went for a dinner with 14 guests.  Price: For dinner ranging from 7.99-13.99 very affordable.  Quality: Miso - unremarkable Salad - mediocre Tempura seaweed thing - awesome. Their sashimi and sushi, I'd rate a 6/10.  I'm sure earlier in the day it may be more fresh, but the cut was too thick.  Their wasabi mediocre.  Often I find places that offer higher quality wasabi have higher quality sushi. Their spider rolls had an odd taste to them. Almost as if it had been re-fried or left out too long.  Quantity: Rolls size were pretty standard, although some of them I did not enjoy the rice/goods ratio. Servings of the actual order were tiny (4 beef short ribs) in the bento with 3 california rolls, 3 salmon sushi, a mediocre salad, and 3 dumplings.  Overall: I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this restaurant, but would consider it if I was in the area and in dire need of my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi place, really nothing special about it. I ordered the lunch bento box special, which is only available if you pay cash. Pleasantly surprised because the beef teriyaki were actual thick beef slices, so it was like I was eating steak! Salad was soggy, but all the other components were standard and ordinary.   Workers are attentive and accommodating but the only negative about the service is that they forgot one of my friend's meals and it came when everyone was done their food."}
{"text":"Usually I come here for a takeout meal for their rolls or a pound of salmon sashimi. This place usually has pretty fresh fish at an OK price (10% discount on cash purchases over $15!).   On my last visit here I got the salmon avacado roll ($5.50 for 6 pieces), dynamite roll ($5.00 for 6 pieces) and the BC tuna hand roll ($4.50) for a total of roughly $15 after the 10% cash discount. I was pretty full from this and was satisfied with the quality of the rolls too. I called ahead for takeout and picked it up within 15 minutes of my call. If you do decide to do takeout it's recommended you call before hand otherwise you will be waiting roughly 15 minutes for your order depending on how busy it is there.   I will definitely venture to this sushi place in the future."}
{"text":"I've come to this japanese restaurant on several occassions and they truly deserve a glowing review.  Hidden gem located at Bayview and Major MacKenzie.  Omakase: Innovative and fresh.  The sushi chef is from Japan and he comes up with different dishes each time.  I've had omakase here 3 times with several others and am always impressed by the selection, particularly the large sushi/sashimi platter.   A la carte: Ordered their sashimi platter with addition of hamachi.  Again, very fresh fish and beautifully presented.  The uni handroll is packed with uni and a must have.  Crab roe salad is delicious and comes in a big portion. The black pearl roll is also very tasty and topped with caviar. Ramen is less of their specialty here, would definitely recommend sashimi, sushi, rolls, terriyaki, and grilled fish before ramen.  Overall, this has become a regualar japanese spot for us, service is great and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Good food, portions are little bit small. Service was great very friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down, THE Worst sushi experience of my life. AYCE was $13.99/person, and even though we (2 people total) weren't super hungry, it was already getting to that price if we ordered 3 sushi rolls à la carte. So fine, we decide to go with All You Can Eat, and the rest of the meal was downhill from there.   There were no papers to mark our orders on - we had to tell the waitresses each thing.  The deep fried tofu was soggy and tasted like overused oil. The green tea was cold. The sushi rolls delivered to the table were Not what we ordered. The staff sat down and fed themselves while we waited for someone to come to our table when we needed something else. The rolls were loose and sloppy, had an excessive amount of rice, and the fish was not at all fresh - A HUGE RED FLAG FOR A SUSHI PLACE. The yam was undercooked and still quite raw. Overall, the taste of the rolls was maybe a 3/10...being generous.  They did not complete our tempura order correctly and we had to ask for the missing pieces.  Then, the cherry on top. Every AYCE sushi place reminds you that wasted food will be charged extra, and we are usually very mindful of this fact - of our own desire not to be wasteful, not because of the threat of an additional charge. However, the food was so unpleasant at Senbazuru Rutherford that we absolutely could not bear to eat any more. We apologised to the server, saying we were too full, and couldn't finish everything in that sitting. We politely requested to take away the remainder, to prevent the food from being thrown in the garbage.   The response we got was beyond offensive. The server told us to finish everything right then and there, with no regard to customer service or even basic decency. She told us she didn't care if we never came back, and that \"All You Can Eat\" did not mean \"All You Can Waste\" or \"All You Can Take Away\". Like a sick parent scolding a child, she refused to take the plate from the table. This is all within sight and earshot of the management and sushi chefs - who were seated at a nearby table ignoring us and enjoying their own meal. The most they did was shout instructions at the server in their own language.   We were charged $6 extra - EACH - to have the extra food packed up. I am completely appalled at how bad this restaurant was on every level and cannot warn you enough to steer clear of it. Horrid experience."}
{"text":"No, just no. I came because my fave sushi place across the street (Aroowha) was closed that day. This was the worst sushi I've ever had. I was glad I decided not to get the tofu last minute. Honestly, it was worse than mall sushi. I ordered some sort of maki roll. I struggled to finish it, only because I was hungry and I paid for it. It wasn't even cheaper than other restaurants."}
{"text":"My dad always takes us to this place because he swears by its freshness and quality of fish, and trust me, my dad knows sushi very well. I'm a big fan of the spicy tuna (i only ever get this roll here because nothing else compares). It's a little pricy, but it's great quality sushi and made really well, plus the service is on point. The owner usually works at this location so it's better than the newer one on Rutherford. The AYCE at the Rutherford location is not that great, but don't let it ruin your perception of the restaurants name. The AYCE is not the best, but the a la carte at the Bayview location is really good."}
{"text":"Location: 1076 Rutherford Road, Unit 4, Vaughan, ON L6A 0K3 (Rexall Plaza) Price:$$  Service: Alright   This is a pretty new sushi restaurant around the area. The interior design for the place was really nice. It it more spacious than you would assume just by looking on the outside.   The all you can eat menu was interesting... Why?! Because there were certain items that you were only able to order once during lunch hour. I don't know if it would be different during dinner. I sort of understand why they choose to make the food order that way. If they didn't they would lose profit but it was odd seeing that as given that It was my first time there. The price for lunch was like any other sushi place.     The sashimi was fresh and the sushi was decent. I enjoyed what they had for their side orders a lot. A lot of their food was a little too salty for my liking.   The service was alright...   Verdict: Try"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced anywhere. Waitresses are rude and unwelcoming. First time I went there they brought me the wrong order and told me I had to pay for it and if I wanted something else I have to wait another 20 mins - adding the wrong order to my bill. Really??"}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night; pretty crowded.  Cozy place with dark lighting. Was seated near the door and had a rather unpleasant experience with the wind and loud conversation of waiting customers. It felt very cramped. I was here before and was seated in a booth, and it was much better dining experience.  We ordered the enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef, dynamite roll, spicy salmon roll, and salmon sashimi.  Food was of very mediocre quality; salmon sashimi was not as fresh as it usually is.  Waiting took forever. We had to ask for soy-sauce and wasabi three times. (What sushi bar does not automatically bring out soy sauce and wasabi???) Service was non-existent; very difficult to flag down a waitress for ordering AND the bill.  I personally would not come here again. Sorry Senbazuru."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi. Some locations have all you can eat but its not really an all you can eat place. Great salmon, tuna and eel."}
{"text":"Just finished having a nice healthy lunch with my loves. The sushi selection and rolls, dinners and so on are very good. We used to live in the area and were regulars, since Moving from here we come by whenever we can. The seafood is always great, it's fresh and the portions are very generous. I especially enjoy the rolls which don't have rice! Like; Hawaii roll, salmon ginger roll. And today had tried the rice paper wrap. They were all incredibly delicious, except I wasn't a fan of their choice of mayonnaise, (I'm a big helmans lover lol) so I scraped it off the top. No biggy. The cooks are friendly and welcoming, especially once they start recognizing you! The servers well; they barely speak to you or smile. They take the order, bring it to you. Very robotic.  The decor is clean and modern with white leather chairs and booths, with dark grey told, cool wall features and soft lighting. Overall it's the food we go for!"}
{"text":"(Food:) UDON WITH BEEF came out not as expected.  We thought that it would be sliced beef mixed in with the Udon; instead it was on the side and the beef was chewy and unflavourful.  It was a horrible cut of meat and when we mentioned it to the server; she said that that was how it was made.  And that next time, we should order something else, because if we want the beef to be cooked, it would turn out like that.  We aren't novice eaters.  We know what the texture of beef can be like.  It can be cooked as well as not feeling like you're chewing rubber.   PORK CUTLET DON:  The pork cutlet was dry and the rest of the dish was nothing to write home about.  SASHIMI PLATTER:  You get quite a bit of sashimi in this platter, although we had to pay an extra $2 to get all the sashimi changed to sushi.  Otherwise, it's a relatively good deal, however the salmon wasn't the best I've ever had.    (Price:)  It wasn't exceptionally cheap and definitely not worth the quality of food we had.  (Service:) If our server hadn't given us this BS excuse about why the beef was so tough, maybe I would've given more than 1 star.  She did not apologize and did not admit that maybe the beef was overcooked, or at least the cut of meat was not prime.  (Overall:)  There are sushi places everywhere in Markham/Richmond Hill.  Places with better pricing and better food.  Mi-Ne is more costly but definitely excels in quality."}
{"text":"Sumimasen!  Maybe. Dui Ng Chu[Cantonese] a.k.a known as Sorry. Value. Affordability. Decor. Nice! Everything else. Service. Quality. Meh. I truly do not have much to write about this place, WOW. Decor Not Bad. L5 Assorted Tempura Udon in Soup ($5.99). Sushi and Maki Set ($13.99)."}
{"text":"Needed a quick sushi fix so I decided to try something new. Little did I know that I had found my go-to sushi take out bar! I ordered the Polar Bear Roll (Salmon, Asparagus, Crab, Avocado, Fish Egg, Topped with White Tuna) and the Salmon Avocado Roll. They were reasonably priced, $11 for 8 pcs of the Polar Bear, and $5.50 for 6 pcs of the Salmon Avocado. The polar bear roll was yummy to say the least, with the white tuna as my favourite part of it! The salmon avocado was its own center stage as well. TRUST ME, I always get salmon avocado rolls everywhere I go and I can say without a doubt that Senbazuru has absolutely perfected its magic on it.   Service was what sold me. While I had a 5 minute wait time for the preparation of my food, the server offered me a seat and a cup of tea. On these cold winter nights, a warm cup of tea goes a long way. I finished my tea in minutes only to find the server coming back to refill my cup. Even as she handed me my take out order, she took the time to refill my cup once more. To me, this shows a great sense of kindness and it definitely adds to my overall experience.   Tip: Take advantage of their discount for 10% off when paying cash!  Will definitely be back to try new rolls and their sashimi as well."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. The waitresses are never friendly and sometimes seem irritated that people are even there. I usually get the salmon bento box. Its well prepared and presented. A little pricey for what you get. I'd go back as a last resort. There's an all you can eat just a few mins drive north on yonge into Aurora. You can get the same thing for a few extra dollars After visiting here today (11/12/14) I'm beginning to change my mind about this place all together. A dinner bento box is just over $15 and tempura isn't even included. Every other place I've been to has offered tempura with a bento box. I left while still feeling a bit hungry. (11/28/15) wow. A year later and I still find myself at this place. Luckily it has come to an end. I've been here for both lunch and dinner and the prices are different by approximately $5 and there is no difference in what you get. I've also noticed that I've been charged different prices randomly throughout the year. This is not acceptable at all. The quality of the salmon has diminished greatly along with the teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"First time here for a late lunch (they do have a lunch menu from 11-3).   Parking is PAINFUL.   The food quality is acceptable-nothing spectacular or exciting.   Service is not rude but definitely not personable despite the restaurant not busy during this off-peak time.  An average experience."}
{"text":"Regular customer here.  More for convenience but find this restaurant very friendly and for most occasions fast.  Their bento box meals are a very good value and have seldom been disappointed.  Sushi ala carte is also very good.  Never had any major problems like other reviewers.  Been coming here off and on for almost six years now.  They aren't Japanese but oh well.   Still like the place."}
{"text":"We accidentally came by accident as we were on our way to the Arrowha across the street, but decided to stay regardless. It was 830 on a Friday, but you wouldn't likely know this as there were two other tables taken and they left shortly after we arrived. You write down the order off the menu and it seems to be made fresh- the sushi, sashimi and teriyaki was good. While the initial portions were small, the noodles were a large portion--- but you have a chance to try several things. Be warned. You get full daily quickly. I feel the service was quite good, as the entire staff sat for a sweet family meal, they still got up to make our food with no complaints. They aren't the best, but they have their hearts in it. Just would ask them to take the mango salad off the menu- iceberg lettuce with sliced mango and thousand island is a bit of a stretch. You should also kick up your web presence and advertise more on social medial. You're tucked away off the path a bit but definitely have potential!"}
{"text":"Got take-out, done quickly. All fresh ingredients and overall tasty sushi. Gigantic sashimi slices, yum)) good price too for size and quality. place itself if clean.  Will be returning definitely, some of our family are regulars here also.   Recent update: not too great recently, waitress was rude on multiple occasions, and they never seem busy (which is not a good thing for a sushi restaurant! And suspicious)  Pay a little more and go to Other sushi restaurants for higher quality, and at least a smile from the waiter. It felt like the waitress was doing me a favour to come take my order"}
{"text":"been here several times and it's okay. the interior is nice and they have a nice selection of food on their menu although there are only two so far that i have really liked (TAKOYAKI AND FISH EGG SALAD THE FRKING BOMB)  i have tried their ramen before and i didn't really like it...from what i remember they were quite bland?   i have also tried their gyudon and chicken cutlet and yeah they were mediocre. gyudon was a bit too sweet (from the onions i believe) and the cutlet was dry af. the sauce it came with was disgusting.. kinda funky tasting. oh and it was like a bento box so it also came with a salad, two spring rolls (which weren't too bad), 6 sushi, and miso soup   overall like i said in the beginning, it is an okay place and it has a pretty nice interior   *****POKEMON GO PLAYERS - I CAUGHT SPEAROWS, RATATAS, PIDGEYS AND DROWZEES the usual gang wattup  p.s. I EVOLVED MY FIRST POKEMON HERE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAYYYYY"}
{"text":"Used to order ftom here weekly and the quality was inconsistent and got a stomach ache the 2nd last time. The absolute last straw is finding bugs in my food! Never ever eating here again"}
{"text":"I do not go to sushi places often. That said, compared to the other restaurants I went to, this one had a surprisingly vibrant atmosphere. Service is great and amicable. Pricing is acceptable, albeit not recommended for a quick bite. A wide variety of choices is offered.  I chose the combo for one which includes the Dynamite and the Kamikaze. Great value. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place literally has the most similar taste to what I ate in some Asian countries. Foods are delicate and quite tasty. Dinner is a little bit pricey but lunch is okay."}
{"text":"I wasn't too crazy about my eat-in experience, but I have ordered party trays (sushi/sashimi) on numerous occasions and it always tastes good."}
{"text":"The only pretty good thing here is there sushi.  Don't order off the thai cuisine section of the menu because its not very authentic, and there yaki udon noodles are kind of strange tasting. But the sushi is pretty tastey, not the best around but its better than a lot of places around. They served me DISGUSTING luke warm bitter narsty house salad. Soggy and just GAHH The decoration and atmosphere is very cute and the prices are quite cheap!  The service is kind of blah, the waitress is there everytime I go and she acts like she HATES her job and or life. Good for the simple rolls and standard fare but nothing special."}
{"text":"Utterly ridiculous for my 4 year girl to be charged $10. She had miso soup 4 pieces of avocado roll and half of seafood ramen. Compare Madarin buffet who charges $2.  $10 for my 6 year old daughter. Had some fried rice which was the wrong one. Seafood instead of chicken.  A roll with crispy tempura was stale. Crab salad meh.  Beef teriyaki meh.  Grilled veggie was better last time. Today meh.  Some good things not spectacular to mention. Ice cream even meh.  My biggest gripe is the price for the children and not having 2 or 3 things listed on menu.  For $15 i expect more."}
{"text":"Food is very soso here. All you can eat level but charges higher. Won't really come for any Sashimi or sushi, maybe if I only want to order some rolls."}
{"text":"Senbazuru is my \"I feel like Japanese food, but I don't want to think too much \" restaurant of choice. You won't be terribly Wowed by the food, nor by the service.   My fall back, I usually order their salad roll, dynamite and salmon skin. But if you're ordering a small party tray, price wise they aren't too bad.   I usually go for their California sushi pizza too, which isn't too bad either.  Definitely not the best sushi I've ever had, but if I'm like a good brisk walk away from  there, this place is my no-brainer for good sushi in the Bayview Hill Area.  I recommend sticking to the Japanese side of things for food, since they only started offering Thai food about a year or so ago... and I would honestly said that that is questionable at best."}
{"text":"This was a nice little place located slightly north of Richmond Hill.  Prices are reasonable but unfortunately quality is questionable as I ordered a lunch special of 6pcs of california rolls and 3 of sushi (egg, crab and shrimp) the shrimp was off.  Waaaaaay off.  It smelled like it had been washed and cooked anyway to serve to patrons.  Unfortunately I had already put it in my mouth and started chewing.  Then I stopped to question whether this was worth swallowing or not.  I decided not to.  I spat it out and told the waitress who then informed the chef.  They then asked if i wanted for them to replace that piece with something else and I declined.  Although they were very apologetic  about it, theres a next to no chance I'll be going back there.  I hope the other guests there didnt eat a rotten shrimp like I almost did.  Good thing I was taking my first aid class upstairs!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I'm teetering between \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" and \"A-OK.\".  Why?  The fish is fresh.  The staff are nice.  Its a bit pricey for the portion sizes.  That said, they are at times generous depending on what you're ordering.  They have a wicked cool grill squid dish that I tried once and really liked.  You kind of have to study the menu to figure out the trick to what to order as ordering a particular combo feels like a better value deal than another.  I tried substitution once - I asked for no rice with my sashimi - instead please a side of salad.  They brought me a chopped up sashimi salad (I could have cried since all I wanted was those big chunks of sashimi - but not one to waste/complain, I ate it and paid for it).  So substitutions - not so sure there whether it translates well.   Oh and I love their fried banana.  Their tempura is good.  Keeps me coming back for more. Like I said, a good place but you might need a map to navigate best cost/food ratio."}
{"text":"Best place for Japanese in Richmond Hill. Consistently good!!!!Authentic dishes. Great menu selection.  Always fresh and delicious. They use good quality rice. Service is always fast."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi...and up in Oak Ridges..there really isn't much to choose from.. let's just say I'd rather drive south to get my sushi fix.  We came around 11:30AM on a Saturday and it was completely empty. We ordered a sushi/sashimi combo for 2, priced at $28.  We were given miso soup to start.. and our main came shortly thereafter.  The fish was okay...pretty decent sized pieces.. the \"veggie\" roll did throw me off though.. I am unsure what it was but I have never been given an entire roll filled with \"spinach/greens\" topped with avocado and some kind of funky sauce. lol   The restaurant smelled strong of bleach which was nauseating as I was slightly hungover from a Friday night of festivities.   They have some lunch options that are \"cash only\" but none of them appealed to me.. I am more of a fish/sushi person.. the options were mostly chicken teriyaki..chicken cutlet...salmon..etc.  Service was...well.. meh.. lady was emotionless..quiet... we did get tea refills often though."}
{"text":"I rather like this little place. Now, don't drive out of the city for it, but if you're in and around Oak Ridges or Aurora, you won't really go wrong. Their sashimi is quite good and they have some good lunch specials. However, if you want a lunch special, bring cash. For some unfathomable reason, they only take cash for lunch specials. Otherwise, you can pay by credit or debit. In short, if you happen to be in Oak Ridges and desire some sushi, feel free to give it a shot."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the ordering method here as I prefer the paper pencil experience.   I visited solo during the lunch rush and probably won't go back again. The service was fine but the food itself was not right. I ordered salmon sushi, kamikaze roll, rainbow roll, salmon avocado handroll and a yam tempura handroll.   Postive:  - the rolls I ordered came in a set of four so I wasn't comatose after  - the items came out promptly with very little wait time in between (good for solo diners) - complimentary green tea  Negative: - too much rice in the kamikaze roll - not as fresh tasting as other AYCE's - low sodium soya sauce tasted like regular soya - tempura sweet potato was cold (see below)  Just as I finished eating, I noticed the restaurant had vacated and I was the only patron inside. I thought I'd order something hot since I wasn't quite full so I asked for a tempura sweet potato handroll. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the friers (or so I thought) click on. Out comes my handroll in record speed. I guess they anticipated more sweet potato eaters during their rush and made too much. Low and behold, my handroll came out cold and saugy-like, not crispy, hot and yummy. I was super disappointed since I was the ONLY person there and they had no other focus to pay attention to but me. Wrongo.   I won't return simply because the food didn't taste amazing, really good, or good for that matter. It was just 'meh'. I'll go try elsewhere next time. Two stars because the service was good. Food gets 1/5 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I've had in the GTA! Their sushi is so fresh and their service is on point every time. Try the futo maki, green dragon roll, volcano roll and salmon sashimi. Once you're a regular customer, they treat you like family :)  Would definitely recommend you visit!"}
{"text":"Ricky the owner and his daughter CC are the best! Their Pad Thai and Snow White roll are the best I've had so far. All the sashimi is top notch, always fresh and flavourful!   They are so efficient and quick to serve you with a smile always on their face :D  Favourite a la carte sushi in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Very solid place for Sushi, all the rolls are big and tasty! All the fish and meat in teriyaki sauce are good. Solid service and its not packed for lunch."}
{"text":"\"It's a Safe Sushi Experience\", said my colleague.  This cute cozy sushi place has been in Richmond Hill for almost two decades, which makes me feel very old, I mean, so I've been told.... You can easily bring just yourself, friends and colleagues here and everyone will have a nice meal, but nothing that says this place is unique, which brings in the word, good but safe.   I've visited this place for lunch, dinner, take out, and even delivery when I was sick and craved sushi(free delivery after $35 in their zone), and it was always very tasty, consistent and fresh. The salmon is fresh, the avocado & mango ripe, the sushi rice is has the right amount of vinegar and not too much sugar. I can't say anything about the tuna, as once you've tasted fresh ahi from the ocean in Hawaii, you are ruined to eat tuna anywhere else!  Menu, is very standard, they don't have any house special rolls. Ambiance, they've re done the place over the years but still, it's safe, comfy booths, and tables with wooden chairs. Service is always nice dining, but when I go for takeout, the lady at the cash has that rushed blunt attitude as if I'm blocking a fire escape, regular or not it's the same for all pick ups it seems.  Note: there is another location of the same name in Maple, the sushi there was different/inconsistent."}
{"text":"This place just opened, and I'd say skip it. Fish was pretty fresh but way undersized. Not enough fish in the rolls. Salad dressing wasn't very good either. Overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"BEST SASHIMI IN TOWN!!!   Came here for my birthday and we ordered a platter of sashimi (Salmon, scallop, white tuna, Hatmachi and Uni). Every piece of sashimi just melted in my mouth... it was oh, so fresh! The price was reasonable; each piece was about $1-$2 except for the Uni of course, haha. Besides from the sashimi, I've also had their Black Dragon roll, Rock n' Roll and the Spider Roll. The Black Dragon Roll and Rock n' Roll was on point!!! However, I was a bit disappointed with the Spider Roll, pretty bland and nothing really special in taste... If you like Salmon a lot, order their Salmon Head. You should place the order a head of time, like before even looking at the menu! Because, it does take some time for it to be made! I'm never really a fan of Salmon Head, however, they grilled it to perfection here. Every piece of the Salmon was tender and juicy; except that they can possibly be easier on the salt!   Service was quick and attentive. However, if you're a tea drinker like me, you'd have to constantly as them to refill your cup. The server do not attend to you unless you need something. Prices are fair for the most part; a bit expensive and it does amount up, but! The food's quality is just PHENOMENAL. Well, you pay for what you get right?!"}
{"text":"Senbazuru Sushi Bar is quite nicely decorated. The atmosphere here is more Zen and dark... so dark as they even close all curtains in broad daylight...  Lunch Specials starts from $5.99 includes a miso soup.  Miso soup that serves here you kind of wish you never need to drink one of those... lukewarm.. with a spoon stuck in it when served... (now you know you are not eating in a authentic Japanese restaurant... :P)  Chirashi ($6.99) - OK! I should not should not expect anything of quality for that price point! - 3 salmon, 2 white tuna, 1 imitate crab and 2 piece of egg - the fish quality is not bad.... for that price - the rice!! the rice is the problem... long grain rice was used.. rice is hard and the seasoned vinegar is not balanced...  Service is really lacking.. served by 1 waitress that wish she is somewhere else.... and she wish I am somewhere else too...  Staffs are mandarin speaking... but she hardly talk to the customers anyway not even a thank you.. so doesn't really matter."}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap lunch, Senbazuru Sushi Bar is the place to be.  Lunch Specials from $5.99 does includes a miso soup. Don't expect much quality here though as this price point. You will be full but not happy. At least I was not!  L5 Assorted Tempura Udon in Soup ($5.99) reminds me of something I would made at home. The udon is way overcooked but the tempura is not that bad  Sushi and Maki Set ($13.99) fish not the freshest and definitely not something I would be back for!  The waitress are just grumpy here! Smile a little might help?!  I don't think I will be back to Senbazuru, nothing here really worth a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"What may seem like a hole on the wall at Bayview & 16th, this little restaurant is a gem!  Why?  Because of the food - consistently fresh and flavorful.  Its absolutely not your mediocre and over-hyped sushi and sashimi place.  Its not a huge place but its humility in size is dressed up with Japanese minimalist yet bold elegance with dainty and warm accents.  I enjoy it even more because it doesn't get too crowded there on the hours we need a quiet lunch or dinner.    On peak hours I don't think I ever saw a line up but the place is packed.  Their kitchen is very busy, however, and their delivery cars come and go pretty quickly.  Apparently, its very popular for delivery or take-out.    I've been ordering delivery from this place for 3 years now.  Reliable to come minutes before deadline and its always the chef who personally made our order who'd be ringing our bell.  In their aprons, yes!  That's what I call cool service.    There were some off days, yeah, like the rolls were not as perfectly tight or the size may seem to have been reduced a bit, and the rice not the usual sushi rice, and the ooh where is that usual zing (?).  But more often we're very happy.  I can tell their food is made by very skilled hands and with the keen intention to please and satisfy its customers.    Very popular for us would be their party trays.  When its Senbazuru party tray for dinner, Mom (that's me) is in a perfect mood or getting there.  With the huge and enjoyable variety of Sushi Rolls I'm like shopping for shoes.  It can get pretty exciting, I tell ya.  The price is reasonable translating it to the quality and serving size.  For example, 8 pieces of Black Dragon Roll would be $10.99 yet ohmygawd this is goo-uud .  Amazing.  Must be something with the dressing inside or its probably the tempura and bbq'd eel on top.  Whatever.  It's a bestseller.  Well, here's their list of Sushi Roll Party Trays to allow you more time to eat than deciding what to eat.    * Party Tray of 54 pcs. - $40.00 - consists of Sushi x 12 pcs., Cucumber roll x 12, California roll x 12, Salmon skin roll x 6, Dynamite roll x 6, Spicy salmon roll x 6.    * Party Tray of 40 pcs. - $30.00 - consists of Sashimi x 12 pcs., California roll x 12, Futo maki x 4, Salmon skin roll x 6, Spicy salmon roll x 6.    * Party Tray of 70 pcs. - $45.00 - consists of Spicy grilled tuna roll x 6 pcs., Futo maki x 4, Cucumber roll x 6, Spicy tuna roll x 6, California roll x 12, Salmon skin roll x 12, Salmon roll x 6, Salad roll x 12, Dynamite roll x 6. * Party Tray of 30 pcs. - $26.00 - consists of Assorted sushi x 18 pcs., Salmon roll x 6, California roll x 6.     When we do get a bit more craving we pick out from their regular menu.   The Mixed Sushi and Sashimi Party Tray is our usual indulgence.  Take a look: * 48 Pieces Sushi & Sashimi for $35.00 serves Sushi x 12 pcs., Sashimi x 12, Salmon roll x 6, California roll x 6, Kamikaze roll x 8, Futo maki -x 4.  * 92 Pieces Sushi & Sashimi for $70.00 serves Sushi x 24 pcs., Sashimi x 24, California roll x 6, Salad roll x 6, Green Dragon roll x 8, Salmon roll x 6, Spicy Tuna roll x 6, Kamikaze maki x 8, Futo maki x 4. * 130 Pieces Sushi & Sashimi for $100.00 serves Sushi x 40 pcs., Sashimi x 40, Spicy Tuna roll x 6, Spicy Salmon roll x 6, California roll x 6, Salad roll x 6, Futo maki x 4, Kamikaze roll x 8, Green Dragon roll x 8, Mango Tango roll x 6.  Their Sashimi is superb - Salmon my fave.  Its so delectable that the noise at the dinner table is hushed.  Kids usually avert raw fish, right?  They don't like it.  But my little girls love love love it.  The luscious texture and sweet succulent meat, Senbazuru just does it too well.  From 12 pcs = $12 to 96 pcs = $96, it's a dollar for every slice of happiness.  Their Bento Boxes are good, too.  Lunch, which ranges from $7.99 to $9.99 with Cod Fish alone at $11.99 mark, is satisfying in Teriyaki sauce, Tempura, or grilled accompanied by Miso soup, Salad, Salmon sashimi x 3 pcs, Califormia roll, Deep fried dumpling, and Steamed rice.  While Dinner, tagged at $11.99 to $14.99, can be a feast for one chick like me trying to maintain her waistline.  Same meat selection and includes Rice, Miso soup, Salad, Fried dumpling x 3, Salmon sushi x 3, California roll x 3.  Quite filling!... grab Tums.  All this time we haven't tried their Sushi Pizza, Vegetarian Roll, and Noodles.  So I have no comments yet on these very interesting items. Their Rice in Bowl are not bad at all from $5.99 to $9.99 for a quick meal.  For something more economical, their Lunch Special at $5.99 to $7.99 could not be understated with the varied selection that may be unique to this place.  \"Cash Only\" for Lunch Special order is a setback.  Dunno why they don't accept the plastics.  I'm not a Sake drinker but they serve it.   If you wanna dine there or go take-out/delivery you won't miss a thing. It all gives you the satisfaction on good food and good service."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this restaurant is very nice.  However, it was very empty for a Saturday night.  The service was ok, the waitress didn't smile even once and took a long time to take our orders down.  The food came very quicky and it was delicious.  The sushi pizza was a bit strange but it tasted fine.  The waitress was not very hospitable and didn't come back to the table to see if we needed anything else.  It took a long time to get her attention to give us the bill, which was strange considering we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"Senbazuru sushi is a perfect place for lunch and dinner. In my opinion they are the best sushi place  in oak ridges! They always have fresh sashimi and cooked dishes. Their service is smooth, but often when the restaurant isn't busy the wait staff will stare at you,waiting for you to finish your food or need something. On the plus side the food comes out quickly! 95% of the people who come here  get take out, I'm not sure why (minus the staring  wait staff) because the interior is modern and classy!   Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sushi!"}
{"text":"Fairly priced, but many menu items can only be ordered once per table, per meal, regardless of the size of your party. Rolls are generally of good quality - not too much rice. Hot options and dessert are strictly middling."}
