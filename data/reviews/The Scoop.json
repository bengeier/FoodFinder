{"text":"I was driving home from a funeral when I noticed The Scoop and thought, \"ice cream sounds good.\" I turned around, turned in to their lot, and was delighted to see a Drive-Thru lane.  After examining their menu, I drove to window and ordered mint chocolate chip in a waffle cone.  The young lady at the window informed me that they only had soft serve.  I hastily changed my order to their version of an Oreo \"blizzard\" and asked for it to be made with chocolate/vanilla swirl.  A few minutes later I was handed a cup with a thick \"blizzard.\"   I could tell that it wasn't made with the vanilla/chocolate swirl but I didn't say anything since I wanted to get back on the road.  
Now you're probably thinking, they didn't have the first thing she ordered and made a mistake with the second thing she ordered so why did she give them 5 stars?   Well, because it was DELICIOUS.  Hands down the best Oreo \"blizzard\" that I have ever had.  Their vanilla soft serve is rich and flavorful.  Their Oreo pieces are large and fresh.  Their Oreo \"blizzard\" is soooo good that I'm already wondering when I can get back to that area again! I've lived in Pittsburgh for 8 years and yesterday was the first time I've ever been to that area... Yet I now want to go! 
Do yourself a favor and visit The Scoop!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream.  Love the Lincoln place Sunday.  Also the landscaping and building are really cute.  Was very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"It's funny, when I first saw this place was opening I thought to myself: how the heck are they going to stay in business with Dell's Too just up the road? Well, it's easy, very good ice cream. They have great soft serve and a wonderful seating area. They also offer a drive through if you need your froyo on the go. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've had great ice cream treats, nice place to eat and clean tables. Unfortunately they can't figure out how to make a Nathan's hot dog, I've given them 4 tries. Twice the bun was stale, twice they put on so much YELLOW mustard that the wiener was invisible and I prefer brown. I'm not sure why anyone would invest a million dollars to build an ice cream stand, then let kids run it. Even the polite teens that work there need adult supervision."}
{"text":"He have been there a few times but will not be returning tonight or ever. The 412-414 \"business\" phone number listed apparently is also someone's personal cell phone I assume the owner?

I called to see how late they are open and the phone was answered in such a rude tone with a very angry \"Hello!\" And when I asked if it was scoops \"yeah who is this\" basically yelling at me in her nasty tone. Who the heck do you think it is if you are a business. 
People have no common courtesy and a business owner should be practicing the above as well as some phone etiquette manners.
No wonder so many small businesses are not successful. The scoop is a perfect example. Thanks for making our decision to go somewhere closer to home,  cheaper, and much more friendly a lot easier!"}
{"text":"Love getting ice cream from this place!   Take the kids and dogs too!  Nice place to sit and eat your ice cream."}
{"text":"Such a relaxing place to sit & enjoy a treat. Brought my pup & we both enjoyed the music & ice cream."}
{"text":"I've been here three times so far and got a sundae each time. They're gigantic! The portion sizes are very generous for the price you pay. You could split a sundae here for sure. So far I've had the Elvis Presley, the bananas foster, and the strawberry shortcake. I didn't like the Elvis one as much and thought it was ok, a bit too sweet. The bananas foster sundae had a great sauce. The strawberry shortcake was hands down my favorite. The strawberries were the perfect amount of ripeness, the shortcake was nice and spongy, and the ice cream and whipped cream complimented everything very well. Everything was added in just the right ratios too, so no issues with too much whipped cream, not enough strawberries, etc. I can't wait to come back and try another sundae."}
{"text":"Excellent! I drive past scoops almost every day and every time I do, there are tons of people! Decided I needed to try it out. Went through the drive through and the young lady was super nice and offered to get my Icecream 'to go'. My husband ordered the 'sweet revenge' and I ordered a medium 'mudslide'. My medium was the perfect size but my husband was worried that his 'sweet revenge'was too large-- don't worry, he ate it all! There was a perfect ratio of Icecream to toppings and the ice cream was delicious!! The price was also super fair totaling $9 for everything. Will def go back again soon!"}
{"text":"This isn't like me to bitch and complain on Facebook but I'm really heated right now and just want to let everyone know about the displeasing experience I had at The Scoop located in Lincoln Place. I felt like I was being mocked the entire time before getting my order taken. Honestly, that part wasn't even the worst of it all. I put my order in and I told them not to put nuts on it. They didn't the first time but as I started to eat my first sundae I found a hair in it. I'm in food service so I know that it happens. I walked up and told the girl at the register about it and she took the sundae and then just stared at me. I heard the girls through the glass and they saying how I was lying. Trust me, I wouldn't go that far. Lastly they made my second sundae sloppily and with nuts. I'm just saying.. What if I was allergic to nuts? Then on top of all this I didn't get any kind of apology. I really advise everyone to stay away from this place. I also, was not the only customer complaining today. I work in food service so I wouldn't go out of my way to make the lives of somebody else miserable."}
{"text":"This place if i could give it a ten i would. They are busy yes. But they get their orders out quick and right. I never had their food but their ice cream is to die for. They have a gigantic ice cream cookie sandwich than two people can eat. Their banana split in point on their so much better than dells. And the prices are very reasonable.  They have a picnic area for you to sit and enjoy your items you ordered . which is very clean and they have all the paper towels you need. At the tables. The only draw back is that they only take cash. They do have an atm on site."}
{"text":"Wow!  My neighbor told me Scoop was better than Page's and she was right!  The ice cream is so creamy and smooth, no ice crystals.  They have extraordinary ice cream creations but my favorite is good old hot fudge with pecans.  The pecans are whole and fresh, and the portions are huge. A drive thru is available if you are too hungry to leave the vehicle.  A nearby picnic area is available Should you want to sit and savor your frozen confection under the stars."}
{"text":"This place recently opened, but I have already gone a couple times. Their ice cream cookie sandwiches are huge, made with Nancy B's cookies, and are pretty darn good! I believe it is soft serve ice cream, but it taste better than normal soft serve I think. Not as good as The Creamery at PSU, but pretty good for a local place. Had a peanut butter milk shake last night, which was very delicious as well! This place is a cash only establishment, but they do have an ATM on site (probably would dock a half a star if I could for this). Also, they have some nice picnic tables next to the store and it is nicely landscaped. Definitely a great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"This is a place that I feel 3.5 would be a good rating because 4 is a little too generous but 3 seems average. I honestly felt that maybe my expectations were too high. 

They have a great menu & everything sounds delish.  Some things that caught our eye would be a sundae with peanut butter cookies & pb sauce..  fried oreos sundae.. banana split.. strawberry shortcake sundae ect.

I finally decided on the giant cookie sandwich & my bf decided on the Bananas Foster Sundae

My cookie was good..  huge actually. Two servings later its still sitting in the freezer only halfway gone. While the cookie was good, the sandwich itself is premade (for obvious reason.. It held together better + it would be time consuming to make it to order). The cookie was pretty hard. Idk I guess I wish I could enjoy the sandwich but also enjoy a soft, chewy cookie lol.

My bf liked his bananas foster sundae, but found the texture of the cooked bananas odd. I tried it & would agree that regular, fresh bananas would have been better.

Oh they are open til 10pm, not midnight according to a Yelp tip. That have an adorable patio area + a drive thru. Cute shop. I intend on heading back. 

I'm sure my next visit will be 4 stars. Again I personally feel that I had high expectations for a giant cookie sandwich & bananas foster sundae. *****cash only. ATM on site."}
{"text":"Right up there with Page Dairy Mart for best soft serve in the city. The store front and picnic area are kept immaculate. Everything I have tried was delicious. Instead of getting an ice cream cake for my step moms birthday, which they dont make, I bought 2 of the Nancy B's chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches.  They are probably the best ice cream treat I EVER tasted. At less than 5 bucks a piece each one could feed up to 3 people. As someone who grew up in Lincoln Place, im proud to have The Scoop in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice, the picnic area and drive through definitely are pluses. I normally get a razzle which is their version of a blizzard, it's always loaded with topping. However the only thing I would deduct a star for is the mixture of their icecream, for what ever reason it just doesn't hit the spot for me as well as DQ"}
{"text":"Great ice cream and friendly service at this local shop that gives a good break from the typical chains. Drive up window a definite plus. Was originally our substitute to avoid long lines at Paiges, but now is our regular  ice joint."}
{"text":"I have never eaten ice cream so many times in one summer, but since this place opened down the street, the gf & I go weekly!! Every time we get a new sundae and my goodness are they all amazing!!! The Lincoln Place Sundae or the little sweet revenge, you can go wrong. Also the largest ice cream sandwiches ever, made with Nancy B's cookies! If you ever are in the area you must stop, or even make the trek before they close for the winter."}
{"text":"Meh. Everything tastes like cardboard here- the ice cream, the hot fudge, the brownies.
They must be using low quality everything and powders. Blech."}
{"text":"I'm an ice cream lover. Equal opportunity. I don't care what you put in it, on it, or serve it in, I'm gonna love it. Ive never been blown away by options and toppings till my gang and I stumbled on the scoop on a hot July afternoon. 
Deep. Fried. Peanut. Butter. And. Jelly. Sandwich. (Yes, you read that right) 
The Elvis Presley is quite impressive. Peanut butter and jelly, fried, jelly and PB drizzle, and the best soft serve I've had in the Burgh. This thing was massive. 
Also, if you don't know Nancy B's, get on that. A Homestead tradition, these cookies out beyond anything that ever came out of my Grandmas kitchen. They serve them warmed in a multitude of different shake/blizzard things, sundaes and more. 
I feel like a fatass saying I foresee many more trips to The Scoop this summer, but I'm sure the extra hour in the gym will be worth it!! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"So, so so yummy and so many choices!

While they have your standard vanilla and chocolate soft serve they also have a few other choices of the lower fat persuasion.  I recently had a cone with sea salt caramel coconut milk.  

You can go crazy here and get fried oreos on a sundae or a hot apple dumpling sundae but my favorite when I'm throwing all caution to the wind is the Nancy B's ice cream sandwich.  First of all, it is the size of your face.  Secondly, it is combining the best possible cookie with delicious ice cream.  You can't go wrong.  And if you can finish the entire sandwich by yourself in one sitting you deserve a t-shirt saying as much!

Cash only!"}
{"text":"My mom is very good friends with the owner. But this is not why im partial to this place...i never knew therbffe was a difference in icecream,but the first time you try it you will see what. Im saying! The hard icecream is 14% fat and the soft 10% ..If you didnt know the difference eithe, then i strongly suggest you go make trek over and treat yourself you will be glad you did.............# icecream"}
{"text":"We love going here! It is always clean, the ice cream is delicious and the service is always fast, efficient and friendly!"}
{"text":"So delicious. They even offer an ice cream cup for dogs too with a little dog treat on top. My pup loves it"}
{"text":"Good soft serve ice cream. They have a drive thru also and a nice picnic area.  No inside seating. We were on our way to DQ and saw this place. I thought hey! Lets try someplace new so I turned into the parking lot. The cashier was very friendly and the service was quick."}
{"text":"The ice cream is really good, and the employees are always super young and really nice. If you order a small vanilla bowl or cone and they know it's for a dog they put a bone in it for them. Super nice. I really enjoy it and it's super good. It is cash only but they have ATM, and a drive through."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the BEST, MOST FANTASTIC ice cream sandwich you will ever have or imagine. They use Nancy B's cookies... the best chocolate chip cookie ever (they have other cookie flavors as well). I got mine \"fresh\" with chocolate ice cream (soft serve). They are gigantic and I can only eat half at a sitting.  They have your usual soft serve suspects plus a few other Pittsburgh special creations. It is a diamond in Lincoln Place!"}
