{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I enjoy the food and the staff is always friendly. Plenty of seating options and nice courtyard when it's not to hot outside."}
{"text":"Nice place in Summerlin North! Great atmosphere & service! Lots of tv's to watch all the games. Extensive food & drink menu. Excellent location in Trails Village Center. Nice to have a cool place close to home to relax at and meet others in the area."}
{"text":"Comps are minimal. Friendly staff. The comp issue is with management staff is great. Poor management"}
{"text":"Good to have a nice bar near the home. Prices aren't bad plus the food was really good (tater tots and wings!). Also, they have all football games on Sunday. The bartenders are great at fast service and are willing to say recommendations."}
{"text":"WOW!  I came here from out of town with some friends and we had a blast!  I wish there was something like this back home and I will definitely be telling anyone I know heading out to Vegas to check it out.  Food and service was great (staff was very attentive throughout - thanks, guys!), and the games were awesome entertainment.  So glad we found this gem :)"}
{"text":"This is based on my experiences with gambling at this establishment.   I walked in with a friend. We both intended to put $40 in a poker machine and have a couple beers while playing. We both assumed that we would be comped a few beers for playing.  I had three beers and lost $40 over an hour of playing. We decided to call it a night and we got up to leave. The lady bartender flagged us down and said we had a bar tab.  We told her that we both put $40 in the machine and assumed that we were comped the few beers that we had. She said only one beer is comped for every $20 and told me that all bars have this rule. I've lived in Las Vegas for the past 11 years and have never had to pay a tab for three Coors Lights after dropping $40. I questioned her about what she said about all bars using this practice and asked why she did not make us aware of this policy when we were over our comped beer limit. She said that I should not expect her to tell everyone the rules.  The problem is that there were no signs posted about the comped beverage rule.  I would not of had a problem if I was just told or a sign would have been posted. She then tried to embarrass me in front of other patrons and asked if I make it a habit of leaving without asking for my tab. Once again, I had three beers and put $40 in the machine. I've never been asked to pay a tab for so little amount of beer compared to the amount I gambled. My friend got a little more loud than I did because he lives in the neighborhood and has been to that location a few times and thought we were not being treated the way customers should be treated. The male bartender said we were being a pain in the ass and kicked us out and told us never to come back. Then the lady yelled how does it feel to be 86'd?   I hope management reads this and understands that locals should be treated properly. Unfortunately, I was looking forward to dining there because I heard it has good food, but will not spend another dime at any of the locations because of one $4 beer that was not comped."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this bar multiple times a week. The food ia great. The staff is usually good. Some of them dont get the concept of customer service(most do). I was in earlier today. I decided to play a video poker/keno slot machine. Long story short I put a $20 in the machine and won $200 right off the bat. But kept it in my machine to continue playing. After 20 mins I ask the bartender for a second drink. She replied rudely, \"ahh no, not unless you plan on putting another $20 in the machine or paying for it. Its $20 for every drink we comp\". Now my intentions were to play back I won, and probably then some. But that hadn't happened bc I was winning. I play at similar bars and as long as you continue to play your drinks are free. Not only did she lose my respect and a decent tip. I hope her superiors at least train her better with customer service. My hunch is this isnt an isolated incident. So it might be time for her to be let go. She was jaw droppingly unprofessional and seemed almost drunk. I was there on 01/15/2018 at 2:00pm. When I started to leave another women was starting her shift around 4pm."}
{"text":"Nice quaint place. I had the chicken quesadilla which was delicious and the fried Oreos were amazing. I cannot comment on the bartender because I did not order any alcoholic beverages. What I can comment on is the waitress that I had. Jurnie was very personable and kind. She was attentive and was the reason why I am giving this place 5 stars on a first visit. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"After over a year, and many more visits, The Bar has made significant improvements to its service and menu. Prices are competitive with other neighborhood bars in the area now and their Happy Hour is a great deal.  The table service is much better as well with the addition of  servers Jurnie and Crystal. You won't find a harder working pair anywhere.   There are still a couple things that would bring The Bar up to a Five Star rating. The outside patio is sorely in need of TVS. Some patrons looking to escape the cigarette smoke, myself included, would appreciate being able to watch the VGK's games and upcoming NFL games while enjoying food and beverage in a very comfortable setting.  Finally,  few more options on the dessert menu would be nice. Pie and/or cake would be an easy addition.   Overall, The Bar has made some good advances and only needs a few minor items to push it into Five Star territory."}
{"text":"Came in the morning for breakfast. They have a great patio where they will allow dogs. Hardly anyone out there,  probably since the place is still new, but still got great service.   Was here about a week ago for dinner and it was great too. Lively atmosphere. Prices are good. Food is great. Love being so close to home. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is probably the fourth \"The Bar\" location I have been to. Their food never disappoints (especially breakfast!) They have mimosas for ~$7 each. I wish I had gotten our bartenders name, she was working Sunday afternoon and was super attentive to all of her customers and guests that came in."}
{"text":"This place is the best. It will change your idea of what a neighborhood pub is supposed to be. We always bring our dog with us and sit outside in the dog friendly patio. No matter how late (or early) it is or how hot (or cold) it is the service is always prompt and attentive. We somehow end up with Journey a lot and she is the best. She always takes great care of our table and is such a great server. She is attentive and is constantly making sure service is up to par. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a good tavern to visit for food or drink. The buffalo chicken dip and loaded tots are the best! Try the Reuben as well."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood bar, I mean it's so close to my house I could throw a rock from my front door and hit this place. So I usually just walk here on the nights I'm drinking (don't drink and drive!). This neighborhood in general has a community feel to it, and you can expect the same experience at The Bar. You see a lot of the same people, and it feels like a big family here. Everyone knows each other by name, and there is never any drama or bar fights around here. ALL of the bartenders are extremely friendly and they all remember my orders. The bartenders will have my favorite drink ready for me by the time I sit down. The food here is super good! I love their fries, and their hot chicken fingers. Although one time I ordered the XXX hot and wow was that shit hot. The bartender tried to warn me, I should of listened lol. I also love their chicken tortilla soup. They have a nice variety of delicious food on the menu. I still need to try a lot of their menu items. The food is a little pricey, but you get large portions, and again it's super good. This place gets packed on game nights. I highly recommend stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The Bar is awesome! Great service from all of the staff. Great gaming too. The bacon cheddar tots are delicious."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is excellent-Crystal is so friendly and attentive. Music was good. The atmosphere makes no sense. It's like eating in an empty Costco building where they pump cigarette smoke through the vents. There is a huge bar but you have to play. There are booths around the bar-sort of. That's it. There are gaping empty spaces where high top tables should be but aren't. The lighting is super bright. Did I mention the smoke? It's difficult to enjoy the great food when the couple a few feet away are both smoking. The area needs a place like this. I hope they can even out the rough spots.   On the bright side the food is very good. Fairly decent beer choice and the service is great"}
{"text":"I started coming to The Bar the first time my husband was in the hospital for an extended time. Spent the evening here watching election returns in November - not The Bar's fault.  The staff is phenomenal and the food - OMG!  Enjoying Chicken Artichoke Pasta w/garlic bread. It is the best!  I'm gonna have to take at least 1/2 of it home though. Too much for one stomach."}
{"text":"The Bar has become our favorite local place to have a cocktail and relax!  We are constantly seeking places that have a nice dog-friendly patio and The Bar delivers. They serve excellent bar food!!!  We came here many times and consistently had the buffalo chicken dip which is excellent. We have recently adopted the mini-corn dogs as our favorite snack to go with our drinks!  The portions are good and the taste is even better!   The best part of The Bar, however, is Journey!  She works most evenings and she is spectacular!  She is warm and kind and makes us feel welcome every time we visit---even when it's 40 degrees outside and she has to come out to help us!   It's really a great local place!"}
{"text":"There is a lot to be said about The Bar.  Hands down the best \"bar food\" I've ever had. I wouldn't even really consider it bar food.  The staff is amazing! Very attentive, courteous, funny, kind, and truly caring people.  They genuinely make it feel like your own cheers in Summerlin.  They do not allow any of their customers to feel uncomfortable by any other patrons, and take quick action to resolve any issues.  This place goes above and beyond any establishment I have ever had the opportunity to experience.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and welcoming, the crowd ranges from 21-91 and everyone gets along.  If you're ever in the Summerlin area, this is truly a place to check out!  The gaming isn't so bad either"}
{"text":"Great food, great people and loose machines! No better combo! You gotta go check Steve out on grave shift, great guy and great bartender"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times between 2am and 3:30am. The bartender is also the only server there when we've gone and my wife and I enjoy our private time so we always choose a table over going up to the bar. Unfortunately we've never asked the server for his name but he gives us perfect service every time and I know how much he hates having to leave the bar area just to come serve us across the room at a table at that time of night. He is truly an example of what exemplary customer service should be like. I strongly recommend this place for a quiet and safe environment that offers great service, food and we always love the '80s music they play. And for The Bar management who may read this my wife and I were there at 3:30 this morning 01/13/18 so please extend our sincere compliments to your bartender/server."}
{"text":"Love the staff (very friendly!) especially Michelle! And the food is really good! You have to try the chicken tortilla soup and the mozzarella appetizer - yummy! I will definitely be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"When they first opened up, Bear and I went there for a couple of breakfasts and lunches.  I found it to be a nice enough place, so when I decided to get up off my hands and form a Meetup trivia group, I thought The Bar would be a great place to host it.  I'm glad I wasn't wrong, for the most part. Some group members have issues with smoking, which is allowed here, and I understand being sensitive to that kind of thing.  But the food is pretty good, and Jenn and Crystal could never have been nicer or more accommodating to our gang than they have been.  In fact, all the staff there are very cool.   We've been coming here since about April, and nearly have half a year's worth of meetings under our belts.  For the most part, it's been doable, but as our group grows, we may have to relocate to another place that will fit our expansion. When that happens, I will be bummed not to be able to have the group patronize this place anymore.  But since I'm in the neighborhood, it doesn't mean that Bear and I won't keep coming back ourselves!"}
{"text":"This place seems to draw in a lot of good locals. Definitely loved the vibe of the place. Food was plentiful, fries were great. I got the chili cheese dog...oh and it came with two.  Yes, could not eat all of it. Bar staff was friendly and attentive. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Sunday morning to grab some food, gamble a little and to watch the end of the soccer match which the bartender Anna are happily put on for me. The Bar has got a great atmosphere, very clean and I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with wifey.. Highly recommend the Huevos rancheros! The food server recommended to add carne asada, which I did! One of the best!!! French toast was delicious and bacon was cooked perfectly for wifey taste. Food service was very friendly and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I discovered this place when we were looking for a new Saturday morning spot to watch early college basketball games. It is easy to get in and out of, and the full menu is available even at 9am in the morning. The wait staff is great, and they started to remember us after a few times. I'm only giving it 4 stars due to the smoking inside the bar."}
{"text":"I can walk to this bar so would be great if the service and food quality matched the prices. Over the years this location has been a number of restaurants and they all failed. This time as a bar with gaming maybe it will last? It's real dark inside and reminds me of the older summerlin bars (Charlie's, beanos, village pub). I've come here about 6 Times now with my husband (and once or twice with friends) and each time everything was just, meh. Often the orders were wrong or missing an ingredient...it was corrected each time, but it happened 6 out of 7 Times. We've tried different things each time (from healthy to greasy) and nothing was great n nothing was terrible. The service was never what I would call great, only one time was it lousy. We always sit in the booths. The bar seats are typically single men sitting (a stool or so apart) and are about 1/3 to 1/2 full... so if your a single guy looking for a watering hole with a fair variety of average bar/diner food this place is right up your alley. On the plus side, There's a good selection of sports on the tv's and it's not too loud at the booths so you can still watch the game and converse."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place, thanks to Yelp. A lot of breakfast joints that are open late are either far away, towards the city, or not open all day. The Bar is pretty much in the heart of Summerlin and it's a neighborhood joint that serves alcoholic beverages, breakfast, and bar eats/lounge-style food. Their bar sits in the middle of the eatery. It's a place to drink, dine, and play! There's also plenty of television sets to watch the games.  There is additional seating in their covered patio area, which is great for those not so freezing nights or summer days. Customer service was great and the bartenders/servers were very personable. They greeted us upon entering and leaving. If you're in the area, give this place a try. :]  Pro-tips: -They're Open 24/7! -They can do take-out orders -Plenty of parking in the plaza"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time because I live really close and had a friend coming in to town so we decided to check it out. I was a little hesitant due to the fact I know you're allowed to smoke inside and I'm just not a fan of food+cigarettes.   Service was great, food was awesome but after an hour I had a raging headache due to the cigarette smoke. For a Friday night it wasn't really that busy. The bar was pretty full but it just seems like there's nowhere for the smoke to go. I'd order food to go if they offer it but won't be going back."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it opened in October and it's been such a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The staff is awesome and they know our drink order before we even sit. It's like family - family that doesn't make you nuts like real family. Jen, Nick, Michelle, Mandy - you're the best!"}
{"text":"Me and my mother go to this bar for late night dinners and the food is pretty good and the staff is very nice and there professional and treat you like you've been there 100 times and always check on how your doing. It's nice late night dinner in a chill environment."}
{"text":"Although very smoke filled the service is good and beer is cold. Gaming machines seem to pay like every other bar in town which is not too often. The food is good. We will visit again."}
{"text":"A lot of good things to like about this place,  a big one is that it's about a half mile from the house. ;)  It's conveniently located in the Trails Village Center which has a lot of parking and a lot of other shops to visit.  You could get some groceries at Albertson's or some Christmas cards at Hallmark then head over to The Bar to grab a drink and some good food.  We came here during dinner on a weeknight and it was pretty packed.  We did get a couple of seats at the bar which was good since my friend knows one of the bartenders so we could chat with her while having a bite and a drink.  They have a good variety of beers and spirits on offer and a pretty huge menu with much more than the usual \"bar food\".   They have a full menu with a large apps/salad selection, along with full dinner entrees like a NY strip and a Red wine braised roast among a few other options.  They have healthier dinner options that come with brown rice, eggs whites, and steamed veggies.  A nice alternative that could leave some extra calories on the table that could be used for dessert or another drink or two. ;-)  We both started with a Hendricks and tonic and for dinner, i got the 1/2 lb. patty melt on sourdough and Mark H got the Buffalo chicken wrap.  Both meals come with either fries or tots.  One thing that was awesome was they make their own potato chips so with our drinks, we got a super hot basket of freshly made chips, those were incredibly delicious.  The patty melt was quite good as well.  I ordered the patty medium but it came closer to well.  The burger still had some good flavor so that was fine.  With the drink, chips, and fries, having half of my patty melt had me full so I had a midnight snack to take home for later.  The one thing I would've liked to see different is the ventilation in there.  It's a smoking establishment and the smoke seems to just linger.    As soon as you step into the entrance, the smell of smoke overwhelms you and when you leave, your clothes smell like cigarette smoke.  A good selection of drinks and good food.  A come back spot for sure."}
{"text":"So happy about this new location opening! There was literally nothing \"pub-ish\" around here. Open 24/7, walking distance to many neighborhoods, clean, fun affordable, friendly staff, good menu. We needed it here. Good luck, guys! Will see you soon again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great. The staff remembers your name. And the deserts are sinful. Fried PBJ. Chocolate cake. Fried Oreo's."}
{"text":"Great spot where a lot of locals hang out after hours. They have a wide menu and a lot of good food. Sometimes I feel like this place is kind of small but then again it brings bit of intimacy to the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Love this place! Drinks & food are delicious. Service is quick! Finally a bar near my home."}
{"text":"I am here to watch the final of Wimbledon.  I am really not a bar guy type of guy. But since I dont have TV, it is a perfect opportunity to try the bar next to my house. This early morning , nobody is here and the bartender agreed to put up the volume for the tennis match. I had breakfast and coffee.  $2 a coffee cup and $2 for a side of potatoes with a smile. The place is very clean and the restroom are very clean as well. I am not a specialist but what else you can ask from a sport bar?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here whenever we can. Great food and fantastic service. All of the staff are outstanding, am very happy to have such a wonderful neighborhood bar to go too. The Buffalo chicken dip with extra chips is a great starter, burgers are outstanding and so is the fish and chips (yes its their own batter English style), my girlfriend usually orders from the healthy menu and raves as much as I do. Last time I was in some gaming guy came in and announced himself to the whole bar doing an inspection. Everything was fine and the staff/management handled it very professional. I am bringing this up not because of the Bar but that these inspectors need to be held accountable. There is a professional way of going about your job, this gaming inspector needs either an attitude adjustment or a job out of the public eye."}
{"text":"Their burger here is really good!  And the bloody marys yummm. It's a nice little local bar and I especially like that they turn the sound on during games!  I've had the same server twice, Crystal, and she is awesome!  She is very attentive, always gets our order right and is so pleasant!  The ladies bar tending are great too!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricy side,  but worth it.   I have been on a handful of times and they always remember me.  Mandy is one stellar bartender,  and is happy to help you figure out what to eat!  Great local spot close to home!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the girls that work here are all adorable and friendly and the service is prompt. It is so close to home and very comfortable inside. I love their apps and my new favorite is the tempura asparagus. I literally think about it every day and its always on the list of fun foods for cheat day."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest place I've been to.  I received a mailer that said if you play $20 you get $20 of free play for new players.  I left the mailer in the car since it didn't say you need to show it. I asked about the promo and I was told that it ended. When I questioned them about the mailer some punk putz behind the bar told me to lower my voice( music was rather loud). So of course I whispered so the putz couldn't hear a word.   Bottom line is I went to the car, brought in the coupon and then I was told I didn't need it. They said they thought I was asking about a discount on food.  They were just trying to beat me out of $20. Fortunately I beat them out of $56. Doubt I'll make it a regular haunt which it could have been since it's only 5 minutes from home.  I'll stick to the Rampart where they know how to treat guests.  Too bad so many joints just don't understand customer service.   The MAC & CHEESE was above average."}
{"text":"I eagerly awaited the debut of The Bar, so close to home that I could walk there.  Well, I could.  But I didn't.  Construction seemed to take forever, so I assumed that it would be a really great-looking place.  Never assume, my mama always told me.  Except for the huge bar in the heart of the oddly-shaped room, we were struck by the very ordinariness of the dingy brown booths, and how few tables there were.  In fact, there's only one table-height table, and that has half a booth for seating.  There are a few larger oblong pub-height tables, and all the rest are booths - raised booths.  And not one of them was made for short people like us.  Oh, they had footrests, but those were narrow and recessed underneath the seats.  So our feet dangled uncomfortably, like little kids, during the entire meal.  Even one of the workers, who shall remain unidentified to protect his/her job, must have noticed our discomfort, and remarked that they'd told the owner more than once that he needs more \"real\" tables.  It's a bar, so of course there are lots of TVs.  For half of our meal we were the unfortunate witnesses to two tables screaming at each other non-stop as a football game was playing out.  Not the bar's fault, of course, but the cacophony further added to checklist.  We breathed a sigh of relief when they finally cashed out and left.  I guess it comes with the territory.  On the positive side, our server, Jamie, was terrific - charming, patient, and attentive.    We ordered a Reuben and a pastrami, both on pretzel buns, adding a side salad.  My husband had soup instead of fries, I had the tater tots, and we shared the sandwiches.  The soup, chicken vegetable, was excellent and not oversalty. I don't quite understand why there's an upcharge for having it instead of the fries/tots choice.  We also ordered a side salad, and that was NOT excellent.  Iceberg lettuce, some of it brown, cucumber pieces that were frozen/defrosted, and lots of tiny salami slices, with cheese and some tired croutons.  When this ghastly mess was pointed out, there was no attempt to change it or remove it from the bill, but it truly was awful.  The meats in our sandwiches were good, though I couldn't distinguish the corned beef from the pastrami.  The pretzel buns were anything but - didn't look like 'em, didn't taste like 'em.  Reubens should have sauerkraut, not cole slaw, as this one did, and this cole slaw had too much mayo and was too drippy to be on a  'wich.  Overall, though, the sandwiches passed muster.  But not mustard, which we had to ask for, though the menu said the pastrami came with stoneground mustard.  I checked out the patio.  Oh, that's where the tables went!  It's a big patio and it could be beautiful and inviting.  No fire pit. No heaters.  It's just a place that holds the tables that should be inside, at least some of them. It's fine if you want to sit outside, but it's not compelling.   In the end, it was an okay experience.  Not A-okay.  Just okay.  I wanted to love it."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my girlfriend for a late lunch. Around the corner from the  NBT admin offices. Although it was very close, my expectations were not very high.  However, surprise. We had one the best bowls of Tortilla soup ever. Fresh, hearty, really good. On the down side the Caesar salad just just so so. But the service was awesome, Everyone was very friendly. and the drinks were generous.   Remember it is a bar.....but if your in that area, check it out."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!  I started going here when it first opened.  Amanda was my favorite bartender but now I go to see her at Durango and Trop when I can.  But ALL of the bartenders, servers, bar backs, bussers and cooks are amazing!!!   They never let you run out of a drink, the machines are reserved for players.... which I love.  The bartenders and staff  are super friendly and call you by name.  The food is ridiculously good!  Oh and it's super clean.... like OCD CLEAN.  BEST BAR IN VEGAS!!!  Btw I'm a native.... so I know my bars"}
{"text":"We finally got a bar in the neighborhood after 21 years and was very excited to eat and drink and be able to walk home. Well the drinking was fine but the food was not. The worst Cuban sandwich I ever had in my life and the burger wasn't much better. Looks like it'll just be a place to grab a drink if you aren't looking for any atmosphere."}
{"text":"Seems cool. Was worried about it being in the village. But so many places have been and died here.... if  they keep it classy will work out. Definitely worth checking out!!! Very clean and food is good. Bartender on point. Hopefully they keep it from being all about tank tops and boobs. Turn off in this area since you see so much of it. Lol. Good to have a drinking football place so close to home. Its beautiful. Truly give it a try. Didn't disappoint. I know the owner. He should be proud. Best of luck!!!"}
{"text":"End up here 2 times a week at least. Service is amazing food is basic bar grub but you swear your grannie is in the kitchen cookin. My favorite part is their lanai because out there they treat my little dog like a Queen. I have literally eaten breakfast lunch and dinner here. They never fail  Tonight the served the best dam prime rib oh my god it was perfection!  And 18,00. Yes that sound is me squealing !"}
{"text":"Finally someone put a bar in this area of Summerlin! This is a great place for food, drinks and sports viewing. They have video poker at the bar, but only half of the bar has machines. So you can go in here and not have to sit in front of a poker machine if you don't want to. The food here is great! I love the animal style tater tots, a knock off of the animal style fries from In N'Out. The staff is extremely friendly, and are really great at remembering your name if you frequent here. If you sign up for their players club, they do offer a decent amount of free play as well."}
{"text":"Located in Summerlin in Trails Village Center you will find \"The Bar\"  We heard from our neighbor this place was pretty good, and offering up some decent eats!!  Last Saturday I called in a order for some food to go and the customer service was very friendly which was a great start! I think his name was Nick and he was pretty eager to do whatever it took to ensure our happiness as a customer.   This was tried and true given my indecisiveness on what kind of bar food I wanted. Was it nachos, mini corn dogs, burgers, maybe even breakfast, heck I wasn't sure?!? I told him my neighbor said the mini corn dogs were pretty good and for under 10 bucks for a large portion of them. I decided mini corn dogs it was. He said 10 minutes and the order would be ready. Sounded good to me. :)  We cruised on down and I was immediately impressed with the outdoor seating. Super nice and if the weather is permitting, I would probably opt for outdoors anytime.  Next we went in and it was pretty cool inside. Plenty of seating, booths were spacious enough and it wasn't  crammed at all. I'm not a drinker so I must be fair in saying from that perspective I'm unable to give that assessment.   Important to note is that this place was very CLEAN!! That is huge with me given that I was getting my food from here. Service was quick and friendly! We grabbed the food and we went home to give them a try.  Mini corn dogs were good, however just a little too salty for my liking. My recommendation would be to chill on the salt and let the patron salt to their liking. ;) To be honest the mini corn dogs were able to stand on their own and didn't need any salt at all! That was the majority's ruling because these dogs were shared among 3 of us.  Based on customer service from Nick, Steve, or Jen, the taste of the food we had with the \"to go option\"  I definitely give \"The Bar\" 5 stars!   I definitely recommend this location.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"GREAT food. I just wish it were less smoky inside. My go-to are the sliders, best in town. I also recommend the bacon and goat cheese salad; the French dip; the fried oreos. Always delicious and fresh food. Nice atmosphere. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Love this bar!  Stopped by here one night just for some food and it became my new local bar. The food is awesome not normal greasy bar food. Working until 3 am doesn't leave me with many healthy choices for food. Now I can eat later at night and not feel bad.   The graveyard bartenders are absolutely amazing! JASON is very attentive and always has great suggestions for food or drinks. He really loves his job. If I come by myself or with my boyfriend and friends we always have a good  Also awesome place to watch the Golden Knights games ! Get here early to grab a seat!"}
{"text":"The BAR Is a super fun local bar with a great happy hour, atmosphere and gaming. All sports play in the TVs, but on hockey nights it's all about the Golden Knights! They have drink specials during hockey and NFL games. For the best service ask to be seated in TJ's section! He is the best server there! And will take amazing care of you!

{"text":"Tried The Bar out on a Friday night and couldn't have been more pleased. We were greeted by big friendly smiles as we walked in and the overall experience was great. The food was above average and the bacon tater tots are a must try! The staff was very warm, friendly and proactive, our waitress was amazing and fun. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great local bar near the house. Foods great and you have the opportunity to eat healthy late at night. Great place to watch sports with a packed house. My girlfriend and I get off late from work and enjoy this little spot after our shifts.  The graveyard bartender Jason is incredible, he's personable and everything you could ask for in a bartender. He became our bartender that we love!"}

{"text":"Saturday I came in to watch the pre seasons football games , the bar was full so we had to be place in a waiting list .. after my husband and I waited for ONE hr . One seat opened , as I sat there gambling with my husband STANDING behind me for 30 minutes  2 seat opened on the other side.. I went to get the seats and the Nasty bartender JENN told me I can only have one because she already gave me one .. she wanted to give the other seat to a lady that just walked in , for no reason than to just be an asshole  She said the lady was gonna seat there because she wanted to seat next to her husband LOL NO SHIT I told JENN I have been  waiting for an hr and I want to seat with my husband too ... JENN said \" don't start with me or I will cut you \" I calmly said you have a waiting list and I was next, this lady just walked in,\" JENN kicked me out of the bar .. For no reason   We live in las Vegas where their is millions of bars and gambling ,, why the fuck would I seat there and give them MY money? so i can deal with this crap  and her horrible rude costumer service  I will never go to this place and I don't recommend this bar to anyone ,, you will never win anything at this Bar or get Good costumer service.. if you want a good fun bar go to timbers or Rounders ..."}
{"text":"Now that I live relatively close to this newest location of \"The Bar\", I wanted to try the food and check out the atmosphere. This tavern has a decent menu and has attempted to offer some unique menu items. I first went with a party of 3 on a Saturday evening and had the \"fried\" peanut butter & jelly dessert. It was very good and filling! They also had some drink specials, I think because of some sporting event that was on. Drink prices were nothing to raise an eyebrow at, and pretty standard for this type of establishment.   I checked out the bar/gaming area on a subsequent visit, and service was fine. The Cuban sandwich was a little underwhelming, but I'll probably return and try something else. It's a smoking establishment, which is no bueno but to be expected. The patio is a large area and wasn't being used during my visits."}
