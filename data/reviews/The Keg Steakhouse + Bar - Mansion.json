{"text":"Pros: Chicken Oscar, Rib Steak (Bone-in), fresh rolls, service
Cons: Not having a restaurant in Buffalo, not enough parking lot for everyone, No Wi-Fi

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Yes

On Saturday around 4:00PM, the restaurant was not so full and we did not need to wait to sit. The mansion is impressive and they make a very good use of it. But this is not a place for people that has problem with stairs, because the restrooms are located on the 2nd floor.
The waitress was very nice and friendly. She was always aware when she needs to refill my soda glass. The rolls were fresh and hot, something rare to find on a restaurant. The place is good for big groups and quiet enough for a calm lunch or dinner. This time we decided to try the Chicken Oscar and the Rib Steak.
Overall, the experience was fantastic as always. I did never have a moment where I came to this location or other locations on Canada and did not like. The rib-eye was very juice and delicious. This is why every time I came here to Canada, I want to eat there every time."}
{"text":"Visiting from Binghamton, NY. The service was excellent the food was just as good. I had 6oz med rare w/lobster meat topped with asiago. The meal is from the summer specials."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the mansion. I wanted to come for years. So beautiful   We sat in the library which was more private. Appetizer Brie was baked warm. Rib steak was huge and amazing.   Finished off with a delicious ice-cream birthday cake. 
All staff were incredibly kind. Helped make a very special and memorable night."}
{"text":"My food rating for the Keg chain is typically 4-5 stars as I've only had one bad experience over the 20 or so years of eating at their restaurants.  That one really negative experience just happened to be at this location which I have since forgiven them (read my experience as described in the next paragraph).  My most current experience is reviewed at the new Keg location on the Esplanade which better reflects their typical quality of food and service.  The review I'm giving here is still a 4 star rating based on my numerous visits to this location over the years.  This place is smaller and has tighter spacing between tables with lots of old world charm.  It's an old historic manor with some interesting footnotes for those who like stories (last paragraph)

This is the story which you will hopefully never encounter at any restaurant:  It was a significant birthday occasion and there were only 4 of us.  Despite having made reservations the wait for a table took an hour while we sat at the bar and we were actually debating to leave. After getting seated, it took 15 minutes to get us a menu, 20 minutes to return to take our order and 40 minutes to bring us our food and drinks.  It's been over 2 hours since we arrived and I was starved... eagerly biting into my steak only to discover it was f**king cold! I bitched and it took them another 15 minutes to nuke it and now it was overcooked. No one came back for another 30 minutes.  Needless to say I was pissed and so were my friends.  3 hours to get seated, served and eat my meal.  We asked to speak with the manager and complained... he apologized because they got a bus load of people and were short staffed.  Lousy excuse.

I asked the manager why they never told us at the beginning while we waited.  He didn't have a response but he hesitantly comped us the meal... so we ordered dessert but left still steaming cos it felt like they were doing us a favour.  4 hours to complete one dinner under any circumstances should not happen and then serve us cold food.   We wrote the head office a letter and received a letter of apology from a senior VP but the experience still left a bad taste in my mouth for more than a decade during which other restaurants got my patronage.  It may have been our experience and letter that caused them to alter their policy about making reservations and wait times.  I've never forgotten that evening's experience and it seems they may have learned some lessons on service.   The only reason we went back was due to a decision by my staff to have a company Christmas dinner there.  I have since gone back numerous times and as a matter of fact, they rejected my reservation and that is how I ended up at the Keg Esplanade a few weeks ago.

Other food for thought... this location was Julie's Mansion (before they closed and the Keg took over in the mid-1970's) and my friend worked there up til they shut down.  For those not familiar with that era Julie's was one of the most expensive places to eat in the city (a cheapskate was the person ordering the daily special meal for two costing $90 as that was a lot of moolah those days... think average house price in Toronto was $50,000 so that meal is equivalent to spending $700 today and you're a cheap ass lol).  My buddy told me typical dinners there cost $500-$1000 since celebrities and Texan oil businessmen were their typical customers.  Let's say I would never know since I don't drop $4-$8 grand on meals and I suppose I can't complain that the Keg charges a measly $33 for their rib eye as my whole dinner could be had for under 50 bucks.

On a historical note, the story behind this location may be of more interest to some than the food.  It's an old historically designated building built in the year of Canada's confederation (1867) and owned at one time by the very wealthy Masseys. It's during this period where certain deaths have rumours circulating about ghosts.  One of the dining rooms and the second floor where the washrooms apparently are spooked if you believe in that kind of thing.  I have not personally experienced any unusual moving apparitions of any kind but eat at your own risk.  The only thing I find eerie is the awful colour of the yellow brick exterior (not very appetizing).  Parking here is a premium so TTC, taxi or walk it may be the better way.  If you've read this far, I'll apologize for this long ass review but it has taken 20 years for me to get it off my chest (they didn't have internet back then so no place for me to blog) and I promise to keep any future reviews much shorter."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place, partly based on these reviews, that I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. I wish I had made another choice. On the positive side, this is a beautiful building. Old, stately, lovely interior. However, upon entering we were basically thrust into a teeming crowd. Servers running every which way, a nearly deafening level of noise. . . I had my doubts right away. We started upstairs at the bar. Another red flag: not a single place to sit, a 20 minute wait for a drink, and one of the most poorly made vodka sodas I've ever had. A double tasted weaker than a regular single. Loud dance music blared, servers and patrons jostled each other. We couldn't hear to speak to each other. usually in such scenarios I would leave, but we were hungry and didn't feel like wandering the streets seeking sustenance. We were finally seated, not in the downstairs area that we had requested but in the upper dining room, where there was no respite from the cacaphony. Under the circumstances, the service was great. But it isn't, to me, a very pleasant dining experience when one's waiter appears exhausted and overworked. The people working here are doing their best, but since the management don't allow reservations on friday or saturdays (and it's obvious why: you can get many more people to come and wait for ages if you don't reserve seats), it really isn't possible for the staff to do much in the way of personalized service.
The steak was decent. But the whole assembly-line, get everyone in and out as fast as possible atmosphere was stressful. We ate hurriedly and got out fast. Not what I had been hoping for in an expensive restaurant that tries to portray itself as 'upscale.'

Perhaps it was simply a mistake to come on a friday night. I'm still willing to give this place a chance; perhaps stopping by the bar level on a monday night might be an idea."}
{"text":"Maybe it isn't hip to like a franchise restaurant, but I've been to the Keg Mansion several times (15+) and I must say that I'm always satisfied.  I like the atmosphere - usually busy but still feels intimate enough to carry on a conversation.  The servers are knowledgeable and friendly for the most part - sometimes a little rehearsed sounding but at least they cover all the bases.

Food always arrives hot and fresh and at the right time - not too fast and not too slow.  Mushrooms Neptune is always a good starter and they provide fresh baked bread right after you order.  

I think the steaks are great - I usually get a NY strip done medium and I would say that it is nearly always perfectly done.  My wife's order arrived too rare one time and we asked for it to be corrected.  They did so promptly, and refreshed the sides with the new plate.  They apologized and provided a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience.  That's what I call exceeding expectations!

Last night we went to the Keg and it came up in conversation that it was my birthday.  They brought dessert to the table on the house - sans the cheesy song and dance you get at some places.

I'll be back. Many times I'm sure."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom neptune and lobster gratinee.  Both were way too salty and not very flavourful.  My partner had the meatball, and it was just okay.  The tomato sauce that came with the meatball was too sugary.  Why add sugar to perfectly good tomoto??  I heard the French union soup is good though.
Service and ambiance were great, but we won't be going back.
btw unfortunately I did not see any ghosts in the women's washroom..."}
{"text":"We decided to go to the  Keg Mansion to celebrate a birthday, we were 8.  Everyone was looking forward to a great steak and it was a true disappointment.  The majority ordered a New York strip loin.  Our servers were great and they made every effort to provides us with our requests, however the actual food was to say the least, mediocre. The Caesar salad was bland, the escargot wasn't at all as I remembered it, but the worse was the main entrée.  Our steaks were not charred at all, they appeared to be boiled.  They were warm, almost on the cool side. I sent my steak  back because it was too rare and it was the best decision because when I got it back they had obviously put it on the grill.  It came back grilled and hot.  My mashed potatoes and vegetables also came back hot which made the meal so much better.  My husband also complained to the waiter that his steak appeared boiled.  Overall, everyone was disappointed with their meals.  They were cold, the vegetable were tasteless, the mushrooms over cooked, flavourless and just not a good experience. The staff were aware that we were dissatisfied and brought out 3 desserts on the house. Thanks, but at those prices it was a let down. I remember going there years ago and being happy with the food, after all, it's steak, how can  you mess that up...well they did."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant dining experience at this Keg location, primarily because of our server. He was really friendly and attentive. I also loved the \"mansion\". It was beautiful and had a classy atmosphere. 

I ordered Chicken Oscar ($21) and it was delicious! It was accompanied by scallops, shrimp, asparagus and mashed potatoes. Although the chicken was supposed to be the main ... I enjoyed the scallops, shrimps and my mashed potatoes more. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were flavourful. I also tried the Prime Ribs ($24-29) which my boyfriend ordered and it was really tender and juicy. 

I wanted to get a dessert .. which contained no peanuts. Our server, however, told us that all the desserts may contain peanuts as they are stored together.. :/ But I enjoyed this place and I look forward to coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place is a must go .
Authentic , excellent ambiance , steaks are succulent and cooked to order  .
Sea food as good as steaks .
Wine menu covers all tastes . 
Hosts were excellent  . 
Whenever i m in Toronto i will first go there . 
Just a great place to dine in . Chapeau .

{"text":"I'm an over all fan of the Keg, but best of all is the keg mansion. The food is always good. I don't do seafood but the steak is always to my satisfaction and I'm pretty picky. The mansion stands out because of it's ambiance. It's located in an old mansion, which is supposed to be haunted. The downstairs is where the dining room is located, and upstairs is their lounge area. 

The location is fairly easily accessible too and they do have parking. 

Best of all if you're a fan of the keg is the actual house. Worth going just to take it all in."}
{"text":"Wine menu was excellent, service was outstanding, steak was exquisite, and the dessert was a delicious surprise! Definitely recommend for groups, dates, special occasions, etc. It's a lovely restaurant with a very nice atmosphere (despite the haunted rumors!) and really great staff. I would suggest reserving a space ahead of time as the place is very popular the closer it gets to the weekend, but other than that the location is convenient with Wellesley Stn nearby, parking available on the street and in the front and bus routes right on the corner of Jarvis and Wellesley street. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"ordered sirloin oscar w mixed veges on the side. loved it! plus a perfect medium rare & bearnaise sauce on top was amazing!!
got mango creme brulee mini for dessert n it was a fairly good size n came w fruits as well. food 4.5/5 service 5/5"}
{"text":"Great place for a nice steak dinner! The service is really good and the food never disappoints i enjoy going here for birthdays or on special occasion. The sirloin with goat cheese and pecans is a must."}
{"text":"Had a very negative experience with friends recently. They forgot us at the bar for an hour (after being quoted 20min), then when we asked they told us that a) we missed our page, then b) we thought you had left, and c) the pagers are broken/not working. A simple \"sorry\" without the lame (and contradictory) excuses would have sufficed. The food was fair, at best. My baseball steak was fine, but lacking seasoning. Two people at the table had overdone meat, one person seemed to have a bad cut - too tough to eat. The apps were very mediocre. It's time for a menu update! We all enjoyed our vodka martinis thoroughly - there's still hope yet."}
{"text":"I had my very first steak at the Keg Mansion about 7 years ago, and it blew my mind. The new york striploin I had was succulent, juicy and super flavourful. It definitely tingled my senses. The double baked potato was very delicious. The staff were really nice, and since we had reservations, it didn't take long to have us seated. Since then, I've returned at least once a year, and have never been disappointed. The quality of their food never diminished."}
{"text":"The steaks were great, the sides a little cold. 
For $13 I felt the crab cake appetizer was too small a portion.
Overall I had a nice experience, the service was good, there was a nice atmosphere and the steaks were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The Keg Mansion is where people who never go out to dinner, go out for special occasion stuff like Valentine's day. It's also where people from the suburbs who move downtown go for a \"nice dinner\". If you ask me, it's the Olive Garden in a dress. However, I hear that the steak is good.

The layout is like a big house, with lots of regular dinning tables and snuggly little nooks with fire places and stuff. That part is okay, but the service is mediocre and I'm just not into paying a lot for something that feels like a chain no matter how you cut it."}
{"text":"Many have told me that this restaurant does not offer anything special other than its historical  mansion. Well... I believe that is what it distinguishes itself from regular keg restaurants. I really enjoyed the atmosphere here as well as great steak. Customer service was great while I have to say that the wait was very long. I remember waiting to be seated for more than 2 hours when I was there last time. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the atmosphere was great. Only thing that was a concern was the hostess. It was a very busy evening and there was no reservations, our names were on the waiting list, yet i still saw a few people u clearly came after me got seated first. Didnt want to make a big deal at the moment but i did manage to speak to a manager. 
His excuse for me was foolish. He says the tables for that room was for 3-4 people, and we had a party for 2. The funny thing is our table was next to that room, and looking over, we saw plenty of tables for 2. So Mr peewee herman manager, get ur shit straight"}
{"text":"Was I ever disappointed.  This used to be a solid place for steaks; now, it's become a tired assembly line franchise.  Not sure what happened over the past few years.  For the price, there are better options and in fact, each Keg seems to be different too (the one on York Street is better).  Steak was way fatty, sides seemed to be slopped together quickly and worst of all - it was all COLD which means it must have been sitting for some time.  Despite the food, the service is still good.  Our server was attentive and patient with our big group.  If you don't care about the good, ambiance is still there... +ives: service, historic -ives: assembly line food"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and I wanted to go someplace close to the office that was cool. Friend took me here. I thought \"oh great a place called the keg?\". This place was jumping on a tuesday night. Music was loud and the crowd was cool. Service was very good, we sat in the lounge which was nice and dark, fireplaces, nice touch. I have to say I was surprised. The food was nothing special, we had caesar salad, calamari appetizer both were tasty and the calamari was not overcooked, which is a big plus. I got the almond sirloin, which in retrospect I wish I went with a better cut of steak, because although it taste ok the meat was tough, but that was my fault. All and all you are paying for service and atmosphere, we had appetizer, salads, entrees, drinks, dessert and coffee and our bill was under $200.00 Very nice.
I would go back for sure..

{"text":"Excellent ambiance and historic location. I invited my brother for his bday and we asked to be seated in booth area which was very relaxing. The food was delicious. I had peppercorn new york steak and my brother had the manhattan cut new york steak. They were cooked to perfection. I also asked for extra peppercorn & au-jus sauce on side. Their bread was also a good compliment to the steak. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the food. I would definitely highly recommend it. Bon appetit"}
{"text":"Love this place and have been going here since it opened. They only problem with that is that I also got older and have problems managing the stairs. The washrooms are on the second floor and there is no elevator. I wish they would add one to aid their aging fans. 
We were here to celebrate my sons birthday. Many family and friends celebrations have taken place here over the years. We love the food, service and ambiance. If they could only add an elevator I would be in heaven. They do have free parking which is a plus so if they could please eliminate this last issue I have with this location all would be good."}
{"text":"Thank you to the staff for helping me pull off the best surprise birthday dinner for my boyfriend! Everyone was very accommodating, friendly and the food was fantastic. It was an excellent dining experience and I would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We were urged to try out the keg by a really nice guy named Mike who we met on a golf course.  That might have been the greatest suggestion of my life.  

We walked up from our hotel to find a really cool looking building that serves as the location for the Keg.  We're from Boston, so we have been into the Smith and Wollensky in our city that has a similar vibe (it's in a historical landmark called the Castle).  

The vibe inside was pretty hectic.  We went in at 9pm and were told there'd be a 45 minute wait.  We walked up the elaborate staircase to the bar, got three seats, and ordered drinks.  Now, this is where the adventure begins.  There were five of us to three seats, but two seats just happened to open up, so we had five seats at the bar.  Three of us wanted to sit at a table, two didn't.  Our wonderful bartender, Alex, suggested we stay and eat.  Great idea!  We ordered our apps and more drinks, and the apps were fantastic.  We asked her many questions about the city, the food, the drinks; all of which were expertly answered.  She knows her stuff.  She was really engaging, asking us questions, joking with us, and taking our general Bostonian loudness and sense of humor very well.  

After several well made drinks, we opted for a bottle of Merlot, again suggested by Alex.  It was fantastic and paired well with our meals, of which I had the 7oz filet, blue rare.  The steak was perfection.  At this time, we were really getting excellent service from Alex, and she enlisted bartender #2 to help, since we were a large workload for a bar.  Her name is Tiuu, and was equally as impressive as Alex.  A nice gentleman and his newlywed bride had taken two seats next to us and we started up a conversation.  Really nice guy.  He set up the whole bar with shots of Patron to commemorate his new marriage.  That just opened us up to more general goofiness.  The bartenders were making us drinks that we'd never heard of, and they were fantastic.  

We were told by our excellent bartenders that the building was haunted.  After several minutes of intrigue, they called the restaurant manager over to tell us more.  He did, and since we were so intrigued, he took us up to the 4th floor where there is only office and storage, but is haunted.  He said they don't usually take people up there, but since we're from Boston and liked the historical story, he'd show us around.  I mean, is that service or what?!

All in all, it will go down as one of the best nights of my life.  We were there from 9pm-2am.  Just an excellent evening, excellent food, and the best service I've encountered from a restaurant.  The bill was not at all exorbitant, as the steaks are really well-priced for the segment.  I'd recommend this particular Keg to anyone in the Toronto area.  Do yourselves a favor and ask for Alex and Tiuu.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"great ambiance and service.. delicious steaks. Very well rounded restaurant in my opinion. good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times! This place never disappoints. I love it! Great drinks! Had some bourbon strawberry concoction. So delicious. Ordered bacon wrapped scallops, top sirloin with succulent grilled shrimp. Our waitress brought warm sourdough bread to the table. The ambiance was celebratory. Really enjoyed our dinner and evening here."}
{"text":"Been coming to the keg many years .. Atleast twice a month. Yesterday was like no other.. Food was not acceptable, was bland, cold and just lacked the effort. Service was very pushy.. As she was annoyed to be serving us.. After coming to this specific location because of the service and food quality we usually get is superb.. Last night changed our opinions on the keg.. Which was once a loved Franchise by my partner and I. Disappointing to see this after being loyal to the brand for so long!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service. I had the prime rib and it was good."}
{"text":"Great food, great wine list, I cannot recall ever having bad service here ...  I guess that would be why my boyfriend and I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My only comment is regarding the noise level. If you want a quieter meal go upstairs and seek out the South East corner area beyond the bar. A lot quieter and I have always received good service. Being a historic bulding (the former Massey Family Mansion) they have done a nice job of interior renovations. Food and Drink are up to the usual high Keg standards, but do I wish they would get rid of those greasy fried shredded onions. I always forget to ask them not to add them to my order as I hate wasting food. Also if you are dining alone you can eat at the upstairs bar and watch the game of your choice on the large TV"}
{"text":"I love the atmsophere, calm and dim lighting makes for a great dinning experience. Came here to celebrate a birthday and the wait staff was very sweet. I told her im celebrating a birthday and she said the vanilla ice cream chocolate cake was complimentary. After we finished our meal which is always delicious at the keg,  she completely surprised him with the cake. I had a virgin caesar which was made perfectly and two Atlantic lobster tail with rice. Although the rice was nice, the lobster was a bit dried and melted butter was kind of bland, I didnt care so much for thr dip as I like my lobster with lemon juice. 
The portion for the prime rib and mashed potatoes are hugh, we had to do a takeout of it. 
I can't wait to come back here, it's my favorite place  to celebrate a birthday or go for some great food.

Thanks to the key for a wonderful dining experience and for making birthdays memorable."}
{"text":"Went last night to celebrate my birthday with family. Reservation done for 8:30pm, party of 5 and we were seated on time. Hostess was friendly. We started with 2 appetizers. Calamari and bacon wrapped scallops. Both were really good and warm bread served was fantastic. Keg sized mojito was specially made with Splenda as I'm diabetic. Waiter had no problem making the substitution. Our waiter was fantastic. Perfect mix of asking if we wanted anything further without being overbearing. He was polite, funny and made it a great dining experience. -1 star as my NY peppercorn was ordered as medium rare but came rare. Offer to re-grill was offered. Birthday cheesecake was complimentary. Overall dining experience and atmosphere was great and I would return and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I had a great anniversary dinner at the Keg Mansion. Steak + Lobster were delicious, the meat was perfectly cooked and juicy. The tuna tartare is amazing. Service was good and faster than I thought. The first dessert listed on the menu will blow your mind."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. The $18 burger is not made in house and you can get a better burger from literally anywhere. The fries that came along with it were also less than good and they gave us literally 12 fries. The prime rib was so-so. The restaurant itself is beautiful and we sat in the sunroom which was nice and private. Our server was slightly annoying and not very attentive. I had to shout at him a few times to keep him from running off after filling water or dropping menus \"hey wait! I have a question\". I definitely wouldn't come back for the $150 price tag we paid."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but the fact it's in an old \"haunted\" mansion in downtown TO is pretty cool! 

I've been here a few times and I have yet to be disappointed. The food is good (meat always cooked the way I want it, veggies fresh/never overcooked/wilted,  and i LOVE the garlic mashed potatoes - yum!), and service is excellent! We waited 30 mins to be seated on a Friday (they don't take reservations on Fridays), but it's well worth the wait!  

I have only 2 complaints - 1.) It's LOUD (I found myself shouting across the table), and 2.) it's a little too dark inside (Why not? It IS a \"haunted\" house after all!) :P"}
{"text":"The best Keg I've encountered anywhere. Service is excellent, the architecture and mansion is pure Gothic Victorian Revival of great historical importance to the city. Most important? Food quality 5 stars , great place to meet and mingle. Ask for the solarium on the 2nd floor for a special occasion, separated from all other patrons. The room is a real treat, although very difficult to get over the front doors of the mansion. Very highly recommended. Watch whom you bump elbows with, you never know a famous person a few seats over, as I found out!!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. The Keg mansion continue to be one of the best spots in the city with AMAZING STEAKS, WONDERFUL SERVICE, and EXCELLENT ATMOSPHERE. I justed finished a dinner at the Keg. we came late so didnt get a table at one of the main dining rooms... hence, we headed to the 2nd floor... to the Bar...(The bar has no reservations policy, just came in, grab a chair or a table.. and enjoy nice music, cool people... and some Hockey as well :) )

The service by TERRY was the best ever. She is just a very good representation for most of the beautiful waitress who worked aside her during this shift. 

When we had a tiny 'hiccup' with the service, MATT, the manager approached us, solved the issue in no time, and ensured the dinner will continue to be just perfect. he said and I quote 'you hold us to the highest standards which we hold ourselves to...'  (What a nice thing to say supporting the customer, and showing how much he appreciate the place and the brand he works for) 

As you can see by my reviews.. I eat in restaurants many times a week, but I NEVER received so much attention when raising an issue by the manager, who took my 'well being' on himself, ensuring a wonderful experience. 

No doubts, the Keg is my favorite place for a good steak (I ate the NY which was fabulous). Also, I love those small desserts they serve in the end of the meal. give it a try, you wont be disappointed. 

Matt, Terry - Thank you for making my Saturday night so nice and tasty!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more for scenery. The basement and top floor was blocked off, so the only thing opened was the first and second floor. They hostess put me and my boyfriend in a small room, VERY cozy, a bit too cozy for me..not at all intimate.

Try the santa fe chicken dip! That was delish, usually im against getting chicken at a steakhouse but that was superb.

My boyfriend's steak was a bit dry, my steak salad, was alright. Nothing spectacular. 

Food is overrated at this location, i like the keg near Maple much better, and best customer service there ever!

Overall it was a good experience, but i'll probably drive to Maple if i want to go to the keg."}
{"text":"Awesome, one of the best steaks I have ever had. Right up there with all the top steak places. Had the fillet. Cooked perfectly. Great service as well. Cool atmosphere. Prices were surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing! I have loved every meal I have had here. It's very close to my house, so I can't help to be a regular.  As a server I love good service, and the keg mansion has the most amazing servers.  Bacon wrapped scallops, prime rib steak, and trio of deserts. Best meal ever! And a tip: add the blue cheese crust to every steak. Only $2. Best deal ever!"}
{"text":"I took my hubby here for his Birthday recently. We were tucked away in a romantic little booth. The service was awesome. The food was good. The prices are decent too. The feel is cozy elegance."}
{"text":"I would rate the food 4. Ambience 1. Unless you're into yelling at your party all night, seeing college kids screaming at their batchelor party. Seriously, I don't get why this place attracts the loud obnoxious crowd. Must be the good prices with the feeling that you're actually in a very classy place. It was my dad's birthday celebration and we had to leave before cake arrived as the noise was intolerable. We were in the small back room called library in main level. The staff was great and compensated us with free dessert and apps but experience was ruined for a $200 dinner."}
{"text":"Great steaks nice service. Gets pretty busy though"}
{"text":"Overall, great experience. Great food and service. Nice setting and in my opinion pretty fairly priced.

Got the baseball steak and my GF got the NY strip- both very good and the sides were also v tasty.

Honestly, can't find any downfalls.

Would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with the family a few times for dinner. I think the steaks are decent but over priced here. I think of the Keg as 1 bar above places like Jack Astors. They try to market themselves as a specialty steak house but they really fall short with their quality of beef and cooking. I have had way better steaks at Peter Lugers in NYC and Keens in NYC, those places are true specialty steakhouses. 

Every time I have been here, I have come as a group of 8-10 people with reservations, and I have always felt cramped as heck(and I am a thin person). The service I guess is normal but not great. I have really never really understood the draw of this place."}
{"text":"Background: I had a great first experience here in a small group of 4 on a weekday, so I decided that I wanted to celebrate my birthday at the Mansion. So I emailed ahead to ask for reservations for a group of 15 on a Saturday evening. I was informed that they would not take any reservations and was advised to arrive an hour early for seating. 

Facility: Located on the northeast corner of Jarvis and Wellesley, there is free parking after 5:30pm for guests of The Keg. Otherwise, it's pay enforced (this is a new thing they just added in recent months). Parking IS cramped though, so larger vehicles beware. Washrooms are okay, the decor is romantic, although the upstairs by the bar is quite loud. 

Food Quality & Price: Food is a little more pricey than other Keg locations (either that, or there was a recent price increase). My usually favourite the Blue Cheese Fillet has gone up again, now at $37 for 7oz (no other options). I asked for medium rare, and got medium well. I didn't ask for them to remake it because there was absolutely no time and we needed it on the fly. The first time I came (weekday) it was perfection, this time around, was just sloppy. I was overall, slightly disappointed by our experience. 

Service: Leading up to the day of, email exchanges were curt and to the point. We arrived at 6:30 and was told that the wait would be around a hour, we were not seated until 8:30 (2 hours) and had to leave by 9:30!! So it was really pushing it. As we waited upstairs by the bar, waitresses were visibly frazzled. When they asked some members of our group what they wanted to drink, if you have them more than a 5 second hesitation, they would just walk away! This happened on more than one occasion. The location was busy and packed, no one wanted to give us the time of day. We made the most of it anyway. 

When we were finally seated, we ordered on the fly. Everyone was starving. Service during the sit-down meal was superb. We ate and were out the door by quarter to 10 (although my steak left much to be desired).

Overall: AVOID WEEKENDS!! It's an absolute mess here on the weekend, service slacks, no reservations, wait times are horrid, staff is frazzled/frustrated and it shows. My experience at the Keg Mansion during weekday evenings was so much more relaxing and pleasant. I would certainly recommend that The Keg Mansion reviews their no reservation policy for weekends and allot a certain number for special occasion/events or large groups. It was just absolute chaos and that pressure was reflected on the faces of their staff and the quality of the food.

Weekday grade, 4.5/5, weekend grade 2.3/5. Average = 3/5."}
{"text":"Easily, hands down , the BEST Keg location in the entire city;  the entire GTA. This is the Keg with history, with class and built into the original Victorian facade of the Massey Mansion (and most certainly haunted!) and of course some beautiful , delicious food and wines. 

The individuals, from bar staff to wait staff to management are really superb. As a few times a year frequent customer to the Keg Mansion, I've had had the opportunity to have management just come up and talk to my party, offer deals and specials as well as talking about the mansion and the history around it. I admit, parking is a tight one, but it's the Keg Mansion;  it's so worth the trip for those who have never seen the old a Victorian home on Jarvis St., where in the early - mid 19th century, the very RICH upper class ruled this street with grand mansions. 

The wait time can be tough, but if you walk in on a Friday night at 6pm, of course you're going to wait. That's a no brainer. But even then, they run a tight ship and with the size of the mansion, I've had to wait , at tops 25 minutes possibly. That is the time you visit the upstairs full bar level , sit back, enjoy some drinks and before you know it, they are calling you to your table. 

The second floor, the staircase to the second floor is certainly haunted and the management will tell numerous stories.  I've also had the pleasure of sitting by some very very famous Canadians, some true legends in he restaurant so keep your eyes open ! The whole place, asides from just the wonderful food has a well documented history of its own and it's a must go Keg to eat at and just take a look at the beauty around you. 

Hard working staff. Always seeming to go out of their way to make is your night of superb service. 5/5."}
{"text":"Appetizers were great. Atmosphere was great. Service was quick and polite Steaks were great.  Adults had a good time, kids had a good time and price was fair for the quality. Can't believe I waited so long to visit."}
{"text":"Best looking keg out there! Food is good, just like any other keg. Loved dining upstairs with the ghosts."}
{"text":"One of our good friend from HK came back to Toronto for a short visit. His demands was he wanted steak because the steaks in HK are not good and way overpriced. So he wanted to go to the Keg to get his steak craving fixed while he was here in Toronto. The Keg Mansion is one of the chains from the Keg Steakhouse but it is in a heritage building and it is also known to be haunted with ghosts. Spooky ....

It was also a great UW reunion, it's really hard now to get the group together. There was a big group of us and the downstairs dining room was packed with people and it was only 6pm. We went upstairs to try our luck at the upstairs dining room, there wasn't many big tables available as most of them sits 2-4 people. But we were in luck that they had a large table at the back but they wouldn't sit us until there was 80% of us on site.

There were lots of steak options, and decided on the 8oz blackened sirloin coated with herb butter and baked potato. The steak was not bad, but ever since I had that A5 Black Tajima, no steak I tried afterwards has been comparable. So I don't want to be bias but the Keg's steak was ok, worth the price I paid is what I can say. The herb butter melted into the steak so it was not dry, didn't have to order separate sauce. I was really full so I didn't get desserts but some of us got the mini desserts and it was still huge, shareable! I ended up helping my friend eat 1/2 of the brownie."}
{"text":"My favourite steakhouse. Much more affordable than Morton's, and the service here is top-notch. I've been here a dozen times and it has not disappointed yet. Jay, the maitre-d, is awesome."}
{"text":"Steak is good or whatever....but the veggies they give you are so embarrassing. I can make nicer looking veggies from a $2.99 bag of frozen vegetables from loblaws...."}
{"text":"Wow, started with the insanely garlic escargot, then onto the house prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes.... Man oh man was it great"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience at the Keg Mansion. The mansion is really pretty and the service was impeccable. 

We started with a couple cocktails - the jalapeño margarita and the cucumber cooler. I wasn't a big fan of the cooler but the margarita was well made. 

For the main course, we got the sirloin Oscar and the Prime Rib. The prime rib came with a choice of garden salad, Caesar or spinach salad. I got the spinach salad which was crisp and was made well with strawberries and pecans. We got the garlic mashed potatoes and the twice baked potato as sides. The twice baked potato was an absolute winner! Apparently the potato is baked, scooped and mixed with bacon, chives and sour cream and baked again..yumm!! Among the steaks, I liked the sirloin better. It was just more flavorful. 

We ended the evening browsing through the ghost log - a collection of stories of real sightings and what not. Definitely read through a few of them to be entertained if nothing else!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant for a date! Décor is awesome and staff is nice and professional. Parking might be challenging for some."}
{"text":"Great food for the price and great atmosphere.  The only drawback is that it is sometimes hard to find a parking spot and they don't take reservations so sometimes you have to wait 30 minutes for a table.  The mansion has an interesting history.

Ooops, sorry, only Friday they don't take reservations.  They also have a great system, in that they give you a beeper, so you can have a drink or walk the neighbourhood while you wait."}
{"text":"I have been to this area in Toronto many times but last night was my first time finding this amazing restaurant/bar. We had the tuna tacos and burger sliders, simply great. Not to mention the fast ,friendly, service and just stunning atmosphere and decor coupled with a great drink selection. Also they are open until 12! We got in late after 10pm staying on church st. I just had to give this place a 5!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'd go here again. If you're going to go to a Keg...make this the one. They treat it like it's an actual fancy restaurant...which is great because at any Keg, you're paying fancy restaurant prices. The Mansion looks like the hotel from The Shining, which is also a bonus."}
{"text":"One of the only places in the city that I can honestly say has never disappointed me. Every single time I go (which is more often then I'd like to admit) My steak is done to perfection and my sides are scrumptious. Well priced for  the food and the atmosphere; the old Mansion allows you to be able to dress up  little without feeling out of place at a franchise. The private table on the top floor is romantic and intimate; to all the men reading this you should definitely reserve that spot for your lady ;) 

My go-to order is the grilled top sirloin but I've gotten the pecan sirloin as well. All have been delicious. Service is wonderful; waiters are pleasant and attentive. I've been to other Keg's and none of them match the Mansion in terms of quality of service."}
{"text":"I've come here numerous times over the years, mostly for friends Birthday parties or random get togethers, however I have never come here for the steak. Yes, I know that's strange and wrong. However, up until very recently (a few weeks to be exact) I did not enjoy steak, so that might explain why I have never had the Keg's steak before. 

I have, however had lots of their appetizers and countless of their cocktails, and I have yet to be disappointed. The shredded steak dip is delicious, as are their nachos, and trio of sliders. All very, very yummy. 
Their cocktails, from the Mojitos to their Martini's are well executed and just potent enough to not knock me over after a couple. 

The atmosphere in this place is great - historical and classy. I really like it here. My only complain would be that the last time I was here it was so super busy that my friend's and I felt a bit neglected by our server, but nothing tragic. 

My next visit to The Keg (which will be pretty soon) will include a big, juicy steak."}
{"text":"Fantastic food in a charming setting. The lobster medallions were fantastic and they will let you order them without the sirloin. The steaks were fantastic. The best was the wait staff, our waitress was helpful with local question and took great care of us. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My gf took me to dinner there the other night after my first day in Canada. This place is set up pretty cool, it's an old mansion (as the name implies) that has been completely redone and turned into a restaurant. We were in a side room on the 2nd floor that only had 2 other parties (one was a 10 top) along with 2 servers so the service was pretty attentive. We started with some drinks and the server (Tommy or Johnny) was nice enough to entertain my gf's request for something 'fruity that doesn't taste too much like alcohol'. I had a special cocktail with Hendricks gin, lime, lemon and cucumber that tasted too much like lemonade to me but my gf of course loved it. 

This is a steak restaurant and I ordered the prime rib at the suggestion of the server and my gf had a NY sirloin with roasted red peppers and goat cheese. Both were amazing and came with mashed potatoes and a twice baked potato, respectively. Also, mine came with some au jus and some homemade horseradish that was amazingly strong. Both of our meals were delicious and I will certainly go back next time I'm in Toronto. 

There were two faults that account for the missing star: first, the prices do not match the clientele and atmosphere. The noise level was up there and I saw at least 8 people wearing t-shirts, jean shorts, etc. Second, It took a while for the server to notice that we were ready to settle up, only the 10 top remained at this time but we still sat there waiting for a check, even with 2 servers. 

Overall: great food and friendly staff, will def return."}
{"text":"What can I say I love this place, I have been coming here for years and I am never disappointed with the service or the food. The keg mansion is a special place with a great atmosphere and great food. The staff is amazing, always accommodating with my gluten allergy, I recommend the mansion to anyone who loves meat."}
{"text":"Great place to get a late night meal. Go up to the second floor as the main floor closes much earlier. I find the steak a bit chewy and the sides ok but there aren't a lot of late night places open that you can get a decent meal. The bartender doesn't make any effort to greet you as you enter. She was more interested in chatting with the regulars but the rest of the staff are attentive"}
{"text":"Better than just a standard location of the keg, if for no other reason than the mystique. 

Food Quality: The keg has great food and a pretty wide menu selection. I have had every steak on the menu, and they're all good. The Salmon is good too. To start I like the crab cakes. The true hidden gem of the keg however, is the Keg burger. You must be in the bar/lounge area to order it, but believe me it's worth it. It's cheap too, like 12 dollars, who knew you could have an econo-meal at the keg.

Service: I've never had bad service at the Keg ever (50 plus visits in the last few years). The service is always great, and the keg mansion is no exception. Friendly service, timely food arrival, appropriate attentiveness, the list goes on.

Decor: The Keg sticks out in my mind for great interior decoration. The decor at the keg mansion is even better. It's what can only be described as classy and cool. I love how it's an old mansion from the outside, but current and up to date style wise inside. It's worth a visit for the environment alone.

Great place overall!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent.  Just beware of paranormal activity.  My cup of coffee spilled for no apparent reason.  OOooooooh.

Interesting history on the house too."}
{"text":"Great food and service at The Keg Mansion every single time. The surroundings only heighten the experience, as does the rumour that the house is haunted.

The restaurant is located at Jarvis & Wellesley and has plenty of parking. From Wellesley Station, walk east (or take the bus) to Jarvis. Keg Mansion is on the north east side.

No matter what occasion we celebrate here, we always have a good time. The staff are attentive and prompt, and the steaks are to die for. You definitely pay for the privilege but in my opinion it's well worth the money.

The only thing to bear in mind is that the wait for a table in the downstairs restaurant can be lengthly, so feel free to ask the host to seat you upstairs in the bar. I would definitely make a reservation if you are with a large group or want to sit downstairs.

Although there are definitely better steakhouses in Toronto, and in reality the food is a little overpriced, The Keg has them beat due to the unusual premises and the great ambiance."}
{"text":"Took my partner here for his birthday and wow was it awesome!

This place wins in all areas including, but not limited to; decor, service, and food! I ordered the chicken with scallops and shrimp with mashed potatoes, and my partner ordered the streak with scallops and shrimp with baked potato. We then cut the meals in half so we could each experience both.

Food was delicious and the service was even better. Our waiter, Mike, was attentive and very helpful.

When my partner went to the bathroom, I told our waiter it was his birthday and he said \"I got this.\" Next thing we knew there was a GIANT dessert with two forks coming out and it was amazing tasting - and comped!

The Good:

1. Staff. Exceptional staff. The Keg has a wonderful training program.
2. Decor. Being the most famous of the Kegs, its a very classy feel in there like you're dining in another time period.
3. Food. Delicious food, perfect temperature and timing.

The Bad:

1. Resos. They do not take reservations on Saturday which can make it difficult to get a table because this place is extremely busy.

Recommendation: GO!"}
{"text":"I would give the telephone service a 0 star. The person that answered phone calls on January 8th in the evening, believe she identified her name as Lacey, was very rude & abrupt. Tried to make a reservation for my fathers b'day for 25 people & after advising me of the days they don't make reservations for she quickly responded by wanting to end the call by saying \"OKkkkkk\" & didn't appear as if she wanted to explore additional options for me. Talk about Customer Service friendly! And when asked about January 22nd (the Sunday when they do accept reservations), she didn't ask what time, she put me on hold for a good few minutes than returned & advised they were completely booked. When I looked at the availability on my Open Table app I confirmed there was availability, talk about ethics of this restaurant's staff & me bringing back my business there. Will explore other options, not a very professional & appropriate representation of an option I'd do business with!"}
{"text":"I was just here again the other day. It was the first time things did not go our way. I think the server was occupied with a big party that seemed to be in his section. 

Our food was pretty good, but we always order the same thing so it's obvious when something is not quite right. The biggest thing was that one of our sides was cold and bland... and had a hair in it. 

Thankfully we were comp'd $15 for the mistake, but I would have been happier if the server had just checked in on us at least once so it could have been fixed sooner. We are pretty laid-back, and we know what kind of service is usually the standard there so this review is forgiving. Just imagine if we were first-timers! Not good."}
{"text":"We started with the famous the keg's bread, after we got our main plates, I got a rare top sirloin perfectly cooked with a fully loaded potato, my fiancé got a rare New York steak with fries. It was good but a little chewy at times. My fiancé's mom got the honey salmon, she said that it was really tasty. And his dad got the ribs and he was really happy with it. For dessert, my fiancé got a cheesecake on the house for his graduation, it was a nice gesture. And it was delicious, I got the mango creme brûlée, it was good as well. I would come back."}
{"text":"Yummy porterhouse steak. Service/Value/Ambience:4/5 

Best Keg experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I had the bacon wrapped fillet with roasted red pepper, asparagus and baked potato. All perfectly prepared. Our entire party was extremely happy with their meals.

Absolutely amazing service. Our server was attentive, energetic and extremely professional. The bartender upstairs was also great.

The atmosphere was perfect. Busy without being overwhelming or noisy.

My only complaint was the paranormal experience that evening. I had a romantic rendezvous with a Succubus, that quite honestly, was significantly below my standards. I guess my expectation would be that a place like that would have some hotter phantasms."}
{"text":"I do not think anyone will disagree with this statement: the best Keg location nationwide in terms of ambiance.   Make sure to make a reservation on the weekends because this place is packed. In terms of food quality and service, it is consistent with any other Keg franchise in Canada. The music is quite loud so if you want a quieter place, you may want to try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent Prime Rib & great service."}
{"text":"I adore this place- it's where white people go to feel snobby and rich when they really aren't.

The food is incredible, worth the price for sure. The staff is generally very helpful and they're very good at helping you pick if you can't choose. 

One important thing to note: if you bring your kids here, you're a tool and I dislike you. This is a very nice restaurant, quiet, classy and romantic...do not spoil it with your loud annoying kids...get a sitter."}
{"text":"It's only the second time that I've been here this year and I'm wondering why I don't come more often. I was there with a friend last night and enjoyed amazing food in a great atmosphere. The steaks were fantastic as were all the accompaniments. I went for the lobster special starter and my friend the scallops, both were great. After dinner we headed up to the bar to finish our wine. A very enjoyable evening and I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance is pretty standard Keg fair. The Mansion stands out because it's a little more formal. My issues are exclusively with service. 

- Parties of two should not be placed in a room filled with parties of 8 - 10. I could hardly hear my partner speaking all through dinner. It was a weeknight. There's really no excuse for the noise level we experienced. 
- Your waiter shouldn't be trying to upsell everything. When he suggested wines, he went with the most expensive option. When he went through the mains, the only special he suggested was the $50 dollar surf and turf. Like... a couple of other mid-priced options would have been nice. 
- We were \"checked on\" no less than 8 times during the 90 minutes we were there. We were there for a special occasion, and not only was it impossible to talk to my partner because of the noise, but we were being interrupted every ten minutes by a waiter who was trying to upsell us at every turn. 

My advice to The Keg is to chill out a little bit. Personally, I go to the keg for a more quiet ambiance. I shouldn't have to shout or shoo away waiters. Not the best experience overall, but hey, at least the food was decent."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it. In a side-by-side comparison with Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, the Keg wins hands down. Half the price, amazing atmosphere, incredible historic architecture and great service."}
{"text":"We came here for a prerace dinner (Toronto Good Life Marathon). The idea of it being haunted was intriguing but we didn't notice anything. The food was wonderful and our server was attentive to our needs and even with a toddler. The steak was flavorful and juicy, no need for steal sauce at all. If I go back to Toronto this is a definite must go to."}
{"text":"Incredible Mansion, perfect for special occasions and fancy dinners. The food was truly delicious. You need to wait  30-something minutes at the bar for he table if you don't have the reservation, but it's totally worth it! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Toronto, Ontario- I don't know if the staff or the food was better.  Maryannthe and Helen could not have been more welcoming.  The lobster au grautin app was fantastic as well as the best twice baked potato. The prime rib was cooked just right and the price was reasonable.  I was not bothered by any ghosts!"}
{"text":"Je crois que c'est le meilleur restaurant que j'ai pu faire depuis mon arrivée à Toronto.
Ambiance années 30, the keg mansion vous accueille au sein d'une immense maison victorienne. 
Entre serveuses sexy au bar et personnel de salle en chemise blanche et cravate, on a l'impression de se retrouver en Europe à nouveau.
Ici la spécialité c'est le steak frites mais pas n'importe lequel, comptez 30 a 35$ le plat.
C'est beau, c'est cher mais dieu que c'est bon!

I think this is the best restaurant I've been so far in Toronto.
In a 30's, \"années folles\" atmosphere, the keg mansion will great you into a wonderful victorian house as you can see many in Toronto.
Between sexy waitresses at the bar and waiters in white shirts and ties serving you dishes you feel like being back in Europe for evening.
Specialty here is THE steak and french fries.
Be ready to spend at least 35$ on a meal.
It's beautiful, it's expensive but god it's good!"}
{"text":"Love this keg as it is so unique. Located in a super old heritage building which is super stunning. Amazing dining experience.  Plus this place have free parking after 4 pm which is amazing for Downtown.  We started off with the crab cakes, the 10 oz Prime ribs with the the double baked potatoes and the 18oz Kansas city strip with fries from the  winter grill menu.  The washroom is upstairs and doesn't have any real signs, so you can get lost easily. Haha maybe see a ghost or two. Heard the place is haunted. I wouldn't be surpised if it was.  This Keg can get busy very fast as it is very popular in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday and The Keg did not disappoint.

First off the location is convenient and the mansion is just stunning. It creates a great dining experience eating a candle-lit dinner in an old mansion in downtown Toronto.

We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday and did have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. The location was extremely busy and we were originally quoted an hour wait. They don't take reservations on a Saturday.

The above did not cause The Keg to lose a star because the food was amazing and the service was even better. Our waiter, Mike, brought us free bread twice and also brought us a complimentary ice cream cake when my partner secretly told him it was my special day.

The meal can be a little pricy but it's well worth the experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. I ordered the peppercorn steak and king crab legs, it was good, not great. Certainly for the price I enjoyed my meal. I'm not sure if it's a Canadian thing, but the wait staff certainly leaves you alone a bit longer than I'm used to. That said, I quite enjoyed it, the building is fantastic and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"This is great venue and well situated. Came here for a pre-show dinner and some wine.

My partner and i shared a meal (we do this a lot now for better portion sizes) and started with the Korean Fried Cauliflower, which was very yummy. Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sauce.

Next we shared a 12oz New York peppercorn steak cooked medium rare, garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. A good choice.

My only comment was that they did not know what to do with a shared meal. They brought out the meal on one plate and gave me a blank plate. This meant a bit of fiddling around to share. We do this a lot and most restaurants split the steak and sometimes even add more vegetables.

I would come again. The staff were OK but nothing to push the experience to five stars. Perhaps a second or third date venue; maybe your six anniversary venue."}
{"text":"It is the keg guys but this one is really nice, as it says \"the Mansion\" its one those old Victorian style mansion and amazing food and the service was also good at this location"}
{"text":"If I'm lucky, I may get a good steak, definitely not excellent.  

Well, I had their just okay or dry steaks before, also in other Keg locations. Atmosphere and service are good.  

Paying 3 $$$ signs for inconsistent steaks.  No way!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy a night out at the mansion. Have no complaints about service or food quality. 

Only issue is there is not much pescetarian or vegetarian option on the menu consistently. I know it's a steakhouse but sometimes in a large group there is that one odd person we have to accommodate for that just does not want to eat another Caesar salad or nacho. 

They had the divine seasonal pine nut salad but that is not a fixture on the menu. What a shame."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening and it was quite busy.

Pros:
- Reservations
- Good service
- Nice ambiance

Cons:
- Pricey for the quantity offered."}
{"text":"LOML and I circled the parking lot for 20 minutes and ended up on a side street to park. The atmosphere is terrific but we couldn't get a table so we sat at the bar. Crab cakes, crab dip and chips, a couple of beers and some wine suited us just fine. I've had the prime rib and steaks here before and I was underwhelmed. But I would go back in a minute just  for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tastes just as good as all the other Kegs, but you get to eat inside this really cool old house which may or may not be haunted."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and consider it to be acceptable, cheap and cheerful. It is not a high end establishment despite the mansion and the effort. It can be noisy and sometimes over run with children and on busy nights (friday and saturday) they don't take reservation giving it a franchise feel.

The waiters also seem a little too scripted (robot like) which feeds into the franchise feel. I know what they are going to say before they say it because it is the same script as last time.

The do what they do well, the location is convenient and the food always seems to be on. 

If I were trying to impress, this would not be on the list but for a quick good steak it is fine.

SEE BELOW: The fact that this manager actually bothers to post a rebuttal on each post should speak volumes.... just not classy

Update: Been again, my feelings are the same pleasant but nothing special when it comes to the steak.

Update April 2014:  My feelings about this place is right, I just saw a CBC report and the Keg is not one of the cleanest places to eat, as a matter of fact, it is one of the worse.  I always felt this place was good at pretending and not good."}
{"text":"I love eating here. Great atmosphere. Like to start with a few drinks at the bar and than move into one of the dinning areas. The keg menu is primarily the same at all locations but there is something cool about this location. Service is always good. Been here in various groups up to 10 people and the service never falters.. Been coming here for 10 years at least."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The house itself is gorgeous! The staff are always very nice and the food is always delicious! I love getting there early and sitting at the bar with a few martinis reading their ghost log! :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The vibe is great and the service is very friendly. Its a very comfortable atmosphere also. 

I visited for a friend's birthday, and we were treated so well! Probably because we were a large group of 10 but, I had absolutely no complaints. They gave us a private area when we showed up, and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"This place is known for its SERVICE...and service is exactly what I got.  I wish I could remember the managers name, but she was on top of everything.  She knew that our table was late in getting seated, and came by to apologize and even gave us a free appetizer.  Then my steak was over cooked a little, and she came by and said she was sorry and would take care of my meal on the house.  Little things like this really made my visit to the Keg Mansion memorable even though my steak wasnt the way I ordered it.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Probably the best looking steak house in all of Toronto!  This place attracted me due to the exterior, I always thought the mansion looked haunted with the creepy lightning and decor.  From the parking lot to the front entrance, you'll feel like you're stepping into a horror movie!  I kind of wish there was a ghost or horror movie theme, at least around Halloween time.  I know I would be making reservations for that!

The service here is what you would expect from any Keg.  Great, fast and friendly staff from the host at the front, to the servers inside.  The food comes out quick, and the steaks are always cooked to perfection.     I've never had a steak under or over cooked at any Keg to be honest.  I usually order the prime rib and it's plenty of meat to fill me up to the point where I have to pass on dessert. 

Overall a great steakhouse and what makes this place even better is the location and decor.  This place looks straight out of a Hollywood movie, and you'll feel an interesting vibe having dinner here.  Highly recommended if you're in the area and looking for a classy steak dinner."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here. Although I opted for the less-than classy nachos.

The style here is also quite eclectic. On one hand, there are the patrons that dress up a little, and on the other there are others in jeans in t-shirts. But the ambiance is definitely more high class, I'd feel out of place dressing overly casual here. I would say  the dress code is business casual, or dressy. Anyone else who doesn't follow it, is just very stubborn or confused."}
{"text":"This place is always somewhere you can count on for reasonably fair priced food- for a special occasion that you don't want to splurge too much on."}
{"text":"My first time eating at a Keg - kind of insane, considering I've lived in Toronto my entire life.

Arrived at Keg Mansion around 8:30 pm on Saturday.  No reservations, there were two of us.  The friendly hostess told us the wait would be 30 minutes or so, and gave us a buzzer that goes off when your table is ready.  We asked if we could just eat in the bar/lounge area they have you wait in, and she said we could take a look, and if we decided to just eat there, we could just hand in our buzzer to our server.

We went upstairs and found two spots at the bar; my dining companion and I both prefer to sit at the bar to eat, so we handed over our buzzer and ordered some drinks.  I had the white wine sangria, which was really just fruit juice and wine - there was half a slice of strawberry and a sliver of orange floating in there, but it was hardly sangria.  The glassware was overly large, and that's a weird thing for me to have noted.

We shared the escargot as an appetizer; it was overly garlicky.  She asked if we wanted bread and my companion said yes; I liked the butter but the bread was just average.  For my main, I had the 10 oz Prime Rib with the twice baked potato.  It was cooked correctly (medium rare) and tasted fine - just fine.  For $30, I want my main to be good or really good - I can go to much more creative and delicious places in Toronto for $30/entree.   

I'll note some positives: bartender was our server and she was very good.  I got upset right when my main got delivered (not about the food, about a personal issue) and couldn't eat for a long time; she showed concern that the food was okay without making me feel embarrassed I hadn't eaten yet.  The bathrooms were really nice too, something I appreciate."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. The ambiance was nice and quiet. 

I ordered their classic Top Sirloin and my date ordered the Peppercorn steak, both medium rare. Hers came out perfect, mine was too well done but were still her. Hers was actually pretty amazing. I highly recommend that one.

We also ordered Crab Parmesan Spinach dip, we did not taste any crab so we sent it back. The waiter asked if we wanted mushrooms and we said yes. The waiter totally forgot.

The portions were large, ended up taking half it home for breakfast!

If you want intimacy ask to be seated upstairs, we went up there afterward and it was empty."}
{"text":"One thing that I appreciate about the keg and the reason I give it 5 stars is the consistency it delivers in delicious food that never disappoints! 

I recently went for dinner with a friend the other night. We usually opt for the upstairs bar lounge area it has an upscale but casual feel that I prefer to the dining room downstairs. The service in this area is always stellar, professional servers who are also down to earth, I truly enjoy being served by these servers ! My server, Mary Anne Tay did a fantastic job taking care of us. 

I tried the 8 ounce Sirloin topped with Crab and Shrimp, I swapped the Blue Cheese sauce for Bernaise and was in heaven paired with Garlic Mashed. 

Ceasar was also spicy and delicious. 

I recommend the mansion bar for a date, dinner and drinks with friends, or special occasions. There is also a first come first serve private room on the second floor the looks over Jarvis St and is very cool to dine in  with a group , I did on my birthday and it was perfect for my family and I. 

I am such a fan of this Keg!"}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary. Reminded me of Salvatore's in the WNY area but nicer and busier. We had rsvp and still had to wait a bit, and when we were finally seated it was packed. Total bill with tip was $100. Staff was pleasant, and food was great. This was right down the street from our hotel, so we didn't have to mess around with parking. Next time I get to Toronto we'll be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is awesome. The food is typical Keg and usually consistent. However; on my most recent visit, the veggies were served cold, and the manager was really awkward and loud and even banged/shook the entire table upon his exit.  Our server was nice enough, but failed to make that personal connection. This is the type of place my parents, who are from a small town, like to visit when they come to Toronto. So, if you have any hick relatives, this is THE place to bring them!"}
{"text":"Great food and Great Service

The thing is, I've had several bad experiences at the Keg in the past. They rarely managed to cook my steak the way I ordered it. So, when we decided to meet up for a business meeting and dinner at the Keg Mansion, I was a little worried, but none-the-less hopeful I'd be eating a great steak. And so it goes, I had a great steak. 

Before eating, I started with the Keg's \"Perfect Manhattan\" and I'd say it was pretty good. Served with a giant ice cube, the way it should be, which is nice to see and made the drink all that much more enjoyable. 

We started with a Caesar salad, and it was really great. I'm a Caesar fanatic, so I know a good one when I'm eating one. Just the right amount of dressing, good garlic, pepper and lemon levels. Really good, I could have eaten another.

I have never had a rib steak before, but my dining partner suggested I give it a try, especially since I'm a New York fan. The Keg serves theirs bone-in, weighing in at 20 oz. Ok, so the bone itself is probably 5 of those 20. It looked great on the plate, and I polished off every last morsel, the bone stripped, how should I say, to the bone. It was really outstanding, and cooked to perfection!

The baked potato - twice baked - was excellent as well. Scooped out and loaded, the insides are placed back in the potato once the skin has been cooked again, making for a crispy outside and soft and silky inside. Y.U.M.

We didn't have dessert, but I had a craving for Billy Miner pie. If you haven't tried it, and you like coffee ice cream, it's really great.

Service was excellent from the time I arrived until the time we left. Very attentive and helpful throughout the evening.

{"text":"Best Keg I've ever been to. Nothing more to be said.

I base all my ratings and reviews on a couple simple categories: the food, the service, and the venue (which includes the washrooms.)

This place gets five stars in all of those categories. I could go on forever about how good it is if I don't leave it at that. Cannot compliment this place enough.

If your looking for a Keg and have some time: seek out this location. It is more than worth any trouble you'll put into getting there or finding it (it's not hard to find)."}
{"text":"I live close by and tend to go to the Mansion at least 3 times per year.  Although there are no reservations on Fri and Sat, you can go upstairs to a great lounge and enjoy a Keg size caesar or a glass of wine and wait for a table, or even enjoy dinner at the seating area upstairs near the bar with the same awesome menu.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I always love Keg! Their steak never disappointed me. 
This was the first time i went to the mansion.
The atmosphere was great. However, i went on a Sat night and the average wait time is 1-1.5 hours. 
They didn't take reservation for weekends.

I ordered escargot as appetizers and i love it so much. 
For steak i ordered prime rib with a combo which came with salad and mushroom.
However, i found that  the portion was actually too big for me. After the appetizers and salad, i already felt full. The steak was cook perfectly. Compared to other places, their steak was much better.  

I got a ice cream coffee cake as a dessert. Even though it was delicious, i were too full to finish it. 

I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"I had a business dinner here during the week. We didn't have a reservation, but we were seated right away.

To start we had shrimp cocktails and crab cakes to share. The spice in the cocktail sauce for the shrimp was just right. The crab cakes were really good.

For my entree, I had prime rib with a lobster tail. The prime rib was cooked perfectly (medium). I loved the fact that they had fresh horseradish instead of serving it creamed.

It wasn't too loud, so our group was able to talk during dinner without having to talk loudly.

I decided to fat it up with dessert. The Billy Miner Pie was a great finish to dinner. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"3.5*
I'd like to give this a better rating because the service is so good but the food is way too inconsistent.  Yes its always cooked well but I find the steaks really lack in seasoning a lot of times.  They are in desperate need of salt and pepper.  The first time we visited the steaks were cooked perfect and well seasoned on our second visit they tasted very bland as if they had just been seasoned and thrown on the flame. Since then it has been hit or miss, excellent to mediocre.

That being said its a great place to go with friends or a date, and the service is always top notch which is why we keep going back.  I can tolerate an average meal with great service because its still a nice night out, but lousy service makes even the best meal taste like $&I* and ruins the night."}
{"text":"my bf and i had a date night here on boxing day after enjoying a Marlies game at the ACC. i was awe-struck at just how big and beautiful the whole place really is. all the dishes we had were absolutely delicious..from the shrimp & brioche app we shared to our steak mains to our sorbets for dessert. our server came by to make sure we were doing fine,  and refilled our waters always in perfect timing. 
perfect for a date night to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"My favourite location because of the historical house. Great food, great service, great staff."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at The Keg. I loved it so much the first time I went to Toronto that I had to go back to it!

The service is just excellent and they always recommend the best of the menu showing great knowledge of every dish.

We had the tuna tartar again, it is a great appetizer to start with, fresh and very tasty.  I had the iceberg salad with blue cheese and it was just what I needed. Refreshing and with a lot of blue cheese, it was really really good but don't order it if you are not very into blue cheese! 

Burgers are great too, I had a bite from one and it just melted in the mouth. A great choice if you like burgers too.

Finally, as a dessert, I had the small bite of brownie with the vanilla ice cream as last time as well and it was as good as I remembered. Don't get fooled by the part of the name saying small because it isn't small at all, the size is just perfect dessert size after a great meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here last Friday for dinner with my wife as we had some gift cards.
Very tasty starters; the cheesy bread, goats cheese and beef carpaccio were all great.
Steak and ribs for the mains.

The building itself is nicely decorated and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Places like this make me wonder how I was ever a vegetarian. 
I had a steak and a peach drink. Both were delicious. I stuffed myself and then went to another Keg a few days later, that's how satisfied I was. 

It is expensive, but the good is so damn good. The location is great and the mansion itself is gorgeous."}
{"text":"Great steaks, amazing service.

I realize that going to the Keg Mansion at 7:30pm on a Saturday is one of the dumbest things you can do. It's like going to Disneyworld during Christmas break. It was insanely packed when we got there, obviously. The foyer was crowded with people, as were the stairs and the bar area. It was madness. I'd honestly considered going to a different Keg uptown, but the Hubster was already parking the car.

We stood in the bar area, ordered some drinks and waited about one hour to get a seat. I guess we proved to be very nice to the staff around us, because when a new table opened up in the middle of the room of the bar area, the manager asked if we'd like to sit there. He sat us ahead of the surly couple who had gotten there before us, and were having cocktails at one of the high tops at the bar, so either they liked us, or they thought that a couple in their early 30s would cause less of a fuss about sitting at a bistro-sized table in the middle of the room. I'd like to think it's the former.

We had a $100 gift certificate to the place (Christmas gift) so we were able to order without thinking about the cost. I asked for the crab cakes to start, while the Hubster got the bruschetta. I told the server that I had a dairy allergy, which he noted. A few minutes after ordering, the manager came up to us and informed me that the crab cakes do have dairy in them, and suggested a few appetizers that didn't. I really liked this. Too often, a server will just give you the menu and ask you to choose something else, without telling you which are dairy-free options. I went with the bacon-wrapped scallops.

The appetizers were okay. The scallops were cooked just right, but they were nothing special. Just bacon and scallops. You really can't go wrong with that combo. I would have liked them to be a bit more seared, though.

For our entrees, I got the prime rib and the Hubster got the flat iron steak. We both enjoyed our mains immensely. Hubster was a bit put out that the Keg fries were fries, and not frites, but other than that, we were super happy with our meals. 

The service was amazing. Our guy was attentive but not intrusive. He even corrected another table who kind of yelled out a request to him while he was dealing with us, patiently saying \"I'll be with you in a second, as soon as I'm done here.\" Class act. 

I'm always really satisfied with meals at the Keg, because their quality of service is really great and their food is consistently good. This experience was no exception, though I think we'll try to visit on a quieter night next time. 

Note: they don't take reservations on Friday or Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"Many options, steak was GREAT. Wish I got more vegetables with my order though."}
{"text":"If you like steak and are prepared to spend a nice sum of money one one you will remember for a very long time, then check out this restaurant in a swanky historical (and haunted) Victorian Mansion. 

At my most recent meal here at one point I felt the steak I was eating was too good for me. But I kept quiet and pretended otherwise."}
{"text":"Love the Keg mansion chains and this one is an absolute classic.  Service, ambiance and food. Perfect for date night or drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Service was good- food was amazing. Ambience was the greatest. 

If you haven't been. Then go. This is a Toronto Landmark!

Pretty penny for a pretty majestic place."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and every single time I come here the service is beyond fantastic. The Keg is definitely known for top notch servers and management and it shows. The food is always consistent and when you are paying an average of $50 a plate it should be nothing less than spectacular. I always love the Steak and Lobster and appreciate the twice baked potato which is delicious! They usually have specials on as well where you can get 18 ounce to even 30 ounce steaks for an amazing price.

The most recent time I came here our table received a noise complaint.  We laughed it off because it was literally noisy in the entire restaurant.  The manager had to come and tell us to try and keep it down more than once and I felt bad for her because she was really just doing her job trying to keep all customers at a Happy Medium.  We politely asked for our bill and all felt like we were being kicked out...however being the wonderful Manager that she is she did not want us to leave on a sour note so she gave our entire table dessert and coffee on the house which really was above and beyond.  

At the end of the day, we were just trying to be like the people in the Keg commercials having a good time and laughing over some yummy steak and drinks.  I told the Manager that we will be back and be EVEN LOUDER next time we come.  :-)"}
{"text":"It's cliche, but this is where my boyfriend and I went for our Valentine's dinner this year. It was my first time eating at the Keg actually and I had a wonderful time. The service was friendly both at the bar upstairs while we waited for our table as well as in the main dining room. I also noticed as we walked around the restaurant that the staff smiled and even said hello to us which was very welcoming. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and, even though the restaurant was busy, she was attentive and genuinely cared about making our meal great. We both ordered the filet mignon which was fantastic. At the end of the meal the manager stopped by the table to see how everything went which was a nice touch. All in all a lovely meal!"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night. This location is my absolute favourite in toronto because of the mansion! Our filet mignons were fantastic as usual, with a side of garlic mashed potato and veggies. We also ordered the whiskey peppercorn sauce on the side! I have never been disappointed with the keg and it's at a great price point to! 

Tip: you must always save room for the billy minor pie for dessert"}
{"text":"Of all the steakhouse chains I've been to the Keg is my favorite and the Keg Mansion is the best location of them all.

This location (Jarvis and Gloucester) is in a pretty central location within the core.  As far as parking goes there is parking available on Jarvis as well as on site parking.

This location is special because it is a converted mansion into a handful of rooms each with a handful of tables.  

This place has great service and great food.  While there are places that try to be fancier... to me this place is perfect just the way it is.  If you have guests from out of town this is a very nice place to go and the prices aren't outrageous.

Location, ambiance, service and quality... all here +++"}
{"text":"The Keg introduced me to steaks. And I have been a fan of them since first bite! This location ups the ante quite a bit by housing an otherwise monotonous dining setting in a grand venue with their usual food and serving standards which I have always been a fan of.

You are able to enjoy your favourite cut of steak all at a decent price to go along with the very friendly and attentive service. I'm not much of a wine connoisseur but I've always enjoyed my bottle of wine here and while I don't recall their cocktail list being too extravagant, they do a very solid job of good drinks.
I have always liked the appetizer menu as  well, including the French onion soup, I've been here once during their lobster season and I was left feeling just okay with my dining experience with the surf and turf, my favourite item would be a medium rare filet mignon. 

I know that they don't serve up the best steaks out there, but for their price it's nicely done and a great intro to steaks for the relatively uninitiated. Since I've cut down on meat consumption it is locations such as this that I miss, a grand location and a good dining experience."}
{"text":"After a long wait, We went back for my Birthday. They lived up to their reputation and delivered a stellar meal and service...  I guess we just got the very bad apple in the basket that day....

Thanks...."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try the keg mansion and it turned out to not what I expected. We started with arriving a bit earlier to see if we could get in. There was a line up to speak with the host. When I was next to speak, the person behind decided to go ahead and speak to the host first. The host herself, didn't even try to attend to me first, instead wanted to help her. That really got me upset, but I decided to let it go. Everything after that was better. Mainly we were impressed with our server, Emma. She was very attentive, professional and extremely friendly. We felt she really tried to make our experience a pleasant one. Aside from that, we might come back. I suggest the hosts to step up and attend to your guests when they are in order and not pick and choose who you want to take care of."}
{"text":"Always delicious and one of the best vibes you'll ever get from a restaurant. Truly enjoy all Keg locations but there's just something special about the Mansion. Great service, delicious steaks, always a good time!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this location! I heard a lot of good things and this Keg location is unique compared to the others because it used to be a haunted house. Nestled in an ancient victorian house on Church street, it was the perfect spot for a date night. The food was amazing, service was great and the ambience was truly memorable! It wasn't as creepy as some people made it sound. Definitely coming back for some delicious steak and lobster."}
{"text":"The Keg is pretty standard steakhouse fare.  Ask for 'chicago-style' steak on top of the usual 'warm, pink on the inside, etc...' instructions if you want the outside of your steak a bit charred (delicious!).

The escargot appetizer is really to die for.  Don't miss it!

I must complain about one thing:  I often take older people to this mansion as it is a bit of a throwback to another era.  That being said, the lighting of the place is maddeningly too low.  I must read the menu (and my own 40-something eyes struggle, even though they are of perfect vision) to all who are in my party.

I am finding that a lot of restaurants in Toronto these days have lighting that is too low and noise levels that are way too high.  Maybe I'm just old.  Delicious food and friendly service!  I am a fan."}
{"text":"A steak restaurant for those who don't know steak restaurants. Make no mistake, the food is always good and I never have anything to complain about with the service, but it's the atmosphere that gets me every time. I always ask myself, why am I sitting around a beautiful old mansion fitted with mahogany eveything and great looking finishings everywhere, yet filled with groups of guys in thier TAPOUT t-shirts shirts and backwards hats talking about how \"f%&king awesome\" their steak is?

It certainly has the appearance of a classy place to go but is far from it. It is a shame indeed because it is really a great looking location, the customer base ruins it."}
{"text":"Obviously on the pricier end of a steak joint, but a really great experience to eat here. The building is phenomenal and the staff were kind and helpful.

The steaks were excellent. I got the prime rib done medium which was perfect although the horseradish that comes with it is VERY strong.

My partner got the Oscar surf and turf which was a brilliant medium-rare thick cut. Almost perfect!

We ate with a nice Sauv/Cab mix from California. All in all we enjoyed it and would go again!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good and each time I have gone for dinner the service has been exceptional."}
{"text":"I came here with family friends for a joint birthday and anniversary celebration. The overall experience was very good. I was reluctant to go because my previous experience was very bad. I had the California salad and just hated it, although I'm sure many others would have loved it. The second time around was far better and my review reflects only this second visit.

What I had:
1. Pistachio crusted salmon with maple sauce: 9.5/10. This was so delicious. This was the first time I tried a sweet sauce with salmon and fell in love with it instantly. Funny enough I asked for syrup on my salmon on a recent trip to Punta Cana where the chef came out to acknowledge and appreciate my addition to his dish."}
{"text":"Such a great ambiance!
If you're looking for a good 'date night' spot or even a relaxing place to have dinner this is the spot. There is parking in the back although they might not advertise it. The mansion is literally built like a mansion and you can see it right away on the road, right beside the gas station.
Food was good, ordered the usual steak (rare), along with mushrooms (costed a little extra). Overall pretty good, not the best steak, but the ambiance and the lighting and mood definitely made the experience one to last."}
{"text":"Food was okay--good lobster tail and ribs. Mashed potatoes were tasty. But their customer service was top notch. I think the manager's name was Danielle--she helped us with our steak and she took care of us. Amazing decor but we didn't see any ghosts!"}
{"text":"Well known among Torontonians who enjoy paranormal activity, besides being known as possibly the most haunted building in the entire city (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/haunted-toronto-a-paranormal-primer/article559802/), the Keg Mansion on Jarvis is a full service restaurant operating out of one of the former stately manor homes that was home to the Massey Family (the same clan that produced former Governor General Vincent Massey and Hollywood actor Raymond Massey) for many years.

With a wide selection of entrees, a full service bar, an excellent and attractive wait staff, and beautiful decor, this is one of my fave spots in all of Toronto to have a special dinner with friends. Prices tend to be a bit high, but it is so worth it. Although it is part of a chain, I overlook that fact simply due to the mentioned amenities mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph.

Only negative thing I can say about this place is that it opens at 4:00pm, and only caters to a dinner crowd. Distance from Toronto's many theatres and clubs is a bit far as the neighborhood is more residential, but if you have the time and are willing to travel to Toronto's Church & Wellesley Village for a good meal, this is the place to come. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Thot it would be a high level of quality and service but no.

I asked for half mash and half roast potatoes (as I had the option of either) - was told no (no reason given). But my sirloin oscar tasted great.

Colleague got the prime rib. It came looking disgusting. Looked like weird red raw meat. It was cut so poorly. 3/4 left un eaten.

Another colleague had the salmon with pecan salad. Salad had two broken pieces of pecan. Advised the server. She brought out a small container of broken pecans.

Another person in the party said his steak was not cooked as requested.

Service was just average - same as any average place. No need to dress them in whites! It was a bit rushed.

I admit I was expecting above average service for The Keg Mansion. I don't feel I got it."}
{"text":"Great place. The mansion is a beautiful place. Maybe a little too dark inside. If you love meat it is definitely a place to go. The creme brûlée was excellent too."}
{"text":"Take the veritable Keg chain menu, add a Victorian era mansion, sprinkle in tales of ghosts and you'll have the Keg Mansion.

It's as if Ruth's Chris suddenly purchased the Merchant's House in NYC and preserved the exterior in a mashup called \"Ruth's Chris House\".

I've dined at Kegs before while visiting other parts of Canada and was quite pleased to discover this particular location, given the unique environs. It's not every day I get to eat in a historical mansion.

On a Sunday night at 10pm the place was still buzzing but reservations were not required. According to the hostess, the prime wait time is usually 6-9pm.

Many tables featured well dressed people. Our table was not in that category but we felt comfortable enough and were treated as if we were indeed puttin' on the ritz.

The service here was exceptionally good. Genuinely friendly people seemed to work here, from our first encounter to the last good bye. 

The menu is typical Keg and by that I mean steak-heavy (although salads, chicken and ribs are available).

We started with an appetizer baked goat cheese which was presented with crushed almonds, tomato salsa and crostini. We made it through all of our crostini and were promptly given more. The warm goat cheese was easy to spread on the crostini and even easier to eat.

For my steak course I selected the grilled top sirloin, keg size please. (Price difference is 19.95 vs 23.95- I was hungy!)

The steak arrived with a baked potato (sour cream) and a tomato slice. Somewhat spartan but sides are available to augment the entree. 

My sirloin was ordered medium and arrived just how I like it. My wife's request for well was also honored. 

New york strips are available as are rib steak, filet mignon, prime rib-- the beefeater will not want here.

The Keg's sweet temptations dessert was a sensible way to ,ahem, watch calories but also indulge the sweet teeth. There are five mini dessert shots to choose room so we split an order of three for $6.95. The banana caramel shot had a rich, butterscotch flavor that had me wishing for a sudden size increase. Lemon blueberry and chocolate fudge were also small but deadly good.

No ghosts were observed during the eating of this meal. I'd highly recommend that the Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures, Sci-Fi's TAPS and any other ghost crew stop by to investigate , probably come up empty on the paranormal front but have an excellent Keg meal."}
{"text":"This is a signature location of a Canadian chain with over a hundred locations. We were tired and looking for a nice meal and stumbled upon this location. 

I had the rib steak which is a hefty piece of meat even though it's bone-in. My dining partner had the bigger cut of sirloin. As manly men we skipped the soup/salad and went straight for the meat. I forgot the name of beer we had on tap but it was made by Molson and not too bad.

With the favorable exchange rate the check came out to a little over $50 US per person. Not bad for a good steak and a couple of beers. Service was pleasant. The only negative is that we had to share the dining room with an obnoxiously big loud group with children but that is beyond the restaurants control"}
{"text":"Loved it! Will go back. I loved how it was an old mansion turned into a restaurant. Very different. Lots of cool things to look at. Big staircases. Food and service were excellent."}
{"text":"The food was good. The atmosphere pleasant with nice decor. The waiter was attentive without being overbearing. I had a nice time, even though I was on my own."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous restaurant! 

This is your standard Keg restaurant only it is located in a HUGE mansion, making for an amazing ambiance and a gorgeous setting. I went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night, we were a group of 15 and since they don't take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays we were certainly in for a long wait (we were told about an hour). After our wait had exceeded an hour and we asked for an update we were told we would be seated shortly and the manager would do something for us. Figuring our group was on the verge of starvation (which we were) the manager came to us with a plate of canopies topped with a goat cheese bruschetta, absolutely delicious! A few minutes later she comes with a giant plate of fully loaded nachos, and these may have been some of the best nachos I have ever had! Loaded with lots of cheese (and high quality cheese at that) made them warm and very gooey, lots of jalapenos added a nice kick, I would definitely order these when I go back! 
 
When we were finally seated everybody seemed to enjoy their food. It's the standard Keg menu so you are guaranteed a good steak. I had the French Onion soup to start and this was mind-blowing! So much cheese on top that was perfectly melted without being greasy, the broth was very rich and had a good beef flavour while the onion added a nice sweetness. I have never had a bad steak at the keg, and this occasion was no different. New York strip was cooked to perfection and was so tender it practically melted in my mouth, this time I tried it cooked \"Chicago style\" (meaning it is charred on the outside and cooked to order inside). This added a nice charred crust to the steak and actually did a better job of sealing in the juices; this cooking style is definitely worth a try. For sides I always go for the twice baked potato; bacon, cheese, and baked potato how could you go wrong? 
 
This place gets bonus marks for letting our huge group split the bills and not adding an automatic gratuity (which most restaurants do for large groups). Definitely a great place to go with a large group, on a special occasion, or simply for a nice dinner. Overall great food, beautiful restaurant and good service! 

*My only complaint is the drinks were pretty expensive, bought a shot for my friend and it was nearly $9 for a standard shot! That's pricy!"}
{"text":"Wait one hour and a half is way too much for the kind of service they give you. The upstairs bar was crowded, no where to sit and people moving you to pass by all the time. 
We asked for a couple of appetizers, mini burguers and calamari. The mini burguers were really tasty.
When we finally got our table, I was disappointed with the presentation and quality of the food... Never ask for lobster in there, looked and tasted like those Chinese frozen ones you can get at the supermarket.
I asked my steak medium rare, and unfortunately, was over cooked..."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Keg in all of the GTA! We decided to come here to treat our relatives to a steakhouse and I happened to stumble upon this one - the steaks here are grilled to perfection. It's hard to describe what a perfect steak tastes like but you'll definitely leave here not disappointed. We also had their ice cream which well, it's ice cream so you can't really mess up that. 

I had the filet mignon and had vegetables on the side. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and I had no complaints about the vegetables as well. The drinks here were also really good! If you have guests out of town, I would recommend this Keg as the ambience of the place is excellent and the prices aren't too outrageous. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a rather special day of mine. It was quite rainy outside so that already set the mood. Given that we went around 5:00pm on a Tuesday ensured that it was pretty quiet but people did start filing in after awhile. 

I've always loved the Keg, I find that their food is consistently great no matter which one I go to. This was no exception. Actually, I think it might actually be better than some of the other places I've had. The steaks were cooked perfectly. I ordered the Pecan Sirloin. It was crusted with flavourful pecans and had a huge slab of goat cheese on top. I loved every bite. My boyfriend got the Sirloin steak with the Bernaise sauce and seafood. It was equally delicious. 

I've gone to other Kegs and usually if you reserve ahead and say it's a special occasion, they give you dessert for free. Unfortunately, not this time around. That doesn't matter though, I still ordered dessert which was still very good. Overall, this place really is great. I'm glad I trusted the reviews and it has again, held up the reputation of the Keg's quality food."}
{"text":"What is Mansion Keg? Simply put, it is The Keg inside a mansion. Where better to spend Christmas Eve other than here. This place is gorgeous and it screams sophistication. The decor and layout sets the mood for any night out. We wined and dined upstairs since downstairs was fully booked. The space is intimate and seating is unparalleled. 

I ordered the New York Peppercorn Steak, rare. When the steak came out, it did not resembled what I had thought. I imagined a perfectly seared steak crusted with herbs, spices and pepper. Instead, it was a grilled steak, with a ton of peppercorn stuck to it. The peppercorn was overwhelming and added too much heat to the steak. The steak did not have a nice sear to it and far from a brown crust. As a steak connoisseur, no crust = less flavour. Overall a quality steak, poorly prepared. 

Had my steak been better, I would've given this establishment a perfect score. Service is friendly and our server, Brittany, was beyond phenomenal. Will revisit to try other menu items. Til then, c'est la vie."}
{"text":"I know that the Keg is a chain but I can't help but feel that the dishes I ordered here were somehow better than the other Keg locations I've been to. 

My go-to has been what I call the Kegsplenade (on the esplanade) but sometimes you want to make things a bit fancier and eat in an mansion. It's a cool conversion. 

I usually order the keg classic dinner with an iceberg wedge salad + blue cheese dressing. There's something satisfying eating a 1/4 wedge of iceberg salad stuffed with blue cheese and bacon bits. The steak was also cooked perfectly. It pairs well with their mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. 

Service was fantastic here too. 

Overall, I really like the Keg and this is one of my favourites. 

The free birthday Miners ice cream cake was a nice touch too!"}
{"text":"hqd a great date night with the boyfriend here.  place haa a nice ambiance.  service was great, genuine.  we managed to get a table with inly an hour reservation prior on a saturday night.  so no complaintsm  prime rib was satisfying!  happy satisfied client.  hit the spot."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place for years even with the 'chain'  stigma going in it. However, the place is huge. Great mega-large bar with plenty of interesting drink choices (and of course, their own interpretation of the Caesar of which they sell their own mix in stores) and the steak I had (a special with a chipotle glaze) was cooked perfectly. In fact, better than the one i had at a non-chain pricier steak place the night prior. Service was extremely good and had some great conversations with my waitress. Would definitely come back here next time I'm in Canada."}
{"text":"This place is very interesting. It has a bar on the second floor and fancy dining area on the first floor. It's in a Victoria style mansion. Realllly nice. Would come back again."}
{"text":"* Pre-emptive apologies for possible spelling mistakes. SpellCheck isn't co-operating with me.*

Always wanted to come here because I thought the mansion was so pretty from the outside. Well, I guess today was my day. The parental unit wanted a break from cooking so they suggested eating out tonight (02.05.11).

I called The Keg earlier to make a reservation, but was told that it was a 'first come, first serve' basis. Fair enough. The weather was going to be crap tonight so I thought, 'no biggie.' We arrived at around 6:30 (free parking in the lot after six) and entered the Mansion. It was packed! We were told that the wait time was 30-40 minutes. The parental unit and I sat on the chairs by the door and we could smell the 'aroma' of tobacco. Apparently it's against the law to have patrons smoke right in front of the door. 

An hour later, 20-30 minutes beyond wait time we were given, the parental and I were seated in a cozy booth, far from the craziness. It was nice and quiet, which made it easier to have a conversation.

The food was pretty good and it didn't take as long as the time we had to wait. Our server, Lori, was efficient. We ordered the prime rib was great, the vegetables not so much.

I want to go back, but the fact that you can't make a reservation is deterring me from going back."}
{"text":"You know this place is haunted? This old magnificent building is a pillar in Toronto's history. Many stories of the previous residents and those who work there still haunting the property. They even have a book you can read with stories and facts. Fantastic place to go of course it's overpriced but it's totally worth it because it's Keg Mansion it's not like any other. One time we were eating mushrooms and I found a piece of circle cardboard that got into the mushrooms and the staff gave us the mushrooms for free and all our drinks. So cool. When it's busy you can sit at the bar and get a few drinks into you before being seated. Very romantic lots of fireplaces and old architecture"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a date night recently. I have to say I have been to the Keg before, but not the Keg Mansion. The Keg is known for it's steaks, so of course I ordered steak. They had two specials on the menu that evening, my boyfriend and I both ordered the special. My steak was a flat steak in 5 Asian spice with a skewer of shrimp. The steak that my boyfriend got was a 14 oz bone in steak. Both dishes were delicious! Although, I do have to say that my steak was a tad over spiced with salt as it got a bit too salty for me near the end. Overall, the food was delicious. The service there was very friendly and professional. Our server was nice and attentive, but not overbearing. I really enjoyed my experience at the Keg Mansion. I would definitely come back for more .... more STEAK of course!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the lobster in summer! Easy to find a parking place and yeah, love their BGM."}
{"text":"The service is always excellent. By far the best Keg there is. It was my absolute favourite restaurant for a long time but recently decided to go vegan  so won't be dining there anymore. The food is always great and the best steaks in the downtown core IMO. The decor there is stunning, a must visit for anyone who likes a good steak and visitors coming to the city. Even if you don't eat meat (which I don't anymore) this is still my favourite restaurant. Keg caesar salad is one of the best caesar salads around and that bread is to die for!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed reviews towards the level of service I've received here, but the food is always on par with standardized Keg meals.
I'm not going to compare this to Harbour 60, Barberians Steak House, or anything like that in the city, but when you want a consistent meal at a much friendlier price, this place can do no harm. I mean we're talking only $35 for a 10 oz Filet Mignon - that is a winner in my books, so I'll continue to visit!

This location is also better than most other Keg's locations since the Mansion interior really creates a certain vibe to the place as opposed to a mass produced dime a dozen steakhouse that their newer locales wreak of. Keg Mansion FTW!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  I had my reservations to be honest from other people telling me that this wasn't a great location.  You must try it and it is definitely better than other keg locations (vs. eglinton, oshawa and ajax).  The food was amazing and the service was even better. We were a party of 7, and our waiter did an amazing job making sure we were attended. I left a well deserved hefty tip.  Definitely a return-restaurant.

Food: 4/5, we got a mix of surf n turf to feature cuts and apps and dessert. All good.

Service: 5/5, best service out of all the Kegs I've been to.

Ambience: 4/5, cool mansion house decor and comfortable seating. They should however reinvest or fix the tables as some were rocky.

Price: 3.5/5, definitely is more than others but good for special occasions"}
{"text":"Amazing value for the quality you get here. Steaks are always perfect and attention to detail is paid in everything. This place is just consistently good. The prices are very reasonable for top notch quality and service."}
{"text":"I'm not the kind of person that usually digs chain restaurants. However, I make an exception for The Keg. The food is pretty good, the service has always been attentive, and lately it's been one of the few restaurants that my paleo-diet loving husband and I (an avowed carb eater) can both find something to suit our tastes. 

The steaks here aren't the best I've ever had (in terms of meat quality), but for the price it's pretty good. The selection of side dishes is nice, too - the vegetables are never overcooked, and the salad greens are always fresh. I've yet to try dessert here, because I'm usually too full by the time the meal ends. 

I'm particularly a fan of this location of the Keg, because the candlelit atmosphere makes it casually romantic -- perfect for a weeknight dinner date. The bar upstairs is a nice place to have a glass of wine before dinner, too. The wine list is kinda meh, but the lounge area has some nice vantage points to hang out or people watch before your table is ready."}
{"text":"The Victorian era mansion is awesome.  The food - 'eh.  Typical steakhouse."}
{"text":"WOW! This was my reaction to walking into the historic Keg mansion. I love the architecture that dates back to Confederation. I could spend all night exploring the different rooms and studying the intricacies of the banister carvings. But clearly this isn't a review site for architecture but for FOOD!

While the wait on a Saturday night (the only night they do not take reservations) was a bit long, the wait was between 1 hour 15 minutes - 1 hour 30 minutes, honestly it was 7:15pm on a Saturday night, I expected this. We got a little pager (fyi it doesn't work outside) and went to the bar, which was equally rammed and got a drink. We managed to snag the window seat, located between the first and second flight of stairs. Had our drink and proceeded to wait. 

Approximately 25 minutes into our wait a nice lady came up to us with a platter of sample appetizers and I got to try the most delicious crab mixture on a crispy flat bread...YUM! Ok so now that my thirst and a bit of my hunger was quenched, another server came along and asked if we wanted to order appetizers, in any other case I would have totally said yes but I was waiting as my hunger had been temporarily satisfied.

By a little after 8pm, we were seated. Not a bad guesstimation hostess lady friend. Our server named Kevin, who bore a striking resemblance to our lovely CM Vivek, quickly came by and greeted us and took our water preference. Honestly, I can't say anything bad about this server, he was prompt and came and checked on us at the perfect times, although there was one somewhat long stretch in which I didn't see him at all, but I'm just nit picking now because I didn't require his service. What really sealed it in for me was at one point, my partner and I were in an intense part of a conversation (don't worry it wasn't arguing) but he took note of this and decided that it would be better if he didn't interrupt on this particular moment...5 STAR RATING FOR KEVIN!!!!

What can I say about the food, it was Keg-tastic. Prime rib was cooked to perfection, I ordered rare and was informed by wonderful Kevin that it may come medium rare as they may not have that cut but it came rare and it was delicious! I asked for my veggies to be simply blanched as I did not enjoy having garlic or butter on them and they came naked! 

Now let's get to the best part and the main reason that I decided to come to the Keg. The BILLY MINER PIE!!!!!!!!!!!! I seriously come here just to have dessert. The mocha ice cream atop of an oreo cookie crumb crust, drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce with almond shavings..... *DROOOOOOOOLLL* I enjoyed this dessert so much that my neighbour said, \"Excuse me, but what is that you are eating?!\" with the most curious look on his face. People might've have thought that I achieved Moksha or something! I never have to look at the dessert menu at the Keg, I actually don't even know what else they serve but I don't care, because the Billy Miner Pie seriously satisfies every one of my cravings.

Thank you Keg Mansion for scaring the crap out of me, we decided to read about how it was haunted while waiting and for providing me with wonderful stories to tell another day."}
{"text":"This Keg location - commonly referred to as the Keg Mansion - is HUGE. It's set up in a old house on Jarvis so it's very ambiance is very dark and Gothic. 

I went here with my boyfriend about six months ago on Friday night. They told us there would be a 45 minute wait. My boyfriend told me that hostesses always exaggerate wait times so that people won't crowd up the restaurants. Boy was he right! We were seated in 15 minutes. (I've realized this is true for most restaurants in the city, so keep that in mind). 

Before we were seated we went to the bar area upstairs which was really nice. It was very busy but there was lots of seating and definitely a happening vibe throughout the floor. 

When we were seated we enjoyed the very high ceilings, and the rich,  luxurious and comfortable seats. Our waitress was very friendly and the atmosphere was very quiet, private and romantic. I had a New York Strip which was delicious and covered in a rich wine sauce - definitely a great choice. My boyfriend had the tenderloin which was buttery smooth and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. 

The Keg ain't cheap though. You'll pay a pretty penny for your steak but it's good quality. However, if you want the ULTIMATE steak experience, I recommend Hy's Steakhouse for the best beef in town!"}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere in comparison to other Keg's. Good service for a New Year's Eve. It was going to be a 90 minute wait for a seat in the dining room. Decided to grab drinks and eat at the bar. Great service."}
{"text":"I went to other keg's before but Keg Mansion is just blew me away. I went there with my office colleagues with a big group. We started early at the bar upstairs, and then went to our tables downstairs, our own corner. Food was superb, very friendly staff (considering we were loud) and had a great time. Check out some of my photos on yelp. I am definitely going there again with my friends and family"}
{"text":"Just Wow!
Worth: while the Keg is fairly pricey, about $50.00 per head average, the food is well worth the price. The ingredients are top notch. The staff is congenial and professional. They are also VERY accommodating. The decor is likewise, worth the price of admission.

Ambiance. The staff are timely, courteous, and friendly. The decor is classy and well appointed. There are bustling areas of the mansion, and there are quiet areas. Whichever pleases you can be found here.

Return Ability: there is 0 chance in my mind that I wouldn't return. This establishment is off the hook.a must visit when you travel to Toronto."}
{"text":"I normally don't rate higher than a four unless I am blown away with every element of my visit.  I consider the greeting or the welcoming, the service staff, the food, the efficiency and then how satisfied I was at the end of my dining experience.  Tonight my partner and I chose The Keg Mansion because we were celebrating something special, and we both felt like a good quality steak.  The entire experience was top notch.  Our server was named Chris and he was extraordinary.  He was efficient, polite, friendly without being annoying.  Just before bringing our bill, he brought out a piece of amazing ice cream cake for us to share, on the house, accompanied by a very heartfelt congratulatory explanation which made the experience that much more special.  Thanks Chris, and the rest of the staff at The Keg Mansion.  You made my day!  ."}
{"text":"I came here with the girlfriend during the winter holidays and I must say it was a very unique experience and now being my favorite The Keg location. In short The Keg Mansion is a 1868 mansion turned into a steakhouse, so it has a gothic look to it and on top of all the it is supposedly haunted by ghosts. Since we came here during the holidays the restaurant had a lot of festive decorations such as the Christmas tree that stretched from the main foyer all the way up through the opening of the second floor. With all of the decorations, people dressed up and all of the great food being served I could not help but to feel like I was invited to an important dinner. As for the food, the menu is the same as the other The Keg locations  which is always very good value for the price you pay and when it comes to choosing a location to eat steak The Keg is always my go-to choice. I ended up ordering the Grilled top sirloin topped with shrimp, scallops, asparagus and Béarnaise sauce and the girlfriend got the Manhattan cut New York topped with caramelized mushrooms, onions and peppers. Served with demi-glace. Dinner was delicious and while eating I was just admiring the decor of the room that I was seated and all of its unique details and furnishings. Sadly I did not have the greatest service that night, with my server not being very attentive nor around when I needed him which was possibly due to how busy the restaurant was that night, but regardless that left a negative impression. I do believe that was just poor luck that I did not have the best service this time but I would definitely eat here again and would recommend anyone who enjoys The Keg to try out this location."}
{"text":"If you weren't told, I don't think you would know this is a chain. 

The house used to be a single residence mansion. Lots of craftsman wood work.  Beautiful.

There are rumors of paranormal activity. Our Ghost Radar app indicates there were in fact many ghosts at / around our table. Thankfully no coffee was spilt (see another review).

We had:

Apps:  tuna tartar - fresh, delish, huge portion. 

Salads:  one in out party had the steak salad. Huge doesn't begin to cove this unbelievably good salad.  This is definitely either a meal or something to share! Think of a wedge salad, with a pile of thin, crispy onion rings (you know the shoestring kind), with a whole NY strip.  Two others had wedge salads - very good and ample portions. And typically delish.

Dinner:
Prime Rib with mashed potatoes; asked and received an end cut. Perfectly cooked and seasoned,

Sirloin and Alaskan King crab. Refectory cooked all around. 

Two Small filet dinners - one with with asparagus and mushrooms. Cooked perfectly... One with a twice baked potato which I am told was super yummy! 

Dessert (yes two in our party were up for dessert): brownie sundae and cheesecake. They looked good. My peeps said they were good. 

Portions were huge!"}
{"text":"As visitors from Chicago, we've eaten at several restaurants during our stay, but we definitely saved the best for last! Beautiful interiors, friendly and attentive wait staff, and a fabulous menu. The green salads are chock full of delicious fresh ingredients, topped with a light house dressing. Our party selected the Lobster sirloin, Top Sirloin, and Pistachio Crusted Salmon--each dish was beautifully presented and just as delicious. The steaks were tender, juicy and flavorful, the salmon was perfection. The meal was capped off with a generous slice of Billy Miner Pie. The perfect end to a great meal and the perfect meal to end a great trip. We plan to return to Toronto and will definitely return to Keg Mansion!"}
{"text":"Awesome steakhouse. This place is gorgeous. I was really impressed with the building and decor. My first impression of this restaurant was a little rough as they were a little strict regarding our reservation and informed us if we were late they would give our table away. However, when we arrived everyone was extremely friendly and the service was excellent. We had a large party and they sat us in a somewhat private area. I started with a strawberry rose' and the drink was light and fresh. The Caesar salad was good and had just the right amount of parmesan cheese. The dressing was  creamy with robust flavor. 

The food was very good. Definitely high quality. My steak was cooked perfect and the baked potato was fluffy. For dessert I ordered the cheesecake and it did not disappoint. Very creamy and flavorful. I also tried my friend's Billy Miner Pie and that was sinfully delicious. A definite table favorite although personally I preferred the cheesecake and was very happy with what I ordered. This place really knows how to fill you up. Definitely worth the price. I can't wait to return. Also this location has some very interesting facts that go along with the history of the building. It's a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Hip happening joint with some really random music playing in the background, apparently there's a few locations throughout Toronto. 

The food was pretty wacky..reminded me of Outback steakhouse in taste and presentation but higher prices.

It's basically American style cuisine done wrong. Weak drinks don't do it for me either.

I'll Pass."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, history and interior.  Service was on point - ask for Mitch.  Maria manager was super accommodating - many thanks for dessert!  Food was fine, I they must be doing something right with so man locations.  Just nothing too standout..  Sometimes service makes the meal though and we really experienced great service."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE KEG!

We go on average once a month and are always pleased. You get decent service, great value, good wine and a beautiful steak for like $150 all in! (That includes martinis, appetizer, mains, bottle of wine, cognac and coffee). Talk about value!

The Tempura Asparagus and Snap Peas are unbelievable! One of my very favourite first courses. I tend to go for the Filet Mignon most times. They prepare your preferred colour of steak to perfection.

See you tonight..."}
{"text":"The Keg is a great example of a chain that doesn't really feel like a chain, especially when visiting this landmark location. 
My husband and I have frequented this restaurant many times and every time we leave happy, from our experience to our bellies. I don't think I have ever had a bad experience at this Keg. The location is a historic old mansion, complete with resident ghost and haunted washrooms, apparently. Most of the staff are versed in the history of the house and will spend the time talking about it and answering questions, which is nice. The first time we visited this location I spent most of the first hour just looking around immersed in the environment. Even though the seating can be tight due to the irregularly small rooms (it was a home at one point) I never feel cramped, just very intimate and cozy. 
Staff is always excellent and knowledgeable about the menu. The bread is fine but we never eat it because the real food is just so good you don't want to fill up on plain old bread. For appetizers we order the Thai Calamari which is just excellent, I can't say enough about this little appetizer which is essentially lightly breaded calamari tossed in a chili Thai sauce and served with a tangy honey soy sauce. We also get the spinach dip which is fine, and have started trying the grilled mozzarella flat bread with balsamic glaze which I really enjoy. 
For dinner I have the Teriyaki sirloin which I get each and every time and the one time I didn't I was sorry because this steak has the perfect flavour balance in my opinion, but I tend towards sweet/tangy combinations. They tend to be on the safe side of cooking so I order medium rare and it comes closer to medium which is fine. The garlic mashed potatoes are excellent as a side although sometimes they form a slight crust and you can tell they were the first item to be placed on your plate, but still delicious. Sometimes I switch out for fries and they have a nice taste like they have been cooked in bacon grease or something All steaks have a tomato with some melted cheese included on your plate which I never eat and can't comment on but I sometimes feel guilty because it seems like a waste of food! 
The only time I didn't order the teriyaki sirloin I ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was actually pretty good but still not as good as the steak counterpart. My husband orders the fillet mignon which he also enjoys. 
The Keg has perfected the Cesar and I usually order it or wine. 
All in all a great dining experience, from the location to the consistent food and great service. Maybe not the fanciest or trendiest places but definatley one of our faves. 
Ps. don't bring a nice car the parking lot is insane!!"}
{"text":"My lovely lady surprised me with a birthday dinner to this Keg location.  It had been 5 years since my last visit, so I was excited.  We learned about the history of the mansion and how it is one of the most haunted places in Toronto!

The Victorian decor is unique, though the ambiance was busy and loud.  

We ordered a bottle of Chianti, of course fillet steaks, and settled in for our celebration dinner.

The Keg overall has some of the most superb customer service of any restaurant I've ever seen.  After receiving and starting on my steak, the waitress was worried that it was more on the rare side, and immediately offered to have it cooked properly.  She even had the manager attend to ensure everything was to our satisfaction.  I didn't want to ruin the pace of such a special night, and I can enjoy a steak that's slightly more rare than medium rare, so it wasn't worth making a complaint of it; though, I do know that the Keg takes the quality of their food extremely seriously and I have seen a friend have a meal replaced and comped for the same issues.  Any other day I would have let them redo it, and I would probably get the staredown from my date for doing so; the Keg sets the standard for restaurant customer service.  At least the cake was free anyway... maybe because t was my birthday!"}
{"text":"I only go this location, the atmosphere ( so Romantic)
Cozy,peaceful and the waiters are super cool. I love how they kept a book on their Gost stories.  Its super cool."}
{"text":"Certainly a \"special occasion\" type venue but like all Keg locations, to me anyway, for the price there's much better out there. The Keg seems mostly hype and not worthy of the price given the food, while of good quality overall, is pretty much down the middle in terms of flavor or anything that makes it distinctly exceptional."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and I always thoroughly enjoy it.

The menu is the same as other Keg restaurants. I got the Bleu Cheese filet mignon both times I went, and I always really love it. The look on my face when I take that first bite? Priceless. And since the last time I went was my birthday, I was also given a free slice of cake. The cake was mocha ice cream, and was honestly one of the best ice cream cakes I've had in a long time.

What really makes this place though is the atmosphere. The old mansion is beautiful and really mysterious looking. Going there is so fun, and while it has the casualness of a normal Keg, the 19th century architecture makes it feel really classy.

The service is, as always, very good. Everyone is very efficient and friendly. They don't take reservations, so keep in mind that if you go during the evening, you'll have a wait. We were told the wait was 50 minutes, but we probably waited half an hour. You can choose to eat in the bar, where the wait is shorter, but the bar is VERY noisy, whereas the dining rooms are much quieter.

Totally would recommend!"}
{"text":"The Keg. It's a nicer chain in Canada. They are known for steaks and their summer lobster menu, apparently. I have been to many. They are good. This trip we decided to check out the one in the old mansion downtown. It has a good history. It's haunted. Read up on it when you go. It's gorgeous and very ornate. I should have toured the entire mansion, but I was busy eating.

We had reservations on a Monday night for 3 people at 7:00. Parking was a little confusing, but we pulled it off (it's right in downtown Toronto). We were seated promptly in one of the front rooms. We were offered water and drinks. We had two wines and a mixed cocktail. All were fine. Service throughout the evening was good.

We visited during their 'lobster summer' menu. My dad had big plans to get the lobster and it sounded good to me too. My dad did order the lobster tail. And I thought it would be an even better idea to order the lobster tacos. Wrong. The lobster tail was great (I sampled it). The tacos: The three typical sized tacos had a total of 5 small, fried pieces of lobster (5 total in all 3 tacos). Did I misread the menu? I don't recall seeing the lobster would be fried. It was tasteless (the lobster that is). I was disappointed. It had potential to be good. It had a nice slaw on the tacos that would have went great with a few pieces of (unfried) lobster on it. So I ordered poorly,  BUT, those tacos would have been a disappointment, in my opinion, for anyone who ordered them, even if they were ordered as appetizer (which I believe was the idea). 

After dinner we checked out the desert menu. What I loved was that they had \"mini desserts\". Perfect for when you just want a few bites. We ordered a mini brownie with ice cream and whipped cream and a mini creme brulee and a \"maxi\" (as my dad called it) creme brulee. All were fabulous.

Everything else was great and I would like to go back and order the lobster tail. Someday."}
{"text":"Still one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Naturally expensive, but totally worth it with fantastic service!  Thanks Dave!  :-)"}
{"text":"We're from Texas visiting local friends. They recommended the Keg based on its history and their prior experience. 

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The food was scrumptious and our server, Vanessa, took great care of us. Her laugh was infectious, but most importantly, she was there to help us when we needed her without hovering. 

Two in our party had the peppercorn New York strip with a whiskey sauce. The sauce was good, but I did feel the steak was a tad over peppered and could have used more butter basting during the cooking. Another had the prime rib which we all sampled. It was very good! The sides were all good as well. 

Although their menu showed a cheesecake with bing cherries, Vanessa said they were out of cherries. I asked for a chocolate sizzle with strawberries and they delivered! The cheesecake was about the best we'd had: light and airy, yet creamy and just the right amount of citrus. 

All in all, a wonderful evening in a historic building. I do wish the upholstery was cleaner, and I miss linen tablecloths in a steak house. The prices aren't real expensive, but we do wish it was just a bit more \"fancy.\""}
{"text":"Yum! 

I was visiting over the weekend and this restaurant was the only place in Toronto we visited with both excellent service and drinks (not to mention the fabulous atmosphere!). Well done, Keg.

The steaks are fantastic, as are the drinks. GET THE KIWI SPECIAL. It's amazing.

Our waitress was so sweet and very accommodating to our rowdy table of 12. She didn't even give us a hard time about having separate checks, which I know is totally obnoxious. She handled us all with patience and grace.

I'd certainly come back if I'm in the area again and get a hankerin' for a good steak."}
{"text":"The Keg Mansion is around the corner from my house. I have been a couple times and i really like it. The keg food is notoriously good, everyone knows this. So the good food plus the so incredibly detailed and gorgeous home its in is a perfect setting for either a romantic evening or a few drinks at the bar. There is a lot of history behind this place and apparently it even haunted. I have yet to see any such ghosts but maybe one day lol. I recommend this Keg especially because of the environment. The hostess are friendly the servers are awesome and there really isn't much more to say. Just check it out, take a tour, go up up stairs (its actually very creepy at night if look through the window into the terrace) and enjoy some good du vin!"}
{"text":"One of the nicer locations.  Very affordable and great steaks.  Good choice for locals and tourists."}
{"text":"I'm choosing to review not the Keg restaurant but the bar on the upper floor. I've eaten in the dining room, and it's fine, but the bar is where it's really at. I've been coming here for years and have been poured out its doors at the end of the night many times. If I win the lottery I'm buying this place and booting out the Keg, but I'll keep the bar open with the full menu, don't worry.

The bar is sizable and comfortable. It's just too easy to order a Keg-sized cocktail, a little pricey at around $10, but your martini or bourbon sour or white Russian or Manhattan will be delicious. You can order from the full menu at the bar or at one of the tables in the nearby rooms or snugs, so why would you ever bother with the dining room?

I have many fond memories at the Manson. I've seen hockey players walking through after a game. I even saw a couple basically having sex on one of the couches in the bar. That's an unusual event for the Mansion, I have to say, but it's something you don't forget seeing in a steakhouse bar.

Just a note on the building: the Keg Mansion was at one time owned by Hart Massey of the famous Massey family. Former Governor General Vincent Massey and Hollywood star Raymond Massey once lived right to the north of the mansion. Many rumours of spirits and hauntings abound in the Mansion. There's an open oval in the floor near the washroons where a maid who served the family is alleged to have hung herself, and some report they've seen her ghostly body hanging there. Lillian Massey, the daughter of Hart Massey, is said to have died in the mansion and some have said they've felt her presence, especially in the washrooms for some reason. (Why are washrooms often said to be haunted? Would you want to spend your afterlife flushing toilets and turning lights on and off?) There are also reports of children laughing and a little boy who runs around the mansion playing and spying on diners. Despite the alleged hauntings, the Keg Mansion remains one of the most popular places to eat and drink in the area, and I'll go there either until it closes or I find myself hauntings its hallways myself."}
{"text":"Last time we visited Toronto, we enjoyed dining in at The Keg Steakhouse and Bar because of their delicious pitchers of Sangria's and cooked to perfect prime rib. This time, we decided to have dinner at the original The Keg Steakhouse and Bar aka The Keg Mansion. The two story mansion consisted of dining rooms on the first floor and a spacious lounge and bar on the second floor.

I didn't like the dining area at this location because it was rather confined and it was hard to hold a conversation without yelling at each other. 

For drinks, we shared a pitcher of Red Sangria, which consisted of a nice blend of red wine, havana club 3 year old rum, beefeater gin, cherry brandy, and orange and pineapple juice. It was garnished with fresh fruit medley (including berries and citrus fruits) and drunken bing cherries.

For appetizers, we shared an order of Mushroom Neptune, which consisted of five baked mushroom caps stuffed with crab and cream cheese.  In addition to the Mushroom Neptune, I ordered a French Onion Soup, which consisted of a nice blend of beef broth and sherry with spanish onions and slice of baguette topped with melted Swiss and Parmesan cheese. I highly recommend both of these appetizers as they were delicious.

My brother ordered the Sirloin Oscar, which was topped with shrimps and scallops cooked in a Béarnaise sauce and served with asparagus. My brother was unhappy about his sirloin and was educated on the degrees of steak doneness.

My mom and I ordered the Pistachio Crusted Salmon, which was served over garlic mashed potato, and bacon sautéed brussel sprouts in maple butter. The only difference was I substituted the garlic mashed potato for a baked potato,

My dad ordered the Prime Rib, which was slow roasted and served with vegetable medley (including asparagus, mushroom, and red bell peppers) as well as horseradish and red wine herb jus. As a part of the deal, it came with a Caesar Salad, which consisted of freshly chopped romaine lettuce tossed with croutons and shaved aged Parmesan Cheese in homemade creamy, garlicky Caesar dressing. The meal in its entirety was just the way he had expected it to be. 

We finished the meal with a slice of Billy Miner Pie, which consisted of mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust drizzled with hot fudge and caramel and garnished with sliced almonds."}
{"text":"I absolutely love going for dinner and drinks at the Keg Mansion. Not only is it one of Toronto's most haunted places, but it is gorgeous and grandios inside. The dark mood creates a romantic and Victorian ambiance. Just being in such an old and historic house provides such a lush element of prestige, you forget you're in a chain steakhouse. The food here is consistently good and each time I have gone for dinner the service has been exceptional. 

Normally I would refrain from giving a chain restaurant five stars, but the atmosphere and history behind the place are impossible to ignore. Do yourself a favour and read up on the Mansion's haunted past before dining. And remember to ask your server about their experiences too! The women's bathroom is one of the most haunted rooms in the place. Though beautifully decorated with the highest attention to detail, the mirrors will have you looking over your shoulder as you wash your hands and watch for ghosts. And if you really find yourself intrigued, try going on a Toronto Ghost Tour. We walked by this place and learned more about its past, making the Mansion just that much more intriguing.  

If ghost stories aren't your thing, you will still have a great time at the Mansion, enjoying a perfectly cooked meal, high ceilings and a magical atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute jewel. The wait staff was outstanding and the food was amazing. The ambiance is fantastic as well. I took my mom there for her birthday and everyone had a great time. I had the pistachio crusted salmon and it was simply delightful. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is in  Toronto."}
{"text":"It was an excellent service. The setting inside is also very nice and cozy. We had the calamari for starters and it was very delicious. I ordered the top sirloin medium rare but it wasn't medium, it was way too rare. The vegetables as the side weren't good seasoned, they didn't have any taste."}
{"text":"4.2 / 5

The Keg mansion is not your ordinary Keg location.  While the menu items and pricing are the same, the overall atmosphere and decor is far superior.

This location actually used to be a mansion built in 1868 before it was purchased and transformed into a Keg restaurant in 1976, hence the word \"mansion\" in the name.  As such, the design on the outside is gorgeous old fashioned architecture while the inside of the restaurant has a much more contemporary feel to it, while still very attractive.  The restaurant is several floors and is very large, although this doesn't automatically mean that there is always available seating since this is one of the most popular Keg locations.  Th service is just as good as any other Keg location and the ambiance is calm and relaxing.

I've tried several items from the Keg including the top sirloin, new york striploin, filet mignon and the mushroom neptune appetizer (mushroom caps stuffed with crab meat).  All three of the steaks I tried were great although the NY striploin is probably the best in terms of price to taste ratio.  The mushroom neptune is a fantastic appetizer, one of the best appetizers I've had anywhere, and the mashed potatoes that come on the side with your steak are out of this world.  The prices on the meals here are more than a typical non-steak restaurant obviously, but they are cheaper than most other steakhouses, without sacrificing quality.

The Keg mansion is a great place to go with almost anyone whether it's family, friends, coworkers, or a special someone.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner a couple weeks ago and I joked that I always get the same thing (Keg Classic dinner) so this time I'm trying something different. We have been wanting to check out the Keg Mansion since moving to Toronto, so we finally went. It was surprisingly busy at 6pm on a Sunday. The place was absolutely packed. 

I personally don't know anyone who doesn't love the Keg. If I've ever had any issue with my food, they've always been very quick to make things right. The service is what puts them above some other steak joints out there, and let's face it - they know how to cook a steak. Unfortunately, this trip to the Keg Mansion was slightly lacking in the service department - which is why I couldn't give five stars. Our server seemed like she was bored - I don't think she smiled once. But she brought our food and drinks in a timely manner, so I can't really complain about her skills as a server. Perhaps she was just having an off day. 

I asked my friend if he wanted to split an appetizer, and we agreed on the escargot. Then we both decided on... the Keg Classic filet mignon dinner. Hahaha - one of these days, I'll have something else, I just know it. 

The food, as usual, was excellent. The escargot was garlicky and buttery, served with a soft dinner roll to soak up all that goodness. Followed by a perfectly cooked medium rare filet mignon, and fully loaded baked potato. What more can you ask for? Even the veggies and sautéed mushrooms were seasoned well and perfectly cooked. Although I don't eat a lot of red meat, any time I'm craving a good steak, I know I'll find one at the Keg!"}
{"text":"This is a late review - I was here on my actual birthday. This location is historically known for being haunted.

The interior was positively beautiful - even the washrooms were fancy. Our waiter told us the story about how one of the housemaids hung herself near the (now) women's washroom.

We all enjoyed our meals and the service was excellent. I received a free slice of cake and got to blow out candles too. It is on the pricier side, expect to spend $50 per person. The Keg is definitely a treat yo' self place. 

Overall, I recommend visiting - let's keep this location alive!!"}
{"text":"As always steak was excellent. I had the filet mignon and garlic mash. Steak was excellent. Highly recommend it to anyone in Town. Place was very stylish and around 930 pm had a lot of room to sit. Sat outside the balcony and I was able to see the colours on the ACN Tower"}
{"text":"As far as food goes, The Keg is The Keg.  You kind of know what to expect.  It's delicious.

One of my biggest qualms is that they don't take reservations, but oh well, that still doesn't deter me from going to The Keg.  My boyfriend and I had a gift card, and thought we'd treat ourselves to a nice dinner.  He had never been to The Keg Mansion, so we thought we'd try that location.  It was packed!  The hostess said we could sit in the bar area and still have dinner, so we decided to do that.  

Now like I said, it was packed, so I can understand if things are running a bit slower, but the pace that we were being served was unbearable.  We each ordered a glass of wine, which we had finished by the time the waitress came back to give us our meals.  While my boyfriend got the right meal, they gave me the wrong order.  They took it back and said they'd cook me a new meal.  Instead of taking my boyfriend's meal back, they left it there to either get cold while I wait for mine, or for him to eat it in front of me while I waited for mine.  My meal finally came half way through my boyfriend's meal (I told him to go ahead while it was hot), and at this time I asked for a glass of water.  I got the water AFTER I had finished my meal, so I was dead thirsty since I had nothing to wash my meal down with.  

I was happy that the manager came over to apologize for the error in my meal.  I was surprised however that he didn't offer to comp. our drinks, or offer a free dessert or small discount.  I've gone to other restaurants where they accidently brought our appetizer and main at the same time, and they comped the appetizer for the inconvenience!  For a big chain like The Keg, I was shocked that they didn't do anything other than apologize.  

Needless to say that was the last time I've been to the Keg Mansion, and that was 2 years ago.  It's unfortunate b/c it's a great location downtown and the house itself is beautiful with a lot of history.  I'm all for giving second chances, but if this happens again I'm done with this location for good!"}
{"text":"This place always gets busy during dinner time so be sure to come early! We waited 20 mins to be seated which wasn't bad since we went during the dinner rush. Service is always good as expected from the keg. Nice atmosphere! 

Food was pretty good.

Appetizer: I usually get a salad, I was kinda sad they took away their spinach salad which I thought was da bomb! The dressing was sweet, tangy and delicious. They have other salads but they're pretty standardized (e.g. Cesar, garden salad, etc.). To me the spinach salad really stands out and was different then what most resturants usually offer. You guys def need to bring it back! 

Main: I always get the prime beef. They have all their prime beef cooked medium rare usually, but I always ask for the cut on the more rare side since I don't really like the texture when it's cooked medium. Usually the waiter will try to bring a slice that's more on the rare side, which i always appreciate! The prime beef was perfect and I love the horseradish. Watch out thou, for those who never tried their horseradish, a lil goes along way. It definitely has some kick to it and can clear your stuffed up sinuses.

The prime beef came with a choice of one side (I choose garlic mash) and automatically comes with onion frizzles (I believe that's what they're called). I wasn't too impressed with their onion frizzles, they didn't have much flavor  to it and it didn't taste good espically once it was cold. Not a fan, next time I'll see if I can substitute another side for it. Their garlic mash wasn't as good today as it typically is, but usually the garlic mash is okay. It didn't have as much flavor to it this time, I think I could have done with a bit more seasoning.  

Dessert: Their fudge brownie is so good, its part of their mini dessert menu (it's designed to be smaller portion, a lil taste after a big meal). I always get it. It's price reasonably....$3 like whattttt are you serious?! It's so cheap for keg pricing, i think they can easily charge a few dollars more but I'm not complaining :P it comes with a scoop of ice cream and whipped cream. Did i mention it's only 3$?! I'm surprised they don't charge more for it considering if you go to any major coffee place like Starbucks their brownies will cost a few dollars more and it doesn't even come with ice cream or whipped cream!! I always order it and share it, it's perfect after a heavy meal where you're too full to order a dessert on your own."}
{"text":"Very beautiful place to enjoy a steak! 

I've only gone here once and all I have to say is WOW! This place is a masterpiece. The moment you walk in the decor really grabs your attention. From all the crown mouldings to the fixtures to the look that you are in an immaculate house. 

If you don't make a reservation at this place you will be waiting a very long time and I mean very long time. I waited about thirty minutes for my table even though I made a reservation which kinda made me mad a bit but that was okay because it gave me the opportunity to check the place out. 

While waiting for my table one of the servers took us upstairs to the bar/lounge area. It was very nice I was kinda glad that I didn't get my table right away b/c it gave me an opportunity to talk with my friends in a closer area instead of spread out on a table. The drinks at the bar are decently priced like any restaurant and they have a bigger variety of drinks available. 

After 30 minutes or so we finally got our table. After settling in our server came and told us a little history about the keg mansion, which mind you was very interesting. It got really good until she told us that the Mansion was haunted. I wasn't surprised b/c honestly which huge mansion in the world is not somewhat haunted. But when she told us that they have heard some things going on in the restroom while no one was there that's when I got a little freaked out. I didn't want to go to the restroom after hearing that b/c you know the next thing I know I'm doing my business and something starts coming towards me or soap just starts floating out of thin air. OMG! so anytime one of boys was getting up I'd be like \"you going to the washroom? I'm coming with you\" 

The one thing I don't like about the Keg in general is that it is overly priced! Especially when the food doesn't fill you up! Don't get me wrong though they absolutely have one of thee best steaks and prime ribs anywhere. 

Items to definitely get 

- keg sized prime rib 
- keg sized filet mignon 
- keg sized new york strip-loin 
- Crab, Parmesan & Spinach Dip"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere... Seemed like I was having dinner in some rich person's castle.  The wait staff and bartenders were all so down to earth and friendly. The steak was perfect and the wine matching was even better.  Price for the quality was on target in my opinion.

The only thing missing - and NOT their fault - is the lack of cigar smoking inside.  :). Really wish one of these steak houses would allow a good cigar after a food steak without having to go outside."}
{"text":"A nice place for a meal. The food is a 3 star. Service is 4.5. Ambience is interesting as it feels like a haunted mansion at a Disney theme park. We had steaks. The meat is ok, but it is cooked well."}
{"text":"The Keg Mansion should be fun.  Built into one of the many mansions found on Jarvis Street, you want this place to work.  There'll be all kinds of rooms that you can find yourself dining in, bars on different floors, the vast expanse filled up with tables of people eating beef and loving it.  And it does have a bit of fun rolled into it.  The steak isn't too bad either.

There are few places that you want to show up early to and enjoy a drink at the bar.  This thankfully, is one.  I'd reserve if I were you and arrive in advance of your table time.  There's an upstairs bar that appears to have been a drawing room or lounge or something of that nature.  The stair cases and interior have all been well preserved so that you get the sense that you're at a cocktail party or something.

Once seated, there's a myriad rooms that you can find yourself in with quiet corners and darkly-lit nooks.  The steaks are your typical fare that you'd expect from a Keg, which is a good thing.  For some reason the first few times I went there, the steaks were not as good as the other franchises for some reason.  I've been recently and they seem to be back on track.  Good on them."}
{"text":"I went here with family last weekend on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. The food was delicious, I got the teriyaki steak, which was great. Although they have other types of dishes, steak is definitely the way to go here. There is a big selection of cuts and seasonings and they will prepare it any way you like. My drink was also good, an alcoholic raspberry lemonade, which our server helpfully suggested.
What separates this place from other steakhouses is the atmosphere. The building itself is gorgeous, as was the decor inside. We ended up eating in the lounge area, which had a fun, trendy, upscale vibe. The menu was a little pricey, so thank god I wasn't paying. This would be a great place for a date, especially if you're trying to impress someone.
Minus one star for having a super long wait and not taking reservations. Luckily, they had the lounge area with the same menu, so it wasn't too bad. They also have their own parking lot, something I've found to be a rarity downtown, and I'd like to give them props for that!"}
{"text":"My gf and I visited Toronto for the weekend. I found this place here on Yelp and it was excellent.  We had to wait at the bar for our table for a half an hour, but that was just enough time to have a few drinks and make some friends. Not to mention the fact that we got to watch the bartender at the upstairs bar knock 12 shots of Jager into pint glasses with Red Bull.  It was perfect domino effect of all the shots into the glasses. I wish I had seen that done before I went to college because I definitely would have tried it!   

The food was excellent.  My steak was perfect and so was my gf's.  The one thing that was lacking at this place was grunting cavemen and bearskin rugs.  After a nice steak I enjoy wrapping myself in a nice bear skin hide and sitting by the hearth while listening to Hall and Oates. If you can tell me a restaurant where I can make this happen, let me know."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here with the family. The historic mansion is great to explore even casually if you venture upstairs to the washroom. The service was spot on, attentive, informative yet not overbearing. 
The mains here are mostly between $25-35 with the best values being the keg combo meals. I enjoyed a big salad of mixed greens to start. I ordered the 8oz top sirloin combo. The steak arrived a perfect medium as requested and it was juicy tender flavorful and nicely pink. I had garlic mashed potatoes, cooked veg and sauteed mushrooms to accompany all that lovely meat. I personally believe this is the best best bang for your buck at $27. For desert I recommend getting the sweet mini treats @$3 each so you can sample each! I lived the mango creme brulé. The vanilla creme brulé was not as interesting and the cheesecake was typical cheesecake. Overall, I like my Kegs and this location adds character and charm to the experience."}
{"text":"Great steak and scrumptious desserts as always at the Keg. Amazing building, perfect date restaurant!

What stopped this review from getting 5 Stars was our server, Justin. He was polite enough but seemed to be on autopilot. I just wish his pre-programmed routine included a second check in beyond the customary \"How is everyone tasting so far?\". After that one question he didn't stop by until I waved at him to ask for a dessert menu for my date and I to peruse. Amazing Billy Miner Pie!

I would've also asked for another Keg-sized glass of wine if he came by, but I never had that opportunity  Lost the restaurant another $12 of revenue at least and a sad drop in tip for Justin. Wake up and smell the service, friend!

Will return, if perhaps to request a different section of the mansion."}
{"text":"Friendly service, lovely atmosphere but is it just me or are their steak portions getting smaller?  For the first time ever I left the restaurant still hungry."}
{"text":"I've decided I'm a big fan of old mansions turned into restaurants, and the Keg Mansion definitely does not disappoint.  It has all the AMBIANCE you could ever want...although they might want to consider offering headlamps to read the menus as it is indeed pretty dark...one can overdo it, this isn't O Noir after all.

The FOOD: 
~~~Prime Rib ($32 w/salad & sides, $26 w/o) is a delightful tender, juicy cut of meat.  I'm a sucker for horseradish and prime rib, and this perfect combination was cooked just as I asked for.

~~~Filet Mignon ($39 w/salad & sides, $33 w/o) was also just perfectly done.  I have a hard time describing a well-cooked steak.  You know it when you see it.

One nice tip is that you can substitute any salad in these dinner combinations and I've enjoyed the mixed greens or the spinach salad.  They're pretty unimaginative and equivalent to what you can do at home, but tasty.  If you're going to get a salad or side, then it's cheaper to do the combo.

The only thing was bad was that they used to offer a passion fruit creme brulee.  The waitress warned me about it, but I ordered it anyway.  It was awful, she was right.  She promptly took it off the bill and took it away.

The SERVICE:
It took me a few minutes to come up with the right description.  It's very good service, but in the Stepford Wives sort of way.  It's a rehearsed casual tone.  I can't complain, they're always pretty good and responsive.

OVERALL, this place is a bit of a splurge, but if you stick to what they claim to do well (dead cows), then you will not be disappointed.  Nothing avant garde going on here.  I'm fine with the basics, but at this price point, I wouldn't mind just a little bit of creative cooking thrown into the mix.  The chain nature also comes through including with the tacky upsells to the \"Keg Size (R)\"....and I'm not kidding that it has a reserved mark next to it.

A TIP:  Make sure you have a reservation.  This place can be busy almost any night of the week."}
{"text":"It was perfect for our business party of 10.  We were seated in the backgammon room, the acoustics were great, we could hear one another well, service was very good as was the food and the price was very reasonable for a large party.   We will be back"}
{"text":"Keg is one of my favorite steakhouse in Toronto.
Especially Keg mansion is my best  location.
It's busy location but still very romantic place to date.
Cocktail shrimp and salted mushroom is my favorite appetizers .
New York steaks never disappointed me.

It's too dark to take a picture. But bright enough to see a lover :-)"}
{"text":"After over 200 reviews, my review is just a cherry on the cake.  I do find it necessary to express my appreciation of the combined offering at The Keg Mansion, so here I go.

Environment - top shelf venue.  In truth, it has very few near competitors in terms of the uniqueness, grandness, size and glamour.  I sat there and wondered how it was possible someone had actually lived here.  5 stars.

Ambiance - Regardless, the ambiance in the dining room was diminished because it was crowded and noisy.  Tables were cramped together.  So I was impressed and then not by the ambiance.  There is hope, though, as there is a casual classy lounge on the second floor.  Here the public can enjoy drinks and small bites in a more leisure setting.  I didn't dine here, so I don't know if you can order a steak from the lounge.  3 stars for the dining room.  4 stars for the lounge.

Food - we ordered prime rib, top sirloin oscar, baseball sirloin and New York steak. Prime rib was the star - cooked to order, perfectly seasoned, tender, flavourful, juicy.  My whole table would have no problem reordering it next time.  If you prefer to see the grill lines on your steak, I'd say the baseball steak and New York steak are both good choices. The one we had were from good cut of meat, perfectly seasoned, rich in beef flavour, and well portioned.  The sirloin oscar was less impressive, and it was quite expensive compared to the baseball and New York steak. 4.5 stars.  If we discount the sirloin oscar, it is 5 stars.

Value - superb.  Good steaks are expensive.  Steakhouses with good atmosphere are expensive. The Keg Mansion charges the same prices as other locations of the chain.  But the venue is the best.  I feel that the steaks are cooked better. This is where you can impress a date without breaking the bank.  5 stars.

Services - adequate, patient, polite though admittedly a bit aloof.  Our waiter was not intrusive, and we could sit as long as we liked after paying the bill.

There is no doubt in my mind that the combined offering of The Keg Mansion is in a class of its own.  Nothing comes to mind that 1) is in the same price range and 2) has similar class of environment, location, food, and attention to detail.  If you can pay a lot more, there are better steakhouses, and the Keg Mansion would be 4 stars in comparison. Otherwise, The Keg Mansion, in my humble opinion, is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Woah, simply amazing. I've always loved steaks from the keg but this one takes the cake. I had the 10oz Filet Mignon with a 8oz Lobster tail for my main and as a start the garlic shrimp and calamari appetizers. I don't know what it was but this one was cooked to perfection. I usually take my steaks medium rare but I got this one medium well and it was great!  It was my first time here also, great atmosphere. Fancy. Great place to take friends or family."}
{"text":"Having been to the Keg Mansion many times, I will recount my first experiences there as they are the most memorable...

My first time at this location was about 2 years ago and we were in a group of 6 people, I was the only Torontonian with the others visiting from Newfoundland. We got there a little early not realizing they open at 4:00pm, so we waited the hour until they opened. We were seated right away in what we were assured was the best seat in the house, the \"solarium\". It was a great table on an enclosed balcony with windows all around. I was the most normal looking person in the group with everyone else having piercings to hell or funky coloured hair, but we still received very professional service. Between our noise level and eating steak with our hands, we were very surprised that they put up with us, but in fact the waitress sat down with us for a few minutes at our request. Our final bill was over $400, so they must have loved us. The food was cooked to order with not a single problem between any of us. This was the rare occasion where everyone in my group received what they ordered the way they ordered it. It was a fun experience that left a very good taste in my mouth, and a very full stomach.

My next visit was for my girlfriend's birthday a few months later. We walked there because I lived right around the corner, and that way it would be a surprise where we were going. When we got there it was busy but we were still seated right away in a romantic candle-lit corner. Unfortunately just as we ordered our meal work called, so we had to be a bit faster than hoped for. We told the waiter we were in quite a rush, and our food came out in record time! Even with the busyness of the restaurant and the rush that we put on the order, everything was still perfectly cooked and tasted perfect like very few restaurants can manage.

I have been back many times since then and each time had a perfect experience. I have been to a few Keg locations before, but never have I had this level of service or quality. I would recommend The Keg Mansion for groups or for more intimate meals."}
{"text":"Okay, it's a chain.  But we went here for my birthday tonight and had a thoroughly pleasant experience.  The atmosphere is pleasant and lovely with absolutely no feeling of being in a chain restaurant - after all, it really is a historic mansion.  Service was great - considerate and pleasant without being at all obtrusive. (She did make a minor mistake in the order, but it was hardly noticeable and was billed according to what was delivered.)  Our party all ordered a winter special of steak and seafood.  The steak was great as were the shrimp and scallops that came with.  Asparagus was crisp and perfectly cooked.  A mixed green salad had a vinagrette dressing blissfully free of sugar and a nice mix of spring greens and mesclun.

The prices, while not cheap, are very fair for the atmosphere and what is presented.  I ordered wine by the glass but could not help noticing the wine list had some very good buys on bottled wine."}
{"text":"Came here last night to celebrate my husbands birthday. I had a fabulous time as usual.. The Keg just knows how to do it right.. 

Somehow they have really tapped into what a customer needs when they dine out and have perfected the whole dining experience. I honestly feel like a lot of other restaurants need to come dine here and take a crash course in what customer service actually is.

The food is always consistent, the wait staff are genuinely interested in making your night a pleasant and satisfying one. I really love how they genuinely want to make you feel comfortable.

On another note the general ambience of this place is just unreal. There's a particular energy here that you really don't find at any other restaurants and that's what makes it unique.

I love how you can really spend a few hours in this place. It's kinda like a one stop shop with the upstairs feeling like a lounge where you can have a few drinks and then can continue downstairs to have a nice meal. 

On a side note, their steaks are the best I've had anywhere... I just had to update my review because it's not often you dine more than ten times at the same place and receive consistent service.  

Way to go Keg, you haven't seen the last of me and I will continue to recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Keg Mansion is my go-to place when friends are visiting and they want to have a nice night out for dinner. Delicious food, amazing atmosphere, great value, and service that is so friendly it's almost a little eery.

The whole restaurant is in an old mansion, which is a really nice, classy atmosphere to eat in. My favourite area to eat would be on the main level at the very back, where there is a smaller, separate room with a little more character, containing some paintings and (if I remember correctly) a fireplace. There are some fun little cards at the front that explain the history of the mansion, as well as some ghost stories about it being haunted. There is more of a bar/lounge area upstairs which is a nice place to get some drinks and snacks, or to hang out while you wait for a table to be ready.

The food -- AMAZING. I've had a number of steaks here and loved them all, but my favourite is the peppercorn New York steak. Absolutely exploding with delicious flavour in every bite. Perfectly seasoned. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. For a nice place, it is all very affordable as well. If you want to, you can get a steak dinner with salad and mashed potatoes for about $25 I believe.

The service is fantastic. There is just an extremely friendly aura around all of the staff. Kitchen staff walking by will smile at you even though they don't need to, and the servers are constantly attentive and helpful.

The restaurant does not take reservations on weekends. This is pretty annoying and makes it difficult to plan a night out with friends, but of the two Saturdays I've been here, we had to wait an hour on one of them, and the other the place was pretty much dead. I haven't picked up the pattern on the least-busy time to come yet.

Yes, The Keg is part of a chain, but you'd never know unless someone told you. There is a lot of unique character to the restaurant and the quality is bar none. I grew up in Oshawa, and the comparison to our Keg there is like night and day.

For a nice night out in the city, you need to check this place out. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars but really no place is perfect. They did a great job and the service was terrific. I ate upstairs in the bar and the waitress was very attentive.  Nice wine list and my steak was cooked exactly the way I ordered it.  The veggies were also cooked perfectly and my waitress answered my wine questions well. 

This is hardly a complaint but I alone (I'm on a business trip) and was just looking to read a book while I ate but it was a little bit dark inside.  Not a problem... My waitress brought me two candles. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There is nothing mind blowing about the food. It's simple and consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Love love loved it! So far the best food we've had in Toronto. Service was great, drinks were great, extensive wine list as well. Price was incredible considering how good the food was. Had the onion soup, tenderloin, baked potato twice (so good), creme brûlée. Someone in our group had the escargot appetizer and he looooved it. Honestly, there wasn't a bad dish we tried. Highly highly recommend this place. They have a lounge/bar on the second floor in case food isn't on your priority list tonight"}
{"text":"Oh My! The juciest medium rare, cooked to perfection steak! Succulent escargot, delicious baked potatoe topped with sour cream and chives. Steam floating off them when the servers brought our plates. A gorgeous dining room, everyone well dressed and smiling. A wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"great EVERYTHING.... this location is the BEST - beautiful mansion and elegant decor, great view from 2nd floor - best steaks for the $ anywhere in the city - consistently GREAT - you just can't go wrong here!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend because I got a $50 Keg Card. I chose this location because it was in a mansion and supposedly haunted ... I thought that would be romantic :P

I got the filet mignon as per usual and it was cooked to perfection. I got garlic mashed potatoes on the side and it went very well with the ranch sauce. The roasted red peppers was flavourful. However, the peas lacked some flavour but the texture was on point.

We got two desserts in the end to split. I ordered the Billy Miner Pie which was basically just an ice cream cake. It was huge and we could barely finish it. My boyfriend got a butter tart with a scoop of ice cream. The butter tart had a very thick crust and it tasted like grocery bought tarts.

The service here was average. They weren't rude but they weren't very warming either.

Overall, I would stick to the steak here and skip the dessert."}
{"text":"Love the Keg! Always friendly and knowledgeable staff, good romantic atmosphere, delicious food, quiet and relaxing background music. Out of their many locations, the mansion is my favourite. Ambient atmosphere, top notch interior design, excellent service!
Tried many different appetizers there, always top notch. Cocktails are great!
They have a good wine selection as well!
Tried different steaks there, and was always satisfied. My favourite so far is their bacon wrapped fillet mignon with double baked potato and roasted asparagus. 
For dessert, try Creme Brulee- delish!
I will certainly keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I normally judge a steakhouse by the quality of the steak, which to be honest was only OK. That said I had such a nice time here that 4 stars doesn't seem to be fair either. 4.5 stars would be about right.
The location is truly amazing - there aren't many other places you can eat at with so much history. We felt a little odd asking our waiter about the place, but as the night went on most of the other tables asked about it as well. They have a little booklet that explains the history of the place which is worth asking for.
This is a great place for a romantic dinner. There are many elegant restaurants out there, but few that are housed in a legitimate, historic mansion. This location is the flagship of The Keg steakhouse chain and it's easy to see why. 
Service was great as well. Our waiter was attentive without hovering and got us a free desert as well since we were celebrating our anniversary here. (This seems to be a policy here so definitely let them know if your celebrating a special event).
The only downside was the filet I ordered. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it wasn't amazing either (this is judged in comparison to the top steakhouses in NYC, which admittedly set a pretty high standard). My wife ordered a surf-and-turf combo with steak, lobster tail, and other seafood and enjoyed it quite a bit. The trio of small deserts we ordered were all excellent.
If all your interested in is the beef then you might be able to do better - but if your looking for the total package for a romantic dinner than this place is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Called today to make a reservation and was shooed off the phone so fast by some lady. Like she was rushing me so fast and so impersonal. Gezzz. I like the keg because their service and food is always on the standard. Today was a 100% fail in the customer service dept."}
{"text":"If you love big old houses and architecture, the venue is definitely worth checking out.  As a vegetarian I can't elaborate too much on the menu, but always enjoy the Tempura Asparagus and Snap Peas.  

It's always busy, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ate here for a special function for 30 people. Food was decent, and the building had charm, but service was surprisingly very slow. Waiters did not know what a sazerac was.  No elevators in this restaurant due to the historic character, which may be cumbersome for anyone with strollers or for those who have trouble with stairs (we were on an upper floor). Extremely limited parking in their lot on a Friday night. Loud atmosphere. Prime rib was mangled, cut sloppily. The Billy Miner pie dessert was good."}
{"text":"Am I the only one that is a Keg hater? 
I think this place is overpriced all together. 

Don't get me wrong - the MANSION is lovely and a great place if you want a fancier date setting. 
We had a  20 minute wait so we headed upstairs to the bar for a drink.

GREEN APPLE MARTINIS ARE BY FAR THE BEST! 

We were seated quickly, and it took a while for the waitress to realize we were there. 
I have never been a fan of their steaks.   They \"claim\" they have the best cut and savory steak, however I find them tough and chewy. 
My friend and I ordered a simple cesaer salad  (to add chicken/steak was an extra $10 - is that not a bit much??).

Service was ok - just felt like another customer that was being stuffled in and out of the place so they could clear a table.  There was no special touch to the place.

I give it a 3/5 stars just for the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"Neat vibe and atmosphere for a Keg. Parking out front which is a bonus, though it can be a little tight making it harder to get out of your spot. But still with all the good quality and value that comes with all keg locations.

The keg classics are a good option of you are hungry enough. You basically save a dollar on the salad, and get the mushrooms and veg for free. I had the baseball top sirloin which can only be cooked medium rare or less. It's a really thick cut of meat. I enjoyed it.

For dessert we had the Billy Miner Pie. Which is pretty much a mocha ice cream pie which was massive and a great deal. Definitely large enough for sharing."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group (20+) for a birthday dinner. The staff were excellent, very attentive and kind. They even gave us a few slices of ice cream cake for free! 

I ordered the 12 oz top sirloin and it was cooked to perfection. 

All in all to keep it short great atmosphere, amazing food and an equally good staff experience."}
{"text":"Perfect rib.. perfect rib steak and what is amazing is that all Kegs are this good it is just that this location has the best mansion-like atmosphere of them all. Of course, no one goes to Keg without ordering their mashed potato. The bread is warm and moist.
Why is it not a 5-star? The waitresses are overworked and running around moving fast that is annoying. I hope it is not greed for tips because they could really use more waitstaff. Please do not look rushed or annoyed and stop running around I am here to enjoy my dinner and not get nervous"}
{"text":"The Keg, it's a chain but a good one. Keg Mansion is in a most impressive Victorian house and walking in it just feels a little special.  It's always crowded downstairs but you can always find a seat upstairs in the bar and the food is the same.   Their king crab legs are divine but the prime rib is always good too, so I normally order sufficient to feed a small village and unfortunately rarely leave much on the plate.  This is a great place to come if you feel your jeans are just a little to loose or you need an excuse or you find the space between your belly and the steering wheel intimidating and you want to close that gap."}
{"text":"Great great service as they were well aware of the guests as some of our meal was comped due to a slow kitchen. The building was unique and had parking available in a busy DT area. Typical keg food served. not crappy, not awesome."}
{"text":"The Keg Mansion is definitely the most storied and grandest of all the Keg locations in Toronto. If it's your first visit, your server will probably take you down memory lane during your welcome, as they did with us on this visit. The Mansion has housed some of the most iconic Toronto families including the Masseys and the McMasters. To add to the intrigue, the women's washroom is said to be haunted as a lady passed away in there some years ago. Even if you aren't really that interested in the history lesson, the Mansion is really a sight to behold. There's a huge staircase leading up from the foyer to the second floor which makes for some great pictures as I saw many guests taking advantage of that night. I was seated in the front room which has luxurious mantle and many marble details. It was also decorated for Christmas which  added to the great atmosphere. Just the story and the ambiance makes it a great location for a date.

On this occasion I had the portobello mushroom burger. The burger title is really misleading as it's definitely a sandwich in every way. The bread that was used was a ciabatta bun, was cut down the middle for easy eating and presented as a sandwich. This was a little surprising but there were no other surprises regarding the fillings as described. The sandwich was cold though so definitely the opposite of what I was expecting from a burger.  This entree comes with a choice of side and I opted for a Caesar salad which was good. It was dressed lightly with ample parmesan shavings and croutons. All in all the dish was fine. 

The highlight was actually the appetizer. The baked garlic shrimp is served in the dish that they use for the escargot. This leaves perfect little pockets of cheese and oil to dip the bread in. It's extremely savoury, definitely unhealthy but really good. 

I'm sure there would have been a better option for a main and I would be much more pleased. Huge plus that this mid-town location actually has free parking. The building is really quite magical and what's carrying the 4 star review today!"}
{"text":"First of all - it's the Keg Mansion - you can't really go wrong by coming here, even if it's just for the amazing location.  This house is full of history - and if you're into ghosts, it's 100% haunted.  Ask your servers about the creepy things that happen here.

As far as the food goes, it's standard Keg food.  You know you're going to get a great steak, great potatoes and quality service.  

This place gets busy on the weekends - so get there early if you don't want to wait.  Fun tip, you can get a full menu in the bar, and they have some \"table\" that are actually pretty big and comfy.

The part I love the most, is the open kitchen.  It's really cool to see the chefs work and you know that your food is being preped correctly."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Toronto I visit the Keg Mansion. Utter perfection and my favourite Keg restaurant. Wonderful service. Had a reservation for 7, turned into 10 and the staff were extremely easy to get on with. 

One child special orders a poutine made with au jus. 

My go to place out of all the great food places in Toronto"}
{"text":"We all know the Keg makes a good steak so that said ours was good, the wine geez double the price for all wines, that sucks, the bread should be cut through not so you have to wrestle with it, that's all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I was visiting Toronto for my Bachelorette party and we went out to dinner at Keg Mansion. Our server was the best ever i wish i remembered her name! The bacon wrapped scallops were delicious, the steak cooked to perfection, lobster was delicious and last but not least dessert ( i had the creme brulee) was perfection. Atmosphere is cozy and intimate, perfect for a special night out. Service impeccable. Keg Mansion left a great impression on me and I hope to one day return with my future husband."}
{"text":"Out of 10, I give this place a 5.  Ordered the sirloin Oscar and was disappointed with the size of the scallops and shrimp, very small.  The twice baked potato was excellent.  The server was great and well informed.  For the price, would not go again."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 2 is because the interior is gorgeous and the service is friendly, but GOSH, is it slow. 
They don't take reservations for small parties so myself and 5 friends showed up here on a Saturday evening a bit before 8 p.m. hoping for the best.
We were greeted and told we could wait in the bar (upstairs) and order apps and drinks and they would be transferred to our table after. Cool.
We sat down at a high top table, ordered drinks, and a server came by and told us we could have a seat in a green, little room by the window with a big table and wrap around couch right away if we wanted to.
We wanted to. After this move, it all went downhill.
We were excited about the cute little room and the fact that we didn't have to wait for a table, but I had to ask for water 3 times before we got it.
They brought the alcoholic drinks (I wasn't drinking) but forgot my water again.
The drinks took a while. We were forgiving because it was quite busy.
15 minutes later, empty drinks, we ordered apps and our meals since we didn't want to wait a long time before our server came back.
It took more than half an hour to get our appetizers. We were starving. Since only two of us ordered apps, we waited for them to bring bread before we ate ours.
Our server said he'd be right back with it but 10 minutes later, we were still waiting.
The food was okay. I got the escargot but they were really acidic tasting. Not what I was expecting. Not that good.
You get 5 with two bread rolls and 5 mushroom caps for $11.
Our dinner took another hour or so to come out. We were just sitting there with empty plates, starving again. By this time it is well after 9:45. 
The food came, everyone enjoyed it (super expensive imo), and we ordered dessert and asked for our bills. I think we were visibly agitated. We had been here for so long. By this time the second floor was EMPTY, save for 3 groups, one of which was at the bar.
We got our bills, waited 10 minutes for a machine, found out the apps on \"special\" that day weren't actually on special (only between 4-6 and 11-close or something, which was not clearly stated).
We left after 10:30. None of us could believe how long it took. It ruined my plans to sit on a patio after because we were all sleepy by that time and wanted to go to bed (this may also be because I'm getting older though, haha).
I would not recommend and I would not return."}
{"text":"The Keg is the definition of reliability. They have a unique niche in the market - not high end, but above mid end - and with that you get the reliability of a high value steak. When it comes to high end alcohol, there's no better value than the Keg - no matter how cheezy Keg Size may sound. 


This location is by far my favorite one. Why? It's warm and inviting and it's unique..... it's haunted!

So since everyone's shared their stories of service, i'm going to share the knowledge i have about the ghosts of the Mansion in bullet form:

1) House was built by the McMaster family in the late 1800's (as in McMaster University)
2) House was purchased by the Massey family in early 1900's (as in Massey Hall)
3) Underground tunnels were built because one of the sons was sick. The tunnels, which are blocked off but still exist, connected to the Wellesley Hospital. The son died at a young age, and his older brother also died of sickness shortly after.
4) Only daughter and heir of the estate died of loneliness once her husband passed away. 
5) Her nanny, hung herself of the top of the stairs after her employers deaths 
6) People experience multiple ghosts at this location - the most experiences are felt in the women's washroom on the second floor. 
7) People have reported hearing kids play on the staircase.
8) People have reported seeing the nanny at the top of the staircase.
9) Staff have reported strange activity like doors closing, sprinkler systems going on and off, pans thrown across the kitchen, etc.


So with all the mystery, history and legends, what's not to enjoy about the Keg Mansion over a glass of wine and steak?"}
{"text":"Good steaks, at a good price. The meat was well cooked, potatoes were great, decent wine selection. A nice place to eat. The manor seems formal, but shorts and tank top casual. Great dessert to round off a nice meal."}
{"text":"Didn't see the darned ghost children!! Or the creepy bathroom ghost!! What the heck?!

I've been to other Keg's, but it was my first time here at the historical Keg mansion (housed there since the 70s wowee). Despite the lack of ghosts, I had a wondrous meal. And my food sensitivity was accommodated to all heck which is greatly appreciated by me since I am currently suffering from mystery headaches possibly related to food. So if you have any food allergies or sensitivities, The Keg is where it is at! They note in their menu that they will do everything possible to accommodate you which is just so so so great.

To my surprise, a lot of their menu contains dairy, including most of their steaks (Milk steaks?) I mentioned my sensitivity to dairy and each server that gets a diet accommodation request, clears it with their manager, so that's a nice way to make sure sensitivity/allergy requests go through 2 levels.

So I got a Baseball Top Sirloin, and let me tell you, that thing was like TWO BASEBALLS. It was huge - it was a struggle of strength, appetite and wits to get through that thing (BUT I GD DID). Even when I was basically forcing it down and terrified of choking, I was still like MMMMMM YOU SO GD DELICIOUS STEAK WONT BE EVEN MAD IF I CHOKE ON YOU. So to say the least, I had a grand ol' time at the Keg Mansion - Fabulous service, awesome food, and maybe a little fright from a ghost watching you pee in the women's restroom."}
{"text":"My wife enjoyed the prime rib and my son's tenderloin was good.  My NY Strip was cooked to my liking, however, my bad luck, there was a pretty hefty tendon in it. So I lost at least 25% of my steak. Still would go back."}
{"text":"Easiest review to make!

The place itself is stunning! The food, always delicious.  You can never go wrong.  Great crab cakes too.  Steak always to your liking.  Very reasonable and never a bad critique.  

I don't even like escargot and I was forced to try it at the Keg Mansion.  Best sauce ever!"}
{"text":"Met up with friends here recently for dinner, with our kids. The overall experience was great! We did have a wait, however we made the best of it upstairs at the bar. While there we read the kids the \"spooky\" history of the mansion and looked for the ghosts. 

Dinner...  We had a variety of appetizers as well as meals. Everything was  just about perfect. 

All in all a great evening."}
{"text":"The Keg really has that perfect blend of fine casual. The food is consistently good. It's nothing to special but definitely one of my go to places for a nice dinner on a budget"}
{"text":"Though a chain, this Keg \"Mansion\" location is really nice, housed in an old house with an English country club feel to it.  The service here is really nice - from the bartenders upstairs to the servers at your table.  The steaks were good and cooked really well.  Didn't feel like a chain at all.

The only thing lacking was the cocktails - the mojitos tasted like lemon soda.  Stick to beer, wine or straight up drinks."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time during the fall? I can't quite remember.. But I do remember being extremely excited and a little bit scared from the tales that this place was haunted! I went to high school literally right across the street for 5 years at Jarvis Collegiate Institute and never have I ever ONCE eaten at the Keg Mansion. 

I am a huge fan of old houses, especially big Victorian houses because they have so much detailing and history behind them. I loved that this mansion had been converted to fit this restaurant inside. 

I ordered the New York Steak medium rare and I didn't order any wine that night I just had a cranberry juice. To be honestly truthful I thought that everything was okay... I wasn't crazy about it and it wasn't that special to begin with.  However, with that said, I did really enjoy the salad! Anything with candied nuts has me sold! It was like any other Keg but in this beautiful historic mansion.

On that note I only recommend coming to this place for the experience and atmosphere.. other than that I would definitely go somewhere else for some steak... maybe in Alberta! Mmmmm.. 

- CL"}
{"text":"Steak here was great, in terms of portion size; it'll fill you up. For the Appetizer I'd recommend the French onion soup, it was delicious. Only bad thing was that the waiter brought out the wrong side with the steak, no big deal though as I wanted the rice but the mashed potatoes were great. In total I'd give it 9 steaks out of 10."}
{"text":"4 stars for both service, and food @ this particular spooky location. I had Jason as a server and he is wonderful! Excellent customer service. The food was good."}
{"text":"MEH. 

It is worth coming here for the experience of dining in a cool mansion and the ambiance really is lovely. The main floor has the nicer dining area and the upstairs bar and lounge rooms around have a more casual set up.

We turned up on Saturday night, you're not allowed to make reservations. We were told it was a 40 min wait for the downstairs dining area otherwise we could head upstairs and eat there. We were seated at a cozy couch actually which was really nice.

The service here is EXCELLENT. I do not fault them for that. Beautiful women beautifully dressed. Very, very friendly and accommodating and helpful.

The food is where it falls short for me. It's a typical steakhouse/Keg menu. The food is just terribly prepared and uninspiring. If you are a picky eater man then you will not find fault, but if you are looking for real cooking then there is none to be found here. My filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare, as requested, but the bacon it came wrapped in was soggy and gross. The side of vegetables were equally disgusting. Asparagus (completely not in season) was overcooked and they didn't even break off the chewy fibrous stems. Any cook should know how to do that. 

I'd still go back as it's a lovely mansion, but the food is not desirable to me."}
{"text":"Tuna tartare was amazing! 
My baseball steak is always out of this world.
It's funny a chain can be so impressive but it just is!
Great wine too."}
{"text":"I love The Keg. Anyone who claims s/he doesn't is lying. How can you not love a restaurant that consistently serves delicious, perfectly cooked aged beef while treating you like a king/queen for a reasonable price?

Beyond the usual great food the Keg usually serves (my Classic New York dinner was so good, i actually cleaned my plate of the 12oz of beef, mushroom, beans, and mashed potatoes), what is so great about this location is that it is reminiscent of your traditional steakhouse with the dark ambiance and rich decor..you'd have no idea that it was a chain steakhouse. 

I'm not a huge fan of how dark it is inside, nor do I like the fact that it's really difficult to get reservations here, but at least you always have the lounge. 

And, as usual, service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Usually I will choose this location for special events, and father's day is one. We made a reservation online for 715pm, but they were able to accommodate us to have the table 30 mins earlier. We ordered (1) Teriyaki steak cooked med. rare w/ side of mash, (2) Sirloin cooked med. rare w/ lobster tails, (3) top sirloin cooked med. well w/ side of mash, (4) french onion soup, (5) fried calamari, and (6) Dark n Stormy for myself.

FOOD:
(1) though the steak was cooked perfectly, it was quite chewy and not as tender as I thought it should be. The mash was delicious, very buttery and creamy. It also has little bits of potato chunks in it.

(2) my mother's sirloin was a bit overcooked to be called medium rare. She was a little disappointed as it made her steak less tender. The lobsters were cooked really well and mother enjoyed that more.

(3) my father's steak was, surprisingly, the only one that was cooked accordingly. 

(4) so much onions and croutons underneath that cheesy shell. The soup was very delicious, right amount of salt and flavor. 

(5) nothing out standing of the calamari except maybe the batter did stick to the calamari? 

(6) the cocktail was yummy, equal balance of the ginger beer and rum."}
{"text":"The Keg aka Mansion is a place I must visit every time I'm in Toronto. I love the atmosphere here and the food is amazing and not badly priced either! I especially love their dessert selections if you ever get a chance to eat here you must ask for their popular ice cream dessert dish, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ding-dong!

What's that bell? Yes you guessed it: it is the bell for supper.

Eating at the Keg Mansion makes you feel like a sports athelete or the president of the united states of America. I had the twice boiled top steak served with the twice baked brown potato and some slices of double-baked sourdough loaf a few pints of triple-poured Coors Light and I have two words for all you:  delicious.

The Keg Mansion's motto is \"Supper Is King\" and you can be sure that it's the case: the steaks and chops and lettuce salads and chickens should come wearing crowns. The bathrooms are clean and the place also might be haunted by an ghost."}
{"text":"Nice place, mediocre service at best and the food was not good for a steak house.  I've been to a hundred steak houses across the US and Canada and this ranks among others that I'll forget about.  It's really too bad because with the location and venue this could be a really special place.  As it stands, meh."}
{"text":"Pulling up outside gives you the feel of a mysterious mansion. We had salads along with the Blue Cheese crusted & bacon wrapped filet mignon. They were delightful. 
We sat in the middle room and the ambience was great. A bit of a chill in the air from the supposed ghosts....if you believe in them.
The upstairs bar area as a great ambience about it. Very cool rooms and fun to look around. Rumor has it that there are multiple ghosts.
I suggest you have some food and drinks and check the place out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I'm making every date take me here. The upstairs is perfect. Great food. The prime rib and tuna tacos are excellent. I'm craving their mashed potatoes right now.
Bottles of wine are appropriately priced and the Keg Caesars are the best way to start a night. Extra spicy, extra beans. 
I also felt a random chill that I'm hoping was a ghost as the place is notoriously haunted.
My only issue is they don't take reservations on weekends so Saturday night dinners are always a crapshoot."}
{"text":"Why has no one mentioned that this place is HAUNTED? I've heard quite a few entertaining stories from friends of friends, and there's a little brochure you can pick up in the front entrance to learn all about the dead little children who apparently haunt the place. I haven't had any encounters yet, but who doesn't love an old-fashioned haunted house?

Besides the whole ghost thing, the Keg Mansion is great. I love love love a cozy atmosphere, and the Keg has that down pat. It may be a chain restaurant, and this location may be pricier than most, but I am all for it as long as I get to sit in an awesome antique chair in a haunted house.

Expect to spend upwards of $30-40/person for a full meal (app/main/dessert), not including wine. It's a steak and lobster kind of place that doesn't stray too far from your basic meat and potatoes. But yeah, it is the kind of place you go for a special night out if you don't feel like taking a risk on some trendy new King Street restaurant. The Keg Mansion is tried and true, which is probably why the ghosts stick around."}
{"text":"Food was good but not amazing like any other Keg. But the ambiance was nice and the service was good. If you want a steak it's a decent option for the price."}
{"text":"Very Nice Location! Family environment, waitresses are great. Just because they made a mistake on my order (my Dessert) was on the house.;)"}
{"text":"Of all the Kegs this is THE best one. Steaks are always spot on and service always excellent. 
I don't live close by but the reason we keep coming back is for the very fact that the steaks are so well cooked. 

Let's start with well no pun intended the starters. 
The tuna tartare on avocado is ok. The ahi tuna is fresh as well as the avocado, however it's lacking in some flavour. The tuna and avocado are both bland to begin with so a bit more acidity or soya sauce or perhaps wasabi is required to provide it that little kick. The tuna taco on the other hand is a bit on the spicy side covering the beautiful tuna. 
The onion soup here is the best of all of the other Kegs as its not too salty and just cheesy enough. 
The Caesar salads are excellent 
The escargot with mushroom caps baked with cheese and spices come with some bread and the flavours are fairly well balanced. 

On to mains. As I said all the steaks are spot on. We were told by the manager that there is one cook on the grill with roughly 20 steaks on at one time. He/she (I'm not sure) is able to keep all the orders straight always! I was so impressed. Some cooks can't even manage 2 or 3 and get it right. 
Now this is a steakhouse so we really haven't had many other mains but on 2 other occasions we did order the black cod and the bass those were also cooked well not dry or over done. 

As for desserts we're usually too full to get there, but I'll up date you Yelpers when I do manage to get there

The missing star is if I could only make reservations on weekends"}
{"text":"Yum.  Great ambiance.  Good food.  Great drinks. What more do you want from a steakhouse?  Packed on weekends. Expect a wait after 7."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful building. We came here for our first Wedding Anniversary and had a lovely evening. The food was delicious, the staff very attentive and welcoming and we couldn't fault anything at all. The only thing I had a problem with was reading the menu , not only had I forgotten to bring my reading glasses but also the lighting was just that little bit too low, lol. Apart from that, everything was first class and I would recommend The Mansion to anyone. We shall be returning during December when our relatives visit from England."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here!  My family and I came to the end of our wonderful vacation in Toronto here at the Keg Mansion.  I know the Keg Steakhouses are a chain, but this location at the Mansion is absolutely beautiful!  

I had the 7 oz filet with Bernadine sauce and a twice baked potato.  It was seared perfectly!  There was also some roasted red pepper and green beans, delicious!  My husband had the bone in rib steak, so savory, with garlic mashed potatoes-really great flavor without being over powering.  Both of our children had the Keg Cheeseburger with their favorite toppings, each served with a side of fries, they loved them!  

We all shared the brownie sundae, Billy Miner Pie, and creme brûlée.  All were really good, but my favorite was the Billy Miner Pie, it was amazing!!!!  It reminded me of the Hula Pie we've had in Maui, but with almonds instead of Macadamia nuts.

The staff was so very attentive.  Service was absolutely well done!  I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"An awesome delicious grilled steak begins with an awesome delicious steak! It's all about marbling and age. To be honest, I am not a fan of going to a steak house. I prefer buying a nice cut of meat and grilling it at home. For the same price, I feel I can buy a better cut of meat! My friends ordered the Seafood Sirloin (Grilled top sirloin with garlic sautéed scallops and Black Tiger shrimp, topped with a seafood velouté sauce (8 oz) $27.95), and Sirloin Oscar (Grilled top sirloin topped with shrimp, scallops, asparagus and Béarnaise sauce (8 oz) $27.95). I ordered the Keg Caesar with Grilled Top Sirloin ((8 oz) $20.95).

While I cannot attest to the food, the decor was beautiful. The stained glass window add a very rustic feel to the atmosphere. The plating was a little sloppy. The steak was not juicy or tender enough for me. The other girls actually said they liked their seafood more than the steak and may go back just for seafood in the future. Sorry Keg, I think chains such as Le Bifthèque, Canyon Creek or Bâton Rouge have better steak than you! :( All in all, I had a great time! You can buy good steak but you can't buy good friends!"}
{"text":"The Keg is always good but never great.  If you want to go out and have fun, enjoy a good steak, and very reasonably priced drinks and wine, then this is your place.  The Mansion is so cool, ask the server about the history, dinner and a lesson.  

If you are all about high end beef, this place is not for you.  The steaks are good at best - most people never really ever get to enjoy a high end steak.  Take your time, enjoy the cocktail menu, you will have fun.

If you enjoy a spicy Bloody Caesar this is your place.  I think they are the last place that still uses Mott's Clamato juice from the jug.  It seems most places are now using low end fake clam cocktail from the gun."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. I am from Chicago and nothing there comes close to this experience. The food is amazing, perfectly cooked and served in 15 minutes. The service was impeccable. They were out of the vodka we ordered so they provided desert at no charge. Wow just wow! Please give this restaurant a try, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"First time at The Keg (long overdue!) and definitely exceeded my expectations... the mansion itself is unbelievable, it has a really cool vibe to it. The service is EXCELLENT and so is the food.
It was a Saturday so it was pretty crowded and we had to wait about an hour to be seated so we headed to the bar upstairs and had a Caesar and a beer. There were a couple of people having their meal at the bar too. 
We got a crappy table, in the far end at the corner, but our server was always checking in on us.
I had the prime rib and my boyfriend had the ball cap steak. The quality of the meat is unbelievable, it just melted in your mouth. I had heard great things about the garlic mashed potatoes but found it just ok. 
It was a great experience and definitely on the list for future special occasions."}
{"text":"I went to the Keg Mansion last Monday night with my son and his gf. Since I'm not from Toronto, I suggested we go out to dinner before I left. We chose the Keg Mansion, and none of us have any regrets. The food was excellent(!!), the service was absolutely wonderful (though unfortunately I've forgotten the waiter's name now), and the atmosphere was splendid. My son tends to be particular about his steak, but his was cooked exactly as he'd ordered it, to perfection.

If I had one negative thing to mention, it would be the noise level...we were in a small room on the main floor and the conversations became quite loud. (Why do people insist on almost shouting to talk when the person is sitting right next to them? Maybe it's the alcohol kicking in.) However, everything else more than made up for this, so I've rated this restaurant with five stars. And even though I'm vegetarian (and it is a steak house) I was still able to find wonderful food on the menu. 

We didn't get a chance to see or hear any ghosts (for those who don't know, it's reportedly haunted, with many people experiencing strange things), though I'd love to go back some time and try to find them. ;o) Next time I'm in Toronto, the Keg Mansion will definitely be on my must-go-to list again. I've also marked this restaurant as 'dressy' attire, which would match the atmosphere; however, you can also dine there in quite casual attire if you wish."}
{"text":"The steak was perfection, I couldn't of asked for a better piece of meat.  It was like giving cunnilingis to heaven."}
{"text":"Great food.  Though there are no reservations on Saturday and the wait time was 2 hours. Food took 45 mins to arrive. I guess it was really busy there. The parking was too tight ."}
{"text":"I Love going the Keg and have always wanted to visit the supposedly haunted Keg Mansion. I was treated to a Birthday dinner with my family on a Sunday night. We had made reservations for 6:30pm and the place was pretty full that evening.

The hostess kindly greeted us at the entrance and took us over to our table in the grand main dining room at a large round dark wood table with plush leather backed chairs. When we arrived at our table the hostess asked what we were celebrating tonight and I said my birthday and she handed me a birthday card signed from the keg wishing me a happy birthday. I thought that was a really nice touch.

Our waitress came over to greet us and also wished me a happy birthday and took drink orders and went over the specials for the day.

I absolutely love the fresh baked warm and chewy bread that the Keg always delivers but we also wanted to order an appetizer to nibble on.

Baked Goat Cheese - Warm goat cheese coated in crushed almonds, with tomato basil salsa
I absolutely Love goat cheese so this was a definite delight. The miniature crunchy buttery toast were also equally delicious. We quickly ran out of toasts but our waitress offered to bring us some more which we all greatly appreciated.

For my main I definitely knew I wanted a sirloin but I wanted to try a little something extra special

Pecan Sirloin - Grilled top sirloin, basted and coated in chopped pecans. Topped with crumbled goat cheese. 
Cooked perfectly medium rare topped with ample amounts of toasted pecan pieces and a huge chunk of creamy goat cheese. I was able to slather every bite with cheese and pecans. Extremely decadent and delicious.

Finally for dessert our waitress surprised me with a complimentary dessert topped with a sparkler.

Billy Miner Pie - Mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds.
My absolute favourite dessert at the keg! A hugee wedge of mocha ice cream drenched in hot fudge with toasted sliced almonds. Creamy, crunchy, chocolatey, best way to end any meal!

Overall a wonderful Birthday Dinner. Definitely call ahead and make reservations and if you are celebrating a Birthday or special occasion let the hostess know when you are making reservations and they will definitely make it a memorable experience! 

FYI Ample Free parking after 4pm out front surrounding the Mansion"}
