{"text":"Unfortunately Chester's is gone.  Too bad, as we always had a great meal there.  Pulled up to the door and saw the sign closed forever.  Really sorry to see as I can not stand to go to the chains.  Was a really great restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in Painesville. Food is amazing, the place is clean and the staff is really nice. I have eaten here multiple times and never been disappointed. The seafood is my favorite so give it a try."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Thursday night. They were as busy as they could get. Sat at the bar waiting for a table and decided to just eat at the bar. The bartender was awesome, friendly and poured a great drink. The food came out quick, salad with homemade drsg and fresh vegetables. We had pasta with a Cajun Whiskey cream sauce and it was nothing less than perfection.  Very friendly atmosphere, upscale food for a great price. Loved it, will be back soon."}
