{"text":"I'm totally surprised that many people dislike this restaurant. But I've never had dimsum there, and always had dinner there.

Dinner is great there. The food is prepared well, very tasty and the ingredients are fresh. And best of all, the price is fantastic.

We can have a family dinner there, order 10 dishes, including lobster, peking duck and fish, and the total comes to under $200.

Each dish is very good, there's are not very many dishes that are considered bad. Veggie dishes are cooked to perfection. For example, its easy to overcook snow pea leafs or have it stringy. But not only do they cook it to perfection, they add abalone mushrooms. Terrific.

The duck may not be as good as say Chung King, but every other dish outshines that restaurant.

Overall, it's great value for great food."}
{"text":"I would give it zero if I could.  I don't know why people flocked to this place, we went on a few occassions and the food was subpar.  The service was absolutely horrible.  They made a mistake, made us wait an hour for our dish and never apologized.  Good riddance to bad place!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for dim sum on Sunday. The line-up wasn't that bad as we waited for about 10 minutes.

I would say overall the dishes were good. We ordered: Har Gow, Siu Mai, Chicken feet, deep fried crab meat with shrimp, and sweet pork buns, and a couple of dishes that I don't know the names for.

Overall, I would say it is good. The prices were reasonable, service was ok, and the decor was comforting. The food was good but nothing amazing. However, I should say their chicken feets were pretty good compared other good dim sum places.

I will go back for another dim sum if I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place appears very clean.  Their staff was there when you needed anything without hovering.  I didn't witness any thumbs in the food when the trolley pushers served the food.  

I tried their chicken feet in black bean sauce, traditional shrimp dumpling aka ha kow in Cantonese, pork dumpling aka siu mai in Cantonese, Chinese donut sticks wrapped in rice roll aka cha lerng served with a peanut & hoisin sauce (surprisingly, this sauce was not straight from the bottle, it was actually \"treated\" so that it was not over-powering), and baby beef spare ribs in black bean sauce.  I found the ha how and siu mai very average, meaning I couldn't taste a difference between theirs' and other restaurants.  Their cha lerng was really nice, the added touch with the sauces made an immense difference.  I guess it's the same way a good dressing can make such a difference on plain old salad or how a jar of pasta sauce is compared to the home made tasty versions.  Their chicken feet were perfectly done.  I find that sometimes these get over-steamed and the meat just falls right off the bones and they lack the texture.  These ones were done perfectly, much like pasta al dente versus pasta when you walk away and get carried away in conversation.

The thing that pleased me the most was the bill.  As with most dim sum restaurants, the prices are lower for early risers.  Their prices were unbelievable though.  I dine with my tween daughter for about $30 (tip not included) in Chinatown at the early riser price.  When I ate here, my sister, daughter and I dined for $34 (tip included).  My sister does not have the figure of a big eater but let's just say that if she had normal metabolism, she'd look more like Mario Batalli.  So, needless to say, I recommended my best friendto trek it up here and try the food...as I would recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best place in the GTA for sit-down dim sum.  The reasoning is simple:

1. Clean -- strange for a dim sum restaurant, no?
2. Fresh -- when it's busy, sometimes the dish you want gets snagged up before they get to your table, there's not too much stuff that's been making the rounds
3. Affordable -- $2.50 a dish on the weekend, specials throughout the week and non-prime hours
4. Tasty! -- it's dim sum, so lots of sodium, grease, and MSG.  The holy trinity of ingredients!
5. It can get pretty busy during prime time, but they wait times aren't too bad

Great spot for dim sum, a potential UYE location in the future!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good dimsum restaurant, Honey & Garlic is the place to go. It's the sister restaurant to the one at Market Village (i believe it's called Green Onion or something).  This place is always busy on the weekend, so e prepared to wait. The good thing or some may say the not so good thing) is that most of the seating are booth seats.  The restaurant isn't that big, I don't think there are more than 50 tables, and probably 75% of the seats are booths.  

Another great thing about this dimsum place is that they have the traditional carts. I love the carts.  For those who dont know, the food comes on carts and the ladies (always ladies) pulling the cart scream out what items they have. If you do not speak chinese (like me), just look inquisitively at the cart and inquire in English what they have. They are usually good at explaining (\"beef\", \"chicken\" rice).  

This is hands down one of the best Dim Sum restaurants in Toronto. If you are there after 12, get the Thai fried rice! I eat thai all the time and this is the best fried rice thai style that I've ever tasted!! At a chinese restaurant, go figure. Their sponge cake and tapioca pudding is also recommended.

If you go between specific hours they actualy have specials, where all items are a flat rate (regardless of the size of the dish).  I'll have to consult with my mom on the details...

 Worth the drive, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Not the best dim sum I've had, but they are clean and have a good variety.  Lacking in taste, they make up in service."}
{"text":"On my second visit to Honey & Garlic I was very disappointed. I don't recommend this place at all to those who aren't of Chinese descent(I felt totally discriminated against) and I'll tell you why: 

1. We came in for dim sum late afternoon on a weekday, and we asked the server as to whether or not dim sum would still be served. She responded that it would, in perfect English.
2. She promptly served us tea without asking first, so while we didn't want any, we just let it slide.
3. We waited approximately 20 minutes for them to bring us (any part of) our order, while the disinterested server was settling a dispute with another customer about how long she also had to wait to get her order. The customer, with a wailing baby, had been waiting for 45 minutes and no sign of her 1st order. 
4. The food was decent, as it was on my first visit. No surprises there. 
5. The we waited a very long time for the bill, and after being ignored for a long time we got up and approached our server to pay.
6. She scribbles a bunch of numbers on a bill, and the total turns out to be several dollars more than expected. I inquire, and she responds that tea is $3, (I never requested it), and apparently tax in this restaurant is 20%?!
7. She does a retotal and the tax on the bill is still 20%(I wonder if the CRA is even going to see a penny). I can do math, but I was too annoyed at her sudden inability to speak a single word of English, we paid and left in a huff. 

I may not understand how this restaurant operates, but in the real world tax is 13% and if a server doesn't take my order, I don't pay for it.

If you are not looking for a masochistic dining experience and want dim sum *with* quality service I would go down the street to Golden Regency (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/golden-regency-restaurant-markham) or even to Thornhill for Best Dragon (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/best-dragon-seafood-restaurant-vaughan).

Never again, Honey."}
{"text":"For the non-dim-sum crowd this restaurant also has very good dinner items. This is an \"order a bunch of dishes for a large group and share\" kind of place.   I've been here with family several times and have not been disappointed. Start with the house soup that comes in a large bowl and spooned into bowls by the waiter. Try the sweet and sour pork chops topped with sesame seeds or any number of the stir-fry meat with veggie dishes. Finish it off with the sweet desert sesame \"soup\"  which is served warm. 

Located in a small shopping mall/plaza, a few doors down from a Shoppers Drug Mart, there's plenty of free parking.  Inside the restaurant is nicely appointed with a small booth tables for 4 and a large enclosed large table area.

Be advised that on weekend evenings it's quite busy. As well you'd best bring someone who speaks Cantonese or Mandarin. Finally the place is very clean by Chinese standards or quite accetable by Western standards. I haven't used the washroom (the litmus test for Chinese restaurant cleanliness) and if you don't have to I recommend against it."}
{"text":"One of our Dim Sum staples.

Disclaimer: since I didn't grow up eating Dim Sum, my wife has slowly introduced me to most of the dishes available at the average Dim Sum place, so my standards may be different than others.

Now to the review: While there are places that do Dim Sum better, Honey & Garlic is clean, has good food, and is welcoming to \"western\" clientele, which can't always be said about other places. So, the top reasons why this place gets 4 stars: 
1) BBQ Pork Buns are saucy and tasty (Like I said, I'm new to Dim Sum)
2) Flaky crust Egg Tarts - Pretty good filling too.
3) Good Tentacles (one of the few places I will get tentacles happily)
4) Clean!

So, why only 4?  Well, it isn't the best Dim Sum I've had, and it is a cart Dim Sum place first and foremost.  Yeah, yeah, I can appreciate it is part of the experience and I can always ask, but man do I hate waiting for the good stuff while I see chicken feet pass for the umpteenth time (Yes, I have had Chicken feet, and no, they aren't good), and I never see any waiters to order directly.

Regardless, I'd highly recommended Honey & Garlic to any one looking for Dim Sum in the GTA."}
{"text":"compared to Ginger & Onion I think Honey & Garlic is better.  Most of the ppl working there is nice.  Food is ok, but based on the price, u really can't ask for anything more.  Esp most of the food is same price, so I think worth to give it a try.  Also they have quite alot of dessert to choose, that's y I like to go there."}
{"text":"Want to eat at the cleanest chinese restaurant ever?!? This place is not only clean, but the dishes come in large portions and tasty as ever!

I've had so many things here, from wintermelon soup to a 12 lb Lobster to King Crab. 

Price is a little high, but we eat here only on special occasions. 

You know the place is doing well though when its constantly busy, and instead of using styrofoam takeout containers, they give you plastic re-heatable containers."}
{"text":"Great place for Dim Sum! The price is great and the dim sums are tasty!

I like when they pushed the carts around and you can order whatever you fancy..and you can phased yourself instead having everything arriving on your table when you go to those that are steamed to order.

Even if you wait and wait and your favourite dim sums still does not arrive, you can ask the waiter to go and get them for you from the kitchen...

For dinner, my husband always go with his friends on Saturday night. I cannot comment on that since I never got to go!! Anyway, he told me it is best if you have a table of 10 and order from their special menu."}
{"text":"Honey and Garlic is one of my favorite dim sum place in the Markham area. I absolutely love the decor and the lighting. I don't remember if it was a weekend but they have people pushing carts of dim sum. So you can see what you're ordering. We had a few special requests and our waiter promptly brought us our dishes from the kitchen. I can't complain much with such service. The food was tasty and fresh - I don't have any favorites but I was happy with what I ordered. Definitely check this out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I brought my niece here yesterday.  She loves good food so clearly she takes after me.  We arrived around 2 p.m. on a Tuesday so I did not expect a line up but indeed there was one.  I decided to wait none the less.

It was worth the drive and the wait.  Congee with pork and the weird looking black eggs, fried radish cake, vegetarian rice rolls, soft tofu in sweet syrup, crispy deep fried wontons, spare ribs that look juicy and greasy but not too greasy.  My niece wondered what the green chopsticks in the middle of the table were for, it's there for a more sanitary dim sum experience!  Bring the food to your plate with the green chopsticks. 

Many dim sum places lack vegetarian options, not this one.  That's why I brave the lines and keep going back.  Oh yes, and the price is $1.90 per item after 2 p.m. on weekdays.  I can eat like a queen at those prices."}
{"text":"I admit restaurant looks really nice and popular. I probably would have been a fan, but did not know what dishes to order. We did not come for dim sum (maybe next time) and ordered some shared dishes with rice.

Atmosphere is nice and it is close to Pacific Mall!"}
