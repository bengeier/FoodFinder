{"text":"The portions are very generous - there is definitely enough to take home for a second dinner."}
{"text":"This is my very first review on Yelp. I'm been an active user and decided to share my secret favorite place - Eden's Grill.

Looking for the finest Mediterranean food in the valley?  Eden's Grill is the place to go. Consider the Gyros, Chicken and Beef Kebab combination for two.  It's our favorite dish, since it allows us to have it all. Did I mention the rice? Covered in golden raisins and almonds- WOW. 

Ended the evening Nehren's Wedding Cake for dessert. I dislike cake, but I'm still thinking about how good it was. Try it."}
{"text":"This review is purely based on service because we didn't get a chance to try the food... If there was a negative one star, that is what they should get.

My husband and I wanted to try something new. We found Eden's grill on yelp and thought we'll give it a shot.

We walked in and stood in the lack of space for about 2 mins. NO ONE acknowledged us so we decided to grab a seat. 

It gets even worst, we sat down for 5 mins and still nothing. No water or even noticed that a customer walked in. Servers were in the dining room so I can't see why at least one person couldn't have said hi.

We walked out and will not be back."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD. Amazing vegetarian dishes. The only problem is, the service is HORRIBLE. The owner is the rudest woman I have ever met. I have seen her yell \"Get out, we're all full,\" while spinning her finger at a customer. She just told my Aunt to get out of her seat in a rude manner so she could push two tables together. She made us wait for a group to leave so we could use their two tables to sit at. They kept sitting their so finally ten minutes later she pushed tables together for us. F off lady"}
{"text":"Okay, so the service is spotty. If it's the old man, fuggedaboutit. You're not going to get served forever and you're gonna be frustrated. If it's the daughter, you're in luck. She runs the room like a pro. So, why five stars?

Because the food is spot on incredible, and their rice is the best carb-load in town. We get the number two combo platter to go (our two young girls make it difficult to eat out). We skip the questionable service and come home with enough food for at least four meals. 

I can't recommend the food here highly enough. The service, well, not so much.

Oh, and get a slice of the daughter's wedding cake. It's just the tool to get you off of the Atkins wagon."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fantastic food and large portions. BEST rice EVER!! Mom is cooking up the most wonderful food. Love the entire family and the service.
~Kristi & Chris"}
{"text":"Excellent food.
Huge portions.
Great prices. 

My husband and I have come here multiple times. The food is the best authentic Mediterranean food we've found in Phoenix. 
Plus the girls mom is in the back doing the cooking. There's just a sweet charm about that.

The waitresses are personable and usually remember a familiar face. They speak to each other in their native tongue, which adds to the ambience.

The rice and gyro platter is out of this world. So delicious! 

Spanakopita for dessert is a must."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service! This nice cozy restaurant is family owned and family operated. I recommend this place to anyone in the mood for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Started with baba ganoush. I liked it. Good amount of smoke flavor as expected. Really good kebaps. I had the lamb and chicken combo. The portions are huge. The rice is just amazing. It has almonds and raisins in it. I could just have the rice as a meal. 
I had yoghurt drink. They made it fresh. It wasn't blended well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the lamb & gyros were full of flavor.  Prices very reasonable. Nora, our server, was awesome!  
We came here off yelp reviews and will certainly return."}
{"text":"Fantastic, quality, homemade dishes!  Family owned and always consistently great food!  We go here at least once a week and we have tried all the other mediterranean restaurants in the valley, Eden's Grill is the best!  Plus supporting local businesses is always a plus and this place is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"In a word: delicious! The family that runs this place are always so kind and welcoming. The food is fantastic and there are plenty of options for both carnivores and veg-heads alike. I am totally devoted to their dolma (grape leaves stuffed with rice and spices). Gyros, chicken, veggie patties, and falafel are all equally tasty. The rice is EPIC with delicious almonds and dried fruits - we are picking up a platter for our Thanksgiving feast year. I always feel at home here at Eden's Grill Inn (so much so that the family knows me by name here now!) 

If you're coming in on a Friday or Saturday evening, I recommend calling ahead for a reservation as they aren't a large restaurant. I strongly encourage you to support this wonderful, family-run business."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing in every way, but why the heck is this place in a strip mall? My husband's exact quote after finishing his meal: \"I think this may be the best food I've ever had.\""}
{"text":"The food was really good but a bit overpriced; You do get big portions though.  The service was slow possibly because there were only two servers but it is such a small place that it shouldn't be that hard to male sure drinks are filled when needed.  The rice is amazing!  Love the veggie patty's too!  The servers were very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My family is from Israel and over the years we've enjoyed a lot of fantastic Middle Eastern food. Eden's Grill has some of the BEST in town. Authentic, reasonably priced, and made with love and tradition. I've never had anything there that I didn't like. This one of my favorite places to send people."}
{"text":"Love Eden's Grill.  Great basmati rice, all yellow which I'm hoping is ghee.  (unfortunately, I found out from the owner that it is saffron rice with \"vegetable oil\".  This usually means \"soybean oil'.  Since soybean it probably the cheapest and worst oil to use (endrine disruptor), that really makes me not want to frequent the place that often.) 

The steak kabobs are awesome, seasoned with some herbs and not totally garlicy or spicy.  

Very small place and hard to find in the corner of a shopping center (ACE Hardware) but well worth the trip.  The lunch portions are smaller and cheaper so get there before 4.  One day I was running really late and they had changed to dinner.  Wow, much bigger servings but of course, I ate it all!"}
{"text":"The food here is simply amazing. A little pricier than most Mediterranean restaurants but it is well worth it! The flatbread appetizer with feta cheese was great. The gyro and lamb dinner was fantastic and I couldn't believe that they actually grill the vegetables on skewers and the portions are quite generous. Definitely will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced, but very good food and very good service! They are really friendly there, and the food is delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"The food is  pretty good, but I would suggest you get it to go for two reasons:

1) the place is a dump. It's the kind of dump that I think the owners actually think it's fancy and classy. Their is a chiropractor a couple of doors away that would make a more inviting restaurant. 

2) They made me feel like I was interrupting their business. The owner or manager was sitting at a table with a pile of bills yelling about how they charge too little and the bills are too high. 

Like I said the food is good but with these other things going on in the front of the house, it makes me wonder what is going on in the back. 

Perhaps two stars is a little rough but with all the other glowing reviews of the place I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. My wife and I have been eating at Eden's Grill for the last four year with enough regularity that we now know the owner.  We think the food is wonderful. We typically get gyro meat and chicken kebabs either on a salad or as an entr√©e. The gyro meat is unbelievably flavorful and always tender.  The Moroccan chicken entree is also very good --- the menu says spicy, but that refers only to the use of lots of fragrant spices.  The portions are large and always leave enough for a meal the next day.  We have brought friends and relatives and never had a complaint. Visit this local favorite now!"}
{"text":"We've never left without a 'dogie bag'. Portions are overwhelming.  Best rice in town.  Never been disappointed.  Need to get back soon."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is amazing! So delicious. Portions are really big so it's nice to get a few things and share. Owners are so nice, can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Arizona - hands down.  Best rice.  Best falafel.  Best veggie patties.  Best gyros.  Oh, best dolmas.  Did I mention best hummus?  Seriously - it does not get any better than this.  Awesome family owned business where a sense of pride and customer service still show, to boot. Gigantic portions and fast service.  Oh, and by the way, the food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"There is huge difference between a franchised or chain restaurant run by accountants and a restaurant run by a family focused on quality food. 

Eden's Grill definitely takes a lot of pride in preparing and serving some of the freshest and finest Mediterranean cuisine in the Valley.

The prices are reasonable with the best value, of course, at lunch time.

I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Eden's Grill is absolutely delicious! My first time visiting was a couple of years ago and I had forgotten how good the food was. I returned last night with a group of 10. We had a table waiting for us, the service was great, the appetizers & entrees were very tasty with lots of flavor and the homemade desserts were delish!! Our server, she was on it and funny! Everyone with me, all 10 loved their entree and commented on how flavorful the food was. I am definitely returning every chance I get! I am picky for food so I highly recommend Eden's Grill!!!"}
{"text":"Easily 5 stars! Fantastic food and we had a nice and even funny waitress. Recommended! Just one thing, we showed up on a Friday night and it was full. So if you have a bigger party I recommend a reservation. I will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Lizzie Lemon and me just left Eden's Garden. (So, its DP writing the review on Lemons computer and yelp account). In keeping with my rule of only reviewing if I feel that a place is a 1 or a 5, I'm pleased to give this place a 5.

First, Nora was fantastic. She is kind and funny, but mostly, it's so neat to see how proud she is of her family and their restaurant.  She's proud for good reason. Food is truly great and very reasonable. We stared with the potato cake and it was awesome. Nora brought the legit hot sauce which went perfect with the cucumber sauce on the potato cake. Then we had a giant platter of gyros, lamb and chicken kabob.... Ridiculous. The platter was accompanied by a big plate of rice with fresh raisins.  Normally I'd think I wouldn't like sweet raisins with my rice, but it was terrific.

Couple of cocktails and great company. Can't say enough about this little family owned spot. Great job. We look forward to being regulars!"}
{"text":"We had gyros and fries that tasted great! Dinner was very expensive compared to the lunch prices, but the portion was large. I would recommend the yummy food, but go for lunch for the lower prices:-)"}
{"text":"They put out quite a spread! I eat traditional Lebanese food often and was impressed."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with 5 other friends celebrating P's birthday. We shared the falafel and hummus. The hummus was okay, a little too watery for me, but the falafel was good. For the entree we shared rice and 2 huge platters of grilled meat--an assortment of gyros, lamb, beef, and chicken. The meats were pretty good and there was tzatziki and yogurt sauce on the side. The rice was outstanding. The rice was seasoned with cinammon and other spices and had golden raisins and toasted nuts.  Yummy.

Total bill for 6 people (including soft drinks and tax) was $98."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Portions are large (even on the lunch menu).  Lunch special is a ton of food at a very good price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  They had the best chicken kebobs and fatosh salad around. The service was amazing. Will be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"The waitress was outgoing, friendly and very helpful. The food was served quickly and was quite tasty. Overall a great value for the money. I will be back..."}
{"text":"The food was very good, staff was friendly. Huge portions."}
{"text":"Wonderful food esp the golden rice with raisins!!! Their babagoush is to die for!!  A bit small sized, but never had to really wait. Have been many times and will be going again."}
{"text":"We love Eden's Grill!  It's family owned and everything is prepared by the owner who uses family recipes she brought from Iraq. The portions are generous and perfectly prepared. The kebabs are delicious and the rice is to die for!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's family run.  The food is fantastic.  Lunch specials are priced really well and the portions are big.  I get two meals out of it for under $10.00!  \"Mom's Rice\" is to die for."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch and wow!   It was great on all levels.  Service was excellent, delicious, and hot when it was received.  I had the falafel wrap with a side of fries.   I could not believe how wonderfully good they were.  Best fries in Phoenix.  Falafels were tasty and crisp.   Usually when I get this wrap, it comes with 2-3 falafels.   I think I had 5-6 on my wrap.  My friend had a gyro wrap and side Greek salad.  She said it was the best she had.   I loved the cleanliness and ambience.   Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"I have to say, I really enjoyed having dinner here the other night. My girlfriends and I wanted to hit up somewhere close to home for some good food and drink. We did not expect our evening to be so enjoyable, tasty, and fullfilling. We enjoyed a bottle of wine, some apps, salad, and wedding cake!! The portions were generous and full of flavor. Come to find out, this place has been here for 25 years. The 2 sisters were our servers, super friendly, and their Mom was the cook, super quick!  Hard pass up on showing appreciation to a great family owned business!!!!"}
{"text":"Best gyro in town! We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often. I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed. Service is great and they always take good care of us."}
{"text":"First time customer and ordered take out. I ordered three meals and a side salad. The take out bag must have weighed four pounds! Each meal came with rice, easily half of the to-go container was packed with the saffron(?) rice. The food was tasty. I would return to try different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Although I love the food at Eden's Grill, I can't eat there any longer. 

Recently I met a friend there for a late lunch. We had just finished up and were deciding on desert when 3 women accompanied by three young children came in. 

The kids ran up and down the aisles yelling loudly.  None of the women made any attempt to control them.  When the kids started going in and out of the entrance door, the owner came out of the back and asked them to stop because the door was heavy and she didn't want them to catch their fingers - an injury that might make the restaurant liable.  Other than that, she stayed in the back rather than ask the women to control their children 

Those unruly kids ruined our lunch - which cost us around $40.  We couldn't even hear ourselves speaking and wound up leaving earlier than we would have otherwise. Obviously the owner cared enough to speak up when it concerned liability for her business but not when her customers were being inconvenienced."}
{"text":"Love this family owned little restaurant.   The lamb and rice dishes are amazing and now they have so much better wines than they used to.    We make it a point to visit every time we are in the area and sit at our special table outside and pretend we are in a Mediterranean plaza...   (It actually over looks a car park but with all the smells of the cooking and a glass of wine, it can transport you!)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I checked out Eden's Grill last night on the recommendation of fellow Yelpers.  Don't let the location fool you -- this place is EXCELLENT!

We stopped in about an hour before they closed. The server was so friendly and sweet and we were promptly seated. The table next to us was very chatty and friendly as well. 

We started off with the potato cakes which were the perfect portion for an appetizer and were very good. 

The boyfriend ordered the Adam and Eve and I ordered the kefta and chicken.  Both were superb. I don't know what the chicken was marinated in, but was so juicy and flavorful; it tasted entirely different than any other Greek Kabob I've had. I also tried some of the beef kabob and would highly recommend that as well.  My other kabob was the kefta and I'll be honest-- it wasn't my favorite, but that's what I get for trying something new. 

Both plates came with rice with white raisins and slivered almonds.  On top of the rice was marinated grilled vegetables. I could've eaten a plate of that alone! Be forewarned that when you come here, the portions are HUGE. We easily could've split a plate, although we'd have been fighting over the chicken!"}
{"text":"Generous portions of home cooked Middle Eastern food. Very gracious service in a family run restaurant. What a nice surprise for a bunch of conventioneers visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"OK after hearing about this restaurant from a friend I decided to take the family out. First I must say that living in the valley for over 30 years I still and always will be a Haji Baba fan in Tempe Az. for life!(yelp them)

So, walk in and would agree that the ambiance was less than. Dinner tables were cheap and the table cloth was tacky. Oh almost forgot why is there a large mirror on the wall? Were given dinner menus by a impolite waitress who I suspected was surely going to be the owner. The first thing that hit was the prices! $$$ I kindly asked the waitress if I could just have a Gyro sandwich. The answer was NO! (rudely). Those are only available during lunch time! Ok, so next option was to gamble on a gyro plate priced at $14.95. We placed our order and waited. The food arrived on a timely manner. The food was hot and looked good. The tzatziki-sauce was a 10! Although the gyro meat was not to my tasting, it was ok for being real hungry. Eventually the waitress started warming up to us! :) 

PROBABLY WONT RETURN AGAIN.

Pros- Fresh food, Location

Cons-Couldn't get what I really wanted.(A gyro sandwich)

-$$$ pricey! $36 for 2 adults and 2 children. (2 gryo plates and a coke.)

-No kids menu. 

-Water tasted like it was from the tap.

-Coke was flat."}
{"text":"I just went here last night with a group of people. The space is small so if you plan on going with a group, I suggest 6 or less. I had the vegetable soup and the veggie pattys. The soup was ok but from people around the table it sounded like the lentil soup was the way to go. The veggie pattys were absolutley delish and the rice was really good too. The only problem with Eden's is the space in the restaurant, it gets super crowded and, if you're sitting at the end of the table like I was, you get bumped a ton.

A great place for veggie and vegan eaters."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! My boyfriend and I went there in search of big plates with lots of flavor and this place exceeded our expectations. We both had the lamb and beef which was cooked to perfection and seasoned accordingly. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer; DO IT! We had leftovers for the next day which were just as good as the night before. I highly recommend Eden's Grill. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Just to reiterate, this place is fantastic. It's small businesses like Eden's Grill that make neighborhoods. Worth the trip every time. And they cater! Amazing handmade desserts too. Spread the word!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great place to take family. Price is very fair in contrast to their competitors. Iv noticed ALL their food is made from scratch. Recommend it to anyone and the location is very central."}
{"text":"This is a great and delicious resturant.  Nothing bad at all to say about it.  The portions are large and the place sis very welcoming.  It is our dinner plans when we have a low relaxing/lazy night.  

Nora, one of the waitresses, always has a smile and a great attitude.  Also this is a family resturant.  The mother works in the back making all the delicious food that is served to you.  My favorite is the gyro pita, we are always impressed with the food and NEVER dissapointed.  Nora is the best and funniest waitress that I have ever seen.  And with her she has her sister who is helping carry out the buisness.  

Eden's Grill is a small large portioned dinner served with a smile. You will never regret going their, at least I dont! Makesure to goto Eden's Grill!"}
{"text":"As always, great food, excellent service and definitely get your money's worth.

Picked up an order to go for the whole family...couldn't eat it all.

Simple reason why it's been one of my favorite middle eastern restaurant for over 10 years.

Thank you to the Narsa family for the GREAT & Delicious food."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food my husband and I ever ate! It was fresh, flavorful and enormous portions! It is a family run operation which makes the restaurant even more charming! The service was great. My husband asked for fries for our 2 year old daughter and the server told us in a very motherly way \"thats not healthy, she'll eat with you, theres rice and chicken\" (we ordered one of the platters) and she did! I so appreciated that. I was going to tell him that, but she beat me to it. Everything was great from the Hummus, to the lamb kabob, chicken kabob and the gyro meat to the sweet rice and baklava... the baklava is divine!! 

Cannot wait to be back to see Noreen and taste her moms cooking yet again!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Eden's Grill this past summer and I fell in love.  If you like authentic Gyros, flavorful Basmati rice with almonds and raisins, and homemade hummus then this is the place for you.  

It is a quaint, family run place set back in a strip mall.  Portions are large and the owners are very friendly and service oriented.  Don't leave without a piece of the caramel flavored cake!"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. It is a little pricey for lunch though. Gyro salad is huge and fantastic. Staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Authentic middle eastern fare  Gyro special is a great deal at $6.95 I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Disappointing with a capital D. Bland tasteless food. Spicy Moroccan chicken did not have any flavor and Adam & Eve was bland too. Very disappointing, considering the kind of reviews this place has on yelp."}
{"text":"This place is good. Really good. I've lived in the North Phoenix area forever and somehow never even knew this place existed until last night when I was scouring yelp for a new dinner option. It's tucked in the corner of a nondescript strip mall and from the outside looks pretty bland. Inside, it's a nice quaint restaurant with one wall dedicated to all the awards they've won over the year. Our server could tell it was our first time and explained they've been open for 10 years, that he and his sister are the servers and his mom and aunt are the chefs. We ordered a small house salad to split, the adam & eve (beef and chicken kebabs in greek marinade) and the moroccan chicken. Everything was fantastic, especially the rice that comes with the dishes. Portions were HUGE and I can't wait to have my leftovers for dinner again tonight. It wasn't cheap but not terribly expensive either ($15-$20 per entree). We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Always had a great experience. Nothing exciting about dining room but did is always good and send fresh.  Good salad. Great lunch. Friendly service"}
{"text":"A regular at Eden's,  I usually opt for their lunch special.  You get to choose between a veggie patty and a falafel wrap,  along with you choice of rice/salad/fries. 

Their rice is particularly good!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.  I found it on a whim - thank you Yelp - when I was in the neighborhood for a class I take on Tuesday nights.  It is now my go-to place before the class.  The gyro meat is really tasty and I've now gotten the gyro and chicken kebab salad the last two times and the chicken is super good as well.  The rest of the salad is a little meh but the meat is the thing!  I also am not in love with their tzatziki sauce as it's a little thicker than I generally like it but all in all it's a good salad.

I've also had their gyro platter, which was humungous - I think it took me 3 meals to finish it.  Again, the gyro meat is great. As for the rice with the raisins and nuts - it is pretty good but I almost think the idea of it is better than the actual execution.  Does that make sense? I eat it and love it but it's like there's just something missing with it and I'm not sure what it is.  The fragrance is great and, for someone who generally doesn't like raisins, I really like the raisins and nuts in it.

I will keep returning for the tasty meat... I think next time I will just try a pure chicken dish so I can get more of that tasty chicken!"}
{"text":"This is a great gem of a restaurant in a shopping mall.  It got high ratings on yelp and we were not disappointed.  My wife and I got the gyro sandwich lunch special with mom's rice and also an order of Israeli salad.

Everything was delicious.  The sandwiches were heaping with meat and ingredients.  Mom's rice was awesome with a perfect blend of nuts, raisins and flavors.  The Israeli salad was fresh and delicious.

My only regret is I had had my coffee before going there so I already had too much caffeine in me so I did not try the Turkish coffee.  Next time I will know better and will plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The portions are GIGANTIC, service is as friendly as can be, and all around a great dining experience. This is my go-to Greek Restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a terrific dinner for the first time at Eden's Grill tonigh.  The owner was extremely friendly and welcomed us upon stepping inside this quaint restaurant.  She offered us a drink right away and maintained an impressive level of service the entire time. 

We started with the fatoush (sp?) salad which had the most amazing pita chips in it with a flavorful, fresh dressing. We then both ordered the Eden's Grill kabob plate which we loved, but were unable to finish.  The portions are very generous so we took the leftovers home to enjoy for lunch tomorrow.

It seems we are always on a quest for good Mediterranean food here, and we may have just found our go-to spot. 

Welcoming atmosphere, friendly service, fresh and authentic food which I look forward to trying again and again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant, and for so many reasons . . . 

First, it is family owned (always like to support the little independents), and the owners are so nice and friendly (more on that below) . . . 

Secondly, the food is awesome and portions are generous. The hummus is heavenly. The babaganoush is brilliant. The dolmas, delightful. And that's just for starters. 

Here's what tipped the scales way in their favor . . . 

We stopped in on a lark on a Tuesday night to order take-out. Just as we placed our order for the combination appetizer plate and the kefta and chicken combo entree, the wife came out of the kitchen to serve a couple nearby. The scent of the entree as it passed by was perfume to my nose and senses. I asked, \"what was that?\" The owner enthusiastically replied, \"We are serving Passover dinner this week, and that's our brisket.\" \"Oh my, I said. That smelled so incredible.\" The wife of a couple seated next to us said, \"it is the best I have ever had.\" As a Jewish girl, growing up on the best brisket ever made, only by my mother, that was a throwdown for me to try some. The owner asked me if I want to try some. I think he noticed that my eyes were popping out of their sockets and a little drool was coming out of my mouth. \"Oh yes!\" He proceeded to serve me a nice-sized slice of brisket which he said mother cooked over eight hours. It was as delicious as I remembered my mother's to be and ordered an entire entree to take home. Then, I said, \"it's missing only one thing . . . horseradish . . . \" To my surprise, the wife said to wait, she had some in the kitchen. I couldn't wait to get up and gobble up more of the fragrant and perfectly cooked to perfection brisket. That's the upside . . . the down side is that it's not on the menu any other time of the year . . . 

That being said, our other entree was equally worth returning for the other 51 weeks. Not to be forgotten is their rice chock full of raisins and almonds which accompanies the entrees. 

I can't believe that it took me five and a half years to find this place. I can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we will be back. I ordered the chicken and beef kabob with rice. My guy ordered the lamb with rice. We had FRESH made hummus! Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection! We finished with the lemon cake with raspberry sauce. It was light and fluffy. This is a family business and local! We try to support local any chance we get!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 8 years ! Every time we bring someone they are pleasantly surprised. Everyone always loves it. Please continue to support this local gem!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, a real jewel in the Valley. The combination of flavor will intoxicate your taste buds and you will return for more."}
{"text":"Food here is soooo good. Excellent Mediterranean food lovers with a lot of choices. Mom's rice with chicken & lamb kabab was delicious and so was the potatoes cake. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the service was great. We got the lunch specials and the food was delicious! Food came out fast. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We've been to a string of mediocre places lately and this place hit the spot!  The portions are HUGE so it's a good idea to share. The potato cakes are superb. Hummous & babaganoush very tasty. We didn't know which one to choose so the waitress recommended half & half. Gyros come on a massive platter as well. The special for the night was Lamb Shanks with rice, raisins & almonds. It was so good!  Our 3 year old couldn't stop eating the rice!  We left stuffed and still had several to go boxes. The staff was friendly & accomodating. This is a small local eatery, make reservations if you want to eat in the evening at a certain time, it fills up fast.  Luckily we had arrived for a early dinner so they had room for our party of 6.  We'll be back to try other items on the menu and we will all be sharing next time!"}
{"text":"The food was scrumptious!  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that fool you!  Authentic Mediterranean food. People who run/own this place are so nice.  I just discovered this restaurant and have already been there twice!"}
{"text":"First visit was good, but there was room for improvement.  Seating area is a bit cramped.  Walked in and there wasn't a host area or \"seat yourself\" sign.  Only server grabbed a couple of menus and sat us promptly.  Came by after about 2 mins and asked is of we were ready to order after taking drink order.  Need just a few more mins to take a look at the menu.  Server was very busy - 7 tables at one point.  Hence, not the friendliest, but she was efficient.  Table next to is asked about dessert and she blew him off with a curt answer and kept walking.  I know you're busy, but you ARE the face of the business.  Couple she blew off promptly left.

We ordered the lunch special - gyro with fries, I had salad vs fries and it was great.  The portion is very generous, hot and delicious.  After a couple of tables left and she brought the check, then she decided to \"turn on the charm\".  A bit late for her to start that. I know you're busy, but you have to get the service piece right.  We can get good food a LOT of places."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  We've tasted a whole lot of Greek food, living in the NYC area, and this is now at the very top of our list.  We had the falafel, the chicken kabob and the gyros.  All three were so well prepared and tasted so good!  Even the rice, which is usually an afterthought at most restaurants, was really tasty, and had almonds and raisins.  All of our dishes were beautifully plated, and were so generous that we had the leftovers for lunch today.  The service was super-friendly.  The atmosphere is OK (it's in a strip mall), but shouldn't deter you."}
{"text":"Just checked in at Edens Grill and ordered a Greek Salad with Chicken Kabobs! This dish is amazing!"}
{"text":"Yelpers seem to rave about the portion sizes which I guess is true if you love rice since most of the dish was rice ....I had the Adam and Eve and thought the steak was overcooked. The chicken was alright but again nothing to write home about. The rice was pretty good.  I've had better and I've had worse. The prices are a little on the higher side ($15ish a dish), which I wouldn't have minded if the food was better.  Some yelpers complained about the service which I found to be pretty good. The family seemed nice and attentive.  

I probably won't be back since there are a few other Mediterranean restaurants that I enjoy more"}
{"text":"Best Gyro in town, great lunch specials and always friendly quick service. I can't stress enough the quality of the food and large portions. I always leave happy and full! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"My Mother and I can and we were NOT disappointed ! Her lamb shish kebab was tender and delicious. My Moroccan chicken was seasoned perfectly, definitely not too spicy and enough to take 1/2 home for later. Great food, friendly staff and superb food, you can't go wrong. Reservations might help as 1/4 of their table were reserved when we got there at 6pm midweek ! Yep, it's THAT good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this food. It's the kind of place where your inner dachshund comes out and you just can't stop eating."}
{"text":"I came in with family who had just moved to the area around 8pm on a Thursday- we were seated immediately and greeted by a friendly server who we later found out was the owner.  The food was absolutely amazing and the service was prompt and genuinely warm even upon their closing hours.  I was so pleasantly surprised by this place and will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"I have tried so many places looking for the best gyros...I am hooked! :-) the meat is perfectly grilled, seasoned and not too greasy. The rice is what's got me addicted and coming back week after week. The raisins and sliced almonds takes it to a new level. Today I introduced another friend to the place and she insisted we try dessert. The lemon cream cake with raspberry drizzle was sublime! Not too sweet but very moist and a nice end to our lunch! :-)"}
{"text":"Incredible food! Ladies were so nice & accommodating with two kids. Nice restaurant w linens on the tables but not too nice. We had the appetizer place w four salads/dips, dolmades, & pita bread. Amazing!! Shared gyro plate & lamb & chicken plate. Meat was so good & the rice was delicious! So much food we have enough to feed our fam of 4 again! And the new garlic sauce was awesome. Obviously, I can't say enough about how good the food was. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I really should come here more often. Solid 5 stars each and every time. My husband said that the Moroccan chicken was one of the best meals that he ever had. I love the dolmes. 

Great decor, local feel and not the tacky chain store feel that over 90% of restaurants in the valley are. friendly service."}
{"text":"We came here after day of shopping.  As others have mentioned, the lunch specials are huge.  Has a very welcome feeling of visiting your grand mothers place.  Ordered Gyro Platter lunch special and Falafel lunch special.  Both were really good.  Specials came with choice of rice, salad or fries with our meal.  We had the salad and rice. The rice was really delicious, with almonds and raisins.  Salad wasn't anything special, will skip that next time.  Well have to come back and try some of their other dishes for dinner."}
{"text":"Really good rice and kabobs, the lentil soup was wonderful, attentive service, fresh ingredients, liked the beer as well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant the first time a few weeks ago and we are hooked! First of all,  the people are so sweet. The food is amazing and the value huge (you get at least two meals out of each order!).  My favorite is the gyro salad... So good!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner at Eden Grill.  I have been there before but I am writing to tell you that this place just gets better and better and better!  
I love the way the friendly servers greet, seat  and attend to you.  We started off with the Tabouli salad.  I am going to go out on a limb and tell you that this is one of the best (maybe even the best) Tabouli I have ever had hands down.  Fresh and well prepared served with pita bread.  A must try.  I ordered the Moroccan Chicken and it was wonderful--with just a hint of spiciness.  It came with beautiful, fluffy yellow rice with almonds.  Are you hungry yet?  You should be if you were imagining what this wonderful dish looked like.  Chicken with raisins, nuts, peppers onions... yum.  
Hubby had Lamb Kabob salad --a generous portion of assorted salad greens, feta cheese and generous, generous portions of grilled lamb.  So good his eyes were twirling in his head.  (By the way,  this is the perfect choice for dinner during the summer months--what could be better than a salad and high quality grill meats???) 

After hubby cleaned his plate,  he managed to steal a few bite-fulls of my Moroccan Chicken.  You see my portion was so large I couldn't finish it so he was hovering over my leftovers like a buzzard in the desert.  I quickly had it packed up before the vulture struck again.  (It's in the fridge now waiting to be my  lunch tomorrow) 

We couldn't have dessert... not enough room.  But what I did have after dinner was a wonderful conversation with the owner, Nahren.  I wanted to tell her how much we enjoyed our dinner at Eden Grill and we talked about all the New Times Awards on her walls and her \"A\" rating from the health department which is proudly posted on the bar counter.  How many of the restaurants that you have been to lately have their health department ratings for all to see, just saying.  
Well the food here is fresh, well prepared and delicious... what else can one say about a restaurant??? Well, you can say that the staff is amazing, especially the owner.
See you soon, Eden Grill!"}
{"text":"Terrific food and service. Probably the best hummus I've ever had and the lentil soup was fabulous."}
{"text":"AWESOME Food! First time tonight was take out and it was so good I wanted to drive back and give Mom a huge - that rice!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is incredible.  It is a little pricey but worth it for the price."}
{"text":"The food here is the best in the valley. The rice is to die for. The salads are huge and so tasty. The spices on the meats are mouth watering and the service is personable and excellent. Family owned and operated, we should support them!"}
{"text":"Came back again food was even better than i remembered... the waitresses, everyone so sweet and kind!! Please if your wanting to eat the best food ever and be treated like a king or queen eat here!!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix for a little time in the sun, we checked out Eden's Grill.  What a great find.  We sampled a little of everything and everything was fantastic.  The family was a little apprehensive walking in the door, but walked out extremely happy with our choice for the evening.  Definitely a restaurant worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great spot for delicious middle eastern food, could be the best in town!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and stopped here based on yelp reviews for take out. The restaurant is small, but tastefully decorated. We were treated immediately when we walked in. Placed order, went to store in mall while we waited and returned for our order. Overall, it was ready in approx 15 mins. I watched plates being delivered to customers. not only did they look good and smell wonderful, but the portions were huge! I definitely over ordered. Got our order, went back to hotel and though there was only 3 of us we had enough food for 6!  Yay, leftovers! Fortunately we had full kitchen at hotel. Everything we ordered was great. Beef and chicken kabobs cooked perfectly, rice really good. Potato cakes saved for breakfast-yum. Salad, hummus, baba ganoush- all very good. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch. We both really enjoyed our food. I got the falafel and she got the chicken kabob with rice. Both were very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here! The plates are made to split, and when split I found that they were the perfect portions of food. I ordered and split the chicken and steak kabob plate, and it was delicious. The meat was seasoned and cooked very well.  I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com. For real . It's great Greek food. I thought the raisins and nuts in the rice was going to be weird but I just  spooned that baby up, and dayum it was great. Dinner plates are large. real large. The lamb is hella good. The gyro meat is dank. The chicken is phenom. 
I wish they had french fries and the taziki sauce was blended up more, not so chunky, but the flavor was real good."}
{"text":"I stopped in here as I was doing some business in that side of town for some lunch. The hospitality was great as the staff was very attentive, they obviously had a lot of regulars in there as they know them by name and what they wanted to order. Everything was clean and nice and the decor was comfortable.

I had the kabob lunch special and left full, the rice was fantastic the flavors were good and the service was prompt.

Its a great place for some lunch so stop in and help this local business while getting a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for my birthday lunch because of the Yelp reviews. It was well worth the drive!  Three of us had three different meal and all of us were pleased. The portions are huge. The food was excellent and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Eden's Grill is definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is small and cozy.  The owner's are fantastic.  They always welcomed us and when I would dine there without my daughter they always ask about her.  The food is fabulous.  They have the best dolmeh!  I love the Lentil Soup and the Gyro Salad.  I love this family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Always excellent a great value and hidden gem 
You won't be disappointed. Not many tables and can get crowed. It also can get very noisy. That said the food is always excellent."}
{"text":"This is a local, family owned jewel!
The customer service is wonderful and the restaurant is cozy. Our family does take out at least a few times a month. It may look expensive from just looking on the menu, but the portions are gigantic! My favorite part is the fact that I can make it into a couple dinners.. With my gluten free diet it's hard to find delicious authentic food.The chicken kabobs with rice is always cooked to perfection. The special yogurt sauce is to die for and I always make sure I ask for extra.
Thanks for all the delicious lunches/dinners and friendly service!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years and I love it. Always consistant and always delicious. The owner is always present with a smile and the staff is attentive and professional. We have eaten in many times and taken out as well. This is the only place we go for our Gyros fix and mediterranean cuisine. P.S. The homous was too die for!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant.  Delicious food.  The service was efficient and friendly.  The portions were large and prices reasonable.  I am going back for their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food at Eden's Grill. We have been visiting for over 7 years now and always love the food we eat at the restaurant or take home. The family platters are huge and are awesome for left overs!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mediterranean restaurant in Arizona. The food is always fresh, consistent, and mouth watering delicious. I am never disappointed. If you haven't had Eden's Grill, you should."}
{"text":"Eden's Grill Inn is just outstanding.. This place is an authentic Mediterranean and Greek mix that's serves fresh and healthy food. This family owned place is incredible the staff is always energetic and want the best for you. The chicken kabob plate is untouchable the freshness the flavor and it's amazing how juicy the chicken is itself. The inside of this place is very clean and very well taken care of.. If you want some liquor with your food that won't be a problem at this amazing place. I recommended people to save room for dessert because oh my oh my.. Everything they make here is amazing and it's a experience you don't want to miss because Pita Jungle and my big fat Greek are not real food and they stop you from enjoying something that is good and something someone puts effort to make good for the people.."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  We were pleasantly surprised but I suppose we should not have been given all of the good reviews.  You should most certainly try this place out."}
{"text":"Always consistently good food.  This is the real deal.  I love ordering and taking the kabob gyro combo home because it's the best that it gets!  This seems to be a family business and they take pride in and care about the food.  They did forget the pita bread last time on my take out, but.....they were busy!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice Mom and Pop family owned restaurant with several Best of PHX awards. We have both been here several times and it is always really good. Mom does the cooking and her recipes are executed and seasoned to perfection.

Located in a small strip mall next to the hardware store. This place is small but cozy and very simply decorated. They have an assortment of table sizes based on your group. The larger tables can easily accommodate those bigger family occasions.

Normally come here for lunch and get one of the specials. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. You can also request something off the dinner menu if you wish. This is a larger menu with items that are a little bit more fancy.

My favorite so far is the Moroccan Chicken. She makes mine extra spicy and it is delicious. The Kebabs are also very good and the Salads are humongous. Mom's top secret Rice is so good that it just melts in your mouth. It is covered with toasted raisins and almonds and is at the top of my list to reproduce at home.

Service is very friendly and helpful. You are always told to make yourself at home. They go out of there way to answer any of my questions or request.

Food is always fresh and tasty and we always leave feeling full. Still have not had a chance to try out any of the many tasty desserts. Good reason to come back sooner than later. YUMMO!

{"text":"Eden's Veggie Patties might just make me join Hubby in his vegetarian diet. They were simply outstanding- a mix of cauliflower, potato, parsley and spices fried to crispy perfection. I had the gyros, which were good, but not really much different from gyros I have had many places before. I was doubtful of the rice at first- saffron, cinnamon, toasted almonds and golden raisins- but it all worked. The hummus was heavy on the tahini and super creamy. I think I would prefer a touch more lemon and garlic. If the veggie patty was so outstanding, I can't wait to go back and see how well Eden's does falafel."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place from Yelp when looking for something new to have for take out.  I rolled into the restaurant around 845 (they close at 9), and placed an order to go.  Normally some places like this get kind of cranky if you order that close to closing, but the lady who helped me was so nice.  I believe her name is Nahren....one of the owners.

I had the Dolmeh (grape leaves) appetizer and the Gyros entree.  The Dolmeh, which was served warm, was pretty darn good, a little different than I've had it before, but the style can vary based on which country the recipe is originating from...in this case Iran I believe.  It's hard to really screw up gyros, and gyros meat will be pretty consistent in taste no matter where you go.  But here, there was something that separated it from the rest, it was really flavorful.  The gyros comes with sides of pita to wrap it in, tzatziki sauce, onions, tomatoes...and is all served over amazingly delicious basmati rice with golden raisins and almonds in it. Sooo good.

When the food was ready and I got the bill it was like $23 something.  I thought wow, this is kinda expensive...but when I got home and opened my food, I was blown away at how HUGE the portions were.  I got at least 3 meals for myself out of it.  This place did not disappoint, I'm excited to go back and try some more of their entree's as I'm sure they are delish."}
{"text":"Was at a friend's house yesterday and the food was catered by EG. I'm from the Detroit area and so is my friend, her hubby and about half the people at the party. With so many AUTHENTIC Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food restaurants in the Detroit area, we know the good stuff when we taste it! And Eden's Grill is legit!! 

On the menu was Fattuchee salad, Falafal, vegetarian Domeh (stuffed grape leaves), Hummus, Tzatiki (cucumber/yogurt dip) & tender, savory Basmati rice with golden raisins. 

Everything was amazing and so fresh! Gotta love family-owned restaurants that do it right. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Superb Mediterranean cuisine in a small family restaurant. This is by far the best Mediterranean food in Phoenix. Their savory use of spices and herbs brings out the best in everything they serve.  I would go out of my way to discover this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd been here a few years ago but it proved to be a convenient location to meet a friend for lunch yesterday.  The falafel wrap is delicious and service was good.  My friend said her baklava was yummy as well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it took me so long to write a review for this place. My boyfriend and I absolutely love it! It is a hidden gem in the area. We tend to order takeout more than eat there because we're usually in sweatpants and tired, but the food is just as good by the time we get it home. I love getting the potato cakes - it's a guilty pleasure of mine. We also share an entree because there is so much food in each order! It's definitely one of the places we go to at least 2 times a month. So it's in our rotation of places to go when I'm too tired to cook."}
{"text":"Eden's is a small family-owned restaurant where we have received good service and good food on multiple occasions. 

Coming from someone on a vegan diet, this place is an appropriate stand-in for its namesake - the Garden of Eden.  There are lots of options that have absolutely no eggs or dairy in them - which is sometimes hard with Mediterranean food.  The hummus and baba ganoush were both very good.

I would highly recommend the vegetarian appetizer - it's a meal in itself - as well as the vegetarian plate.  They were more than willing to make a couple of substitutes to accomodate dietary restrictions.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, reasonable prices especially considering how much food we received. Had chicken and kefta kabobs.
Rice was very good with slivered almonds and raisins. 
Had the House salad and Mediterranean salad was good also.
Family owned. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"this place is a hidden jewel, tucked away in the corner of a strip mall. Food is amazing and portions plentiful. never fails to disappoint when I bring new people here. Rice is real tasty and the combo platters can easily feed 3 people possibly 4."}
{"text":"5 stars all around best Mediterranean food I have had. My husband is making it a habit of taking out from Edens at least once a week. We usually share the Adam and Eve which is a big portion. The meat and chicken and really juicy and seasoned to perfection. I believe it is family owned and they are really nice. Again best Mediterranean hands down."}
{"text":"Fantastically Delicious Food, Great Location, and Service. The family owned business for 15 years delivers in many right ways. My group of 4 arrived Saturday night without a reservation.  Highly suggest to reserve your table or order take out. You won't regret it. The level of service is Very accommodating. Beef, lamb Kabobs, Moroccan Chicken,  and vegetable dish all came with Mama's Tasty Basmati Rice, with golden raisins, and almonds. All of us Loved our dish and will call ahead in near future.  Will consider it for events. I find gems by reading reviews but I missed one advising to make reservations for a great Mediterranean meal."}
{"text":"My family and I have been a fan of Eden's grill for a while. Best Greek food- affordable and great service. My favorite:)"}
{"text":"I appreciated the large windows and cushioned chairs.

I also though the server was a bit rude when I asked if I should get the chicken wrap (gyro) or the falafel (gyro.)

I thought she had an attitude when she answered that the chicken was different than falafel. (I knew that already. That was my way of asking what she recommended.) 

I got the chicken gyro with Greek salad. The spices on the salad and the dressing were fantastic. I ate Greek salads throughout Greece though and I was hoping for fresh tomatoes, kalamata olives and fresh greens and feta.

Oh well. I'm not in Greece anymore.

The spices on the chicken and the way it was cooked was phenomenal! The onion and tomatoes and yogurt sauce all combined in a delicious melody of flavors I've missed for a while now.

The price of 8 dollars for lunch is great especially considering you can blow that on crap at Wendy's instead.

I think if the salad had blown me away and the decor was updated a bit, I'd give more stars. 

Turns out, the server called me sweetie a few times so I guess I was wrong about feeling like she was rude. 

I'm coming back for lunch soon and can't wait to give more stars if they serve me a great falafel!"}
{"text":"Fantastic find!  There were 4 of us traveling from out of town and thanks to Yelp we found this hidden gem.  We were in the mood for some authentic Greek food and we were not disappointed.  The dining room was small and quaint, we sat ourselves but were immediately greeted by our waitress who made us feel like family.

We split the appetizer sampler which was delicious and perfect to share.  The entree portions looked large so each couple split one entr√©e and we still had leftovers.  We had the Edens Grilled chicken and the other couple we were with had the Moroccan Chicken which looked amazing and were told it tasted amazing as well.  The chicken was seasoned and grilled to perfection.

The staff was great and attentive, again we felt like family.  They joked with us like they knew us and made the whole dining experience one we will remember for some time."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Mediterranean restaurant in AZ so far. The food is excellent, prepared well, authentic and very flavorful. The ladies that own it are welcoming, lively, funny and you feel like you are a guest in their home. I asked them to open a second location in Chandler-Gilbert area, but they said they couldn't, my heart broke a little. I will keep asking. The location is in an unassuming plaza, a little restaurant tucked in the middle. It gets busy and full quickly, especially at prime times.  Someone tell the owners to make a second location. We drive like an hour each way, if not more. 

I grew up around Middle Eastern food, so I know my way around various versions of the popular dishes and this place is truly delicious. My husband and I go only a few times a year, because it is so far from us, but we love the food. I kinda feel like giving a bad review to deter new customers. 

We get the large combo platters(either #1 or #2)for 2, for dinner. It is a ton of food. We might make it halfway, and have the rest for leftovers, which is still delicious. The rice and meats are awesome! 
We got the Eden's Combination Appetizer Platter to share last visit. 
It has; Dolmeh, Homous, Bab Ganoosh and Yogurt Cucumber Dip. I really wish it included falafel. I didn't love the yogurt dip. 

* Update: We went last weekend on Saturday night, with another couple and the yogurt dip was good again and had lots of fresh herbs. The rice however wasn't as flavorful or toasty at all as previously tasted, super bummed. The chicken tasted well marinated but different than before. I prefer how it used to taste more grilled or smoky. The ground beef kabobs and gyro were excellent as always. Huge dinner portions, you definitely get more than you pay for! 

Baklava is the best here, most authentic made with real butter. You can absolutely taste the difference. #baklavabomb

If you are looking for more budget friendly options, go for lunch. They have lunch specials and smaller plates(still good size portions) at very reasonable prices. My husband gets the Gyro lunch special and I will get that or a salad. We are gyro snobs, but these are super good.  They have plenty of tasty vegetarian dishes too, which is great."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Vegetarian and vegan friendly with portions on the larger side. The veggie patties and dolmas are delicious.  Both soups are great especially mixed with the rice!"}
{"text":"Well very disappointed in food and especially service! I was very excited to check it out as I like this type of food and it's close to my house and it got great reviews otherwise. 
Waitress was kind of short & unfriendly to say the least. We ordered and I had a chicken salad. Upon commencement of eating I came upon what looked like an unwashed lettuce.. I carefully inspected it and moved it aside dismissing the possibility... Very soon after I found another piece of unwashed lettuce (romaine) right after a slight feeling of sand in my mouth, now truly inspected it - sure enough it looked like dirt that has not been washed of produce (just like when you buy loose lettuce at the grocery store); decided I had enough (I hardly got any progress on the food). I let the waitress know and she proceeded to convince me it was the salad dressing (because I guess I don't know the difference). Then as she took the plate, she said: \"you should have told me sooner\". WTF?? What does it even mean? I said: \"no, it should have been washed!\" At that point I was fed up with the unfriendliness and I kind of forcefully rebuffed her.  I haven't ordered anything aft that. They brought soup as a means of settling it all down (as I mentioned I liked the soup because my parents ordered the soup as an appetizer which they didn't like but I did so I ended up eating it). I declined but said I would take pistachio ice cream (they only had 2 on the menu - vanilla & pistachio). Well, pistachio ice cream ended up being vanilla ice cream with few ground pistachios on top of it.. I mean I don't even know what to say. When I read pistachio ice cream I expect pistachio ice cream just like vanilla or chocolate or strawberry. It wasn't worth arguing. I will not be coming back to this place and it's a shame because I really like mediterranean food."}
{"text":"GREAT!!! Mediteranean food.  Ambiance - simple, small, somewhat crowded with paper placemats - lowers rating of an otherwise exceptional dining experience.  Potato Cakes are a good appetizer with a great cucumber/yogurt sauce. Baba Ganoush was very good. Morrocan Chicken (spicy) was savory and truly a star of the evening. Don't let 'spicy' dissuade you - it really has very little heat.  My wife was very pleased with the Vegetarian Stew. The other three in our party had different kabob combinations: Adam & Eve, Chicken, and Beef & Lamb. All drew raves. All 5 dishes were generous portions with equally generous servings of flavorful rice - topped with raisins and almonds."}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant featured in Check Please Arizona, I decided to give it a try. The place is relatively small but definitely not cramped. The service is friendly as can be expected in a mom 'n pop establishment, the food is standard Middle Eastern fare but very tasty and well-prepared, and the portions are more than ample. A good dining experience overall."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Great food, great value, great service.  

I recently had a a dozen guests over for a birthday party.  I spoke with the owner and she helped me figure out the right amount of food for my group.  The \"platters\" on the menu are huge and each one easily serves 4 hungry adults.  They're a total bargain if you're looking to \"cater\" a party without hiring a fancy caterer.  The owner even let me customize what I got on my platters and she definitely gave me heaping servings.

Most amazing of all, the owner came in on a Sunday (when the restaurant is closed!) just so she could make my platters.  She wanted to make sure I had her food fresh for my party on Sunday instead of warming it up after picking up the day before.  Unprecedented!!

The food was terrific.  Each platter came with choice of meats (again, plenty for four adults) a massive helping of rice, four veggie kabobs and several different sauces.  Lots of times gyro meat is underseasoned or just tastes salty.  Here, the meat was well seasoned and tasted like lamb.  We also got the hummus, baba ganoush, and dolmahs, all of which were significantly better than we get at Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I've been here once and the service was friendly, the portions were enormous and the quality was great.  The decor could use some brightening but other than that it was a great experience, I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Best prices in Phoenix and Scottsdale for great Mediterranean food. The service was great and food was served promptly."}
{"text":"We have been going to Edne's Grill since it opened.  We have never had a bad meal.  The food is always fresh and full of flavor.  Tonight was the pinnacle.  New menu item, Spicy Morrocan Chicken was outstanding.  It was not spicy at all, but was such an intense incredible flavor over the excellent rice with almonds and raisins.  An absolute taste treat.  The portions are enormous, so you get to have this taste treat for lunch the next day! My husband had the Turkish coffee, and said it was excellent. Nahren makes you feel right at home, as though you are dining at a friends house.  We just love this place!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Food is delicious.  Best Mediterranean food around."}
{"text":"Delicious and generous portions.. usually busy, for good reason.. recommend everything.. I like the rice with almonds and raisins but wish they had plain rice as another option.. also wish they had grilled jalape√±os which are a great accompaniment to this type of food but I just get it to go and add my own."}
{"text":"It seems that small, family-owned restaurants often have the best food. You want something authentic? Don't go to a chain. It is not, however, a rule, and a family-owned restaurant still needs to stand on its own merits.

Eden's Grill Inn came up as one of the most highly rated lunch spots in the area, and I am always looking for good Mediterranean places, so I decided to stop in. The first thing I noticed is the paltry offering of lamb dishes on the menu. Besides the gyros, there is only a lamb kebab salad (but no lamb kebab offered as an entree). Shish kebab should be made out of lamb, not beef. This place is clearly catering to the Western palate.

I had the gyros sandwich, which was enormous and came with fries.  I also had a lentil soup on the side, which was fantastic, and the highlight of the meal. It was the only part of the meal that reminded me of the real legit Lebanese food I so enjoy.

The gyro sandwich, while humongous, had meat that was chopped ultra thin. This completely ruins it; it seems to dry the meat out (I couldn't finish the sandwich for lack of saliva) and makes it lose the wonderful texture that chunkier slices of gyro meat have. It really just had no substance.

This place is certainly not bad, and it's a nice neighborhood spot. It just doesn't stand out from all the other Mediterranean places with the same beef and chicken offerings. Not when Saba's is just down the street."}
{"text":"we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us. I've lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed, it's quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by.

The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive. We felt so taken care of!! :) 

I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was \"WHOAH!\". The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover. 

The food was fresh, the meat tender, the atmosphere pleasantly divine! 2 trips now and I'm such a fan! :D"}
{"text":"OMG, I can't believe I have not written a review for this place.  I have been coming here since forever, at least since 2006 or 07.  I remember when we first came the owner Markus was super welcoming.  The food is delicious.  His wife is the one who prepared all the meals.  Lately we have been coming for lunch and it is his daughters who are always at the restaurant.  They seem a little bit less enthusiastic as their dad was.  The food is still great.  They have the tastiest falafels I have ever had.  And the rice with the raisins and almonds is so delicious.  I also always order a side of babaganoush, it is my favorite in the valley."}
{"text":"Sincerely,

Uninspired in Phoenix

I've had Eden's Grill Bookmarked for a while now, seeing as I do enjoy a good gyros and today I happened to be just round the corner and hungry. I pulled up Yelp, went to my bookmarks, low and behold a nearby 4.5 star! I quickly decided, \"That's where were going\" and away we went. 

Now many of my reviews come from inspiration, something seems to catch my attention. Maybe it was the amazing house made ketchup, perhaps the superior service, or the cooked to perfection polenta. Inspiration sometimes comes also from a crude wait staff, under cooked chicken, or runny macaroni and cheese. Today, I find no inspiration and thus, this spot gets filed as Vanilla. Not quite one of my favorites, but an OK choice if it's easily accessible and no alternative choices to speak of.

Upon arrival the wait staff seemed to be hours deep into a game of poker. Showing neither excitement nor distain to see me enter the dining room, they certainly had an amazing poker face. \"Two?\" she asked, then escorted us to one of the eight available tables in a dining room of ten tables. 

$7.95 for a gyros and (salad, fries, or rice) seemed like a square deal to me, so I ordered up a \"gyros with a salad - and please, no onions or tomato.\" I knew I could break that poker face of her's; although, I didn't expect it to be in offense to me wanting no tomato on my food. It's rare I get asked \"you want no tomato?... on your salad!?\" with a sneering look of offence, as if my personal distain of tomatos somehow reflected poorly on her or the kitchen staff. 

Sadly, the salad; having fresh lettuce, cucumber, and a \"barely there\" amount of feta cheese - just enough to \"call it out\" on the menu as an included ingredient, was bland. Adding salt and pepper to a salad is never a sign of a good salad or dressing. Along comes the gyros, and tasty as it was, the gyros meat was sliced super thin - no problems if you like it that way though, and it was also topped with the onions I specifically requested to be omitted from my meal; I quickly picked those off myself.

Maybe it was an off day, maybe it's just me be picky, maybe there were forces at work here that wanted my meal to be \"pretty good, but uninspired\", but this 4.5 star place seemed a little over stated, IMHO. It's possible I'll come back again, but hailing from central phoenix, it's rare I'm up this way, and more rare I'm up here and looking for something to eat.

Happy Yelping Phoenix."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are great. Staff was helpful with ordering and gave great service. I was expecting counter service and walked into a full-service restaurant. Go here instead of \"My Big Fat...\" for a true Greek experience."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. Saw the place on Check Please and decided to give it a try. I called to make reservations. When I indicated that I was interested in reservations for the same evening, the response was they were booked solid. I asked if anything was possible earlier in the evening and that worked. Not the friendliest interchange in the world.

Our friends arrived before us. They knew about the reservation ahead of time. They told me when they walked in, instead of a warm greeting, they said the waitress looked annoyed that they were there and instead of a hello, were told we have no tables unless you have a reservation. Interesting greeting. This same person did not wait on us but comes back into the story below.

Once we were all seated the 4 of us were very cramped. The restaurant itself is very small and so are the tables. There were no table cloths that the chef described as a staple of the restaurant when on Check Please.

We were promptly greeted once seated. We ordered drinks and the appetizer combo of Homous and Baba Ganoosh along with leaf wrapped rice (forgot the name). They were served with warm pita bread and were very very good. The lack of room on the small table made things challenging with the appetizers on the table but we got through it.

I ordered the Moroccan Chicken. I will get to that later. The rest of the entrees included a Gyro, Adam and Eve (beef and chicken over rice) and lastly a Chicken Filet Kebob. With the exception of the Moroccan Chicken, the food was amazingly good. The portions were huge. Everyone loved their entrees, except for me. I was really disappointed in the Moroccan Chicken. Others at the table tasted it and also thought it did not stand up to the other dishes on the table.

Another observation we made had to do with the waitress that was not waiting on us. The shorter one. I believe they are sisters. This is the same person responsible for the greeting described above. Due to the fact that the restaurant was so small and the fact that most if not all tables were full, there was very little room in the aisles for anyone to get through, including the waitresses. Each time this other waitress would start walking toward the table next to us she would realize that she could not get through and she would glare at our table as if it was somehow our fault she could not get through. She made it clear she was upset about it. This didn't happen once, twice, but 3 or 4 times throughout the time we sat there. It was very awkward and made things uncomfortable. Once we were finished and had just paid the check, this same person (did not wait on us) starts clearing the table hastily and letting us know she wants us to go. We tried to make small talk and be friendly, but she was not having any of that. We took the hint. Granted we had just paid the check and the restaurant at that time had 3 empty tables, but nonetheless, we felt pushed out.

The reason I bring this up, is because the person I described above was the exact opposite of the waitress that had our table. Though it was very clear our waitress was very busy, she was very warm and made us feel like we were welcomed family. She took very good care of us. But I have to admit, it took her a bit to warm up at first.

I would love to give this 5 stars. The food (other than the Moroccan Chicken)  deserves 5 stars alone. However, the extremely small restaurant coupled with small tables and full crowd made it very uncomfortable to eat there. That cost one star. The second star was lost by how the other waitress interacted with our party. I will try again and try something else."}
{"text":"I come from Los Angeles very frequently, and we have no shortage of good Mediterranean Restaurants. But this place is INCREDIBLE. \"Eden Grill\" is an amazing family owned, family chef, family service staff. What that translates to for me is \"THEY ALL CARE\" and it truly shows. The food was just perfect. We each (4) had a different dish, and each and every dish was great. My only issues is it's a 6 hour drive from my house to the Eden Grill!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the Best Middle Eastern restaurants in the Phoenix area, delicious food, excellant service, and the best part is the family atmosphere that is included!! Great portions for the amount spent.

you can't go wrong :) 

the entrees are wonderful, appetizers heavenly, also for all you low-carb people out there the salads are delicious and perfect for us dieters!"}
{"text":"Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet."}
{"text":"The best Greek cuisine I've ever had!  A quant location with few tables, but BIG authentic flavor.  We were served by the owner herself, and she was very friendly.  We will be sure to make reservations next time, as they filled up quick!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went her a few weeks ago with a friend. Heard the food was really good. It wasn't bad, though my gyro meat was a bit dry and the chicken I got in the kebobs was a bit overloaded with spices/hersb.  The rice was delicious as others have commented on. The portions were huge I must say - at least making it worth the kind of high cost.  The biggest downside is the atmosphere and service.  The place is just a tiny little store in a strip mall. Our table was so small I was uncomfortable and I had to put my purse on the ground.  I kept getting bumped by the female servers every time they came to the table next to me. Also, I kept getting touched by the servers, like a hand on the back and then the arm. My friend told me this is likely part of the culture of the family that owns the restaurant, but I don't liked being touched by strangers especially if I don't know its coming.

Overall I would definitely go back again because the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Yes. This. Go here.

Clean? Yes.
Comfortable seating area? Yes.
Welcoming and friendly without overdoing it? Yes.
Hummus w/ cucumber and pita bread? Yes.
Soup? Yes.
Rice w/ raisins? Yes.
Gyro's? Yes.
Tzatziki? Yes.
Kebabs? Yes.

I visited Eden's on a weekday during lunch with co-workers, and all things were delightfully positive, yummy, quick, and affordable. All things listed above I, or one in my party tried, and liked.
They even have some very well done, and interesting artwork on the walls."}
{"text":"Great food great people try the baklava desert after your meal!!!!!!!! Must try it out!"}
{"text":"First time here! Came her last Tuesday night and the waitress was very friendly. She made sure I like the food. I had the beef and lamb kebob combo.. very good! it was my first time having lamb and i prefered it over the beef kebab haha. The rice was good and the portion was a pretty good amount too. Would definitely come back if I am ever near by again! Not a five star cause I felt like she payed attention to the only other table that's was there and didn't come to my table that much til they had left but besides that everything was good! Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I adore Eden's grill. The food is amazing and service is friendly without being pretentious. you feel like one of the family. The gyros and rice are just amazing.the sample platters are fair priced because they give you so much food. All portions are generous. Please support this local family small business. They prove that they are the best."}
{"text":"Eden's Grill is, without question, home to some delicious, homemade Middle Eastern food. Not since going to the houses of friends of my father many years ago have I tasted food like this. 

I should clarify...

There are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food. This is not bad at all...restaurant food can be very delicious. But, then there are places that serve food the way \"Mom\" makes it. It's that special little bit of love that I'm talking about. In the case of Eden's Grill, \"Mom\" IS making the food. Well, not my mom, but the mom of the great waitress that served my table today (So sorry I didn't catch her name.). 

For our lunch, Bobby T and I went for a side of hummus and baba, a gyro plate and a beef kebab sultani plate. The hummus and baba were solid, loaded with garlic and topped generously with olive oil. The gyro plate was also solid, the meat wasn't too dry and the veggies were definitely fresh. Above the previous two menu items stood the beef kebab sultani. Each bite had the two of us smiling because it was so good. The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece...never did I chew a bite and not get the flavor of the marinade. It was awesome. We also got to taste some of their hot dolma. I have only been served hot dolma at three restaurants, and each time they have been great; definitely worth trying if you're a dolma fan.

There is one last thing that we tried that everyone needs to come to Eden's Grill for though, and that is the rice - basmati w/ golden raisins and chopped almonds. The rice especially tasted like it was made with love and not just by a chef. I still crave it as I write this (good thing there was plenty left over). 

I'm excited about this \"new\" find for me, and I think other Yelpers should be as well."}
{"text":"Home cooking Mediterranean style. Every time we go the food is outstanding. The lamb, rice, babaganush etc, delicious. Nondescript from the outside, fast no nonsense service but the food . ."}
{"text":"This place is small and stifling,, dirty and little effort and thought about the customer experience ( decorations, lighting, hostess stand, signs,). I stood in the doorway Saturday night and waited for 7-10 minutes for someone to seat me or even make eye contact. No signs just be seated or wait to be seated ? Strange but I couldn't have just taken a table anyway, because the 3 or4 tables that were empty were still  dirty and unattended..  Not at all on the ball for sure! Good indication of the food servers and pace of service!! Overwhelmed and only seating for 30-35 people MAX.. Tables are on top of each other. 

So I walked back to rear counter , soda or serving station, I assume cashier ? and was approached by a lady and asked what I wanted? I said dinner and she replies me too !! I couldn't believe it !!!, I assume she is the owners wife? if so , I suggest telling your wife to stay home. , if she isn't I would TERM her., SHE IS COSTING YOU BUSINESS --- if you want to be a comedian get out the restaurant business.. NICE FIRST IMPRESSION ! --NOT 

At that point I knew this place is a disaster ( go with your gut) and she is not interested in quality customer service or friendly service. I despise shitty attitudes and unfriendly people AND dirty restaurants where  tables are empty and dirty and you have to sit next to them and eat your meal. Come on ,hire a damn busboy for $8 / hr ( I was one years ago), these high school kids want jobs to.. . This business thinks small and could care less about growing there business.  So I walked out and drove .5 miles to My Big Fat Greek restaurant ( old faithful) and had a excellent dinner once again, so much for trying something new! Don't waste your time or your money here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here last night.  It was dead.  We were there for about an hour and were the only people there.  A few people came and went for pickup orders but that is it.  It was like our own private dining room.  We were assured by the owner that during the winter months the place is almost always jam packed with snowbirds.

From the looks and deadness of the place I was skeptical of the food/service but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was awesome and so was the service.  The owner was friendly and an all around awesome lady.

To start we had baba ganoosh and hummus.  Both were very good and the pitas were ok but not house made.  Then we had a small house salad and lentil soup.  The lentil soup was excellent but the salad was just ok.  The dressing was 'eh and weird and I really can't describe it.  However, for a small salad, it was huge.

For my main course I ordered the lamb and gyro dish.  The lamb was tender and juicy and the gyro was the best I've ever had.  The portion was huge too which was good because I was able to eat the rest for lunch the next day.  My wife had the falafel salad.  The actual salad part was just ok (like the house salad I ordered previously) but the falafel were excellent.  It was also a very big portion.

For desert we brought home some baklava.  It was homemade and very good although not as sweet as I would have liked.  

All-in-all it was a very good dining experience and we will return."}
{"text":"After visiting a few other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants looking for good Gyros, my wife and I went to Eden's today for first time. I was wearing  my Chicago Cubs T-shirt and lady hostess greeting with a nice friendly greeting and said they were good like the Chicago gyros. 

We both had the gyro sandwich and they were great. Loaded ,heaping with gyro meat and great Tziki sauce. (Spelling?).  Anyway, they came several times to check on us, asked how we liked it and genuinely seemed pleased to serve us. Very reasonably priced. They Said they originally came from a Chicago and pride themselves on having the same quality products.

Very pleased and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I grew up in a Filipino family that bought rice in 50-lb bags, because we ate so much of it. If Eden's Grill is any indication, the people of the Mediterranean have very similar eating habits. They give you so much rice to accompany your meals that, if you're not an avid fan of rice like me, you might feel like you were getting ripped off because the rice portion dwarfs the entree portions. That's not to say you don't get a lot of entree -- it's just that most normal sized things look suddenly become diminutive in the presence of Eden's Grill's rice portions.

Luckily, the rice is amazing. I'm probably -- no, I AM biased towards the grain, but Eden's Grill deserves 5-stars on the rice alone. A lot of Mediterranean restaurants I've tried have a nasty tendency of over salting their rice. Often times, the resulting flavor is nearly indiscernible from Rice-a-Roni. Here, the flavor (curry, almonds, and raisins) is subtle, yet deep. I could eat a popcorn bucket of their rice and still crave more. I haven't had a single entree that wasn't delicious, but for me it's the rice that steals the show. 

It's family owned, the amount of food you get for the money is ridiculous (their huge lunch specials have to be one of the best food deals around), and the food is superb. This restaurant is quickly becoming one of my favorites in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped here for the first time tonight. We were impressed. Wonderful food!! Small, friendly & family owned. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I live for the Gyro Salad. Always make sure I eat at Eden's when I'm in AZ. This last time I went for lunch. I skipped the lunch specials, which are a great deal: pita sandwich, side and drink for $6.99. My mom got the Chicken Gyro, which she was freaking out over. It's very good, and used to by my lunch go-to, but again, I can't deny the power of the Gyro Salad, extra yogurt, please :)"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Phoenix, the price was reasonable. The family owned staff was great. The wine suggested by the server was very good. My only issue was that the table clothes on the tables were kind of dirty. They should charge an extra 50cents per plate and change the table clothes after every table leaves. Cleanliness is next to godliness. I wanted to give 5 stars but the cleanliness factor held me back."}
{"text":"This family restaurant provides a quaint atmosphere, and the food is delicious. Their rice is one of the best in Phoenix with it's saffron and golden raisins. Their dolmah  is extremely tasty and their gyro meat is moist and and plentiful. We frequently get food from them via take out as the restaurant is small. Suggestion: Get there early!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. They finally are offering the lamb shanks - and were they delicious! Cooked perfectly, in a very tasty sauce. The kabobs - as usual- were very good, too. A lot of love goes into these family recipies - if you like generic mediterranen food, go somewhere else - this is the real this. This is a favorite place of ours - family owned and operated. Please join us in supporting this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Authentic, amazing babaganush, gyro great, chicken perfect, fun owners , will be returning a soon as possible !"}
{"text":"I'm bummed to say but the falafel was extremely dry and salty and hardly ever do I say inedible but it was:( I did just have amazing falafel in Israel but it was still simply gross. Sorry but I won't be back."}
{"text":"We eat a lot of Mediterranean and Arabic food and wanted to try a new place. Our server took our order and never returned to see how we liked the food or if we needed anything else. No refills were offered or inquiries if we wanted coffee or dessert. Finally we raised our hand to get someone's attention and a young man came to us. We then asked for drink refills, a to go box, and some Turkish coffee. He was the one to bring us all of these things. Our server finally brought us the check and asked if everything was good. Only when it was time for us to tip we received any kind of attention. If she would have given us as much service as she was to the regulars we would come back. However she did not. We won't be returning. I've never not left a tip before but gave a cash tip to the young man who was kind enough to help."}
{"text":"I visited Eden's Grill tonight with a friend after reading a few good reviews here on Yelp.  I've got to say you guys hit this one on the head.  I had such a good time and our food was great.  What's not to love about a place where mom is cooking and comes out to check on things and make sure you're not only happy, but thrilled.  The chicken kabobs were moist and flavorful.  I think the golden raisin and almond topped rice was amazing.  I'm not big on starches, but I ate much more than I would have elsewhere.  Speaking of eating more...wow, the portions are perfectly plentiful and satisfying.  You definitely get what you pay for at this restaurant.  To sum things up... the family running Eden's Grill clearly love what they do; and it shows."}
{"text":"Great meal. We came for a late lunch so I was hungry. I had the gyros with fry. There was almost more than I could eat.  Biggest and definitely among the best gyros I have ever had. Very good service too."}
{"text":"We looked forward to dining here for a few days, and of course drove out of our way to visit. We arrived at 8:30 PM, and they refused to seat us, saying they were closed; they close at 9:00pm."}
{"text":"Oh holy yumminess! I am so stuffed from eating that GIANT Gyro that came in my lunch special with the delicious greek salad!  I had literally been craving a gyro all day, seriously a random craving(not pregnant), and so I did a quick Google search, read some reviews & decided alright let's try it!  Seriously for $7.95 I think I just ripped them off for how much food came with it.  The tzatziki was PERFECT and refreshing, the pita was warm & soft and the meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  

I can't rave enough about this place & I've only tried it once!  CAN NOT wait to go back!

Oh and should I also mention their \"A\" rating from 3/18/13 posted in front, that always makes me feel warm & tingly inside knowing how well they take care of their restaurant(I've been through those state inspections!)"}
{"text":"Tried this place at the invitation of friends, and am so glad!!! It was delicious!! So much food was brought out on our plates that I wasn't sure how I was going to make a dent in the portion. But it was so good I tried!!! Delicious! It's not a high profile place. Just a place in a plaza ... That is incredible!!"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to see here. Food is always delicious. Big portions. Quick service and easy take out. This place has become our go to for a lazy night at home. Highly recommend.

The gyro meat is perfect.
The lamb is delicious (get it medium rare).
The humous is exactly what would would expect.

Craving it now...."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Attentive service. Try the Turkish beer. Loved all of it especially the lentil soup. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I have been looking for a location close to me that serves good Greek/Mediterranean food.  The gyro was freshly sliced and juicy.  The chicken skewer was seasoned well and also juicy.  Great French fries and rice as well.  The service was very friendly and the food was served quickly."}
{"text":"First time here and food was great! They have vegetarian options for both lunch and dinner. I came for dinner and ordered the falafel plate. I could have done with more skewered vegetables, but rice and falafels were delicious! My only complaint would be that we felt rushed throughout dinner. My friend and I barely had glanced at the menu when the waitress was already asking us what we wanted to eat. She also mentioned that she was the only one here and she had quite a few reservations; that was not a very welcoming statement for first timers.  Overall she was friendly...just felt too rushed during our meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and portion sizes, nicely priced. Service is friendly and attentive. Small space, but be glad for that, the food and the desserts are well worth it. You can call in advance for a table, if you are picky or don't want to wait, you can certainly do this. The owners previously had a bakery in Chicago and the baklava is evidence of that success. Lovely family run restaurant deserving of patronage. I have recommended to friends.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"My mom and I have for years scouted out restaurants with great gyros . This is our new favorite place! 
Their portions are huge, their seasoning is just perfect. I ordered salad on the side, and I loved their dressing, and the greens were very fresh.

The owners were very welcoming and pleasant. My food was ready very quickly.

You can see their awards on their wall for 'best of' in Phoenix for several years now. And they deserve them. 

This is one of those wonderful finds!

We will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted something different for my birthday dinner.  Found this spot very close to our home. So glad we checked out this little place.  It may be small but has a big heart for sure.  Very clean, friendly staff, quaint decor & most important, the food was wonderful.  Lots of choices of fresh, healthy Greek foods.  The servings were large and so tasty!  We'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  

The reviews cover so many of the details, and I hate to be repetitive.  Here are the highlights, according to Moi!

-super fresh food
-amazing vegetarian options
-perfectly seasoned
-food is even better than it sounds on the menu!
-I can never choose because it's all so good
-friendly service (family operation)
-killer baklava, take home w/ you if necessary
-great lunch specials

Here's the skinny on the neighborhood, ambiance and service:  

-Located in decent neighborhood, in a small strip center

-It's clean and maintained, but keep in mind it is a small FAMILY operation.  Don't expect corporate luxury and professional interior design.

-Waitstaff are family, and they may have made some of your food earlier in the day. they are friendly, but not professional servers.  That being said, I have not had bad service here at all.

I see couples, families, solo diners, from all walks of life in here.

If you are in the area, you can't go wrong with a meal at Eden's Grill!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat desert. You must try the baclava and lemon cake.again, the best I've enjoyed"}
{"text":"The kind of place that Yelp was made for. The positive recommendations steered me to a strip mall that I would never think to visit.  I was rewarded with the best gyro lunch combo that $8 can buy.  It also had some of the best pita I've had.  It just takes a while to get to it because you will be mining a giant pile of tasty thinly shaved gyro meat to reach the bread."}
{"text":"I feel like part of a new secret club after discovering this tasty little hot spot.  

It's even spelled homous (not hummus), so you know you've hit the authentic homous jackpot here. (say it with me... hhhhhhooomuuuus)

I went on a date here, he picked the place.   Bonus points to him!   If you do go on a date here, or if you generally want to speak to anyone after eating here, you may want to pack a toothbrush and mouthwash.  Hellooooo garlic!!!      Don't get me wrong, I love me some garlic, but consider yourself forewarned!!    That goodnight kiss could turn evil real quick, so if you want a second or third date, pack your breathmints!  =) 

We split a plate for 2 which was the beef, lamb and chicken.  We both thought we just ordered the beef and chicken, so the lamb was a little bonus.  And I'm glad, because the chicken and the lamb were definitely the best!   While the order says it's for 2 - it's actually probably a portion for 4 - 5 people.   We ate until full and then took two to-go boxes.  I ate it for lunch and dinner the next day.  I'm STILL oozing garlic from my pores. 

The saffron rice was delish.   Servers were non-invasive, but still attentive and friendly.  Loved the neighborhood vibe here - people walked in and were obviously regulars, there was a big birthday party going on, overall just a nice, relaxed vibe.  Great for a date or for families."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!  This place was great!  Food was fantastic.  Family run operation, and they are all just the nicest people.  Mom is in the back cooking, and boy can she cook.   Take a look at my pics...the portion sizes are huge!  My wife got the Moroccan Chicken...so good...that is what I would get when I go back....but then again I want to try so many other dishes.  Check this place out"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Huge portions enough to share if you would like. If you order an dinner plate expect to have enough left over for a second meal. If you order the gyro eat your rice and pick at the meat (which is awesome) then take home what will still be a larger than needed gyro. Go here."}
{"text":"Being relatively new to Yelp I am always skeptical when I see too many 4 and 5 star reviews.  This small powerhouse deserves the nod, however.  My wife and I had a very tasty meal there.  The Kafta and Chicken kabob with their signature rice and grilled onions was very juicy and delightful to our taste buds.  If you are a fan of falafel, this is the place to come.  We had a falafel salad and I would say the falafel were the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Casual place with great food! You'll love it here."}
{"text":"Love this place...As a police officer I have a chance to eat at many locations throughout the city...This place hands down has the best Greek food, period...Family owned and the service is second to none...The portions are generous and you definitely won't leave hungry...Make sure to try the catfish special!!! Also, don't forget their many desserts...Tim"}
{"text":"Great family run establishment!  Never disappoints.  My husband's standby when he's dieting - they know his order by heart!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I used to live in the area and we ate here quite often. I recently was in town for the first time in many years and met here for dinner and the kebob, falafel, and hommous, are as good as ever. I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the best middle eastern food I have ever had.  Truth be told, that is not even the best part - the family that owns and operates Eden's Grill are a pleasure to be around. 

Don't think twice- just go and enjoy.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"From the moment we entered, we felt like honored house guests with a very nice family.   Appetizer (mother's favorite) was amazing and delicious.  Entrees were generous and so delicious.  The rice with almonds and raisins was the best I've ever tasted.  Lamb was really tender and flavorful.   Lots of local regulars who know good food.   Looking forward to eating through the menu."}
{"text":"A complete hole in the wall with awesome food! So I guess I wouldn't know what authentic Mediterranean food tastes like since I've never travelled there, but this seemed pretty dang authentic to me!
The decor is simple and the restaurant is super small! But no need for fancy decor when the food is rockin. It is family owned, and we overheard a server talking about how her mom is the chef there. I love places like that! People working there were nice and showed a passion for the food.
So we started off with hummus and wow it was tasty, had a great texture and flavor. I ate pretty much the whole thing haha. We asked for extra cucumber to dip in it too and that was good, plus they gave us a ton of pita, we brought home extra! 
For my dinner I could not resist the falafel platter, though the veggie patty sounded tasty as well! My mom got a chicken skewer salad. Usually I pretty much inhale my meals, but the portions are both massive and filling! I recommend sharing a plate for sure, and I never recommend that usually haha. The falafel was different than what I'm used to but I liked it. I think more mushy on the inside than what I typically have, but it was good because it wasn't dry like some falafel is. Definitely some of the most flavorful falafel I've had. The rice with raisins and almonds was awesome too, could only eat like a forth of it. And the vegetable skewers! Loved those as well. My mom liked her food too, she had more than enough chicken left over. It is expensive, but you are getting two meals for one so Id say it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This may even supplant my old favorite, Fattoush for gyros and family style plates. Family owned, it will not take much before they great you the customer, like family.  The portions are extremely generous.  Most dishes are served with a rice pilaf which is studded with almonds and golden raisons.  The garlic dip (which you sometimes have to ask for if it doesn't come with your dish) is heavenly.  You will breath garlic for days but it is worth it.  The gyros are sliced very thin so you get to experience the flavor with a different texture than the type you usually get.  The shish kebabs are moist and have one of the best combinations of char to flavor.  It is next to Nee House (home of some of the best Chinese food in town).  So now it turns into a battle in the parking lot.  Chinese, or Kebab's tonight?
 Note:  The restaurant is very small.  I would not attempt anything larger than a group of four :)"}
{"text":"The best Greek around-- hands down.  Family run and they care about their patrons. Lentil soup -- the best.  We go back as often as we can."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food I've had in the valley. So good. I went for lunch- great prices and huge portions. The server's mom makes the food, so they know exactly what's in it. That's great for me, cause I needed gluten free."}
{"text":"Friendly family ran restaurant.   Incredible food,  all from a scratch kitchen.   Big portions,  great value,  and personal service.   Never rushed."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for this find! Came here for lunch and quite surprised how good the food was.

I wanted to eat lamb but since it was not on the lunch menu, I asked them if I could order from dinner menu. 

Lamb kabobs were flavored very nicely and very tender, wish they have lunch portion available. Their portion size is huge, enough to share or bring home for dinner. I really liked their flavored rice, it went well with the kabobs. 

Family owned restaurant and server was attentive and friendly. They were completely packed when I visited during lunch hours. 

Next time when I crave lamb kabobs, I know where to come."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food!  We went for dinner one night during our trip.  We didn't expect it to be in a strip mall, but it was so worth it!!  We even took home leftovers and ate them later in the week.  The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The rice is ridiculously delicious and you have to save room for the amazing lemon cake dessert... Yummmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Chicken is organic chicken and tastes amazing and tender.  Owner is very friendly and actively involved.  The lunch specials are some of the best deals you'll find in town.
I've never had a bad meal here, and they always accommodate my Paleo/gluten free requests.
Can't say enough positive things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem.  This place is a steal ! One of the best gyros I've ever tried. Gigantic portions with reasonable prices. Truly authentic Greek food. Staff are friendly and sweet. Unless they are swamped with a stampede of people trying to get seated. Lol (its that good). Tried the gyro, beef kabob, famous rice, soft pita, and salad. All were perfectly seasoned and delicious. Definitely a must try when in Arizona. The food speaks for itself. Double thumbs up for this place."}
{"text":"My mother is the cook. Love hearing that from our waitress. Great chicken kabob and ground beef kabob lunch special. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my friend after looking for places in the area we were in. We both love Greek food and this was beyond delicious. The staff was very friendly and attentive and they even offered us extra veggies in swap for the rice. We have added this into our dinner rotation and will come back again."}
{"text":"Kind of hidden in a non-descript shopping strip, this mom & pop place is a great find. I've only tried their meats - beef, lamb, and chicken. Lamb is the best. The choices are kind of limited. Seems like half the menu are kebabs, but they are so tasty.

If the prices look a bit high, the portions that come out justify that. The grilled meats rest on a huge plate of flavored rice. I can usually save half for lunch the next day.

Some of their desserts look tempting but I never have room for them. Maybe I will order some to take out next time."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mediterranean place. I love the gyros, chicken, rice, pita... You name it, it's done right. The flavors stand apart from all the other places I've been.  

They have an entire page of salads that I still haven't tried because I like the gyros so well. 

Staff is super friendly and have always gone out of their way make sure I'm happy. Lunch or dinner, this place rocks."}
{"text":"This place is terrific! The food is outstanding. Large portions! The owner made us feel like we were having a gourmet dinner in her home. We are from SF! There are no Mediterranean restaurants as good in the SF Bay Area. We will return the next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful small, local Greek restaurant.  The food here is wonderful and very authentic.  My husband and I split a meal with an appetizer and ended up having left overs.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and the food was amazing both times.  Highly reccomended."}
{"text":"To start with.. This place is Amazing!! I just went there out of the blue and came out amazed. The food is simply delicious. The quantity of food is fulling and the people are so friendly and nice. It gives you a nice homely feeling."}
{"text":"When my Sis is visiting, we make the most of every moment and every meal. I knew I wanted to bring her here, because of the amazing owners and the wonderful food. I love the kefta. I especially love the catfish! The description on the menu doesn't fully describe the complete amazingness of this menu item! So I knew I wanted that, and once my Sis tasted it she wanted it, we ended up sharing my plate (we came hungry, shared my plate, and still had a little left, the portions are huge). It was one of the best things she has ever had and wants to come back every time she comes to visit.  The fish is not just cooked perfectly, it is seasoned so well, it doesn't have a hint of \"fishy\" taste. The rice is perfect with it. 

When we were walking in I was telling my Sis how great the owners were and I got to leave telling her \"see, I told you they were great\"  :)"}
{"text":"Support Mom and Pop places!!!  This is a small gem in a strip mall.  We came for dinner on a Saturday and thinking 7:45pm, table for 3 should be able to get in.  Nope, this place was packed!  It was only a 15 min wait.  I got the Adam and Eve (Beef and Chicken) Kabobs with rice.  OMG...  GOOD!  Meats are juicy and the rice was cooked perfectly.  The service was good, but just did not like we were the table right next to the door.  I can touch the door from my seat."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never stopped in here to have lunch before. This restaurant is family owned, laid back, and the owner personally serves you. 
But let's talk about the food. I ordered the chicken pita for $7.95 and when my friend told me the portion was generous- she was not kidding!  We shared the entree and there was still enough left over for me to take home for another meal!  
The chicken breast cubed were tender and full of flavor. Look at the photos- you will not be disappointed by the food served here. And the lunch specials come with a side salad and a drink. All for $7.95!  
I will definitely be back again. And again and again!  Hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"Convenient location, great parking. Inside...well...will not be gracing the pages of Architectural Digest...but the place is VERY clean, service is incredible, food is remarkable and the prices are great. I could see this being a regular place for me to eat. Had the Gyro (highly recommended), other options looked great too."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Middle-eastern restaurant in a strip mall. Clean, cozy, decent atmosphere. The food is what really shines here. All menu items made from scratch in-house, without using overly salted processed products, enabling the taste of underlying fundamental ingredients to prevail. Generous portions, always a plus. Family operated and owned."}
{"text":"Love Nahren and Nino, they are the nicest owners. They were offering to help people out of the place with babies, always asking if we need anything but also not over-bearing. Everything we ate their was amazing, and flavorful. They ambiance could be better. It's small, and in a L-shaped plaza, but because the food was amazeballs, I could careless. They also sold us bandeleros tickets to casino Arizona and for gypsy kings. Love them. Try everything here. The restaurant is NOT greek. I hate when people say it is. It's ignorance. It's TRUE AUTHENTIC ASSYRIAN FOOD! ASSYRIAN FOOD. That's all. Thanks."}
{"text":"The food is so good, the brother and sisters who run the restaurant are super nice, and you may need a wheel barrow to be rolled out in, as the amount of awesome food you get is enough for two meals, or one big appetite. A great place for a date or to bring the family."}
{"text":"Just an all-around great place.  Not super fancy but all the essentials for a good dining experience.

1) Excellent food- high quality meats and vegetables, perfectly grilled.  The rice with raisins/almonds is very tasty.  The tzaziki sauce is done nicely as well.

2) Impeccable service- the reservation process was easy, and the owner Noreen was gracious when we arrived late.  Our drinks were regularly refilled and finished plates were instantly bussed.

3) Low prices- super reasonable.  We ate well for cheap."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food I have had Period! So detailed. From the rice with the raisins and almonds to the amazing perfectly cooked meats. Impressed and will definitely be returning. Small, but has good feel and service."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try this place after all the good reviews we read and it was awesome food. We started with the stuffed grape leaves which there were six of them and very tasty. Then we shared the gyros, chicken and beef kabob combination plate which serves two and came with a big plate of rice. All I can say is we were in heaven while eating this..everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We had a little rice and gyros leftover so the waitress packaged it up and filled the to go box with rice and extra sauce and pita..which came out to a full meal in itself. The place is a little small but filled up quickly and service was friendly and we never had to ask for anything. If your craving Greek food treat yourself to Eden's"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  The food is delicious, well priced and the service is excellent.  I typically come for lunch and the combo plates are a great deal at +/- $10 per plate.  I had the chicken and beef kabob combo today and both were excellent. Also you can be in and out in 20 minutes max if you're in a rush.  It's quiet at lunch but there's a constant stream of people so it's also a good spot for a business lunch or to get some work done.  Check it out if you haven't yet- I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a total hidden gem! They have a great lunch special and their rice is awesome. The chicken is super succulent and the balaclava should not be missed. Super friendly staff and great atmosphere. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent home cooked dinner.  We loved the flatbread appetizer and potato cakes.  The entrees are very generous. I had the Eden Grill Special Chicken Salad as my main. It had a wonderful balsamic dressing. My husband had the beef and Kefta kabob entrees. It came with delicious grilled vegetables and rice. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Excellent service and nice ambiance"}
{"text":"Que surpresa agrad√°vel este restaurante Grego aut√™ntico. N√≥s o escolhemos pelas indica√ß√µes aqui no Yelp e foi √≥timo. 
A comida √© deliciosa, bem temperada e muito farta, ela √© feita por senhoras gregas, ent√£o tem aquele sabor de comida caseira. 
O atendimento √© cordial e o pre√ßo muito justo pela qualidade e quantidade de comida."}
{"text":"After just one visit I can already say that Edens will be our \"go to place\" for kabobs and other Mediterranean dishes. The atmosphere is warm and friendly as is the staff. Dinner was served fresh and hot and it was delicious! My wife and I had to bring leftovers home and they were just as good for dinner the next night. Definitely try this place if you like fresh, well prepared Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"Cafe style , very small, always used to get take out. Stopped going there for take out because when calling they are unbelievably rude. I thought it was a one time thing, everyone has bad days, but by the third time and my husband mentioning it too on a separate occasion, we refused to go back. I shouldn't feel bad about calling in for food, after all that's my order, my money and their business. Despite having delicious gyro meat and best baklava I've ever had , I refuse to give these jerks business."}
{"text":"This place is LIT! I loved it! I came for a bday dinner-- would have never tried this place on my own but so glad we came! Service was amazing our server was so much fun! She also made excellent recommendations. The tzaziki sauce was amazing, good pita (I prefer mine warm though) and stuffed grape leaves all were great appetizers. We did 3 huge combo platters and ate family style. I couldn't believe how much food we got-- it was an incredible deal. Beef lamb gyro chicken all cooked perfectly and with delicious sauces. There was one that was kind of green and minty and I was basically eating it with my fork alone. We even had tons of food leftover which was awesome. The combos came with rice too which was so good and has almonds in it which was so different but I loved the crunch. I would definitely return here"}
{"text":"Great place! This is now the only Mediterranean joint I go to. Small, family owned and very tasty. The cook even comes and says hi to me everytime I go in, I like that!If your too cheap like other reviewers to pay $15 bucks a plate, go at lunch it half the price. But I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"this place is probably as authentic as you can get, i heard the owners are syrian and they are serious about their food. 

the owner was bitching to me about the ridiculous charges on his aps bill while i was waiting for my gyros. he also gave me a tea in a glass while i waited plus an iced tea to go. very friendly and outgoing. 

the place is cute inside, small but looks like it would hold more than you think. i love small businesses like this - it makes me feel better knowing my money is going to support a family owned small business rather than a sweatshop of a chain restaurant. 

i ordered the gyros and DAMN that thing came LOADED, so i asked for an extra pita to make a second sandwich for lunch tomorrow. the pita was fried i think, it was crispy soft and hot and the gyros was some of the best i've ever had. not too dry and not too tenderly juicy. the tzatki sauce was superb but the sandwich could have done without the onions or tomatoes they load on it (easy to pick off).

seeing as how i work next to this place, i'm sure i'll be back to try more of their greek delights."}
{"text":"The food here is really amazing! The number 9 with lamb and gyro is unreal! Huge portions too!"}
{"text":"Our go to middle eastern spot. Everything is delicious, especially the rice. The owners are friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! The puta bread is the best, freshest I've ever had; the gyro excellent. Do try this place."}
{"text":"We used to live within walking distance of Eden's. They have the most amazing  food, the Gyros are awesome and the rice is simply the best we have had anywhere. Saffron, nuts and raisins make the rice so amazingly tasty. A zero sum gain is when the whole is greater than the parts. This rice is just that a culinary tour de force... On Fridays & Saturdays you can sometimes order Osso Buco if you  get the opportunity you must try it. The rest of the menu is wonderful. Don't let the fact that it is in a strip mall stop you from checking out my all time favorite mediterranian food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Greek restaurants around. Even after moving to Glendale we drive back for the food. Amazing and friendly owners. Enough on the plate for lunch the next day. Their rice is the best!"}
{"text":"Our group opted to try this restaurant for our monthly gathering.  From the minute we got there, we were greeted by the waitress/owner, I believe.  She was so friendly, attentive and shared information as we inquired about specific dishes.  We started out with the Combo Appetizers (various dips & hummus, domeh-grape leaves), flat bread (w/feta, basil & tomato) and tabula.  That let us know that everything was going to be great.  Our group order various dishes from: Moroccan Chicken (Spicy), Adam and Eve (Chicken & Beef Kabobs), Lamb and Gyros, Lamb and Beef Kebab, Mediterranean Catfish.  This allow many of us to try each other's food.  It was all well cooked and seasoned to perfection and so full of flavor. I was particularly impressed with the chicken.  Often times, white meat can be dry, especially when grilled, but this was so juicy and moist.  The Moroccan was full of herbal seasoning, don't let the word spicy scare you hear.  It's a completely different meaning...not hot, just full of rich seasoned flavoring.  And the rice was equally seasoned and flavored well with raisins & slivers of almonds.  I will definitely make this a regular habit."}
{"text":"First time here, but it won't be my last! Arrived around 1 PM on a Friday, and the place was  bustling! There weren't many open tables, and it was clear that most of the customers are regulars.

First things first, the food is amazing! I ordered the Moroccan Chicken which was served over 'Mom's Rice'. The dish was fairly spicy but not over the top, and the great flavors came through loud and clear. This was from their dinner menu so the portion was generous.

The service was fine. The server was attentive without being overbearing. Everyone was very friendly, and I understand why so many people are regulars here!

Since it's a storefront in a shopping center, I didn't expect much ambiance. Even so, soft music was playing, and there were nice painting on the walls. Most importantly, the place was very clean (including the men's room). The only issue I had was the level of noise, given the number of people. But it's not enough to knock anything off my five star review!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was blown away by this place. My other favorite Greek Restaurant was closed so I had to find a substitute. What a great place. The Dolmas were out of this world. They were the kind that I grew up with. I have been looking for these for years. The Gyro salad was Huge and very meaty. It was enough to split between two of us.

I will definitely be driving the extra distance to eat at this place again.

Staff was extremely friendly and made you feel at home."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in Phoenix, I eat here.  Outstanding food, personable service and huge portions."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Try the Moroccan chicken and yellow lemon cake for dessert.  Incredible portions,  nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"A bit of a disappointment. We have been here before and have enjoyed it, perhaps they were having an off night.

First of all, I must say that I resent paying $5 to share a dinner. It costs the restaurant nothing, and seems wrong to me. To avoid paying the sharing penalty, we started with the house salad. It was large and a run of the mill salad. The feta cheese was plentiful, but not all that flavorful. 

We then had the beef kabob. The portion was generous. The beef was ordered medium rare, but came out medium well done. The highlight of the meal was the rice and vegetables. The almonds and raisins make the rice special and tasty. The pita that was served with the dinner was supermarket pita, not fresh.

To finish the disappointing dinner, a party of 5 that had made a reservation came in as we were finishing up. The waitress was told to give us our check quickly so they could turn over our table, even thought there were plenty of tables open. Like I said, a bit of a disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food with very generous portions. Friendly and efficient service, too. Loved the gyros and the baba ghanoush. ."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service!  If you're looking for authentic Mediterranean/Greek food, look no further than Eden's Grill.  Located in a strip mall, this little family owned/operated eatery serves some of the best food we've had.  The dolmas appetizer (stuffed grape leaves) were tasty, the Moroccan Chicken was very flavorful and the Gyros Plate was overflowing with perfectly seasoned meat.  Entrees include flavorful basmati rice studded with white raisins and almond slivers.  We dined with two other couples who also raved about their Vegetarian Platter, Adam and Eve Entree, Lamb Kebobs, and the Chicken Kebob/Gyros Entree.  Unlike most other restaurants, wine pours were almost to the top.  Prices were very reasonable and servings were very generous.  We all took home leftovers.  Noreen, the owner/server was friendly, perfectly attentive and responded to our questions regarding her culture.  We will definitely go back to Eden's Grill when we are in the mood for Mediterranean/Greek food!  We also advise making reservations as this place is generally very busy!"}
{"text":"Actually shaved gyro meet. not pre-cut, spam looking gyro meet. This place gives SOOOO much food. I love it. When my wife and I go we split the gyro platter/plate for dinner. Sometimes we will get a salad to split as well, but to be honest we have left overs sometimes.
So much meat...can't ever complain. You have to come to this place sometime.

They can packed really quickly so make sure you plan accordingly. First time we went we got in right before temple got out. We got lucky but everyone after us had a 45+ min wait."}
{"text":"Eden's grill has very tasty food. Good vegetarian selection.  Delicious rice and falafel. The service is warm and friendly. Its a bit pricey compared to other nearby Mediterranean restaurants but the food tastes like it was made with love.

FYI- You can place orders for their fantastic rice for the holidays. I heard it is amazing with turkey dinners. I plan on it for next Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice prior to our last visit. Food is good and generous portions. However we stopped in one night 15 minutes before closing time and were turned away claiming the kitchen is closed already. Why would your kitchen close before the restaurant...."}
{"text":"We just got a ton of take out here. Gyros, potato ckaes, baklava, hommos, flat bread, and kabobs. Everything was great. I loved the potato cakes which were a little spicy which made them great. The takeout containers were straining with the amount of food! Seriously generous portions. Their cucumber yogurt sauce is super thick and doesn't drip out of your gyro. We have leftovers for days and we'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Food is so very tasty!  Mom's Rice is unusual and fab.  Servings very generous. Chicken is fabulous--lemony  and garlicky and so tender. Hummus is so good. The service is quick and owners are always right there. Mom is usually cooking. Love this place."}
{"text":"All I have to say Is come with a BIG appetite!! This is truly a hidden gem if you enjoy Mediterranean food!  The cup of soup was the size of a bowl at any other restaurant. My brother ordered the Moroccan chicken and it was enough to feed 4!  Just absolutely delish!! I ordered the falafel salad and again too big so I had to pack it to go!!  They put 10 falafel balls on the salad and serve it with Tahiti dressing.  YUM!!"}
{"text":"This place was AH-MAZ-ING!!! We tried the homous, tabouli and falafel appetizers and then shared the #3 and #6 entrees (between 3 of us). We washed it all down with some Lebanese beer to boot. Every last morsel of food was divine, the drinks perfectly chilled and refreshing... and the service was equally awesome.
From a few folks who have eaten Mediterranean food from around the globe.... this place is THE BOMB DIGGITY and you should go there and try it all!
We'll be back as soon as our leftovers are gone and our stomachs have some space."}
{"text":"The food is great here but this waitress needs to get some personality. She is very short with people and yells across the restaurant. The food makes it worth the trip after a hard morning at Orange Tree!"}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!  I've been thru some medical issues recently and food does not interest me at all.  I ate more here than I have in MONTHS and took every bite and grain of rice home to eat more later. If I could have eaten any more I would have licked the plate. I had the vegetarian combo and my boyfriend had the lamb and beef kabob. Both were fantastic and the portions are huge. Definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"A tiny strip mall located family owned business.  For those who know anything about valley food; that means you're usually going to find something great.  If you like Mediterranean, there's something at Eden's Grill Inn that will satisfy your taste buds.

I've had a few of Eden's Grill's platters at a party before, but this weekend was my first dining experience at the restaurant.  The dining room is small.  Probably not much bigger than my living room, but they manage to comfortably squeeze a good mount of tables in without it getting uncomfortable.  Some music (I'm assuming Greek) gives the place some added feeling.  The decor isn't much.  A few paintings and a lot of the clique \"Best\" whatever they were vote from the New Times or some other publications plaque's.  Those awards seem to be well deserved.

We both had the gyro pita lunch special.  For just $7.95, you get the sandwich, a choice of Greek salad, fries, or rice, and a drink.  When the sandwich arrived, I was shocked at the massive amount of meat.  I had to start with a fork just to eat it down to a size where I could use my hands and take a bit!  The tzatziki sauce is also excellent.  I'm guessing they mix some sort of sour cream in with the yogurt.  Whatever it is, it makes the sauce very flavorful.  The pita bread may be the best I've ever had.  It's almost more of a hybrid or a naan and a pita.  A little oily for bread, but delicious.  The service was as good as the food.  The owner really made us feel welcome, and was as nice as can be.

The lunch specials are cheap.  The regular entrees can be pretty pricy.  But portions are pretty big, so it's best to come here with a group of at least four and split a few items."}
{"text":"If you want authentic, delicious Mediterranean food, head to Eden's Grill!  I've been a handful of times and have tried quite a few menu items - the appetizers are all spot on and the entrees are huge portions.  Some of my favorites are:

- Dolmeh (fresh, warm stuffed grape leaves - a world away from the typical cold, slimy canned ones many places offer)
- Falafel (crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside - served with a tasty tahini sauce)
- Tabbouleh (nice herb/tomato to bulgur ratio and good seasoning)

Note to the wise: unless you're really, really hungry (or if you want leftovers), stick to either a few apps to share or just to the entrees.  Any more than that will be too much!

Service has always been both friendly and speedy - just note the hours before heading over, because we've stopped by on occasion and it's been closed."}
{"text":"Mom and I arrived to find EG bustling during lunch (it was around 1:15 pm).  There were around ten tables of different shapes and numbers of chairs.  Our server Noreen was amiable and eager.  She took our orders of water and left us to look at the menus.  I didn't find the lamb entree Mom mentioned, and when I asked Noreen about it, she said that while it was only on the dinner menu, she could get the kitchen to cook it.  Mom balked at the price ($18.95), so we stuck with the lunch menus.  She wanted to try the Gyros (#6), which came with \"Mom's Rice with toasted raisins and almonds, grilled bell peppers, onions and tomatoes.\"  (No pic taken- sorry!)  The menu also mentioned that fries came with the order, but Mom's entree came without it.  I unfortunately did not know, or I would've asked Noreen about it.  I ordered the Chicken lunch combo, which was a chicken pita and choice of side (salad or fries) and beverage for $7.95, as well as Mom's Favorite Appetizer Platter (\"tabula, falafal, and potato cake\"), $13.95.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ#iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ

Mom enjoyed her meal!  She ooh'ed and ahh'ed over the rice (which I tried in spite of a rice allergy, and yes it was good), as well as the pita that the lamb and beef slices were served on.  She preferred it over the standard pita that came with the appetizer plate.  When she mentioned to Noreen that her pita tasted better than the other pita we had on the table, Noreen kind of leaned in and said it was made in-house and that they cost a $1 a piece.  I asked Mom to break off a tiny piece, and sure enough, it felt different (thicker, more doughy, and a bit greasy) and tasted fresh from the fryer, making the store-bought pita seem like cardboard.  I didn't like the greasy aftertaste, though, but I did appreciate the flavor of butter in the beginning and the pita's textures.  

I also enjoyed my chicken entree, which had juicy grilled chunks of chicken, strips of greens and tomato and onion slices (which I picked off before taking photos). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw#1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw  The \"white sauce\" was a nice accompaniment, although the chicken didn't need it.  Mom and I split the side salad- it was good, although I found the dressing to be too tart.  I enjoyed- tremendously, I might add- the potato cakes that came in the appetizer plate... Wow!  Am I glad I spotted that Yelper's tip to order them!  They're basically button-shaped croquettes filled with seasoned and juicy ground beef.  Definitely a must-try!  I also enjoyed the falafel, even if they were a bit on the dry side, and a bit harder-to-the-touch than other falafel balls I've tried.  The sauce it came with was too bitter.  The tabula was too tart!  I could only bear about three small forkfuls before walking to where Noreen was, standing behind a counter, to tell her about it, and that perhaps the kitchen should taste it and understand what I mean.  She offered to replace it with \"homous,\" and I took her up on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg#E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg  It had a pleasant mouth-feel, but again, I found it a bit sour.  Noreen later came back to say that the I was right- the tabula was very sour, that it needed more parsley, and to thanked me for letting them know.  

Mom agreed with Su-Shien's review I read to her about size portions-- they were generous, and Mom likes generous servings, especially when they taste as good as her entree!  She wished she'd ask for more of the rice, instead of the homemade pita that we were sent home with, with an accompanying charge of $2.  I told her we could always go back for more...

Last, but not least, we had some baklava, two pcs., $4.  Mom and I split one- it was perfect!  Loved the buttery, toasted, and flaky crust, and the rich, walnut filling.  It was so good that I could've eaten the second piece in a heartbeat, but also so satisfying that I didn't feel the need to overdo it.  A great way to end a good meal.

I'd return back just to have more of those potato cakes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ#6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ

{"text":"First Yelp's site did not allow me to check 5 stars so I checked 3a-ok which is not MY pick for a RATING it is 5 STARS!There are 3 GREAT/Authentic  Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurants in Phoniex area.Eden's is the Tatum & Thunderbird(intersection) North Phoenix one. The other 2 are Haj-Baba Tempe 1513 e Apache Blvd.,this is also a small family owned grocery store combo and the last one is Baiz Market, which is a big grocery store/ small restaurant combo,523 N 20th st Phoenix. But back to Eden's this North side GREAT restaurant. Yes it is small ,NOT STIFLING (quit the opposite mentioned by a DR ) with some sitting outside (when the weather is right) family BUSINESS. They have a VERY AUTHENTIC lunch and dinner menu, both great portions. The management is very POLITE and the kitchen being small delivers exceptional platings. Pay more for FOOD and not for circus's. If you really love HEALTHY Gastronomy this is one of your Stops for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food is good and the portions are adequate. Always did a carry out. Have to try dine in the next time to gauge their service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and surprising give the strip mall. But great food and food service. The spicy Moroccan chicken was delish!"}
{"text":"I have heard mixed reviews about this place, so I had to check it out for myself. Although the establishment is in a small space, they maximized the use of their space with enough tables. It doesn't feel too cramped. The decor is neat and the eating area is clean.
The customer service is quick and attentive but not very personable. I felt like they were just trying to get me fed so they could sit someone else in my seat.
The food was great! I had a gyro with the saffron rice for lunch. The second best gyro/doner I have ever had. It was fresh and filling with great flavor. The saffron rice was amazing.
I would recommend and I would return."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced with very pleasant atmosphere & friendly servers. What more could you want ~"}
{"text":"8:33 PM.  Arrived for dinner, only to be chased out of their empty restaurant being told they're closing.  When I pointed out they advertise a 9:00 PM close, they responded \"Fine, you can get it to go\".  Seriously?!?  There is no \"customer\" in customer service here.  We were looking forward to trying it, but will never return."}
{"text":"We've been going there for years and always have an excellent meal.  Fresh, crunchy and perfectly dressed salads, deliciously rich almond rice, perfect fish, and grilled meat kebabs that are always seared and juicy.  What makes it special is that the sisters who run the place recognize is, even if it's been a few months, and make us feel very welcome, like family."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is very easy to miss but was very good.  When we ordered the waitress told us their entrees were very big and we would be taking some home and she was not kidding.  The potato cake appetizer was awesome.  A flash fried mashed potato with a near stuffing.  I had the lamb and gyro entree and my girlfriend had the gyro and chicken salad.  We were both very happy with our food and I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.  I was too full for dessert but my girlfriend had baklava and said it was great."}
{"text":"Great Place, wish it was bigger and less noisy.  Went there with 4 friends.  The portions are huge enough to take home and the two sisters from Chicago who owned the place with their mother were very entertaining.  I had the grapes leaves with rice.  They were very good.  6 Huge grapes leaves on a bed of rice pilaf and veggies.  The food tasted great even the Baklava was good.  I would definitely go back and try another entree."}
{"text":"Yowzah! I bullied my husband into trying this place and I am glad I did. He's glad too :) he just won't acknowledge it. 

I had to get the Moroccan chicken and hubs got the Adam and Eve. Let me tell ya... HUGE portions with HUGE BOLD flavors. Lip smacking deliciousness. I am sad we are just now discovering this place. It's so unassuming in a strip mall, I drove past this place so many times. But thanks to Yelp I knew such place existed and had to check out this place with has such great reviews. Never disappointed with the general consensus of Yelpers. 

Service was wonderful. It is a family owned business where they have pride in what they do. Loved the twin sisters who are the daughters of the cook/owner. They made us feel like family and very welcome.

The portions were so big, we had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Tasted great reheated too! Check it out and taste for yourself.

Does not take Amex though... Tis ok. The food compensates for not taking Amex :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and pleasant staff. The lemon cake was to die for. Definitely a new go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with HUGE portions! One meal is enough for two or take some home for later. The place is small and family run with great hospitality! I got the Gyro and it was spectacular, piled high with lots of rice and a huge piece of delicious pita bread. The cucumber yogurt sauce was also the best I have ever had! Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"For some reason this restaurant shows up under two different places on Yelp!, so I figured I'd also review it under this entry as well. 

Earlier this week, I made my first visit to this place on the advice of a colleague of mine, since it is nearby our workplace. I have to say it was beyond expectation in just about every way and I can't wait to go back again. I also can't believe what I've been missing all this time! 

The decor and ambiance are both really nice, as the place is cozy, quaint and quiet but definitely not a hole in the wall. It doesn't feel at all pretentious or phony and is, in fact, about as authentic for Mediterranean food and surroundings as you're going to get in greater Phoenix.

Their lunch specials are all very well priced and everything I tried was absolutely delicious. I've also had their appetizers and the humus and baba are both exceptional. They also have a wonderful yogurt dip for your pita that is savory and spot-on. The gyro sandwich that I had was absolutely perfect, the tenderness, consistency and the portions were all spot on and flavor was wonderful.

The service was excellent, with refills never taking too long and food coming out faster than expected, both of which are huge pluses.

I really cannot recommend this place enough and if you're in the area you absolutely have to give it a try. I will definitely be back for lunch in the near future and maybe dinner as well."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, but it didn't blow me away.  The hummus was kinda bland and the falafel was mediocre.  The rice was amazing though.  Next time I go back I'll probably just stuff myself with rice... maybe with a salad on the side.

I wish I could combine my favorite aspects of Mediterranean food from restaurants all over the valley and make a SUPER-MEAL!
I would have:
- hummus and lentil soup from Pita Jungle
- falafel from Sabuddy or Phoenician
- salad and fries from Greek Patio
- freakin' delicious rice from Eden's Grill"}
{"text":"Still awesome, picked up carryout today.  Their portions easily make two meals, gyros have fantastic flavor.  You need to go!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem located in an average strip mall. 

I am not going to lie, when I first walked in I wasn't expecting much - possibly because there was blue hair and walkers in every direction, but we decided to give it a change because of the ratings on yelp.

The ambiance is okay... Although, its pretty small and can get stuffy! We had the unlucky chance of sitting next to the door and we kept having to scoot towards the wall or move the table so people could squeeze by. That aside, the food was surprisingly good. 

They have a small drink menu and we wanted to try some of the unique beers; we ordered effes and almaza - mmm both were pretty tasty! 

For the appetizer we went with the hummus. Unfortunately, this was the worst part of the meal. It was dry and tasted like it came from a package. I became a little worried about the entree, but we forged on. 

We decided to try the shish kebab combo - DELICIOUS! My friend and I were surprised the ground beef kebab ended up being one of the best things we ate. It has a nice texture and was seasoned very well.The steak kebab was cooked perfectly! The chicken was good, maybe a little dry, but the side sauces helped with that. 

I wouldn't recommend the hummus, but otherwise this place is serving up some delicious food."}
{"text":"I won't be back, sorry, but although I like middle eastern cooking, I don't like kebobs much.  Eden's Grill is essentially a kebob house - virtually all of the entries are combinations of four types: chicken, beef, lamb, ground beef.  And they are pretty good kebabs too, but I just don't like kebobs much.

I could quibble about the vegetables being underdone, nearly raw actually.  Or I could say the sauce container was so small that it was hard to dip pieces of meat in it.  The dinnerware was kind of flimsy.  It's a small place and you may have trouble walking in and getting a table sometimes.  

The point is that Eden's does what it does competently and with no serious faults.  I just don't like kebabs enough to return.  But for anyone who does like them, four stars is fair."}
{"text":"The single best place to have lunch if you're in the Paradise Valley Mall area.  

This family-run eatery serves up traditional Mediterranean classics  but they make each one their own.  The ground beef kabob is nothing short of spectacular.  In many places, that dish is an afterthought but not here.  Their house rice is an aromatic yellow rice with almonds and raisins and absolutely delicious.

It's also a proper restaurant - not your typical gyro lunch counter vibe.  Lunch for two runs $17.00 and we usually take food home.  Everyone I've brought here loves it.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Traveling to scottsdale for a week at the westin kierland villas, we wanted to see what yelp recommended in local Greek food. Edens grill is about  8 miles from our location, so why not? The ratings and the food pics looked great .....very easy to get to and plenty of parking....not a big place, but we love the family run places. The restaurant is very clean and getting there early for dinner was perfect. Ordered the Moroccan chicken...spicy but not hot...sooooooo tasty...love the sauce with the chicken, peppers, onions.....I could haves stopped at 1/2 of the dish and be satisfied, but I couldn't stop! Had to savor every grain of rice on the plate... Omg! I wanted to come back again....my wife had the Adam and Eve  which is very good Aldo, but she loved my Moroccan chicken more and was disappointed I didn't bring any home..
We will be back  the next time we are in the area....try it!"}
{"text":"That was. . .amazing.

Great reviews of Eden's Grill Inn are nothing new, and if you've been there, you probably aren't surprised to see this.

If you haven't been there, then I have a few things to tell you about this place:

1. The high reviews aren't hype--this really is one of the best places to eat in the Valley.

2. You haven't had kabobs until you have had them here.  No, that's not trite--it's quite true.  Get your steak kabobs medium rare.  Do it. They are an experience to behold.  Even the basmati rice is remarkable.

3.  Imagine the most delicious, warm, rich apple pie you could ever have.  Now, project that richness of taste to a baklava.  You can have it here.

4.  No matter what you order here, you will love it.  Yes, you will.

Worth driving across the Valley to eat here.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite awhile now and was surprised by my review of this place. I love the family owned business. The mom and the brother is in the back as cooks, the older sister is the owner, and the younger sister is the hostess and waitress. They are all from Iraq and their food is all from the Middle East. 

I've notice they've upgraded their place. Walls painted, nice new floor, with nice new table tops. They got rid of those gaudy pink table clothes. I really like their decor. A lot better than before. 

We always order the potato cakes. It comes with three in an order, garnished with cucumbers, and tomato slices with a yogurt dipping sauce. It's so good. It's crispy on the outside with a meat filling on the inside. Put some of that yogurt sauce on it then I'm in heaven. To die for. Really like it as you can tell. 

Me an my wife always order one dish and we split. It enough for two people. I could probably eat a whole dish but would be totally stuffed but sharing is perfect. Today we had the chicken and lamb kebab. It comes on a bed of rice with golden raisins and almond slivers with grilled vegetable which included green peppers, tomatoes, and onions. Lamb was so tender and chicken was so moist. Really good. Loved it. They used to give even bigger portions with about two or three scoops more of rice but their portions are just perfect. One thing is their prices stayed the same with smaller portions. Doesn't matter to me cause it's still enough for two. Just love the grilled lamb and chicken. 

We've had their deserts before but not tonight even though they have some of the best deserts. They said they used to own a bakery back east and bake a lot of their deserts so if you have a chance try their deserts. You won't be disappointed. 

So this place is small with about 10 to 12 tables. Very busy on the weekends. Great food and friendly service. Sometime they can get busy and sometimes come off as not being as friendly but the service is good. So trust me. I love this place and will for sure be back. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while, and finally stopped in today for Christmas Eve lunch. Soooo happy I did! I ordered the Catfish, which came with grilled veggie kabobs and the most delicious rice with slivered almonds and raisins. The service was excellent, fast and friendly. The food was fresh, well seasoned, and the portions were generous. I ended on a sweet note, with the baklava. The layers of phyllo dough were flaky, and it wasn't overly sweet, which is a good thing. A lot of times it can be soggy and super sweet. This wasn't, it was perfect. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro dinner. Lamb very tender and flavorful. Rice was spectacular.
Save room for the melt in your mouth baklava.
Portions were large enough to share or definitely enough for leftovers.
Waitress was very friendly and helpful.

This was my first visit to this family owned restaurant but won't be my last."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, the first time was for lunch and was definitely a 5 star experience. Howevaaa, the second time I came was with a date and was for dinner. This time we ordered a few different dishes and I came away rather unimpressed. The hummus had way too much tahani as it had a very strong peanut flavor. I was also not crazy about the chicken and rice dish my date ordered.
Both times I had gyro meat and enjoyed it, but some of the other things changed, such as the service. Dinner service was not nearly as good, which I somewhat understand because there were so many more people, but if you want people to come back to your establishment, you gotta always have good help."}
{"text":"This is a must sample restaurant. Truly a family run restaurant and before you know it, you'll be part of the family. The Osso Buco is ranked among the best in the city and I have not tasted better. The rice is fabulous. The combination platters has something for everyone. Nora, our server, was great."}
{"text":"I personally loved this place. The food was homemade and good. the business looked family run and the food tasted that way also, which I fell in love with. The staff is friendly and responsive. The food is cooked to order..which means fresh and HOT from the pan!!!!!!

The place is really really small, which I didn't know. I didn't have to wait long, but I suggest making a reservation.

The meat is in good chunks and cooked to perfection. Well most of it..one of my pieces was undercooked :/ But it's okay it was worth  it when I boxed it and heated it later :)

There is a ton of rice. Maybe too much rice. They should probably offer another small side or something because then the meal would have been so much better! I suggest the lamb and chicken or beef!!"}
{"text":"Been here now a couple times for lunch...  decent lunch special and pretty good food.  I only give it 4 stars though because we have had a bad experience in service but not enough not to try again :)."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for the first time last night, it was a last minute dinner decision. The place was packed at 7:45pm on a Wednesday and I think we got the last table. The food was unbelievably delicious and the portions are gigantic. We started with the falafel appetizer - very crispy and packed with flavors - served with tahini and pita bread. My husband got the lentil soup - I only had a few spoonfuls - but it was the best soup I have ever tasted in my life. I never knew I loved lentil soup?? LOL
For entrees he got the lamb kabob salad and I got the chicken fillet kabobs. The meats were perfectly seasoned and not salty, which is something we are very particular about. What really knocked my socks off was the saffron rice with golden raisins and pine nuts that came with my chicken - holy cow - the most amazing rice dish I have ever had. I'll be dreaming about that rice until I go back!
Service was prompt, courteous and friendly, even though they were very busy. I would highly recommend this awesome little gem to anyone! My husband and I will be regular visitors."}
{"text":"Very friendly people. Quaint and comfortable. I have the lentil soup which was fantastic. The perfect amount of spices. I also ate the gyro dinner which definitely had leftovers. Portion size they were huge. I probably could have gotten just a soup and been full. The gyros were pretty good, but the thing that threw me for a great loop was the rice. It was served with raisins and almonds and it made it spectacular. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This has been on our To Try list for probably a year, and we finally had the opportunity to get out to north Phoenix and try this hidden gem. The one thing we were disappointed with was the fact that since everything was so good, we are going to have to make the journey up here more often.

When coming to a new restaurant, especially one that has a cuisine we are familiar with, we like to sample an assortment from the appetizer menu. Not only was the owner/server exceptionally friendly, but the food was homemade, authentic, and served in a timely fashion.

I can say that we felt everything was slightly under-salted, but we much more prefer that to the alternative and having to gulp water the entire meal. The appetizers, including the dolmades, were entirely scratch made, and serving sizes were more than generous.

The large portion sizes of the entrees left enough for a second meal while the flavors and menu choices made for a Mediterranean dining experience that was a nice change from some of the run-of-the-mill restaurants out there. We will certainly be back to try more from the menu. The Adam and Eve and Moroccan Chicken are both killer plates in the entree department; we truly were not disappointed in any of our selections.

If you have the chance, try out this spot hidden in the corner of a strip mall! The dining room is very small, but if you end up having to wait for a table it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch, and it was incredible!  The staff is so friendly and the food was excellent.  Chicken was so tender and tasty.  The salad, tomatoes & onions tasted very fresh. As always, edens grill will never disapoint."}
{"text":"Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family!

Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door! Fast service and great food too!

HUGE portions!! I recommend splitting entree's. We ordered 2 entree's between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home! I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy. Hubby had the Gyro's and loved them! (Gyro's were probably enough food for 3 people!!).

Moderate prices. Averaging about $15 bucks a plate, but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants, almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon?

I was told they had the best cannoli's in town.....so I had to save room for one!!...and they were pretty darn good!! 

To sum it up...... FAST~FRIENDLY~FRESH FOOD!!!

Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday where it was pretty busy. If you want to be surrounded by an older crowd, it's the best place to be. 

Recommended appetizer: Potato cakes! They're pretty good.

I had the \"Adam and Eve\" which is supposed to be beef and chicken kabob. So I'm guessing Eve's the chicken...? They should call the beef and lamb kabob combo \"Adam and Steve\". Anyway, it was alright. I liked the rice mixed with almond and raisins. 

The baklava was okay too, although I was tempted to try their chocolate chip cannoli..."}
{"text":"This is an amazing small restaurant where they serve the best fresh meals, if you're looking for some great salad, chicken kabobs or baba ganoosh, I highly recommend them"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean food restaurant. We been going there with friends and family for years. It's a small family business just the way I like it. The food is delicious and you always feel welcome. It gets busy during the winter time so make reservations."}
{"text":"Wonderful little neighborhood resteraunt. Nice surprise!!! I enjoyed Eden's Grilled Chicken Salad for $12.95. Simple but filled with flavor. Romaine lettuce, tomato, cucumber, greek olives and feta cheese. The dressing was incredible and is the reason this simple  salad was outstanding. They have a a menu with variety. Service was very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at Eden's Grill, but the service was not up to the quality of the food .  Stopped in for lunch on Monday.  Two other tables were occupied.  I was given a huge leather bound menu.  Lunch specials listed in this book were $9.95 and up, and all included rice.  I wanted salad, so I ordered the $15.95 Steak Kabob Salad, a price far higher than I would normally pay at lunch.  It was very tasty, and I enjoyed the balsamic dressing.  The almonds and raisins on the salad were a nice touch, and the steak was perfectly medium as ordered.  I was disappointed that a salad at this price was not even accompanied by a warm pita.

Companion ordered the $6.50 chicken pita ala carte.   Server asked if we wanted the lunch special since it comes with rice, but we just went with the salad and chicken sandwich because \"I wanted a salad\".  I also assumed she was referring to the $9.95 and up specials in the leather menu book, which weren't really very special at all. The pita had very generous portion of delicious meat, tomatoes and lettuce on a pita.   We ordered only water to keep down the cost, but with tax and tip we spent $30 on lunch and had NO LEFTOVERS but two cubes of steak.  Ouch.  Service was fine, not outstanding, but not bad.

As we were leaving, we stumbled upon a little A-frame sign outside, hiding behind a pillar on the back side, facing away from the parking lot and restaurant entrance.  This sign indicated six lunch specials with a choice of rice, fries or salad for $7.95 including a drink.  Wow, that is a solid deal!  

After studying this menu for a few minutes, I stuck my head back inside and motioned for our server to come out for a moment.  I showed her the sign and asked why we were not offered this menu when we were seated.  She said it was usually on all the tables and gestured (to 10 tables with no lunch menus on them).   So I said, we just spent $30 on lunch, when we could have spent half that.  She offered to give us all our money back, but since the food was excellent, I said I just wanted to pay the lunch special price for our meals.  Some cash was refunded, but the experience left a bad taste in our mouth even though the server \"hoped we would come back\".  

I would have ordered quite differently if we had been given all the facts.  I might have tried a sandwich with my salad.  I might have gotten to taste that highly recommended rice.  I would have enjoyed an iced tea instead of water!   

Was that an attempt to get us to spend more by not offering the value lunch specials??   I saw two other tables that had ordered a variety of items, none of which were lunch specials either.   HMMMMM."}
{"text":"Has been good for years. The gryo plate is enough for 4. The chicken shish kebab is always tender.  I normally pick up and they always do a great to go. Ask for extra Gyro bread not just pita bread. It seems to be homemade and could be the best accompanying bread at any Mediterranean restaurant in the world !


10-06-17
Just an update. Picked up there last night and still wonderful. The gyro plate is enough four 5 people and the chicken kabob was some of the best tasting chicken I have ever had !"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  First time here and recommend to the restaurant from people who live in this area!  The Israeli salad was perfect and fresh!  The sampler platter was awesome!!!  Oh and the warmed baklava with honey and pistachios on too, to die for!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great meal all-around.  Was hoping for an authentic experience...and that is what we received from start to finish.  Really enjoyed the grilled lamb and chicken, with garlic sauce on the side, and a Turkish coffee to finish.

Service was attentive and friendly.  The staff was clearly proud of their food/restaurant, as they should be...

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great 'family' atmosphere and the FOOD is REALLY Great!!  
If you are taking someone there to impress them, the restaurant itself is nothing special, a little on the small side and plain seating. 

But when the food comes, you will be rewarded with an unbelievable meal. 
Although I am partial to the Gyros, the Kafta and rice (with golden raisins) are to die for!  

So go with an expectation of casual dining, with great food, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had just gotten off a plane from Greece and wanted to treat some friends helping us out...some of the best middle-eastern food we've had. From the first bite I knew someone's mom was in the kitchen cooking with extra TLC (and authenticity). Sure enough the owner mentioned her mom had prepared everything and puts together the menu. Loved it. Excellent middle-eastern food, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is our second time back here and i have no idea what took so long to come back!  I really like this place.  The place is small-maybe seating 40 people.  We were promptly greeted and waited just a few minutes for a table to be cleared for us.  We ordered a nice bottle of red wine, the dolmeh for an appetizer, Paul had the lamb kababs and I had the  Eden's grill chicken.  Both came with a fantastic rice with almonds and yellow raisins  and grilled veggies.  YUM.  Portions were large and we may end up splitting a lamb and chicken kabab in the future, but the good news is we have left overs!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a true sort of \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with great food and generous portions. I had the beef and lamb kabob plate and it was delicious. The lamb and beef were delicious and juicy with a whole bunch of great taste. They were served with a lot of rice and grilled onions, tomatoes, and peppers. My girlfriend had the ground beef kabob ( I don't remember the name) and that too was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Eden's Grill is out of the way from where we live but it's worth the drive and we'll definitely be back. Go here if you want a great meal, good portions, all in a simple laid back place. The only bad thing was that I was so full I was not able to finish my Turkish beer!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah, this is DEFINITELY my favorite Mediterranean place in the Valley. I don't get by here often enough but when I do they remember my preferences and give great service with plenty of spunk & personality. It's a little different - in the best way. 

I LOVE their vegetarian platter that comes with 4 stuffed grape leaves, 4 falafel & 3 veggie patties served with 2 grilled vegetable kabobs on a bed of their amazing rice cooked with slivered almonds and golden raisins. It comes with tzatziki & tahini sauce. YUM!!! It is enough food for 2 or 3 people.

Pros:
Delicious, good quality food made fresh
Large portions at a fair price
Prompt, friendly service
Well decorated and always clean

Cons:
Distance to restaurant from my home!"}
{"text":"AMAZING Authentic Food! Friendly service. Proud family owned and operated! Definitely a must try! There lunch specials are very affordable but very filling."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and was just looking for something I could take back to my hotel since I had had a long day of traveling and was very hungry.  I went with the tabouleh and combo skewers which ended up being enough food for two but the quality of the meat and the flavors they created were very good.  I also liked the quaint atmosphere they had there."}
{"text":"Looooove this place.  I have to come here every time I visit Phoenix.  The rice with raisins and almonds, the baba ganoush, the hummus, the dolma, the falafel, the veggie patties... it's all so delicious and vegetarian-friendly (although they have plenty of meat options for the carnivores). The portions are HUGE, so come hungry, share, and/or make room in your fridge for leftovers.  Eden's Grill is staffed by a super nice family, and even though I'm not a regular, I feel like one whenever I go."}
{"text":"The d√©cor at Eden's Grill is basic, but the food is anything but. This is quality Mediterranean dining, as evidenced by walls lined with New Times Best of Phoenix awards from years past. The pita bread is fresh and the portions served are huge. You rarely see a party leaving without at least one or two containers of leftovers. Many regulars evident. There is a small outdoor dining area. Not sure if its dog friendly, but I suspect it may be only reluctantly.

I don't care for the five dollar fee to split an entre. Most dinner entrees are about fifteen bucks and the serving sizes are large, so sharing is a rationale approach for all but the most robust of appetites. Also don't expect a warm welcome if you try to order portions of the menu al a carte. I think it's fine to bring your kids here, but I don't sense that kids are encouraged. They did throw in extra pita bread upon request with our leftovers on a recent visit. Nice. Any complaints are really very minor in comparison to the strengths of the restaurant. 

This small family owned and operated establishment is definitely worth experiencing."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant .  The owners are great.
We went in last week for dinner. We usually take out but decided to order in.   The Lentil soup is the best ever.  We shared a kabob.  We took 2 desserts home. 
It was a great Sunday night.  

We are going to take out tomorrow night!!! 
Yummy. 

Food and service are great!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Middle Eastern restaurants I've been to here in Phoenix. I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for the fact that they don't turn on the ac or they set it way too high when the owner is there."}
{"text":"Eden's Grill is a gem in Phoenix.  A diamond in the rough if you will.  It's truly a shame there aren't more deliciously amazing family-owned restaurants like this in Phoenix.  

From the moment you walk in you're welcomed by a member of the family, usually the father who is working the dining room.  This hospitality lasts until you leave.

Their rice is truly a standout with almonds and raisins mixed in.  Hummus is amazing.  Chicken kabobs are always tender and juicy.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here!

If you're nice to them, they might even give you a complimentary baklava for dessert!"}
{"text":"I love Eden's Grill Inn.  The food, the owners, the lunch special's....everything!  It is, without a doubt, some of the best Mediterranean food in town.  Their gyros are the real deal. A perfectly prepared pita, lots of seasoned beef and lamb, fresh onion and tomato. A side of creamy goodness and some of the best rice I have laid my lips upon and you've got yourself one mighty fine meal.  The gyros, chicken and beef kebab combination ($33) says it feeds two, but I think it would be more than enough for six NFL players or eight midgets...I mean, little people ( approximately seven average sized humans).  What a smokin' deal!  

Trust me when I tell you that you are doing your self a disservice if you don't check out Eden's.  They will not disapoint!"}
{"text":"I got turned onto Eden's Grill when my car club did a group dinner here a couple months ago. I have gone the opposite direction of home from work at least 4 times since to pick up dinner.  The food is ridiculous! The Gyro dinner fed me for 2 extra days.  The Chicken Kebab is all kinds of awesome and feeds me for two days.  I am not normally a rice person regardless of the culture of the food but their rice is fantastic! I literally want to shove the whole plate in my mouth. I have never had Baklava so good.  Only dined in once but the service was great and they are always super friendly when I pick up my #1 to go."}
{"text":"Great lunch special prices.  Went with nephew who suggested it and he was right...good food at very reasonable prices. We had gyros sandwich lunch special with fries and soda for 7.95.
Service was good even though busy for lunch and only 1 server...poor woman was running around taking orders, refilling drinks, cash register and to go orders...what a pro she was.
Portions for gyros were awesomely huge too. Well worth going..I sure am glad I did."}
{"text":"A tiny place in a nondescript strip mall. You wouldn't think to look twice at it but I tell ya...it's AMAZING! Hubby had the lamb special and I had the Moroccan chicken. Both were great but the Moroccan chicken was actually to die for! Portions are HUGE so expect to have leftovers the next day. (I believe it's $5 extra to split  something so just go with having leftovers you won't regret it) I'm not a leftover kinda girl but I hoarded these leftovers like you wouldn't believe. The owner is the cook and the daughter is the waitress. The sweetest women ever. The rest of the staff was fun too!  We had a party of 11 so it could have been a handful but they handled it well and made it fun!  Quick tip. ...the place is tiny so make a reservation if you have a large group. Our group of 11 took up half the restaurant.  :)"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place. When we walked in I became a little worried. It didn't seem family friendly (no kids menu). It was small and kind of quiet. While I was delighted to see \"ask about gluten free\" on the menu (for me), I also saw \"everything comes with rice with almonds and raisins.\" My son has an egg and nut allergy. But when we asked about cross contamination of nuts in the food, the server confidently assured me there would be no issues. And I believed her whole heartedly. She was a lovely lady and very sweet to my son. The food was fantastic and everything turned out great."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. I brought my elderly grandparents, who aren't big on greek, and they had a great time. The sergice was attentive, and thought was put into every dish. 

Most Greek/Mediterranean places tend to overflavor their food, I thought Eden balanced the flavor of their chicken brilliantly with just a compliment of nice spices. Their salads were fresh, and the falafel was cispy outside and fluffy inside. I would absolutely go back...and congratulations to the owner on opening a nice, quaint business."}
{"text":"I love love their gyros. The lamb is the best by far.  I definitely would recommend this place.  The place is a small hole in the wall type of feel,  but food is amazing."}
{"text":"Food deserves five stars.  Service deserves zero.  The shorter sister is a total a-hole.  I've never had such rude service.  I'm not a big yelper (in fact this is the first review I've ever written), but her inappropriate behavior (like tossing the bill on our table without a word and walking away) and rude comments (like when she asked us if we wanted desert and my boyfriend started telling me that he already had ice cream earlier and she chimed in with \"a simple yes or no answer is all I wanted\" then walked away looking irritated ???) Makes me never want to go back again."}
{"text":"I did not find this establishment to be as good as the hype/reviews. It certainly was not terrible, but quite mediocre. 
Service was lacking..
....often times the server would be asking me questions about what I want or need from the other side of the room, which is kind of strange and a little unprofessional. The rice had a lot of excess grease. With all of the great options, it is not a place I find worth returning to."}
{"text":"Best food and service in town, my family has been coming here for years now and we can never get enough it's the best food and service you'll find in a Mediterranean restaurant. The food is truly as authentic as can be and the atmosphere warm and cozy, they really know how to make you feel apart if the family. Definitely recommend this place anytime for any occasion."}
{"text":"At first, I was skeptical that this place was going to be another over-prices Mediterranean restaurant.  The options on the menu are nothing different than any other at first blush. But the difference is in the dolmehs! The serving sizes are very generous. The rice is delicious. The dolmehs and hummus were both amazing! 
I had the gyros. My dinner mates had the Eden Chicken and the the Lamp/Chicken kabob combo. We had leftovers for lunch the next day. I even got a cucumber sauce to go without asking."}
{"text":"Bar none the best Middle Eastern food in Arizona. It is truly home-cooked because the cook is \"mama\" in this family owned restaurant. Portions are very generous but also so delicious you have to try it to know what I am saying. This past weekend we catered my son's 18th birthday party with Eden. The food was every bit as delicious as when we come to eat at the restaurant. Very charming spot nice for a date any night of the week. The regular clientele speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Loved the food in the little neighborhood shopping center.
The people that own the restaurant are delightful and very
helpful.
It's busy and well worth the trip from Scottsdale.
We've been there twice and plan to return."}
{"text":"The food is better than when it's busy. It is priced very reasonably and the portions are generous. This is not a place for a romantic diner. It doesn't have that type of atmosphere. The atmosphere is quaint, with a few small tables scattered in the small dining area. No class but decent food.  
The beef in the kabobs are hit or miss for each piece. You may get pieces that are really tough and others that are tender. Not sure that they are cooked to order; If you order medium then some pieces are well done, while others are bloody inside. The rice is great and always a big hit.
It is not unique in any sense as Mediterranean restaurants go but nice to have as an alternative to some others."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love this place. The dining room may not look like much but the food is incredible. Family owned with great service and huge portions of food. If you like Mediterranean food, stop in and try it. It will change your life."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 2.5 stars. But I am. I believe half of the experience is the food, the other half is the service. The food is definitely 5 star quality, but the service is terrible. I've been here many times and have had some good service, but there are times when I get an extremely rude server/hostess. It's quite uncomfortable. I'd love to keep coming here for the amazing food, but not if the waitstaff treats their customers as if they are a total bother. I also really don't want to see any eye-rolling because our party of two hasn't decided on a meal after being seated for two seconds!  If you frequent here enough, you will witness this. No thanks."}
{"text":"If you want some of the greatest Greek/Mediterranean food, go here! Their yellow rice with cranberry and almonds is so delicious and also very hard to impossible to find at other Greek restaurants at this quality. Everything I've tried here is just amazing. The environment is nice and quaint and they have all the awards they've won on the wall for customers to look at. The service is usually good, sometimes you can tell when the waitress is having a bad day but we all have bad days right? But they do recognize you if you come in often so it's nice when they treat you like regulars. Love this place! Haven't found a replacement for Edens Grill since I left Phoenix just because of their amazing rice!"}
{"text":"Eden's is a classic mom and pop American story. Immigrated from Iraq this family is born to make delicious food. The mom has a super secret recipe for rice which she will pass on to her children only through her will.  The sister is kind, warm and knowledgeable. The brother is the brains and the cool who does a great job. He's always creating new dishes to push your tastebuds. Very authentic food. Good food. Great people."}
{"text":"Outstanding Middle eastern cooking!  Vegetable platter was delicious.  Little atmosphere but the service is very friendly and helpful and the food is excellent.  One of our favorites.  Well worth the one hour drive from Surprise."}
