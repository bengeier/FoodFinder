{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago during lunch on a weekend since it's close to my place.  I can safely that I have eaten sushi in many places and I know what good presentation, service and flavour should be. Unfortunately this spot was lacking in all three.  However, I will start with positives:
-good location
-portion size for an AYCE is decent.

Unfortunately that's all I have on positives.
Sadly, the service was horrid. There was one other small group of customers there (a table of three) and the server was not very attentive to either.  
The chef's lack of creativity was evident in his platting and the overuse of rice and lack of ingredients was a bit disappointing.
The flavours were poor and the sashimi sizing was quite small.
I will go back one more time to see if it was a one-time occurrence and will post if that is the case.  However, for now, I would suggest"}
{"text":"I was in this place twice. What can I say, the first time was very good. The sushi, tampura, everything I tried was very good. The service was average minus [I asked for glass of water and never received it]. The d√©cor was not very inviting, black and red very heavy and depressing. 
The second time I went there it was a total disaster, it was late at night one hour before closing time and you could feel that the staff just waited to close the place. 

But the major problem occurred when I ordered 6 pieces of salmon sashimi from all you can eat menu and received around 16 pieces. I was surprised but did not say anything, I thought because this was the end of the day the chef wanted to make us feel good. Indeed I was surprised when after several minutes came the chef and apologized that he made a mistake and gave us too many pieces. He also asked if he can take part of them back. Astonished, I of course said yes, next was total DISASTER he came to my plate, stick both of his hands in to my plate and took most of the sashimi, leaving around 6 pieces on the plate. I felt disgusted, never in my life in a restaurant or when visiting friends I saw such appalling behaviour. I was in such a shock I could not speak. 
Needless to say that I lost my appetite.
I will not return to this place, they lost me as a customer. We all make mistakes, and there are ways to approach and fix the situation. 
In addition I am almost sure that this salmon find itself on somebody else's plate the next day."}
{"text":"I have been there a total of 5 times. The first three times were brilliant. Friendly, attentive staff and beautifully prepared food. I raved about it to everyone. 
   Then comes the fourth visit. I brought an entourage to show off my new find. Mistake. Food-wise it was average. Not everything arrived as it should, what did arrive was ok at best and the service was about the worst I have ever experienced.  I could go on and on about how terrible it was, but you get the idea. 
   I am a trooper. I really believed in this place and ventured to go there one more time. Surely the prior visit was just an off night. Not so much. It started with us having to wipe down the table ourselves...and it was all down hill. 
so sad. 
Back to Masa."}
{"text":"I went here on their opening night. It was 15 bucks all you can eat sushi/sashimi buffet. It even included a pop! The food however was horrible and I wanted to order 10 pops just so I can make up for my 15 bucks. Fried tofu, sushi, sashimi, everything!!! I'm not picky at all, but this restaurant has to change their chef or something before they run out of business. :S"}
{"text":"I was impressed with Oishii based on quality/price ratio, which is key for comparing the hundreds of sushi places in Toronto.

Unfortunately Oishii has taken the space of Kaiseki-Sakura, an incredible traditional Japanese restaurant, but let's not compare a high-end traditional Japanese eatery to a place that offers $20 AYCE (after opening special 10% off), which is what my date and I ordered.

We were impressed with the quality of the ingredients used in the spicy salmon maki, white tuna sashimi, crab roe hand roll, and unagi hand roll. Salads were basic with below average base ingredients, but the dressing was quite good. Tempura was tempura, it's hard to screw up or make amazing. We also had a salmon sushi pizza, which was interesting. It's the fried rice base topped with small cubes of salmon tossed in a spicy sauce.

I wouldn't say to choose Oishii if you have to go out of your way, but if you're around Church/Wellesley and looking for a quick sushi fix Oishii will fit the bill quite nicely."}
{"text":"Mazui! About half the stuff wasnt very appealing, half of it alright. Gyudon wasnt bad, but not as good other restaurants. Some of the sushi was subpar IMHO

Would maybe give it another try again, but wouldnt recommend it"}
{"text":"Fabranak was full. It was a Friday night, around 7:00PM. I had arranged to have my dinner there. I was excited, full of hope and expectations filled by the reviews of my fellow Yelpers. To my disappointment, we arrived a bit too late.

With my head hanging low like a droopy and wilted flower, I had no hope of finding another restaurant which would bring me back to par. Oishi Sushi, across the street, certainly wasn't the best rebound choice we could have made.

I looked it up on Yelp before entering. My brothers and our girlfriends all anxiously waited for the results. \"Ummmmm... two stars...ish?\" I said.
Well there was room inside. It was clean, super hungry and we sorta wanted Japanese food. So with a leap of faith, we went for the terrible ride.

By no means does my rating reflect the service or setting. Both were decent. It was a medium sized restaurant, almost the size of 3 Wow sushi's or 3 Bimbim Qs. I know that doesn't help too much but just bare with me. We debated whether to try the opening special discount for AYCE for $28. I made the executive decision of saying no, and instead ordered a few appetizers and rolls to share.

Everything we had was mediocre at best. Fried tofu, was below Dim Sum standards. Edamame were, well, edamame enough to not complain. The rolls were small however. Freshness was not an issue, just portion size and price.

One of our rolls came 8 mins. after we had finished all others. That was the best roll, the oishi sushi roll. But I could only imagine if the restaurant was slightly busy, we would have waited for eternity.

Here is the take-away. I was still hungry after a $20/person bill of 6. I wasn't that hungry to begin with, the rest were but I'm the biggest eater...
The portions are small and each roll is about 10-15 bucks. Not worth the time or money if you ask me. Venture down a bit on Church and you'll find better tastier food for more bang for the buck."}
