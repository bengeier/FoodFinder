{"text":"This is my favorite sit down Mexican restaurant in the Dane County area.  The staff is so friendly, the food is amazing.  I was spoiled by real Mexican cuisine in Arizona for years and this place is as close if not better!  It is affordable, it is pleasant and I thank them for setting up house in Stoughton."}
{"text":"One word: awful. Awful sugary margaritas, awful plastic-y food, awful awkward service, awful creepy Mexican mouse.  Do not subject yourself to this."}
{"text":"Very good! Service is excellent! The owners are so friendly and personable! Chips and salsa are what bring me back!! Fresh and delicious! Arroz con pollo or their fajitas are my favorites, but you honestly can't go wrong! Check it out, and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is the best salsa in Dane County.   It has wonderful friendly service with ownership that loves their customers.   They have the best chicken tacos and bean burritos.  Lunch deals are quick and a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"You will not be sorry you drove in from Madison, or wherever. This is some of the most consistently awesome mexican food you can find in the area.

I am really picky about how I like my chili verde, and these guys make it just right.

If you are looking for mexican, this is the one you want to check out.

My only gripe is that when we ordered for delivery, the salsa did not taste as fresh as it did when we ate in. Thats not enough to stop me from ordering again."}
{"text":"El Rio Grande is the best Mexican restaurant in the area.  I have not had a meal there yet that I was disappointed in.  Their salsa is the reason my 7 year old daughter loves salsa now.  Their rice and beans are so good.  Really...their food is amazing.  I totally recommend El Rio Grande."}
{"text":"This place is super! Cute, friendly, quick service. I tried the BBQ quesadilla not wanting to exceed my expectations... Do Yummy! And the Pico, oh my... So GOOD! The liberal use of cilantro here is fantastic. I can't wait to come back and work my way through the enchiladas!"}
{"text":"The best to get food in the madison area. The service is fantastic and the owner is hands on. Food is beyond any other Mexican food in the area. My wife and I come here a couple times a month and everything we try is great. Cadillac margarita is the best margarita around!"}
{"text":"The food is not good and they raised prices way too high because they think that they are the only Mexican food restaurant in stoughton and as soon as the other mexican restaurant closed in town they raised their prices, stopped delivery and give less food. The shrimp was so disgusting it was gritty tasting. On top of that I know a worker that has been in their kitchen to look at their equipment and he said the kitchen was absolutely disgusting. the atmosphere is so dusty and they have lamps and there without the glass on them the carpet is filthy and it is really looking like some place I would never eat again I don't trust the cleanliness either"}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada tacos.  Normally I dont eat the rice and beans at Mexican restaurants but their rice and beans are well prepared and delicious.  Very good service.  I always feel taken care of here.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of my favorite Great, fresh food. Fun casual atmosphere. Great service.  Love it!"}
{"text":"loved the food, and loved our waiter. we tend to go at the same time when we go, so we always get the same waiter, and he always remembers what we got last time. As far as mexican restaraunts in ohio goes, this one is def pretty yummy. The chips and salsa are great and fresh, and I loved their vegetarian quesadilla. I have also gotten the enchiladas and bourritos, and they are very good. we go there often :)"}
{"text":"This place is about 2 blocks from our house and we are starting to visit every other week on average. I've been in to eat once and had take out 4 times. Overall this place is great. Staff is very friendly, even taking the time to have a 5 minutes discussion about fine tequilas with me when I asked for a good sipping tequila. (ps. I bought my own bottle of what the owner suggested, it was that good) 

Food: 4/5 - food is really good, but not the best I've had in Madison (I'm originally from Texas, so I'm picky). Variety is on the better side, not overwhelming and not skimpy. Their salsa could be better, but their queso dip is pretty awesome.

Staff: 5/5 - very nice, quick and the owner took time to explain their different tequilas when I asked for a really good sipping tequila to sooth my throat while I was sick. 

Ambiance/Facility: 4/5 - restaurant is clean and there seems to be enough space. The one time I went it was at 1pm on a Wed...not a good time to test the capacity. Outside it looks like a liquor store and the parking lot is a bit worse for wear. But the place is overall cheery.

Look forward to making this place our go to when we get lazy around dinner time."}
{"text":"Good, solid food.  If you're just looking to go out to dinner and have a reliably pleasant experience, this is the perfect place.  I'm a particular fan of the Chorizo y Queso and the guacamole.

Like the rest of Stoughton, they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican Resturant around!!  Service is excellent and all the staff is super friendly!!   Great place"}
{"text":"I had dinner at this place last friday. The ratings for this place made me hesitate but I took the chance. The place has great ambiance, right portion size, good tasting fresh food & ample parking. We tried the lobster item & #F. The flan dessert was excellent.

The approach to this place is the tricky part, watch out for sign once you enter the complex from mayfield rd."}
{"text":"The ultimate restaurant graveyard!  Don't blink as this place will be gone in a week to be replaced by another patheitic slop shop."}
{"text":"We really disappointed in El Rio Grande last night, which I hate to say because we've visited several times a year for the past five years or so. The food has always been fine-- reliable, inexpensive Mexican food. Last night at 7 PM, we ordered two entrees for carry out and were told it would be ready by 7:30. The food wasn't brought out until 7:45 and the restaurant closes at 8 PM-- this would normally not bother me. However, we ordered the burrito Mexicano with shredded beef. Here's the description from the menu: \"A burrito stuffed with your choice of shredded beef or pork, with cheese sauce, burrito salsa, lettuce, tomato, cheese and generous portion of guacamole on top.\" The burrito section of the menu says \"Served with a side of  rice and beans.\" Honestly feel like they ran out of food by 7:30 and did not want to prepare anything before closing at 8 PM. It was a wet tortilla filled only with greasy ground beef--not shredded beef as advertised. There was no rice and no beans. There was maybe a teaspoon of guacamole mixed into the lukewarm wilted lettuce. I almost did not notice that there was any guac at all. The burrito was lukewarm at best. I did not feel safe eating it because it felt like it had been sitting out for a long time. I had one bite and threw the rest in the trash. Unfortunately, they were closing by the time we could go back and ask for a refund or new food. It was disappointing because they usually do a fine job-- but I really feel like they gave us the scraps from the bucket last night."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times while up in WI for work.  The food is more \"tex-mex\" it seems and I have no complaints!  The chips and salsa are awesome, the cheese dip is addicting, and the main course food is great too!  I can't compare to other restaurants in the area, however I very much enjoyed my meals at this restaurant and recommend it to anyone who lives nearby!"}
{"text":"Based on the decor and the menu, I believe this restaurant is affiliated with El Rodeo in Parma Hts. And the experience was similar: 

Dinner starts with fresh chips, excellent salsa, and some of the sweetest margarita I've ever had -- the traditional flavor is served with both lime and orange slices, and has a strong orange flavor, which some may find appealing but comes on far too sweet for me.

As at El Rodeo, I had the molcajete for dinner: essentially a hash of steak, chorizo, onions, peppers and cilantro. And as at El Rodeo, it proved a fantastic combination of flavors, not too spicy, served in a sizzling rock bowl. Unfortunately, this time the steak was very overdone, almost leathery, which really detracted from the overall experience. Fortunately the standard refried-beans-and-rice side was solidly above average.

I got the impression that El Rio Grande's menu was a slight bit more authentic than El Rodeo's, but it still sits firmly in the Americanized-Mexican genre. That's not a complaint, just information so you know what you're getting into. 

Reading the other reviews, I'm happy to say that our server was absolutely excellent. Attentive and timely. But it was also a little disconcerting that the place was utterly deserted. To be fair, it's in an absolutely ridiculous location: you can see it from the highway, but have to wind behind a shopping plaza to get to it. Unfortunately, while this is a solid place that's worth going to if you're in the area, it just wasn't above-average enough to be worth a special trip."}
{"text":"This place prepares authentic Mexican food, including some great specials, at very affordable prices.  The service is reliable and friendly.  Parking is at a premium on busy nights.  They also deliver!"}
{"text":"So...the 1 star that I'm giving this place is for the decor and the waiter because he was very kind. It's sad because I seriously doubt that this place and therefore his job will be around very long! To keep it short and sweet, the food was terrible. Starting with the watered down salsa and tortilla chips. A Mexican restaurant with bad salsa and chips?? I should have taken heed and left before I wasted my money on the entrees. Next, the $4 queso dip....GROSS! I'm not even sure it was real cheese.  As we waited (all of about 4 minutes from the time we ordered) for our entrees to come out, the manager came by to ask how things were so far and I expressed my dissatisfaction with the queso dip. He pretty much didn't know what to say so to break the awkward silence, I said well hopefully the food is better and he simply walked off. The food comes out lukewarm on a scalding hot plate. My entree, the Matador lunch special had one chicken burrito and one beef enchilada.  The beef was extremely greasy, lacked seasoning and was ground up very fine like a paste of some sort. The chicken was so dry that after one bite, which had to be chased with water just to swallow it, I gave up entirely on the meal. My son had opted for a pork burrito and after he bit it, the look on his face said it all. I tried a small bite and the pork was tough, not seasoned and tasted extremely gamey. I honestly would not have fed any of that food to my dogs. 

When the waiter came back, I asked for the check. He didn't ask how the food was, I'm assuming because our plates were full yet we declined boxes. As he got the boxes, the manager came back over and asked how we liked the food. I told him that we didn't and he asked for specifics. I gave the details above and referred to the food as \"Taco Bell\" served on a plate to which he replied \"all of our food is made from scratch\". I just laughed and gathered my things to leave. Doesn't matter much if it's made from scratch if it tastes like crap."}
{"text":"I got the Marina Fajitas. On the menu, it's described as containing crab, scallops, and shrimp. Thinking it was most likely imitation crab, I decided to forgo the crab.

My co-worker joked that I was brave for ordering seafood from a Mexican joint but I was undeterred. As I write this, yes I'm alive and well. Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the dish actually was. touché!

The dish came with shredded iceberg lettuce, fresh pico de gallo, rice and refried beans in a separate container. Four soft flour tortillas were wrapped in a separate foil.

Amazing for the value, as I easily got two meals and a snack out of the whole deal.

The scallops were cooked perfectly, lightly seared on each side and no hint of fishiness. The shrimp came with the tail off, and deveined! *insert halo emoji* this is a huge pet peeve of mine, (ahem Cheesecake Factory!). Not only that, but again it was cooked perfectly - not rubbery at all, and I was impressed at the size of these things. Check out my photos and see for yourself! The ratio of scallops and shrimps were hugely in favor of the vegetables, which consisted of slices of green peppers, onions, and chunks of tomato.

Thank you El Rio Grande for restoring my faith in Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant! The food is consistently tasty and at a fair price. They have a large vegetarian selection all of which is tasty. They have the best tasting re-fried beans of anywhere else I have tried!!!! Being a vegetarian this is very important. My favorite is the Veggie fajitas but when I go with meat eaters they all rave about the Chimi aca pocco or chicken chimichanga.  It is family owned and the Brothers that own it are extremely friendly and eager to please. I have eaten there many many times and the one time I went and my dad did not enjoy his entree he informed the staff and they apologized over and over and made him something else and comped his meal. They are often adding new and different things to the menu and have a real passion for making there customers happy. I recently moved to Colorado and I am missing El Rio so much!!!! We still have not found a restaurant that even remotely compares."}
{"text":"I know a ton of people love this place and I can't blame them the environment is great and food is fresh. However, for me personally I feel like I've had much better. Anything with shrimp is bland, the salsa just isn't good to me, and despite trying something different every time I go, I have yet to find something I really like. I've been going here on and off for a year, but I'm willing to drive somewhere... anywhere else for Mexican food.

UPDATE: 

Ok, I finally found something that I love. 

Pollo Rio Grande, I just can't figure out how they make the chicken taste so amazing. I love adding shrimp to this meal just so that I have more to swim in the cheese sauce that is SO GOOD. 

Also, their guacamole, SO GOOD, and did you know you can buy it in a pint sized container to go! Perfect for when you have a get together with family and friends and you need a last minute appetizer, however I do suggest adding a little extra salt to it when you get it home. 

I also like the little updates they have done in the last couple months. They've managed to make the place look a little more clean and up to date."}
{"text":"What a gem in Stoughton. Visited this bright little restaurant on a recent Friday night, impulsive day night. The place is bigger in there than it looks outside; booths, tables, a small bar, and stage. I loved the bright paint, decor, and music. Staff was ridiculously nice, overly accommodating, and small town conversational but not annoying. 4 different employees approached us, one perkier than the last.

We tried out their house margaritas to start. Typically I avoid these like the plague due to their using a mix but El Rio staff insisted they use real lime. The premium was served up and was quite a bit more - nah. House was perfectly fine, particularly with their acknowledging my request for extra salt. Beers were also satisfying.

I ordered Enchiladas Michoacan. I never order enchiladas since I don't love corn tortillas but this dish was killer. Pulled pork inside, green salsa, cheese sauce, chorizo outside. Rice. Beans. So rich. My partner ordered a burrito smothered in cheese sauce. The sauce was incredible; I'll be ordering the app version next time. The burrito itself was just ok. Guacamole app was very small so I won't bother with that, but I absolutely appreciated the free chips and salsa throughout the night."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a place to eat and spotted El Rio Grande. She had been craving Mexican for weeks at this point, so there was no doubt we had to give it a try. 

When we walked in, we almost turned around because there was clearly no one in sight and when we came to the door, the host almost jumped out of his skin from excitement. He asked if we were there to eat or to get applications...not sure what that means. Anyways, we sat outside because it was a perfect day for it and our server was really nice (though I think he was forced to serve, since there seemed to be an exchange between him and the host about servers calling off--maybe that's why they wanted to hire us). 

Our food was pretty good and the drinks were tasty (though they could have been stronger in my opinion). Nothing to rave about as far as Mexican goes. The salsa has definitely been approved, though, which is good since that's the only thing I'm SUPER critical about. It was de-lish. 

Complaints/oddities: The backs of the chairs were back so far that I felt like I was at the dentist. We also had to walk back through the dining room to get to the car, which felt weird since it was like we were parading through the now semi-full restaurant. The host almost turned us away with his kind of creepy excitement, especially since this place is sort of secluded/hard to get to and away from. When I ordered green sauce on flautas it was way different from the green sauce that came on my to-go order of enchiladas for my boyfriend. Also, the enchiladas seemed to be full of spinach, and I'm guessing this is because they never even asked what I'd like inside of them. 

I'd definitely give this place another chance, and if it flops again, oh well. At least I ate more of that salsa."}
{"text":"Yep, El Rio Grande is very good if not great.  Our most recent visit was on a Saturday night and we were greeted promptly at the door.  As the hostess checked on a table for us another very pleasant person asked if we were being taken care of.  Nice.  I got the \"special dinner\" and there is no way I could have finished it all!  Not after all the  complementary chips and salsa, that's for sure.   Dined with three vegetarians and a picky eight year old and everyone walked away happy.  The waiter ran his tail off making sure everything was perfect.  So value for the dollar this is a excellent choice, tons of very tasty food and excellent drinks, try the Cadillac Margarita, awesome!"}
{"text":"Five stars for service and three for the food.  We went for an early lunch on Sat and were not overly impressed with the food itself.  If not for the excellent service I think that we would not come back again."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  I had the arroz con pollo and ended up getting 4 meals out of it, so a great value IMO.  Everything came out quickly and was hot and fresh tasting.  The parking lot looks small but the inside is rather big.  We had no trouble finding a table."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Stoughton!  Lunch is super fast service.  Food is always hot and delicious.  The salsa and Pico are on point. Family friendly run by a wonderful family. Service is excellent..prices are very reasonable.  Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for a date lunch.  The food was pretty good.  The atmosphere was alright.  This place is always packed and parking can be an issue, but it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Good value for money. Eaten here for 11 years, never had a bad meal or Margarita for that matter!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the reviews saying that this place is cheap. I paid $10 for a plate of refried beans and a tortilla drenched in fake cheese. I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dead stop on Wisconsin highway.

Sitting long enough to start looking for something to eat, on yelp, of course!   

That's how I found this place.  Yelp reviews were strong and I figured I could get there if I got off at the next exit, if ever we moved again.   So sometime later and after some quite lovely back roads I arrived here.  However, this place is not very far off the highway, perhaps 4 miles or so.  

It was busy at 4:30 in the afternoon.  It's a big place on the inside.  I was seated at a nice booth, they have a few and then one of those great larger round ones too.  

The menu was fairly robust, and I choose nachos thinking they sounded terrific and perhaps would be perfect to get back on the road.  

Waitress was funny and engaging.  

The nachos were HUGE.  I could not even come close to finishing them.  But they were terrific.  I ordered a mix of chicken and steak after discussion with the waitress and that was a good idea.  The protein was not my favorite part though.  The nachos and toppings were really really good.  Its been years since I have had nachos and after these I may wait years for more, not sure anything will compare.  

If you want a taco or anything else as well, you can order a half order of nachos if you like.  I found that out after I got them, and thankfully I had ordered only those.  Ask for jalapenos.  Nice service.  Pleasant all around. 

I have two things I'd think about changing.  You pay at exit.  So much easier to pay the waitress.  And the parking is not great.  At all. But they can't make a bigger lot so if you see a full lot, look for street parking.  Its worth it."}
{"text":"Thanks to Chy L's review my son and I stopped in.  Agree with other Yelpers this is probably the best Mexican around Madison. 

The shrimp and scallops were excellent. Cleaned, cooked but not over-cooked. Not overly fishy.

My son got the amazing pork. Enough for a meal and a lunch and cooked perfectly. 

Reasonable prices. Good margaritas. 

Chips could have been warm and salsa alternatives offered, but overall great service, great food and a great value."}
{"text":"Eh, I tend to be rather forgiving of mexican resturants. You get a lot of food for pretty cheap. With that in mind this place is decent, about what I would expect. The atmosphere is decent, the open layout makes the place noisy,but,that is both a good and bad thing at the same time. 
The food is ok, the lowest point for me and the reason for the three stars. Nothing was wrong with,it, but nothing was worth writing about either. Except the salsa. It was just right, I had three bowls of the stuff and poured it onto my food as well. Made fresh on site. The chips are baked, which at first I did not like but they grew on me. 

My suggestion, try it for yourself, but I can understand both the high marks and the low marks."}
{"text":"Love this place more every time I come.

When you first sit down, you'll be treated to chips and salsa.  The salsa is delicious, but forgo it and get some guacamole if you don't like cilantro.  Chips are warm from the oven.

Quesadillas are yummy.  Cheese is melty.

All of their enchiladas are to die for.  Helpings are large.  We always joke that we get two meals whenever we come here.

Burritos are large and in charge."}
{"text":"I have been to a few good Mexican restaurants and this one makes it to the top 3 if I do say so myself. This is a place where portion sizes are actually taken into consideration and you get what you pay for. 

Nothing better than ordering whatever type of platter it was called where you get one of everything in extra large size. Every this is well cooked, the servers are awesome and the atmosphere is grand."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous poster, there is nothing groundbreaking here, but it is good.  Basic mexican food that is good and pretty reasonable prices.  The margaritas are goood, as are the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently.  The food and service are very consistent and very good.   My favorite is Super Burrito Fajita with the Cadillac Margarita.  Highly, highly recommend this place.  If you are from out of town and looking for a place to stop before a show at the opera house, El Rio is perfect."}
{"text":"I must start with 2 things known...
1. I'm an avid Mexican food lover from out of town, so I was eager to try a Mexican restaurant in Stoughton on my visit 
2. My dad's family here were against going because they'd already been and didn't like it 

I think everyone enjoyed the food. With a chef, two picky teenage girls and a Mexican food freak, we were all very happy with our meals. 

The staff provide great service, so overall, it's worth trying and going back"}
{"text":"Very yummy.  Portions so far have been good for the cost.  I love the salsa here - it is consistently delicious.  I finally tried the lunch buffet recently.  It was also very good.  Everything tasted fresh, and had a great flavor.  I was quite happy with the hot offerings, and jazzed them up with the salad bar offerings.  Mmmm... fresh cilantro?  Yes, please.  

It is difficult to find the place, it has an unfortunate placement in the parking lot.  You have to know it is the old Buca restaurant behind the plaza.  Perhaps signage at the front of the plaza could be added?  I work up the street, so I've known about the place a while now.  

Service has been good.  Sometimes, the waiter/waitress is difficult to understand, but if everyone is patient - it works.  Folks... let's recall that most of our relatives came to this country not speaking English.  Patience with folks learning a SECOND or THIRD language is a good thing.  Play nice.  :)"}
{"text":"Worth a trip. Steak tacos with cilantro and onion was the best I've had in a long time. Guacamole was fresh and the Cadillac marguerite made with Patron - perfection. Wonderful staff - won't disappoint !!!  6 STARS if I could give!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good people, good service. The owners are super nice and they truly care about customer satisfaction. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Let's get a few things said right off the bat. El Rio Grande is not a groundbreaking restaurant. You will not find things that you've never seen before at typical Mexican restaurants. What you will find -- however -- is a well executed \"been done before\" idea. The chips and salsa is to die for. I'm not sure if they put rum in the salsa but in my opinion, it is the best salsa and chips I have had in the area.

The Vegetarian options are friendly and accessible. I hate having to order a pork taco with no pork. I love being able to point at a Vegetarian combination option and its a done deal. The wait staff is generally  prompt. Only a couple times out of the many times I have been there did I find the wait too long either on food or service. They have grown some menu items lately as well such as the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which is delicious. 

Lastly, the prices are satisfactory. Besides the affordable lunch menu, dinner is also a treat. Soda is typical fare but they do also offer Jarritos last time I checked. They do have some drinks like margaritas but they are working on adding, what it looks like, is a full bar. If that pops up, it will definitely be interesting. Beware! Parking can be very difficult especially during peak times and you may be forced to park on the street if you are desperate. Despite that, there is usually more room inside then parking space.

But anyways, a place like this in a small town like Stoughton is a great option. It tastes wonderful, the prices are reasonable and you'll leave and want to come back -- the perfect recipe for a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The owners are amazing people. They have the best everything!You want to dine in a delicious, comfortable and friendly environment?
 Then go to El RIO!"}
{"text":"I always like a place that seats you way in the back and forgets to wait on you. after 10 minutes of waiting we got up to leave and our hostess said thanks and hope you liked it. she couldn't remember she sat us there around 10 minutes before? 
so I can't really rate the food since I didn't get any but the service is horrible!"}
{"text":"great for a birthday party of 22 people. nice job. speedy G the mouse was wonderful as he had a grand cake entrance. food all came out quickly at the same time! we brought a pinata."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas - I know Mexican food!   I've been to lots of the Mexican Restaurants in Madison and El Rio Grande, although it may not have lots of Mexican trappings like serape's , burros and paintings of old old missions on the walls,had, the food was excellnet!  Best I've had in the Madison area. I never had a soft taco like this one - the soft shell was thick and soft and WONDERFUL and the tamale was edible, didn't burn my tongue off so much I couldn't eat it and VERY tasty. Also the Spanish rice did not come from a box or if it did, it was not like any boxed rice I ever tasted.  Also really liked their chips and salsa.  I would definitely go back and recommend it to friends. Friendly wait staff also."}
{"text":"Always so good! Friendly staff always seem happy, and the food is always consistant."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican I've had in Wisconsin. 

Owners/workers are extremely kind, dedicated, and thoughtful people.

If you are considering trying it out just go - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So I've come back 3 more times since my original review and haven't been disappointed yet. Crazy good!"}
{"text":"I'm from Las Vegas and I come to Stoughton this time every year with my wife to visit family. And I make it a habit to come here and get some of the best Mexican food. The food is so authentic, you'd thinking you where in Mexico."}
{"text":"Tried this place again after hearing good reviews. Just as bad as I remembered. The place has dirty carpet and drop down ceiling tiles that have dust and mold on them. My kids who normally love enchiladas did not like the ones here. My husband did not like that their rice had potatoes in it and said he wished we had just gone to Taco Bell. Also their \"vegetarian\" items that have rice are not really vegetarian since they use chicken stock. The waitress was very nice for what it's worth(reason for the 2nd star). Will not be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Restaurant.  It wouldn't be a trip to Wisconsin without stopping here."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area! I will take the drive to Stoughton for their salsa, rice and beans, and especially their Chimi Acapulco. The waitstaff is beyond friendly and I'm happy to contribute to the family owned restaurant. 

However, some of the booths need updating. The ripped seat covers don't look very professional and can be off putting for newer customers."}
{"text":"We used Yelp to find a good Mexican restaurant off Hwy 51 south of Madison.  This one had the best reviews, so we gave it a shot.  We were NOT disappointed!  The food was excellent and they even have gluten-free chips freshly made if you ask.  Staff was extremely friendly.  We travel on Hwy 51 frequently and look forward to stopping here again.  Thanks, Yelp, for helping us find this place."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican place! It is far from fancy, but the service is fast, the food is served hot and is yummy, and the prices are reasonable. Free chips and salsa. Try the chimmi acapaulco!"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday with my gentleman friend.  We used to go to the El Rodeo on Mayfield with moderate frequency for your general, moderately priced Americanized Mexican food.  Since they closed, we decided we'd stop here before our movie.  We arrived a bit later on Saturday evening, around 8:30.  The restaurant is HUGE, and it looks like they bought all of El Rodeo's furniture.  I'd say 15 percent of the restaurant's tables were full, which isn't good for a Saturday night at 8:30.  It was starting to look like it was going to storm Saturday night, but we decided to give the patio a try anyway thinking \"eh, there's umbrellas over the tables, and if it rains really hard we'll move.\" The hostess brings us out, and seats us at the one table without an umbrella.  Sweet!  
  The food was fine, my margarita was quite good, though my fiance thought his was too sweet. (I got the pink lemonade margarita that was on special and it actually had a decent tartness to it.  I was pleasantly surprised.)  The chips and salsa were good, also.  The prices seemed a bit higher than I remember El Rodeo's being, and the menu seemed quite a bit smaller.  But I did enjoy my meal, I got the fajita quesadilla dish and I frankly don't remember what my fiance got, but we both enjoyed it.  For two margaritas and two meals, we paid 30 dollars, which was a decent deal.  

Overall, the food was alright, the drinks were good, the service was alright, but nothing about this restaurant really stuck out to me.  I commented that it was basically El Rodeo with less delicious food and a worse location.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you are in the area, you could certainly do worse."}
{"text":"I recently found this restaurant, and I have to say that I've been pleased with it the several times I've been back since. 

The food is above average, I thought it was a little better than some of the fare at similar places. The fish tacos have been one of my favorites here. Like most Mexican restaurants, you get chips and salsa with your meal, and they got theirs right. The salsa was good without being too spicy or too mild, and the chips had a great fresh crispness to them. Drinks were a win as well. I usually have margaritas, and they have been good every time. (Try the \"Coronarita\" with the tiny Corona bottle in your drink!) 

The service is what took them up to 4 stars for me. The staff is friendly, and are always attentive. (They even did a great job of dealing with some difficult customer's who kid was wreaking havoc in the place) 

For a casual, low key Mexican dinner, or just for some drinks with friends, this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Some of the best mexican food you can find anywhere, and I've lived in CA, TX and CO. Joel Cervantes Macias is also a great man to boot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a date night just to try something different. Service was great, food was great, and the atmosphere was good aswell. I expected something along the lines of a bar atmosphere but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of families dining! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped into the restaurant yesterday to order take out. There was no one in the front to take our order, so I called the phone number on the menu to get someone to come up and acknowledge us. No one answered the phone. We sat there about 5 minutes longer and I decided to call the phone number again. It rang for an extensive period and someone finally answered. He apologized once I informed him that I was sitting waiting for someone to take our order and said that he was helping a customer in the back. I didn't see anyone, but whatever. The food has improved. The rice seemed fresh, which is a nice change of pace. Now if only they can get the food to taste decent and have nice service at the same time, we just might have a good restaurant on our hands. I keep hoping!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful food!  Best I've had in the area.  Great service too!  Can't wait to go back for margaritas!"}
{"text":"I really like these guys and hope they stay around for a while.  Its a great neighborhood Mexican place, that always has fast service when we're there.  Great outdoor patio, nice servers, and usually cheap Mexican beer.

The food is a 4/5, as its your standard Mexican small chain stuff-  but they do have a few unique innovations, and the portions are always large.  They get extra love from me for having a 'frequent dinner' program - I think your 5th dinner entree there is free.  We had a big event there with 20 people, and the served us all with no problem (we had a reservation.)   

Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! All of the staff are so great and friendly. We've had the owner a few times as our server and he couldn't be nicer. I've been here atleast a dozen times and always have a great experience.

Definitely recommend the enchiladas cancun! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Service is lackluster, I've sat for twenty minutes without so much as a drink at times. Chips are hit or miss, interior is dirty, and food is not very fresh or tasty. Since it's not any cheaper, go to Madison and save yourself a tummy ache."}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive from Madison! If you are looking for good quality Mexican food, you must try El Rio Grande. It may not look like much from the outside, or the inside but don't let that fool you.... The food is what you are there for anyways. 

After seated you are served complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa has great flavor and the chips are freshly made. You can't pass up their margarita's either. Typically I order mine on the rocks but this place I always choose frozen. They have 5-6 different flavors to choose from. If you are not a fan of salsa I highly recommend ordering their cheese dip (your traditional white queso). 

I could go on and on of all the amazing dishes to order but let me spare you and just name off a few. 
-A must try is their BBQ Pork Quesadilla, it is incredible and the portion size is huge! Make sure to order a size of rice & beans because the quesadilla's do not come with them and they are delicious. 
-The Chimi Acapulco, this sucker is HUGE, I mean it! I don't think I have ever came close to finishing it. It is loaded with grilled chicken, steak, shrimp, onions, tomatoes and green peppers, topped with their delicious cheese sauce.  

Lastly I want to say the owner is very down to earth, and make sure you are enjoying your food/dining experience. He also has a heart of gold, and actually started a GoFundMe page for an elderly ice pop vendor in Illinois that went viral raising over $300k changing that mans life. Kudos to you!!"}
{"text":"Well done!

It's amazing how clean and simple their dishes are and yet so perfectly executed that it can put shame to a lot other glitzy establishments. There is a homely feeling with their flavors that make your taste buds really happy!

We ordered a Chimi Acapulco and Enchiladas Michoacan, paired with their famous margarita. The Chimichanga was thankfully not drenching in oil and the cheese sauce on top paired very well with the carnival of flavors within the burrito itself. All meats and seafood were cooked just right and complimented the side dishes. The sides of beans and rice was amazing! I've never had beans that were mashed to the silkiness of mashed potatoes!! The rice were so flavorful that they could stand out as a dish as themselves.
The Enchiladas were equally impressive with the tanginess of the green salsa really working well with the chorizo bits on top and the pork itself.

The portions were generous, price good on value and service very pleasant!! I'd definitely recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fajitas I've found - anywhere.  Not sure what they cook the chicken it, but it's excellant!  A little pricey for fajitas IMO, but still my favorite!  Service is good, employee turn over has improved which I like to see as a customer. Chips and salsa are standard; cooked salsa - nothing great, being an authentic Mexican joint, I'd like to see fresh salsa I've seen in Mexico...but either way it's still decent.  Enchiladas Cancun is also very good, but a little chinsy on the shrimp."}
{"text":"Ok... Mixed review. I thought the food was very good, but the menu was a bit pricey for this type of Mexican food. And it's nice that they have $.99 drafts... But the service was absolutely terrible. It was almost like the waiter had way too many tables too far apart or something. That actually made it a bad overall experience.

But my wife liked the food so we will give it one more try sometime. Personally, I'm not looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I love the food, staff and how friendly they are. I have high standards for Mexican food and the menu is top notch.  I absolutely love the enchiladas. Cesar and his family are professional, courteous and the atmosphere is pleasant. my family loves this restaurant"}
{"text":"Reliable and cheap Mexican fare. I've eaten here twice now while visiting friends in Stoughton. I forget what I got the first time around, but I do remember it was yummy and the restaurant was clean and inviting. 

Tonight we got takeout. Still tasty, but not as good as I remember it - possibly because the beans were runny and they forgot to include my chicken taco. My friends were nice enough to give me one of theirs, and I was pleasantly surprised by the ground beef. I'm generally not a big fan, but ERG's was well-flavored and of fairly good quality.

It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area, but I wouldn't be disappointed to eat here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! The past few times we have eaten here were not impressive. The food was so bland. I have a few regular menu items I always order; chicken fajita taco salad, white cheese dip, chicken quesadilla, enchiladas, fajita quesadilla. Something has changed in the preparation of their food. If you are looking for food that has flavor go somewhere else. 

7/2017 Update: We took family from out of town here for lunch. There are only a handful of options in town. The staff was unsure about how the food was cooked or prepared. They couldn't answer questions about the food the were serving. It was embarrassing. Our cousin ended up getting sick within 30 minutes of eating lunch. I felt horrible and will never eat here again. The quality has never been the best but this was a total embarrassment."}
{"text":"I was excited to discover that El Rio Grande is, in fact, open, after reading Jeff T.'s review. But I'm less than excited about that now that I've eaten there. 

I went in last night - and they still don't have a liquor license. ¡Que lastimo! But to their credit, they let you know that right away - with a poorly hand written sign on the door. 

\"No ALCOHOL until further notice!\" 

That should have told me to high tail it somewhere else, but I'm all about trying new places. 

The decor is nice, although freakishly similar to a Mexican restaurant a few blocks away. (who knew there was such a market for brightly painted chairs with with suns and moons carved into them?) Since this restaurant is in a building that once housed a Buca Di Beppo, it's enormous on the inside. Maybe too enormous? All you see is a sea of tables, so even once more people recognize that this restaurant is open, I doubt that there will ever be a wait for a table. 

I wasn't a fan of the runny salsa and baked chips. Normally, I'd gobble down a couple servings of the stuff, but I only had a few scoops. The guacamole appetizer I ordered was a little bit better, but nothing I'd go out of my way to eat. 

Our server was anxious to get us to order our entrees but disappeared after that. Considering that there were a half dozen servers and maybe a dozen patrons, some drink refills would have been nice. 

There were quite a few vegetarian option son the menu, and my friend and I both ordered a vegetarian enchilada sampler - one guacamole enchilada, one cheese enchilada, and one vegetable enchilada. They were all \"meh\" at best. Guacamole in an enchilada sounds awesome, but it was kind of cold when it got to the table. The vegetables in the vegetable enchilada probably came in a freezer bag. And the cheese enchilada...it didn't really taste like anything. As an enchilada lover, this was a really disappointing meal. 

I'm hoping that things are just a little \"off\" at this restaurant because it just opened. I'm honestly in no hurry to go back there anytime soon, but I'd at least like to try their margaritas sometime."}
{"text":"So good, I'm dying to go back. I finished off a variety of our kids' dishes, but the carnitas I ordered was the stand-out. Sides of beans and rice were equally fantastic. Yum!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since I moved from Stoughton a few years ago and, thankfully, nothing has changed. I still get fish tacos and am always impressed! The chipotle sauce is the perfect spice to top off the plentiful filets of fish. Their rice and beans have always been one of my favorites. We decided to order cheese dip on the side and I'm glad we did. Large cup for just a few dollars. 

The staff is so friendly and their prices are more than fair. $3 margaritas on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Love this place! everything i could want from a local mexican place. the queso dip is amazing as are there strawberry margaritas!  the service was just ok but the prices and the food have always been good"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican in the area. I had the fajita suprema. Very simple dish to make. My steak was a crumbled gray mess. Employees tried to tell me that's how it cooks. No no not right at all. Food was comped but I don't think I can phathom going back and taking chances like that. Drink service was bad too. Service was lacking and taste was dead"}
{"text":"Our go to mexican. Sometimes it can be hit or miss but their cheese dip is good (most of the time sometimes you get flour nuggets in it) as is all the pork (every pork item ive had is GOOD). Your typical hometown mexican place."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago with my wife and 6 year old son. The service was very good - friendly staff. The food was great, but it was pricy for the portions we received."}
{"text":"This place just opened up last Friday and we happened to stop in the day of the Grande Opening.  The place was empty, disorganized, boozeless, and really difficult to get to.  You actually have to enter through an old bank drive thru, kind of.  There is a little tiny sign where you can turn but if you miss it, like we did, the next turn is into the old bank.

When we walked in it was as if the hostess was surprised to see us.  Instead of seating us closer to the door, she gave us a booth furthest away from the kitchen and sat us right next to the only other patrons in the place.  These girls were obnoxious.  The one was talking about how she doesn't have sex with white guys and every other word was an F bomb.  Our waitress knew of this and didn't even offer to move us.  That would have been the right thing to do.  Instead we just decided to eavesdrop just to see what this girl was going to say next.

The food was actually not bad at all.  The complimentary chips and salsa were fresh, obviously, but high notes go to the salsa.  I ordered off the a la carte menu because I can do without the rice and beans.  My dinner choice was 3 enchiladas, one beef, one chicken, and one bean.  The chicken was my favorite by far but the others do get high marks regarding taste.  I wish they would have put pablanos in all three not just the chicken.  I would also recommend more cheese on top.  Other then that, my food gets 4 stars.  The wife liked her enchilada but chose only to eat half of her burrito.  That could have used more cheese and sauce.  Given it was their first day, we'll let it slide...lol.

So my suggestion is to go there next week when they have booze.  Something tells me that they will be having an official Grand Opening once the liquor arrives.  The place is absolutely huge with fun, exciting decor.  The bar stools are f'n hilarious.  I don't thing there enough parking spaces to fill the place so even if it looks busy, they probably have a spot for you and your family.  I really want to give this a 4 star but the corporate chain feel and shaky first experience was only worth a solid 3.  I will be back to try something else and for sure try their margaritas.  Look for an updated review then."}
{"text":"newer place that replaced buca di beppo. Nice atmosphere. we had a big party that they accommodated very well and it made a nice impression to come back. the next few times Ive been, the service has been a bit slower and management seemed a bit rude.  Oh and if its not happy hour the drinks are a little pricey. if you like it hot, ask for their homemade habanero sauce, its really great. 
overall the same mexican restaurant as most others in the area but a refreshing interior and a few more menu items to choose from."}
{"text":"Oh, Dios mío!  I had a hankering for some Mexican cuisine.   Tonight was my first time at El Rio Grande...I can't wait to come back.  The people there were great.  It was a fantastic team atmosphere.  A lot of places, you go in and the servers only work their tables.  Not at El Rio Grande.  I am not exaggerating when I say everyone was delivering food, refilling drinks, calling back on tables.  I have to say that coming to El Rio Grande tonight was definitely the highlight of my week.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"My family and I did not have the best experience with them. The place was mostly clean with the exception of the window by our booth was dusty and had bits of crumbs and straw wrappers on it. The food looked great but it did not taste as good as it looked. My 2 year old didn't like his simple cheese and chicken quesadilla and took longer to come out. The chicken in his quesadilla had an odd taste and there was too much cheese for a kids meal. My husband's large burrito had more bland rice than anything and the meat that was found inside was dry and heavily overcooked. The problem with my meal was that is was bland and the chorizo was over cooked and dry. The chicken was bland and the rice and refried beans were a little oily. 
I wanted to take my leftovers home and jazz it up for lunch the next day, but I accidentally left it there. I wasn't upset about it."}
{"text":"Ive never had a bad meal here. Its our familys favorite restaurant to go to. Even though we do not live in stoughton anymore we have no problem going out of the way to drive to el rio."}
{"text":"A co-worker saw a truck a couple weeks ago that was advertising a Mexican buffet near work for $6.99.  He told me about it and we decided to visit when we had time.  Today was the time.

Finding the place was a joke.  We drove all over Golden Gate Plaza looking, but you have to drive behind Golden Gate to get to it, unless you're coming from Mayfield Rd.  It's slightly east of Golden Gate and the entrance is off of Mayfield Rd. just before the southbound on ramp.  Anyway, once we found it, we were promptly greeted and sat in a booth per our request.  Also, the price was $7.95, not the $6.95 that we were expecting.  The place had one large group of people and a few small groups, but on the whole, was empty.

After a minute, a waitress showed up and asked us for drinks.  Good thing the co-worker understood what she said because I sure didn't.  We asked for the buffet and then we helped ourselves.

I took a look at the buffet and there wasn't much food, but I guess if you're creative, you can come up with many combinations.  I loaded my plate up with fajitas.  I got chicken and steak, which is already mixed with peppers and onions.  I was little disappointed that there wasn't any shrimp!  I then went to the taco bar and added some toppings to my plate.  Then I found the warm fajitas wrapped in foil.  They got that part right.  The fajitas were quite tasty, but we both concurred that the food is not as good as Cozumel.  That was priority #1.  They were also fairly messy and a little more greasy than expected.  The quality of the steak and chicken were good to above average.

I also tried the cinnamon tortilla desert, which is like Taco Bell's cinnamon sticks.  They were okay, but they tasted like roasted marshmallow.  There were several items that I didn't try because I literally stuffed myself with Fajitas and Sierra Mist.

My co-worker tried a few different things, including a seasoned chicken breast, which he seemed to enjoy, little chicken burritos, and several other things.  He said the food was good, but the service was lacking.  He also thought the ambiance was nice and I agreed.  

One thing this place could use is a salsa bar and some hot sauce.  We only received one cup of salsa, which was kind of bland - no kick.  Also, there was no hot sauce at the bar or table.  We asked for some and it came in a small cup.

The decor was nice and the restaurant was actually fairly large, so it would be good for groups.  I'm sure i'll be back.  

I'd recommend this buffet it if you can find it."}
{"text":"Warning: most \"vegetarian\" dishes on the \"vegetarian menu\" are made with chicken stock. To stay vegetarian, then, don't get the rice. (The refried beans are supposedly lard-free, but I'm taking that answer on faith.)

That aside... There are \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants, and there are \"American-style\" Mexican restaurants. I like both kinds, and this place is \"American-style.\" But it's not totally generic either: some of their recipes and menu items are slightly different from your average fare. For instance, peas in the rice and a wider range of sauces.

So I've found a couple things I like here. I only wish I hadn't been eating all those chicken dishes for 2 years..."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican. Food we have found. Definitely order the tamales, chimichangas, or fajitas. They are amazing. Plus the staff always is super attentive, kind, and helpful. Never had a bad server there once. Manager Erica does a fantastic job, server Danny is always right on top of everything, and their hostess (sadly didn't catch her name, but she's younger and always smiling) just makes you feel welcomed and goes above and beyond her duties to make sure u have everything you need. Never had an empty drink (margaritas are amazing), and always have tons of salsa. The hot salsa is wicked!  We love mixing them. I think the hostess needs a raise and promotion.  All other servers we have had were just as good too. Go here for fun, great hospitality, and a good hearty meal!!! Number one in Stoughton!!!"}
{"text":"When my husband and I first discovered this place we loved it...gave it five stars actually.  We sat at the bar, the drinks were all wonderful.  Tasty, fresh food and great people.  Sadly, the last couple times we went  it seems like the management was cutting corners in food quality.  It became very mediocre.  Not worth the 20minute drive like it was before.   The bartenders were great, but the food was subpar.  We are, again, on the hunt for great mexican food close to home."}
{"text":"Great experience! 4.5 stars 

I had enchilada Michoacán with pork, it was something I had for the first time and I loved it. Coming from a person who is not a big fan of beans(not green beans), I loved the bean paste kind of accompaniment with the dish. The rice served with the dish was so light and flavorful! The enchilada itself were well made, pork filling inside was generous and was creamy with a yummy topping/sprinkle of minced chorizo on top. I was not able to finish the whole plate myself, I would say 2 people can share one plate with an appetizer and it would be good enough!! 
The parking was right outside the restaurant and we got seated immediately, being a Saturday afternoon it was not very crowded. Service was great! The songs playing in the background were cool to listen while eating! I also had margarita on rocks which was pretty decent, I say this more coz I am more of a wine lover! We were so stuffed with our food that we didn't get to the dessert round.. 
Right when we were seated, the waiter quickly served fresh hot tortilla chips and amazing salsa dipping!! 
Overall great experience! Will definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"YUM.  I got the Camarones al Mojo de Ajo - which is essentially shrimp sauteed in garlic and butter served with tortiallas, rice, guacamole, pico de gallo, and lettuce.  Amazing!  If you love shrimp and garlic - get this and die happy.  My husband got the Chili Verde and it was equally as delicious!  They also deliver now - so we'll be eating there more often!"}
{"text":"Honestly, After going here a few more times it feels like the food is slipping.  It seems more about quantity and less about quality."}
{"text":"excellent  and does serve a full line of liquor and drinks"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service here. Have always been welcomed and made to feel right at home. I'll admit, I'm addicted to the Nachos Mexicanos with no lettuce. Hard for me to branch out when these are so tasty. The fajitas are good and husband loves the pork Chile verde. Good local choice for Mexican at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"After waiting at the door for ten minutes to be seated we finally seated ourselves at the bar where we waited another 5 to b greeted by the girl w chips and salsa. The bartender finally came back and instead of greeting us just rudely said what do u want to drink. We ordered the queso which came out cold and I had a margarita on the rock which still came out of the machine not bad but too sugary. The food came out less than 5 min after ordering and was awful I still got the pico I asked to not have and my burrito tasted microwaved. My fiancés food was dripping grease. We left half the food on the plate and defiantly did not want boxes. For that kind of money Nxt time we'll go to the hibachi like I wanted. Taco bell would have been an improvement in my mouth and on my wallet."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here dozens of times now and have never once had a bad experience.

Recently I've been hooked on the Fajitas Rio Grande - Chicken, beef, chorizo and shrimp, mixed with fajita veggies and served sizzling. MMM so good! And the portion size is plenty big enough to get two meals out it. 

The flautas are another favorite of mine - both the shredded chicken and beef are excellent. Tacos de Chorizo are awesome when you have a craving for tacos. 

The chips and salsa you get when you sit down are great. I love their salsa as it's not chunky and it's more of a puree. The cheese sauce is a must, but be careful, you'll fill up on chips before your food arrives!! 

As far as the building goes, it decorated really festive with fun lighting and artwork. It's not fancy at all, but it's authentic! There is a bar as well as stage too!"}
{"text":"We decided to have a co-workers going away dinner here. It was super last minute so the night before we were supposed to go in, I called trying to make a reservation for 17 adults and 4 children. The guy I spoke with on the phone was SUPER nice and helpful! He mentioned that there were a few other big parties around the same time that we wanted to come in, but he would make sure they were ready of us. 

The actual location of the restaurant is a bit hard to find. You see it as you're coming off the highway and follow your GPS and end up in Golden Gate shopping center and have no clue where that restaurant went! But, then you follow a road BEHIND all the stores and VOILA!!! ... the restaurant magically reappears :) (so yes, it's BEHIND the shopping center)

We all trickled in at different times between 6pm (our reservation time) and 7pm. The servers were very patient and eventually would come by and take drink orders. The chips and salsa were delish. Their salsa was pretty mild, but still tasty, so I was happy. I never asked if they had a spicier one, but next time I'm there, I will. Once the majority of everyone was there, we ordered entrees. Despite having about 18 people, they were fairly quick in preparing the food and everything starting to come out about 15-20 minutes later.

I ordered the vegetarian fajitas with a side of extra guac. Unfortunately my skillet was not sizzling when it came out. I assumed it was done earlier and was just waiting for the rest of the entrees to be ready - which is understandable when you have so many people. The veggies were still HOT, tho so I wasn't too upset about it. The plate that comes with the fajitas includes refried beans, rice, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, and the tiniest amount of lettuce and cheese i've ever seen for a plate of fajitas. Everything was delish, I just am used to getting enough lettuce and cheese to at least put on two tortillas - but there was just about a tablespoon each of lettuce and shredded cheese. The guac was great. I've mentioned this in other reviews, but most mex restaurants don't make tasty guac and I end up adding salsa to it; however, this place has GREAT, tasty guac.

Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. The place itself is cute. Very similar to El rodeo's decor on the west side. All of the employees are friendly and margs are delish. Now that I know where it is, I will definitely be back to check out this lunch buffet I've heard good things about or just for another dinner. 

PS they apparently have a patio... b/c I saw a sign in the middle of the snow covered grassy area that said patio open ;) hats off to anyone who is brave enough to do THAT!!! haha but I'm sure thats fun in the summer :)"}
{"text":"To describe this place as having even \"average mexican food\" is an insult to fine instiutions like Taco Bell. This place was an abortion of a restaurant, in terms of both food and service. 

The chips were warm but flavorless. The \"salsa\" they gave us was a can of tomato paste that was mixed together with a piece of cilantro and a big middle finger to the customer. When we requested a hotter salsa, they brought out a salsa that was somehow less spicy and looked like a mix of cigarette butts and dirty wash cloth water. And somehow, it still managed to taste even worse than it looked. Bravo 'El Rio Grande'. Bravo.  

After being THOROUGHLY unimpressed with the chips and salsa, we got to the main meal: the burrito with rice and beans. If your idea of good mexican food is diahhrea beans and bland rice surrounding a dry chicken burrito with no redeeming qualities, then you should eat here every day.  I was genuinely offended that I was charged any amount of money to consume this \"meal\" that even children in Africa would reject, choosing starvation instead. 

Overall, 'El Rio Grande' is perhaps the worst place I  have ever eaten. I weep for Stoughton Wisconsin that this is there idea of good Mexican food. This restaurant should be torn down and replaced with a memorial for all the souls that accidently ate their thinking they were getting a good meal."}
