{"text":"Alright Yelp-ers - let's check out NorthView Village that serves one of my all-time favorite cuisines - VIETNAMESE (mmm yumm). Without further ado, let's get cracking:  Outlook: With ample parking space, this place is really easy to find and drive to; also accessible by transit. Does take all major credit cards, also does take out (the option I took). The place looks really nice and clean when you walk in. It wasn't very crowded when I walked in; I was happy since I didn't have to wait, but kind of sad at the same moment because I want to see my local businesses busy.   Personal Interaction: Gentleman at the front was nice and tried to make a friendly impression. Too many aggressive words, such as sh*t, f**k, bi**h, were used by the gentleman during our conversion of \"oil downturn\" and when he found out that I couldn't find out a job because of the economy LOL.   Food: Ok...ok...fine, let's get to the point here: Food here is pretty good. I would consider it above average based on price and portions. Speaking of portions, I found noodles to be much more than the meat (which reflects the ratings). However, even with small portion the meat was super delicious, succulent and juicy (bet you're thinking about it as you read).  I would say this place deserves more than 3 stars, perhaps even 4. But to me, it wouldn't be fair with the other cool Viet places out there. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone in the vicinity.   Until next time (insert peace sign here)"}
{"text":"I ordered #20 - hu tieu tom cua thit and added chicken for $2.00 more. Soup was pretty good. I had to ask for basil to be added to my soup...I don't know is it just me as I need my herbs when it comes to eating  Vietnamese food. Food was good but I wished they wiped down the condiments as the hot sauce bottle was a little sticky."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place since I was staying close in the area, I'm glad I did.  The food was good, prompt and warm, the only real complaint I have was the service.  The server was very rushed and almost impatient, went to wash my hands before we ate and found out why.  He was busy playing video games on his laptop lol.  I would recommend the restaurant to anyone, just hope you get a different server lol.  Good location and tons of parking!!"}
{"text":"Spicy beef satay #17! Tastes really good not too spicy tho. Quick service and delicious menu. Very friendly I come here often"}
{"text":"We used to go to this restaurant's previous location near Deerfoot Mall for many years.  One thing that we noticed near the end of its time in the previous location was high prices and small portion sizes.  We ended up stop going there because it was just not worth it anymore.  Recently, we were in the Westwinds area and discovered that the restaurant that we used to go to has moved to Westwinds.  I believe the restaurant is located in the old Original Joe's space.  We thought we would give this restaurant another shot since we are not in the area that often.    We were greeted by the same owner from before and he clearly remembers me.  The food is still good and my favourite item (Sate Beef Pho) still tasted the same.  The price is about the same as in their old location, but the portions have grown to more acceptable size.  If I am in the area, I will come here again."}
