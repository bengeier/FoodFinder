{"text":"Great subs, bottom line.  Fresh bread, a large variety of choices, hot or cold.  Yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"Love Love Love DiBella's! Now if only we could get a Wegmans Grocery Store down here....   Quality meats, fresh breads, and the sub oil is simply amazing. I'm here atleast once a week!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but a bit too pricey.  I didn't think the food was much better than Quizno's or Subway, but I would definitely recommend that you try this place."}
{"text":"I went to  DeBella's for the first time today.  It took a while to get my sub but once I did I was happy!  It was a was a darn good sandwich!  I'll go back again soon!"}
{"text":"I am disappointed in management not responding to a complaint. I ordered a vegi sub, being vegan, and told the girl I wanted every vegi. When I got gone it I rained every meat they had. I had to pitch it. Tried contacting the location and received no response back. Poor customer service the girl who made sandwich was very nice bit management needs to figure out how to deal with issues"}
{"text":"DiBellas is one of my favorite sub shops in Rochester, NY; so when I was in Cleveland for business, I made a special trip to the Strongsville location.  I was amazed to see that the location was decorated and set up exactly the same as my old haunt - it was really comforting to sit there and eat my sub!  The staff was all super friendly.  Even though they were very busy with call-in orders, I still had my sub before I finished deciding which kind of cookie to get (fwiw: oatmeal raisin is just as yummy as my normal chocolate chip with walnuts!).    If anyone is having trouble deciding what to order, I recommend a Godfather with Oil, Provolone & all your favorite fixings.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I found DiBella's through Yelp when trying to find a decent place to eat.  The reviews made it sound interesting enough and set high expectations for me.  I was not disappointed!  DiBella's was everything I expected.  The food was amazing and the decor just enhanced the experience.  Definitely not your typical sub shop."}
{"text":"Good subs. Don't expect anything else. The Godfather is the best one on the menu. Cheesesteak is the second best. Eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been in Pittsburgh since my Duquesne days! My friend introduced me to this place way back when and I've always come back! The bread is amazing and the portions on the sandwiches don't disappoint. The speed is relatively fast, depending on what you order. The cookies are to die for and the pricing is about average. Must go"}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere is great. The place is very clean and welcoming.  The only issue is that is took way too long to make a sub!"}
{"text":"We tried this newly opened sub shop today, and wow! I had an excellent meatball sub - put Subway to shame - and Jen had the Godfather, which was tasty and very generous with the meat. We both got medium subs and had leftovers. Highly recommended! Oh, and great, homemade-like cookies to boot."}
{"text":"A real east coast hoagie shop. Fresh everything.  Makes subway, quiznos, et al taste like second class fast food. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place puts Subway to shame, easily the best sub I have ever had, and I am a fan of Subway.  Reminds me of going to a deli in New York.  The meats, cheeses, toppings, and breads are top notch, and the oil dressing they put on the subs is so good.  The service is fast, and I think the prices are reasonable.    Overall, I would give this place ten stars if I could, love it!!!"}
{"text":"Super good cheesesteak!! The bread was soft and really good as well!  The guys making the subs were very friendly and seemed to really enjoy working there. Great food, good service!"}

{"text":"Workers were busy doing things. Did not acknowledge me at the counter. Left and went to Panera around the corner"}
{"text":"I always get a hot turkey , my husband and dad always get the god father and they love them! They have messed up several of my orders and one girl there is kind of rude but everyone else is pretty nice. You smell when you leave there ( even when you dont eat in side)."}
{"text":"I went to DiBella subs and it was good... well at least my sandwich was good. when we got home my brother and my mom got food poisoning. but I didn't because I just got a sandwich that had lettuce turkey and cheese on it. also the lady was talking so fast I could barely understand her."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good!  I ordered a hot ham sandwich with swiss cheese, and my fiancee ordered a hot turkey sandwich. We both agreed that it tasted really fresh and something about the cheese just tasted really good. I was a little apprehensive about ordering my sandwich on multi-grain bread because it looked like it would have been hard and I can't stand hard bread-but it was very soft! I also ordered a pickle, and they give you those giant pickles which was a bonus.  We both ordered small sandwiches, and I'd say they were anywhere from 6-7 inches long. We were both stuffed when we left!  Defiantly a go again, especially since we won't leave smelling like onion unlike a particular sandwich chain I can think of."}
{"text":"Amazing bread! Probably as good as it gets for a sub. I had the chicken Philly and the large was way too big, but delicious. Would love to try this place again because so many subs looked tempting."}
{"text":"So. I do P90x and I work up quite an appetite. i was jonesing for cold cuts and fresh bread and I didn't want to take a shower when I got home from wherever I would go so Giant Eagle was out of the question (fleas? lice? who's to say) and I went to this place and got a great big sandwich.   There was no line which -insert pithy intellectual reference here- meant I had to order on the fly. I panicked and went with the 'Old Fashioned' on sesame seed which was a good call considering. I loaded up on everything and micromanaged the assembly by instructing the girl with an impressive off-the-cuff colloquialism: \"don't be shy with that mayo, Missy.\" She got the message and it was prepared to my liking. It being my sandwich. I got swiss cheese and lettuce.  It was the best sub I have ever eaten. Ever. The sesame bun is so good and the rest of it was glorious. I will never eat at Subway again. Subway, it turns out, is nasty. Who knew?  Here's how I did it: I went home and shooed the animals and then I poured my souvenir Swenson's glass with the chip half full with Aberlour cask strength single malt scotch ( I won a bottle of batch 39 off of my buddy who lives in Medina) and went bite, glug, bite, glug until my head was swimming and I was just wolfing at that sandwich.  It only cost maybe eight bucks for this two pound monster sandwich. I miss it.  I couldn't come up with a good quote on good sandwiches but let's pretend I did and it is really clever and it makes me look smart:  \" quote goes here.\""}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and I frequent this location often. I love their subs and they are quick and efficient while preparing and serving order!"}
{"text":"Regarding a 04/28/2017 visit to the Dibella's restaurant in Strongsville, OH:  I ordered 2 sandwiches.  One sandwich was missing the requested flavored oil, the other sandwich was missing the requested onions and mayonnaise.  The girl even wrote down the order and still couldn't get either sandwich correct.  If you take the onions and mayo off a sandwich you are left with a flavorless, dry meat biscuit.  I like DiBella's  sandwiches because they are big, the bread is very good, and the flavored oil is good, but this was not the first or second time my order has been screwed up at this particular DiBella's location.  I never have an accuracy problem with the less desirable sandwiches at Subway, where I can actually see my sandwich being made, unlike at DiBella's, where my sandwich is hidden from view until I unwrap it at home.  From an operational standpoint, making a sandwich correctly should be easy.  Why can't DiBella's do it more often?  The process is the problem and the poor accuracy won't change until the process is improved.  Welcome to DiBella's."}
{"text":"Super slow, even after the lunch rush. Made our sandwiches wrong. Staff seemed poorly trained."}
{"text":"\"Best sub you ever had\" is printed on the wrapper and wow they were not kidding!  The first time I tried their subs was at a lunch meeting we had at work a few weeks ago.  They won me over from that 1 quarter of a sub and giant 1/2 pickle.  Stopped by tonight after work and was thrilled that there was no line.  We got a cheesesteak sub on everything bread and a roastbeef sub on everything bread plus 1 whole pickle to split.  The bread is so fresh even for 6:30pm.  We ordered 2 small sandwiches and split between us.  I think I really enjoyed the cheesesteak a little bit more, but maybe because it was warm and juicy on such a cold CLE night.  The price was beyond fair considering we are both completely full.  I cannot imagine eating a large sub in one sitting.  Staff was super friendly!  So glad we had that meeting and discovered this place! We will definitely be here more often!"}
{"text":"Nice standard sub shop, with great bread. Much higher quality than the nearby Jimmy John's and Subway."}
{"text":"Some really good subs and a large amount of food for the price. Their plain bread is awesome and they have a ton of different sub options. They'll also build you a custom sub if you want."}
{"text":"I was very dissappointed in my one takeout from this sub shop. The meats had an \"off\" taste, as if they had been kept out too long. Pitched it before I got sick. No second chance for this place."}
{"text":"DiBella's has been one of my favorite sub shops for many years but this location disappoints be time and time again.  I attempt to give simple instruction of my order and only 1 out of the past 6 times have they gotten it right.  I have been served cold buffalo chicken subs, which is supposed to be a hot sub, on multiple occasions and returned the order until they got it right (sometimes twice in one visit).  Today I ordered a large buffalo chicken sub with extra buffalo sauce and cut into thirds.  When I receive it, the chicken is ice cold, the sub is cut in half (in my opinion the halves of a large sub tend to fall apart, so I order thirds), and there was so little buffalo sauce that I could hardly taste it.  I even repeated myself at the end of the order just to make sure it was heard.  I am very patient with the employees, but my patience is wearing thin with their carelessness.  I don't think what I ask is difficult.  These employees seem to be very unskilled incapable of simple instruction.  Although I enjoy the DiBella's food chain and it is convenient for my lunch break to go to this location, I don't think I will be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"Great place. I've only had the subs, none of the sides. But I've tried 4 or 5 of the subs on the menu and they were all worthy of the 4-5 star range. Price is a little higher than I would like, but ultimately, its worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch at about 1:30. Very friendly staff and had very good patience with my huge order. They acted in a way as if \"it always happens\" and done a very good job. The manager Eric was very nice to myself and the customer's behind me. Definetely coming here more often !"}
{"text":"Have you tried these Ol Fashion Subz yet? Why not??? Walk, dont run (you might fall down) to DiBellas. Just a few words and you'll understand: Godfather, mouthwatering, HUGE, fresh bread, NYC dressing, GO!  Soapbox:I also wish YELP would let me post reviews from my phone. I could have done this from the table."}
{"text":"yum!  so far i've had the godfather and the italian sandwiches - very good bread and good portions of meat.  add some peppers and their really good oil / vinegar dressing, and you have yourself a nice sandwich."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a sub that doesn't taste processed.  The bread is wonderful and the hot subs hit the spot.  If you hate Subway like me then you will love Dibella's!"}
{"text":"For a cheap, quick and REALLY good meal go here. Their subs are delicious. I read a review that said DiBella's is a step above your standard Subway chain. I HIGHLY disagree with this. I think this place is leaps and bounds above Subway. It's apples and oranges. They make very very good submarines."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here many times. Me and my husband had tried several subs and all were great. I couldn't believe how huge the sandwiches were any size! Very much worth the money and I have recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Subs are ok. The service can be better. I like Alecsi better,"}
{"text":"Visiting from Florida, left the airport and just happen to be in the area of DiBella's.  I ordered The Godfather and asked the employee to prepare the sub the way most customers order it. The sub was AWESOME, zero complaints, I will eat here again given the opportunity, very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs. Get bacon and the everything bread. The only reason this review isn't 5 stars is because they just recently discontinued their white chocolate macadamia nut cookies which were much better than their chocolate chip and their oatmeal. Who keeps oatmeal over white chocolate macadamia nizzut?"}
{"text":"If you like \"HOT SUBS\" dont go here...They do not toast the subs at these places. I asked, and was astonished that everything is just served on barely lukewarm hoagie rolls. Might be good for cold cuts but not my style!"}
{"text":"Cashier asked me to sit after taking my credit card and told he will give my order on desk... Was waiting for 15 minutes for sub and then he said they are still making.. But other people who came after me were being served. ... Chicken was ok nothing special but bread... Oh man it was like 2 day old... This was second time I came here and last... Done trying... 10 bucks for med chicken and small drink..."}
{"text":"being from out of town we usually rely on yelp and other on line reviews for places to eat.  we wanted sandwiches which led us here. when we walked in, we were informed they only had multi grain (no big deal) the server who helped us, Carmen was awesome. he was very patient with us  and kept a great attitude the whole entire time  the sandwiches were all great. bread was fresh. we will definitely tell others to stop here if they are ever in the area."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago with a friend for the first time and tried to recreate my favorite subway sandwich. I substituted roast beef for subways steak and had all the same toppings. sadly, dibellas didn't compare to subway , and I never went back until recently.   about a month ago my boyfriend finally convinced me to go with him and try half of his sandwich, and he swore I'd love it. normally, I'm very stubborn and difficult and SUPER picky on new foods, but I went and ultimately ate half of his large turkey sandwich with lettuce and extra mayo on plain bread. (same as what he gets at subway, our former go-to dinner place.) since that amazing day, I've gone to dibellas at LEAST 6 times per week. no exaggeration. I'm a senior in high school juggling multiple jobs and I'm never home to eat food so I'm always grabbing fast food. (disclaimer: I only weigh 107 so my metabolism is pretty sweet). I absolutely LOVE. THIS. PLACE. im literally pulling into the parking lot as I finish this review. I honestly wish I tried this sandwich years ago. it's amazing."}
{"text":"DiBella's is my favorite chain sub shop.  I have to hand it to the employes, I went to this location on Light-Up Night, and I only had to wait maybe 10 minutes for my sub. Now, on a normal day, 10 minutes might be a bit long of a wait, but this place was PACKED because of all the festivities going on right outside the doors. Every other place we went seemed like an impossibly long wait for anything, so I give this location a lot of credit.   Anyway, onto the food (you know, the important stuff). I think they have some of the best quality sub bread at DiBella's, I just wish there was a bit more variety to it. Your options are sesame, multigrain, everything, or plain. Maybe I've been spoiled by other restaurants, but I'd like a more artisan option as well. Everything on the sandwich tastes fresh, unlike some places. I like the Godfather, personally, but the cheesesteak and the tuna salad sub are great options too (tuna salad can be tricky).  DiBella's is a favorite of mine because everything tastes fresh and it's definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I had a Dibella's sub. It was at the Robinson location and I ordered a medium cheesesteak with oil (always, always get the oil. It's not the same without it.)     My first impression was the size of the sub. A medium here would be a large anywhere else, the small a medium, and a large is meant for two people or two sittings. Then as I bit into my delectable treat, a smile crept onto my face. Yes, this sub made me smile. That is all I need to say about it's taste.      All in all, this is the best sub around. There is literally no way you can improve on perfection, which is shy this is literally the best sub I've ever had. But if you don't get the oil, you are short-changing yourself big time."}
{"text":"Best sandwich chain around. This location is fast and delicious. Just ignore the terrible IHOP next to it."}
{"text":"This Dibellas sucks monkey ass literally! They can't comprehend your order correctly then have attitudes bc they fcked up! Never again ! Ain't no starts bihhh"}
{"text":"Dibella's has the best subs in America! The everything bread is great and make sure to order your sub \"hot\" because then they put in on the grill. The oil dressing is a must. This is my favorite lunch spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Ordered a meatball sub. It was sub par (no pun intended). The meatballs were bland. The sauce was thick like a paste and tasted weird and the cheese was non existent. The sub was large. Unfortunately I ended up tossing out most of it. Too gross to eat. Plus their prices are outrageous. Bummer."}
{"text":"These are the best subs in the area!!!! They offer a ton of food for the price.   Their rolls are baked in house daily and are always amazingly fresh.  They offer plenty full amounts of meat and toppings on just a regular sandwich. They offer cold and grilled options.  They even offer catering that makes feeding many people  at any office lunch meeting or just a party at your home very easy.   And I can not overstate THE AMAZINGNESS Of these subs."}
{"text":"Waiting while being irritated by loud mouth woman with huge beaver teeth."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon, around 3:00pm.   The place had about 5 other people in it. Our party was of 4. The service was great and they were understanding of any questions I had!    They have a great customer service and manager who was working that shift. We had an incident and she was so quick to help and make sure we were happy.   The feel of the location is great and enjoyable. Very relaxed and the food is delicious and of good quality!  There is no reason people should go to Subway when DiBella's when this quality sub shop is right here!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for 20 mins for 2 subs. Yes, somebody ordered 4 subs ahead of us, but a simple acknowledgement from somebody who works here that they realize it is slow and they are sorry would go a long way. To clarify further, they made the meatball sub, gave it to us in about 5 mins and 15 mins later gave us the other. No \"sorry for the wait\"  Poor, poor customer service."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place another go I think. Wasn't really impressed or blown away by my sub. I ordered a chicken Philly, but there were no onions or peppers on it so I guess I wouldn't call it a Philly really.They must of got confused since I asked to add banana peppers? Nothing special so I can't gift them a great rating yet.  On the positive side I liked the bread, very soft and crispy on the top. Perfect. Also, I think the prices are reasonable for the size of the subs."}
{"text":"Hands down, this sub shop, though a chain, puts its competition (Jimmy John's) to shame.  Huge sandwiches for the money.  I ordered the Small Dagwood and it was packed with meat and looked a good 8 inches long.  I like Jimmy John's also, but their small, skinny sandwiches are a lousy value in comparison at the same (or even higher) price.  I am amazed JJ's is packed while this place was almost empty--I guess that is the power of JJ's marketing!  I also liked the fact that because the subs take a bit of time to make (mine was grilled), you get a number and a server will bring it out to you.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered sub catering for an event at a hospital.  I placed my order in the morning with Curtis, he was very nice and helpful.  I called back to move my order up an hour.  Again, spoke to Curtis, again nice and helpful.  I pick up up my order in the afternoon and Curtis helped me pack my car.  It is two days later and I just received a voicemail asking how everything went.   I am very happy with my experience at this location and will use them again.   Great Job Curtis and DiBella's!  My group loved the food!"}
{"text":"By all means your lucky you got That! Was so hungry for the godfather sandwich which is my all time fave. So I brag to my buddy what a great place this is,,boy was he let down I ordered the godfather like I have so many times and my buddy a Philly cheesesteak.also a couple salads..i said to the young lady cashing us out is that our order ( she was in la la land)she said no,that lady is wrapping yours up now she hand is the bag an we took the 20 min.ride home.we get back to my place and as sure as God made green apples it happens.  Our order is jacked up! my sandwich was a turkeyclub  with so much mustard on it it looked like it was bleeding profusely and my buddy with the Philly chs.stk was so greasy that you could have wrung it out.  Disgusting! When I called about my order the mgr.kept calling me hun and sweety.nothing worse then being upset ANd someone old enough  to be your daughter is disrespectfully calling you hun and sweety! I asked if they can just make me another tomorrow and she said no its policy. If you can't come that day ,we have to mail you a coupon..just one day?  Is that asking to Much? I hate coupons! Well I'll take my 30 min trip to the one in solon,. At least they are respectful and always have my order right..but I will say the African American guy was awsome and efficient and had class . You saved it with two stars !  Won't go back.....ever"}
{"text":"The subs are good and way better than Subway.  I like the cheese steak sub (I just wish they had mushrooms) and the Italian meatball sub was pretty good as well.  The Choc Chip Walnut Cookie is decent."}
{"text":"It's strictly a hoagie joint. They have a number of people making subs, and you wait in line (if necessary) until called over by one of the sub makers. You order and they give you a number, then you pay. When your order is ready they'll bring it over to you.   So what makes DiBella's different from a gaggle of other hoagie shops? It's the bread, made fresh daily on site. And also I feel the meat they use is a little better quality than most places. The hoagie rolls come in three sizes so there is no \"half hoagie\" like you might expect. A large number of toppings are available.  You can have your hoagie hot or cold, but hot means grilled not baked.   The salads and sides are prepackaged. The cookies are very large and tasty. I've been here almost a dozen times and it's always very clean - clean enough that you really notice it.  If you're going to get a cookie you might as well make it a combo as it's only a little more to get a cookie AND a drink."}
{"text":"While in town on business, it's hard to find decent, non-chain places to eat. Although, I do make exceptions for subs... as the Subway/Togo/Jimmy John's offer standard food (but not greasy fast-food).  Anyway, I was actually on my way to Jimmy John's after a long day of meetings... as I drove by a new strip mall, I noticed the Panera, but then saw a big sign for DiBella's. Did a quick Yelp search and decided I'd eat here instead.... which was a great choice!  I ordered the large Dagwood on the sesame bread... they were out of the multi-grain, but it was 8:30pm at the time... so no worries there.  Service was great and the sandwich was done in no time. The sandwich was one of the best I've had in some time too.  The only ding on a perfect 5 star review was the person who was working the register that night. No hello... just stated the total, acted like I was imposing, or shouldn't be there. After ringing it up and taking my payment, I said \"Thanks\" and she just stared at me until I finally turned away to leave.  It's a minor point, but a little customer service goes a long way. That aside, I wouldn't let that minor thing stop you from trying this place out."}
{"text":"Huge fan of subs.  And I was not disappointed with Debella's.  Hot or cold you cannot go wrong.  But the best thing to add to any sandwich would be the horseradish its so good!!!!  Also if you have room you have to try the cookies. Next thing they need to do is put one in Macedonia."}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat the subs myself, but I ordered a party tray for another office in Pittsburgh last minute and these guys executed - I even received a followup call from them a few days later asking how everything went. Very high level."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Drove 15 minutes after ordering pick up to be told they \"discontinued\" their roast beef.  Not only is that not true, but you could have called!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I gotta be frank. Everyone knows I LOVE MY DiBella's. But this location loses a star because I kinda got the feeling that they skimp on quality for the sake of efficiency.  I went in at CRAZYTIME. AKA lunch hour. The line was Chipotle-style in length. They had a pretty good system of the sandwich makers waving and a manager escorting those in line to the nearest worker. Very assembly line. That's fine. But for some reason, the bread didn't taste as fresh, the ingredients not as plentiful. That's sad.   Maybe it was just a fluke. And really, who am I to complain? I got my sandwich fairly quickly and I ate it just as quickly. It tasted fine. But ... it wasn't up to DiBella's standards. Which is five stars all the way.  I'll visit again soon; maybe they're still working out their kinks. I'll try to go at an off-time and see if there's any difference.  By the way, I hate this parking lot. I always park in the back, but even that was a madhouse yesterday. Oh well. All the business dudes in Independence have to eat somewhere, and I suppose this new development is as good a place as any."}
{"text":"I said I wouldn't give a chain 5 stars unless it's really great. Well, Dibella's is really great!  I love sandwiches. I'm not sure who doesn't - but I am obsessed with them and they have become one of my many pregnancy cravings. I NEED SANDWICHES!  Especially subs. Anyway, this place was like a classier, more \"authentic\" looking version of Jimmy John's, with a larger selection of breads and types of sandwiches. They have a large menu of hot sandwiches too, which I'm not sure Jimmy John's does.  Even though it is a chain, it doesn't exactly feel that way.   I just had my usual turkey with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and cheese, but there's something about the special dressing they use, or the combination of mayo and mustard, that gives it something different. Plus the bread is just awesome. I had wheat, I think, but it was really dark and tasted like pumpernickel. Amazing.  They also have sides like potato salad and pickles. And these amazing chocolate-chip cookies. Ok, I'm making myself hungry for a sandwich now and it's only 10:20. Just try Dibella's next time you want a really GOOD sandwich."}
{"text":"What can I say, I am a sucker for a place that has the option of Everything bread! With that being said I absolutely love the subs here. My favorite is the Philly Cheesesteak on of course everything bread. The Dagwood and Godfather are also delicious. Sure it's a little pricier than other places but their subs taste a whole lot better than other places! The only unfortunate part is that there are only 2 locations near the Cleveland area (womp womp)."}
{"text":"This was a very good place that we happened into for lunch. Many places are closed on Sundays in Pittsburgh, so we were very happy to find this place open. We both got subs and really enjoyed them. They are reasonably priced. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"My experience with DiBella's needs to be more consistent in order for me to give them 4 or 5 stars. My first taste was actually leftovers. The boy had some crazy spicy sub for lunch one day--when he ate it, it was hot and he said it was actually better cold, so I don't feel like I missed out at all when I snuck into the fridge and had a few...or more...bites...err large bites. It was fantastic! Spicy and meaty and delicious.   My in store experience was good but not the best. I ordered a turkey sub warmed and there was nothing wrong with it, but the flavor explosion of yore was not there. Perhaps it had to do with my sneaky sampling last time, but I doubt it. I really just think this place is hit or miss as far as flavor impressiveness goes, but I'm not turned away.  High note: They have great pickles! They give them to you in a little ziploc and the smell just clouds around the bag like a perfect pickley aura. It was delicious and I definitely didn't have any pickle leftovers!"}
{"text":"When fresh, their sub rolls can't be beat. I've gone on a couple of occasions where the bread was either overcooked or day-old, but for the most part I've not had many problems here. I typically order the cheesesteak with all the fixings or get a turkey and bacon sub - and love the fact it's thick cut bacon.   One thing to ALWAYS order here: the chocolate chip cookie. Honestly, it's one of the best recipes I've ever had. Glad there are a bunch of convenient locations including Market Square, North Hills and Cranberry as we go here fairly frequently."}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful.   In this establishment, you order at a counter of shouting service-people, each vying for your attention at their line. You place your order (standard hot subs), and then, while you stand or sit to wait, workers run up and down the long restaurant yelling out order numbers. The atmosphere is chaotic, and yet the wait still managed to be quite long.   The price was quite high: a regular-sized sub, a cookie, and a drink for $13.   The worst part was the sandwich itself. The first time I went, I found it to be a very run-of-the mill hot sub. I was ambivalent. However, I decided to give it another shot and, though I had a similar experience with the services, the roast beef dip sub on whole grain was *absolutely disgusting.* The bread had an unpleasant, dry, dense flavor and texture, and the meat was highly salted leather akin to beef jerky. Dipping it in the au jus managed only to make it soggy and even saltier.   Really, I would eat at any single place downtown before I will be back to this establishment or any of its other locations."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with colleagues; and had the \"Old Fashioned\" sandwich, grilled, on sesame bread. Also tried their potato salad and it was delicious. The sandwich itself was also excellent. Really fresh and flavorful; and I agree with another reviewer who said that the \"medium\" size is really like a foot long! I could have gotten the small if I'd known; but lesson learned for next time! We were there around 11:45 and it was starting to get busy. The service was fast and friendly; and the manager was zipping around the dining area ensuring everyone was taken care of. I will def. be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Good subs with a generous portion of meats. The sandwiches are huge no matter which size you choose.  The Italian bread is good; make sure to get the oil dressing.  Way better than Sub-par Way."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Meatball sub, mozzarella and marinara... Add sweet pepper and onion... This rocks! Too bad they don't serve beer"}
{"text":"Just wasted 20 minutes of my lunch break waiting in line for them to tell me their machine is down and they can only accept cash. Smh"}
{"text":"I have used DiBella Subs Catering countless times in the past.. and every time its a hit!   The sandwiches are always so fresh and always the buzz in the office. ,.. anyone who is not involved in the event or meeting has their fingers crossed there will be leftovers!!!   Today was unusual .. the left overs remained for the longest period of time.. 5 minutes.. ha !   The \"godfather\" is no doubt my favorite sub..  and paired with lays potato chips.. its a perfect match!!   Great sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"Five employees. One making subs , 4 doing nothing.  Not a clean table in the store.  Franchise owner should see this place. Food is good but NOT eating it here!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine mentioned DiBellas and said, \"it's the best sub place.\"  Well, she's right.  I ordered a small (which by the way, isn't small--still about a 9\" sandwich.  I would hate to see the Large).  And I customized it.  And I ordered it hot.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Yum-ola.  They bake their bread throughout the day.  Their \"everything\" sub roll is so awesome.  And yes this place is better than Quizno's and Subway.  Interior reminded me of the bar on Cheers."}
{"text":"Amazing subs!!!  Get the small unless you have a huge appetite. They are very large. Another option is to share a large with someone. Trust me...you won't go hungry. The meats and cheeses are top quality. And the special oil sauce is a must!"}
{"text":"When they're good, they're really good. Unfortunately, this one is staffed by teenagers more worried about their conversation than your order. Got the double meat cheese steak and the last 1/4 didn't have any meat. Went back to the counter and showed the kid and he shrugged his shoulders. I asked if it's supposed to be this way and he asked (with an attitude) if I wanted him to make me another. I said no thanks. Don't know if we'll go back."}
{"text":"So...for a sandwich place the food is good.  But this place is horribly inefficient.  Here is why:  food takes a while to prepare.  Combine that with, when you go to pay, they ask you what you ordered.  Really?  Next time just to be a smart ass I am going to tell the cashier I ordered a kid's water, no ice.  I wish they would find a way to be more efficient and track their orders better.  If Potbelly, Jimmy John's and Subway can do it, so can Di Bella's..."}
{"text":"Very good subs, they have great bread and they load the sandwich up with meat.  We order at work all the time for meetings and people absolutely love them.  They are also reasonably priced for what you get.  My favorites are their tuna, the Dagwood, and the Godfather.  Make sure to get their \"everything\" bread, it is just like an \"everything\" bagel.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs. Slow service but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Bread was old and hard service was terrible. Order was screwed up. I like dibellas but the Mayfield location sucks. Go to Solon if you want a good dibellas sub"}
{"text":"Way better than Subway."}
{"text":"Love their subs!!!! Mmmmm! I get the chicken philly on their everything bread, so good! They are all freshly made but the wait is not bad at all! I really like it there and I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"First time @ dibella's and was it a good one! Got the large dibella's cheesesteak wow! The bread is way better than anticipated. Puts subway, jimmy johns, Quiznos and penn station all to shame! The meat was plentiful and complemented with a fair amount of condiments. If I had a complaint it would be there isn't a location in Akron. Only a 20 min drive from my job so will be back...probably as soon as tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Yup, got to love the made to order, hot subs.  Even their cold cut subs are pretty good.  Their bread is all fresh and large.  So you do need to be careful, because a medium is a large sandwich.  So my approach is to get a medium, then take all of the contents of one of the halfs and put it into the other.  Wastes bread I know, so save it to snack on if you like.  The restaurant is old school and and only has booths.  The booths can only hold 4 adults, so not great for larger groups.  The sandwiches are made to order, so at lunch you could end up waiting in line.  Worth it if you have the time."}
{"text":"For a sub shop, this place has a limited range of ingredients and an even unfriendlier staff.  Upon entering, I was treated as if I didn't know what I was doing - which was true - and also annoying because I was asking about vegetarian options.  At that point, I'd leave a business, but I had limited time and don't know the downtown area well.  So, I ordered something that was overpriced and just filled with olives and roasted red peppers - which wasn't filling so much as just satisfactory.  So, if you're a vegetarian or vegan, stay away from this place.  Otherwise, I think meat-eaters might like this.  Truth be told, the service is what brings this review down.  This must be a place where teenagers who don't care go to work."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches.  Sub-par service.  The give-a-s$&t factor was low.  Waited 5 mins for our sandwich maker to finish mopping the floor before serving us, we were the only two customers in the store.  A second sandwich maker appeared from the back room and he was more helpful."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I dig DiBella's.  All of their subs are tasty.  But this place is SLOW.  Don't order a sandwich hot or else you will wait a long time.  And...there is no order tracking...you tell the dude behind the counter what you want and presto...the lady at the end of the counter where you pay for your sub asks you what you ordered.  Huh?  If you aren't smart enough to devise an electronic order tracking system, I'll tell you I ordered a kid's sub every time.  Kidding...but seriously, get with the digital era.  Even the clowns at McDonald's know what I ordered.  \"Old fashioned\" shouldn't mean \"antiquated\" when it comes to food ordering!  Penn Station has it all over this place in terms of taste, speed and order tracking."}
{"text":"The bread and toppings are fresh.  The choice of toppings is plentiful.  The staff is always friendly.    The only drawback is the fact that you can't get a cup of coffee here.  They don't serve it."}
{"text":"Charming in their own way, they do what they do well. Taken as a sole experience definitely recommended. Might not be the best sub I've ever had but definitely worth attention and definitely earns its 5 stars"}
{"text":"Unique and delicious! This was my very first visit ever and I loved it! We were in a hurry and we were able to place or order at the counter, slide down and pay at the end of the counter quickly! Plenty of seating at tables or booths. Very comfortable and interesting atmosphere. Lots of tiles on the floors and walls for that subway feel. My salad with chicken was delicious because of the yummy seasoned dressing. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for the first time today. We've been to plenty of sub and hoagie shops and were excited to find one with such great reviews.   I got the Buckeye, which was wonderful and my submaker was wonderful as was my sub. Fast courteous and why this review isn't just one star.   My husband wanted a cheese sub. His submaker just put cheese on the sub and told him to go pay. He thought maybe they'd add more, you know, lettuce tomato... Normal sub toppings while he went to pay. Husband Goes to pay and gets his sandwich. Sits down and finds... Just cheese. Why pay $9 for just cheese and bread? I can go to a deli and buy a pound of cheese if that's what I wanted. I went back talked to the cashier's and asked what I should do about it. I was a little peeved and they looked confused. I took the sandwich back to the submaker and asked for toppings. The fact that they quickly added lettuce tomato and toppings was nice but they looked completely confused. I didn't ask for my money back I just wanted something besides cheese.   Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great subs. Everything bread rocks! Slightly inconsistent on how full they fill your sub. Have to ask to make sure it's check full. Open late. Love that. Have got a lot of subs to go. Wish they'd have more go with sides like potato salad or salad in general. That be nice. But subs rock."}
{"text":"I had DiBella's catering boxed lunches, and they were amazing! I can't say enough about the bread as it was so flavorful and most importantly fresh! I tried an old-fashioned sub with their oil dressing, and that in itself was fantastic. As if all of that weren't enough, I topped everything off with their chocolate chip cookie! I highly recommend this place and will look for DiBella's wherever I travel."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is by far the best hoagies in Pittsburgh. I used to think that Angelo's in bloomfield was the best until I tried Dibellas. The bread is absolutely amazing and the sandwich choices are awesome. Love love love this place. It is definitely more expensive than Subway or quiznos, but they put a lot more in their sandwiches too. Its worth the extra money."}
{"text":"Dibella's offers a great selection with a wide variety of different sandwiches. This particular location has a interesting decor that is actually pretty neat. Seemed to understaffed and food took way longer than necessary. However, sandwiches offered exceptional portions with quality ingredients. Overall, a fine established that could benefit from increased focus on service."}
{"text":"See ya subway! Hello DiBellas! Ok so what I love about this place is their everything bread but unfortunately they were sold out for the next 15 mins when I got there which prompted me to give them 4 stars. It's my favorite and I had a serious craving for a tuna sandwich on everything bread. So I SUBstituted sesame bread. Anyway I always get the 7 inch tuna. The other sizes are way too big for me but good for sharing. Tuna albacore white and it's got the right amount of mayo topped it with Cheddar cheese banana peppers and olives. Made it a meal and got chips and a drink. It was about $10.00 and worth it! It was starting to get busy when I walked in around 7:00 who would have guessed that on a Thursday?!"}
{"text":"My new favorite chain sub place in the Burgh!  I was in the area one night and had my heart set on finally trying a burger from Winghart's. They were closed for remodeling due to a fire. So I walk into DiBella's and boy am I glad I did! When I walked in I noticed how clean the space was and that it had a old school feel to it.  DiBella's not only offers subs but, salads, macaroni, potato and pasta salads, deli pickles and cookies as well. Think of Five Guy's but, with hoagies as you pick your bread, size of hoagie, cheese and toppings you want. I went up to the counter, looked over the menu and was ready to order. I went with a cheesesteak on their white bread, (similar to pretzel bread) provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, banana and sweet peppers, mayo, BBQ sauce and steak sauce.   I got my sub toasted so the provolone could melt a little more. I added a combo of chips and a drink also. I grabbed my bag of chips, went over and filled my cup and went down to the cash register to pay. The smell of my sub being made was absolutely intoxicating! A few minutes I sat down to enjoy my hoagie. Let me tell you, it was EPIC! From the fresh bread to the tender steak to the fresh condiments, it was truly one of the best chain store subs I've ever had! It was so good that a few days later I took my wife and daughter to get a sub as well. They also have a kids menu. Service was excellent as well as it was a little crowded but I got my sub fast!  All in all a great place that is a defiant must try!"}
{"text":"Very let down by this place.  The space is very open, but incredibly loud.  I was unable to hear the sandwich maker over the incredible volume of the establishment.  We ordered 2 combos and it was almost $30.  Both were ordered to be toasted... the bread came out soft and gummy while the meats were heavily cooked... toasting a sandwich is supposed to toast the bread to give it some crust.  Their italian was also not up to the standards of most italian hoagies in the area.  completely let down by this place.  Will stick with other long time established Pittsburgh greats instead of this low budget knock of a hometown staple.  Just to throw it out there... the soda machine didn't have any carbonation, just syrup and water... people didn't even notice... maybe that's the type of people who frequent this place.  People who don't know what things should taste like.  Made me sad, with this store being so close to my house."}
{"text":"I don't get the appeal that results in lines out the door (or maybe that's just the poor setup where the line starts a few feet after you walk into the door.  First off, it is pricey for a sandwich shop.  On the upside, there are a lot of choices for you to customize your sub the way that you want it.  Lots of meats and accouterments to choose from.  The employees taking your order seem to be working at warp-speed, to the point where your head might be spinning after you place your order.  The cashiers and managers down at the other end tend to move a lot slower.  Yet, despite the frenetic pace of the front-line, I always seem to wait forever for my sandwich- usually about 10 minutes. To be clear, I order my sandwiches very simple.  You are given a number then someone is running back and forth from the counter trying to hand out the sandwiches. It is so unorganized and chaotic.    The sandwiches are fine, but nothing spectacular. The portions are generous- the small is quite large.  The large is ludicrous.  I wish they had a bigger assortment of bread- some with seasoning (like a Parmesan oregano, for example).  The pasta salad is good, but over dressed. The cookies are tasty.    Unless you have a coupon, be prepared to pay twice as much as you would at Subway."}
{"text":"We had a great experience during my recent visit to DiBella's.  The gentleman who was making my sub was probably the nicest sub maker I've ever had in my life.  The line was long (during lunch time on a Friday when there was an event in Market Square), but the team kept it moving.  The two subs we got tasted great and they were reasonably priced.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Really wonderful sanwiches! The plain bread is incredible....that sounds dumb, but once you've eaten here you will know what I mean."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 sandwiches for takeout today through Yelp/Grub Hub. All 3 sandwiches were made incorrectly. It took me 5 minutes to fill out the order on my phone, because you have to specify everything on each sandwich, so was very disappointed to get incorrectly made sandwiches. Not just being nit picky, I mean one was not even the correct meat, the double meat we ordered was the wrong sandwich and the bun was wrong on the other. Unfortunately, didn't have any time left on lunch break to go back to exchange them and complain. It's a shame, because what they gave us wasn't too bad. If I ever go back I will only order from the store so I can see my sandwich getting made correctly."}
{"text":"Comparing Dibellas to other sub shops would be like comparing a delicious Prime Rib to Rump Roast...  There's a full list of subs, but the true Dibellas fans know there are only 2 main subs on that menu..The Godfather (Italian) and Cheesesteak.   I would recommend the oil and spicy mustard (all homemade) along with peppers (hot, banana, and mild) and onions which can be tossed on the grill. Also try the everything bread which is absolutely fantastic.   Not many bad things to say about Dibellas. Sometimes the wait can be long during the lunch and dinner rush but it's a small price to pay for delicious fresh subs."}
{"text":"I usually don't review chains.  Stopped here for a quick bite between work and other obligations. I ordered the veggie which was bread, cheese, lettuce, and lots of peppers. I could've had onions and tomatoes, but raw onions and tomatoes and I don't hang out. The other veg option was cheese, which looked like the veggie with more cheese. They have other lunch meat options too but I didn't see anything too amazing. The bread was good but there was a lot of it. I chose the everything and it felt like I was eating a bagel with lettuce and peppers. The prices were average for a sub place.    Ordering was Subway style and they were a little under staffed. We waited too long to order and then too long to pay. Staff was friendly enough, there just wasn't enough of them.   I've had better subs at Penn Station."}
{"text":"I think they are a good option for the area.  The Springhill I normally stay in is right behind this place, and I often stop by after a long flight to grab something to keep at my room.  Like their subs and sometimes get cookies :)   There is not a lot around that area...a few sit in restaraunts...but still pretty good out of the options around..."}
{"text":"very good subs and bread. never quite had a Dagwood as good as the one I got here. fresh baked glistening submarine with warm meats and fresh toppings. the staff was friendly and helpful and the store was clean. a good pick me up after election day depression."}
{"text":"Sometimes I think it's hard to differentiate sub shops - but DiBella's stood out to me! They had so many options and my classic Italian hoagie was EXCELLENT! be warned - a small is 7 inches so be prepared to go big when you order. They also have mediums & larges. It has a very quaint, old-time feel inside and beautiful outdoor seating right in the heart of market square. Match all that with kind & quick service and you have a perfect lunch spot in the burgh!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these subs!  Godfather is amazing on Everything bread!  PLEASE open a location in the North-West Cleveland area!!! :) :)"}
{"text":"My sister goes to the one in Market Square, because she works downtown, and said it was good, so I figured I'd give it a try.  This was my first time, they took my sub order, then the guy tells me to go sit down and he'll bring it out to me.  But of course, I had to pay and get a drink before I sat down, so that was a little confusing.    I ordered the dagwood.  The bread was good, but the meat was lackluster.  And the corned beef was terrible.  It was really chewy, like so chewy they should have thrown it in the trash, not served it in my sub.   The subs are better than subway, but the price is kinda high, $10 for a sub a drink and a cookie.  Everywhere there are signs that say World's Best Subs, it's even on your cup, and the whole time I'm thinking lies, all lies!  A much better place to go if you want good subs is Penn Station in Monroeville."}
{"text":"I'm in love with these subs! I get the Veggie with everything except olives. It was like a party in my mouth! The small had to be at least 7\". I almost couldn't finish, but pushed on because it was so delicious. Take a minute and join Club Bread. I received a small sub for free.  This would likely become my sub establishment of choice if it were closer to home. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Talk about a great find! Stumbled in by chance and found the inside of the subway shop to be extremely charming and clean... and the bread + cheesesteak did NOT disappoint. It wasn't greasy and overbearing. Very very good! Will be back."}
{"text":"Great sub place. The godfather on the everything bread is my go to sub. The others sound really good as well but have not ventured out. I just enjoy the godfather too much. They need more sub shops in northeast Ohio like Dibellas. Great service, fresh ingredients, and large sandwiches."}
{"text":"Some of the best hoagies around. Bread is always fresh and delicious. I highly recommend \"The Godfather\", an Italian style hoagie LOADED with meats. Here's a tip--NEVER order extra meat, they are already loaded with meat!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Lazy staff making the sandwiches. My sub was DRENCHED in oil. I threw it out the second I received it. No free refills. The one in Independence, OH is friendlier, cleaner, free refills, and EXCELLENT SUBS. We will be sticking to the one in independence from now on."}
{"text":"Fabulous bread and decent amount of meat on BIG sub. My medium is basically two lunches. Tasty pasta salad and no problem with big order for entire office."}
{"text":"This is a very good sub. Fresh hot cheese steak. Great bread. Good outside area and quick service. Loved it. Did not try the cold subs,but they looked great as well and huge."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because of all the glowing reviews. But I was a little disappointed. It was really busy but I was taken care of quickly. The decor was nostalgic and comfortable. Staff was friendly. I got a french dip and a cookie to eat in.   Before I get into the quality of the food, I'll mention the portions. They are huge portions for your money! I got the smallest size sandwich they had and I could hardly finish it. The cookie was good, tasted store bought (which isn't really a bad thing!) And the sandwich was just ok. Nothing particularly special. Au jus? Kind of bland. I felt like I could have gone to Arby's and gotten something similar. (Dare I say, better?)   I'll give this place another try and get something else later. But I will say its a nice change of pace from Subway."}
{"text":"The #1 priority of a sandwich shop is fresh bread and DiBellas strictly rotates without exception. When asked what type of bread I want, I always say I want the freshest and I'm always told,  they make their bread fresh everyday. That does not mean you get fresh bread everyday because I often get stale bread. Like today. I just don't have time for it anymore. The last time, I sent my sub back. I can go to subway for a sore jaw and cardboard. 81 reviews and 116 helpful votes, I tell it like it is, not like other reviews."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good sandwich, but WOW did DiBella's rewrite my sub shop hierarchy here in CLE.  Every visit I try a new sandwich, and they have continued to impress with every bite.  If you're making your maiden voyage I suggest the \"Godfather\".  If you've been several time you know the routine.  I'm currently dreaming of their corned beef.   The atmosphere is nostaligic in 1940's era diner.  Good music.  Amazing subs."}
{"text":"I just left the restaurant with a sub meal to go. I was greeted promptly and everyone seemed very nice. While waiting for my food, the woman making my sandwich at the grill corrected another employee about the prep, which quickly turned verbally combative in nature. All of this while 3 customers, me included, stood by not knowing what to do during the exchange. If the woman was a manager, she should know to bring up needed information away from customers, not call employees out on the spot, for all to see AND hear. I was so embarrassed by the spectacle, I will NOT be returning. The sandwiches are very good, but not good enough to suffer through the humiliation of fellow workers. Great job on loosing a customer."}
{"text":"The best subs around...great service, and cute girls"}
{"text":"Delicious subs.  The staff is kind of new, so they are getting used to where things are, but the service was good.  Got a small sub, and it lasted me all day"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever period I have nothing bad to say about it you even can get pasta salad and potatoe salad or a huge pickle with your deluxe sandwich it's a tad pricy but u get what u pay for and it's way worth it"}
{"text":"We found this place pretty confusing. We came in on a Saturday afternoon around 3:00 and it took a very long time to be waited on. There were several people working making sandwiches and one kept apologizing to us (we're guessing for the wait) but we still weren't clear where to order even though we were the only ones in line. Once they were ready to help us it went pretty quickly. The bread is the best part about the sandwiches- the sesame bread is amazing. They put a lot of meat on the sandwiches which is nice. The medium size is generous/huge- neither my husband or I could finish our sandwich. The restaurant  is nice inside- pretty big- with jazz music playing. Overall, it was OK- kind of confusing and frustrating service with a long wait, great bread, pretty good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great spot in Market Square for submarine sandwiches.   They get five stars for the large servings at a reasonable price, the fresh ingredients, and the excellent quality multigrain hoagie roll.   I also like the large size and plentiful seating. If you go way back there's a little more private area away from the counter where you can sit. They have free WiFi that had a good signal.   There's a selection of about 10 specialty subs and also an option to build your own. I got the Uncle Louie, which had roast beef, turkey and ham. It was really good and they offer the standard toppings. They make the sandwich while you wait and you pick and choose the toppings you want.   They have macaroni, potato and pasta salads available for $1.79 but I passed since the sandwich was so big.   It's nice the place is open on Sunday. I'll definitely come again when I'm in downtown."}
{"text":"I think it's an insult to even compare this place to Subway! It is a chain and, therefore, not quite as good as your mom and pop Italian grocery, but it sure as heck beats any national chain. Bread alone makes it worth a try, chewy crust, soft inside, makes me glad for gluten. Meats are fresh tasting as are the toppings. I like the three different sizes--plenty for the larger appetites. I walked in at 10:15 on a Tuesday and was the only one in there so I can't comment on the crowds. Same guy made my sandwich and rang me up, all with a smile. Definitely worth a try if you're Primantied out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time tonight at the end of a long day.  I really wanted to like DiBella's more, especially since they're close to me and they're a local place.  I ordered the meatball sub and it wasn't the best I've had or the worst I've had.  The meatballs were hot, which is good, but I got almost no sauce.  Whatever sauce was there, I couldn't taste.  The bread was good, enjoyed the cheese selection choices.  Quite frankly, I enjoy they fact that they offer 3 sizes, but I shouldn't have to ask what the difference size wise was a small, medium or large.  Just my thoughts, take it as your will"}
{"text":"Love this sandwich shop. The sandwiches are delicious, the portions are generous. Service is always friendly.   I can't decide if my favorite sandwich is their roast beef or corned beef. Either way, their \"everything\" roll is perfect. I usually add potato chips. They sell Ms Vicki's chips and they're excellent.   I also love the decor at DiBella's. Old-timey comfort and super clean."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best submarine sandwich I've ever had....and that's saying something.  Bring your best \"hunger pangs\" and enjoy the sweet taste of freshly baked bread, the highest quality meats/cheeses and just about any combination of condiments you can think up.  One of the best discoveries in recent memory!!  She gets a rare 5 Stars from Steve!"}
{"text":"First time to DiBella's. The cheesesteak was legit, at least the way I got it (just steak, peppers, onions, and provolone the way it's supposed to be).  And that's my biggest complaint with places like this. They're so concerned or afraid of offending someone's taste buds that they've sacrificed any sort of identity. Well other than \"fresh baked submarine rolls,\" which I'm not knocking, their bread is good, however, it's the ONLY thing that sets them apart from other sandwich shops. When I order a \"Cheesesteak\" you shouldn't have to ask me if I want mayo, mustard, or oil on it. And you CERTAINLY shouldn't give me the stink eye when my response to such an absurd question is \"on a cheesesteak? No.\"  By default your sandwich should come the way you intend for it to be consumed and display a menu stating as much.  Subway already has the niche in bombarding customers with condiment and topping options so try something else. And watch out DiBella's, they're baking their own bread too!"}
{"text":"subs are great service sucks - don't know what's changed in the last few months but the wait time is now painfully slow - I'm talking 10 mins for a basic sub when only customer in store - didn't use to be this way"}
{"text":"Only reason i'm giving them a 4 instead of a 5 star is because when I got home, I found out they messed up the toppings on my sandwich.   I did the 'build your own' sandwich with the roast beef.  Even though the toppings were messed up, I still enjoyed the meal.  They have whole pickles too.  Which I had to have.  I got the small hoagie and it was plenty.  Restaurant is nice & clean."}
{"text":"I love their Godfather sub, chock full of meat and dripping with flavor. Yesterday was no exception, however they somehow, in the words of the manager, \"destroyed your bread.\" This is a real tragedy, because the everything rolls are the best part of the sandwich, all smooth-crusted and salty.  but hey, happy ending, they comped me another 6 inches of sandwich for free....hello lunch!"}
{"text":"Best subs in the world!!! Just opened"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times..  I just love the godfather. I always get it mayo and oil..  and such a great combination on this sandwich. if you are an italtion hoagie fan... this sandwich is for you. Also I think it is reasonable priced. I also get the medium size one and it is huge.. this is a large anywehere else..  not sure what I large would be."}
{"text":"Total joke. Veggie sandwich was some lettuce, tomato, maybe some olives, on a piece of bread. Costs as much as a huge roast beef though!  Other sandwich we had was so unmemorable I forgot what we had already."}
{"text":"Large sandwiches for the $$. However I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with everything on it. When it arrived to my table and opened it, only meat. Nothing else. Very blah. They were too busy for me to reorder and was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a sub for lunch. It took 25 minutes from walking in the door to getting my order togo. Ok it took half of my lunch to get my sub. When I unwrapped my sandwich no cheese no onions no sweet peppers and 3 banana peppers. How hard is it to make a cheese steak? I understand lunch is busy but come on if you're going to give me bad service at least make me a good sandwich. Very very unhappy."}
{"text":"Started in my hometown and growing into a nice little chain best bread , not your read the paper through the meats on this sub it will leave you full.   The cookies are delious too"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I'm the only one in line to get a sub, I walk up to the counter and wait to be greeted there. A few minutes pass and then another customer stands to my left at the same counter, which would be behind me in line. That guy gets greeted right away. Ok whatever they made a mistake. Then another guy walks straight to the cashier, not where you place your order and was told to place the order where I'm waiting and he gets served first. I just walked out. I've had DiBella's at many other locations but I won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Seriously the best subs we've ever had! Amazing bread & delicious meat. Yummmm! It was lunch time on a Saturday & it was super busy. Service was very fast & friendly. We will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food here is really really good. I would eat this over Subway or Firehouse any day of the week."}
{"text":"These are the decisions that you regret in life.  I had decided to go to Melt and know they have amazing sandwiches, but there was a wait for a table so I decided to slide next door to DiBellas.   Maybe it was because of my submaker - I walked up and said I had never been there and he proceeded to start reading the menu to me.  I cut him off and asked him what the most popular sandwich was and he told me that everything was really popular.  Rather than educate him on the fact that - by definition - everything could not be the most popular I just went with a Dagwood - which was featured in a poster.    I paid almost $10 for my sandwich and drink and went to sit down.  A couple minutes later a sub got dropped off.  I can't say the sub was bad, but I did not feel like I had made the best choice and the meat/cheese/topping ratio did not correspond with the price paid and the size of the bread.  It's not that I will never come back to DiBella's, but I won't go out of my way to find one."}
{"text":"This was a first time visit and well worth the walk.  I went with the medium Godfather combo.  Huge size, awesome bread and meat/veggie's made this a keeper.  You always have to compare a hoagie to others and this dominates.  I will be heading back down the road.  I was scoping out the other subs at the table and I need to keep trying them out."}
{"text":"good food , sloppy unfriendly service. I just can't recommend eating here. get it to go. staff is unsmiling, and unfriendly"}
{"text":"Dibella's is a great sandwich place.  The subs are delicious.  Lots of options when it comes to bread, cheese and condiments.  But more importantly, everyone here is friendly and helpful.  Even when things get busy the employees don't lose their cool.   I've tried a few of their sandwiches, but I always come back to the Godfather.  It's what they are famous for and after eating one you understand why.  Those cookies aren't bad either.   I was happy to see this location open in the North Hills and even happier that it is staffed with pleasant people offering outstanding customer service with a solid product.  I'm pleased to have this Dibella's close to home."}
{"text":"Boom! Love these subs. I've tried the Godfather, the Phili Cheesesteak, and Chicken Ceasar. All awesome."}
{"text":"2 and a half Stars is honestly a little much, this place SUCKS. The people are awful, not helpful at all. Seemed too bothered to help and It was obvious that the employees didn't want to be there. Good thing the bread is good. Otherwise I'd be f***ing pissed."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Employees mumble, watch you stand there waiting to pay without ringing you out, rang me out for a meal and then left my sub on the back counter and didn't give me my drink or side.... Then proceeded to yell about taking smoke breaks and failed to apologize when we nicely asked if they could hand us the things we paid for. Seriously will think twice about going back again, which sucks because the food is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is great... All Dibellas are.   The service at this particular one is horrible, however. Everyone mills around like they have no idea and it takes forever to get your food.  Every single time."}
{"text":"Yum!  First sub I ate in years that actually tasted like a good Jersey sub :) The place was clean, and two out of the three servers were friendly...the other one began my order than disappeared leaving the two friendlier ones to finish up. I will return there if my subs always turn out that good."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time eating here and I was so surprised at how good my Italian sub was. I think it's called the \"Godfather\", but either way it was delicious. It was thick, messy, and warm just enough. I ordered a small and it was more than enough.  I know a sandwich is going to be good when it's messy and a new napkin is needed after every bite.  I will be going back again soon.  Update: false alarm! That was only a one time experience because I went back and was disappointed by my sandwich. It was just \"okay\" and that's not okay for the price. I probably won't be back but it was a great first experience."}
{"text":"Love it  Great food  Great customer service value  Love it  Friendly, always makes the sandwiches to order and is fresh. Definitely a good bang for your buck  Deliciousness"}
{"text":"I was in Independence for a job fair as I'm moving back to Cleveland soon, and after I was finished about 1 PM I was totally famished and in the mood for a nice lunch.  I checked Yelp and saw that DiBella's had good reviews and was just down the road so I gave it a try.  That was a great idea!  There was virtually no wait and I ordered a medium Godfather.  After I saw it being made, I was worried that it was going to be too much to handle because it was huge.  The large looks like it's made with a whole loaf of bread.  It made a subway sub look like a hot dog by comparison.  The bread was fresh made and it had plenty of genoa salami, capicolla and spicy ham.  It was the best sub I've had since I was in the Navy in Newport RI where the \"grinders\" are the real deal.  The sandwich was so good I killed it!  I can't wait to go there again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"High quality subs, the bread was fresh and the staff is friendly! I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Great subs... Love the godfather sub always get it... Love the variety of oils that they use... There's mostly a line but it seems to go by very quickly... Better than all the other sub places in my eyes..."}
{"text":"This chain location  is a solid option if you're not down for a wait at Primanti's. Actually I think it's better than Primanti's, but I am not a member of the Yinz nation.  The bread quality here is very good - imagine the freshness of Subway but with real bread. Great texture, and I learned an \"everything\" works better with deli meats than it does with cream cheese or smoked fish. The meats themselves were solid - I liked the horseradish mayonnaise on my Uncle Louie, a combo of roast beef, ham and turkey. Salad items were fresh as well. My partner's Old Fashioned (turkey, ham, Genoa salami) was also savory.  A medium feeds one large appetite. If you plan on having dinner, share your large with a friend. Not on the level of a Gaucho or even a Thin Man, but it's a crime that there are ten thousand Subways and maybe two dozen of these. None where I live."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this more than I did.  My co-workers and I decided to stop in here for lunch yesterday, and I think everyone was happier with their sandwiches than I was.  I go the DiBella dip, which is essentially a French Dip hoagie.  And the dip was good, the roast beef was fine, and I ordered grilled peppers and onions to go with it.  I got white bread, which was okay.  On the whole, I think it was too lean.  Which is why I ordered it in the first place, because it was just about the only hot sandwich that wasn't over 1,000 calories in the medium size!  I kept biting into it and dipping and thinking, \"Man, some provolone cheese would help this a lot.\"  The ordering process also gave me a little bit of heartburn.  You go up to an available person behind the counter and tell them what you want, so they go make it for you.  What was unclear, however, was whether you're supposed to wait until they hand you a sandwich right there, go pay first then wait, or what.  In any event, they do have numbers that you can take, but it seemed to arbitrary as to who got their sandwich at the grill/counter, or who needed to go pay then wait for it.  So yeah.  Just an okay experience.  I may be convinced to return, but I probably wouldn't seek this out again."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Order a steak sub, it's all fresh, made to order, on fresh baked bread.  Meatball is fantastic too, heck, all their subs are awesome!  This truly is the best sub restaurant I've ever been to. It's a local grown Rochester, N.Y. \"Mom and Pop\" sub destination that actually found a way to grow without locations giving up on the true quality many people seek. But, give it some time; it does take 10 minutes or so to get that fresh created delicious amazing sub. I recommend chomping down one of their fresh baked cookies while waiting.  Here's my breakdown on what you may be looking for when seeking a sub:  Exceptional quality, exceptional taste, fair price, lot of love, slow time = Dibellas  Poor quality, poor taste, bad price, no love, fair speed = Subway  Fair/poor quality, fair taste, fair price, no love, exceptional speed = Jimmy Johns  Conclusion, give yourself an extra ten minutes and eat the best sub around...Dibellas!"}
{"text":"Can I just say the obvious here?  It's Subway, on steroids.  Everything is just about as similar as you can get. From how you order to how you pay. However, the most glaring difference here is the price. When I went to pay I about hit the floor. For their \"medium\" sub meal combo I could have had two foot longs at Subway.  The thing that I did fall in love with here was the bread. I know the other place bakes theirs fresh as well, but it does not compare to this.  The crust kind of crumbles when you bite into it, and the innards are so soft and great at keeping what's inside, inside.  And do they ever load up what's on the inside, I'm not talking about the fillers. I'm talking about the actually meat.  I tasted more meat than veggie, which pleased me.  The one thing that I didn't really like was not being able to see the toppings. It's great that they interact with you, but it's also hard to hear over everyone else that is in the restaurant.  Plus I like to see that what is put on the sub is as fresh as the bread.  In summation, even though the price shocked me, the taste out shocked me. Is that a phrase?  Oh well if it isn't, I'm using it."}
{"text":"All I can say is ok, something is missing in each and everything I looked at ordering. The bread was just alright I had the everything. The corned beef was ok, the Swiss cheese was strong and over all it would have been better with cole slaw or sauerkraut but neither was offered. Hoping for better, pretty much your average chain sub shop"}
{"text":"A company came to my school and catered these for lunch and it was honestly one of the best subs I've had in my life! I feel like you're probably thinking it's just some bread and meat and fillings, so how good can it get? But the ingredients tasted so fresh. The bread had a unique grain-y texture that wasn't too firm and relatively healthy. I got a turkey sandwich and finished it so fast! Definitely want to stop by and check out the brick-and-mortar location, but I can attest to their simple yet great tastes and ingredients!"}
{"text":"I am generally not a sub person but this is crazy good! Had the turkey, ham, swiss on wheat with lettuce and tomato and a touch of their special oil blend...yum.   Note to others do not order their trays for catering.  No lettuce or tomato...just the meat, cheese, maybe some onions and a few condiments...not good.  Maybe next time our business should order the box lunches instead!   I had to take a star off due to this."}
{"text":"I worked up to courage to give Dibella's another try after my previous disaster of a sandwich on a prior visit.  I followed my own advice and kept it simple.  Small cold turkey sub on everything bread.  Loved it.The bread is so fresh and chewy.  Veggies are fresh and the turkey was plentiful.    For a sub shop it gets 4 stars, just be careful what you order.  ie Avoid the Dagwood and avoid the hot sandwiches if it involves cold cuts.    It's quick and cheap (especially if you have someone to share a sandwich with).  It's comparable to Jimmy Johns with better bread and bigger sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is a great lunch option. The bread is the reason I come. Love the steak sandwich on everything bread. The meatball is also very good. Prices are fair. My vegetarian coworker got a veggie sub that was loaded with cheese and roasted vegetables. She loved it. I def recommend."}
{"text":"I am pretty obsessed with the multi grain bread at this place. The portions are huge. I have had the steak a few times and I love it. My vegetarian coworker really likes this place too. I guess they fry up a bunch of veggies and cheese and put it on the sub if you order the vegetable. Really the bread is the reason to go here. They also carry very good ice teas. Nom Nom."}
{"text":"4:00 pm on a Thursday.  All the tables and booths were dirty.  3 employees standing around talking as there were only two customers including me.  Another customer walks in and has to clean his own table. Food- C-.  Barely any toppings on the sub. Seems like they're being stingy. Sorry DiBellas..I used to recommend you.  You are officially..OFF THE LIST!!"}
{"text":"I love DiBellas. I am from upstate NY, and I am a sub guy.  This location has let me down twice though. Most recently yesterday when I asked for extra mayo and received so little that I couldn't even taste it. It was actually dry from lack of mayo.  Also after they weighed out the meat, (they kind of ball it up on a piece of wax paper on the scale to portion it out) they never spread it back out over the length of the bread. Picture the last 1.5\" of each end meatless. (And basically mayo-less.)  And everyone that works here looks sad and worn out by life. I guess that's late capitalism for ya tho"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times since they opened. DiBella's is one of the best subs you can get in Pgh, to say nothing of dahntahn.   There's a large assortments of subs and meats - capicola, corned beef, chicken philly, genoa salami, ham, etc. I've had everything from the dagwood to the old fashioned, philly cheesesteak  to buffalo chicken. All quite delicious and a good balance between meat, cheese and toppings.   And you can get them hot! Me does not like cold subs.  The wait can be a little long during the lunch rush but I think they do a pretty good job considering the volume. The order takers are pretty friendly.  Overall, this is one of my favorites in market square, esp. getting to-go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside and people-watch while eating."}
{"text":"Not the best sandwich I have ever had...truly made better in my own kitchen."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches, the problem is they can't get an order correct.  After 3 out of 4 times the order has been wrong.  Hot sandwiches take 10 min longer then cold ones to prepare.  The sandwiches do taste good and are a good size if you can put up with the slowness and possible mistakes."}
{"text":"Possibly the best sandwich shop I've ever found anywhere. Amazing subs!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sandwich shop. Need a recommendation?  Try the Godfather on everything bread. It is a wonderful flavor explosion. Service is fast and the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"As far as sub sandwiches go, Dibella's is about as good as it gets! I saw that today was the opening day and decided to give it a shot due to restaurants seriously lacking in this area.   The ordering process was a bit chaotic and disorganized but once I figured out what I was going to order, I was not at all disappointed. As a newbie mistake, I ordered a large cheese steak (which ended up being enough food to feed a small village). I am 5'11' and 240 lbs and half of this sub put me to the point of bursting. While $12 seemed a bit expensive for my meal, I quickly changed my opinion on the matter when I realized that it would feed me for at least 2 meals.  Besides being massive, the sandwich was also amazingly delicious. It can't even be compared with the likes of Subway, Jimmy John's, or Quiznos. They are simply nothing alike and Dibella's is a million times superior to those places. The bread is what makes all the difference. It is soft and dense on the inside but slightly firm and crunchy on the outside.  I was blown away by my first experience here and it certainly won't be my last."}
{"text":"Far better than Subway with an old-fashioned appeal to it. DiBella's has been open since 1918, yet the venue seems to have been updated several times.   Now, the food. I purchased a 12-inch whole wheat sub called \"The One\", which is a gargantuan-sized sub that you can't eat all at once (unless you are a hungry teenager). Add a bag of chips, drinks & two fresh cookies, and you are easily up to $16. Yet don't fret. The portion sizes of sandwiches are so large that you'll more than likely will be eating multiple meals out of this. The meat selections seemed to be made fresh, and the toppings nonetheless generous.  Customer service is good, and this venue never seems to be super-slammed busy around the lunch hour during the week. Yet don't be surprised if it does.   Will be back."}
{"text":"The 1 star represents the service not the food.  Came in at 3 pm in the afternoon and nobody was in there.  Two people behind the counter socializing and didn't even acknowledge we were there until 10 minutes of standing there.  By the way we were only a foot away from them and said they would be with us soon while doing nothing.    Took our order by asking \"what do you want\".  Only ordered two subs and my wife's sub she said no olives and don't toast it in which the ignored both requests.  Took there good old time making it.  Only writing this because we love the food and hope service gets better so they can last.  We know the chipotle down the street had to fire rehire everyone and start from scratch because of service issues.  Looks to be a trend."}
{"text":"Spend your $10 and 1000 calories elsewhere. Subs are boring and service is questionable, even for counter service."}
{"text":"Got the Godfather hot on everything bread with a chocolate chip cookie...the wrapper lied...it was not the best sub I've ever had...it was fine...nothing remarkable.  I would probably try the buckeye cold on  a classic hoagie roll next time..."}
{"text":"Best subs in Pittsburgh. Fantastic cookies.  About the subs: Heavy on meat and cheese. Light on the veggies. Homemade bread. Delicious Dibellas exclusive oil based dressing. Reasonable prices. How can you go wrong here?"}
{"text":"The only problem I have is that the customer is over-charged for the sandwich.  The bread is great and everything else that goes on the sandwich. But there is NOT enough meat on the sandwich.  No WAy NEAR enough meat for the price of the sub. Yes u can pay more for extra meat, but you should not have to.  Bread to meat ratio is ridiculous. When you have to look for the meat on your sub that cost almost $10. then there is a problem.  You decide... I did.  I agree with other posters... THEY SKIMP!"}
{"text":"Awesome sub - can't truthfully say it was the best sub ever but it definitely satisfies and I really like how you can personalize it and how quick they turn around your order.  Some of best sub bread I've ever had.  Beats Primatti Brothers hands down!"}
{"text":"This place is like the evil antichrist of Subway - yay for fattening subs!  All I'll say is: Godfather on white, HOT, plus lettuce, tomatoes, onions, olives, banana peppers, and brown mustard.  So good even the leftovers get stolen from the refrigerators at work!  Oh and get here BEFORE 12:00... the line is insane!  Evil subs, I tell thee... evil!"}
{"text":"Quizno's with better bread and 20 questions you have to answer just to order a sub.   Not bad, just not memorable.   I ordered a small dagwood and it was pretty tasty and big for being a \"small\". Lots of meat, including turkey and corned beef. What I can say is that not one of the tastes really stood out. It really just tasted like miscellaneous meat on yummy bread.   Back to the 20 questions part: Be ready to pick from toppings galore spewed from the mouths of the helpful employees. I had to sit there and think about all the meat, cheese, bread, peppers and condiment options for at least a minute or two while I felt bad for taking a while. Not a great situation if there's a line, but there wasn't, thank goodness. And the menus on the wall? Not really all that helpful.   The dinning room itself really didn't have much to make you want to stay and enjoy the $20 you just dropped on two sub combos. It's a shame because you really wait a while for your food, too.   Again, DiBella's wasn't horrible by any means, but it just wasn't a place I'd be clambering to get back to. I'd rather spend the money on two delish, fresh subs from Bogtrotters in Ohio City. Local, baby."}
{"text":"Great sub place!  They are more expensive then subway, jimmy johns, and quiznos but you get a lot more bang for the buck.  I got their godfather per recommendations and it was very good."}
{"text":"OMG so good! I had the veggie sandwich for 2 days in row. The whole sandwich was good and the bread was so fresh. I walked in the snow for that sandwich! Only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I thought the food was overpriced. Just a small sandwich was almost $8.00. If they threw in a soda and cookie or chips, it would be more reasonable for that price."}
{"text":"When you give a place 3 stars it makes it look like there's something wrong with that place, even though it's A-OK.  People LOVE DiBella's.  It's got a cult following.  The inside of the restaurant was very clean, everyone was nice, but I do not love DiBella's.  I'm a Peppi's fan.  The thing about DiBella's is the bread is really good, but they give you an entire loaf to the point where it's just not necessary.  I never thought I'd be annoyed by bread before, but here I am.  I got the everything bread, and it was everything, in copious amounts.  Then, when ordering, I choked and got the salami sub...why?  I don't know but I'll tell you what, it was really good there was just so much bread.  Bread for days.  I ordered a medium sub and it was a foot long and then I told my coworker i was going to eat the whole thing but tapped out after 1/4 of it.  :(  DiBella's is good ,but i dont get hot and bothered over it.  But people love it.  Try it, you might too!"}
{"text":"Very good subs that are HUGE and made fresh. I was surprised how big my small sub turned out to be - tons of meat and bread. Very good sandwich. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is good. But we came in at 6:30 and they were dead inside yet every single table was dirty. This place is huge and not one clean table. Had to do it myself. This place needs a serious cleaning"}
{"text":"Subs here are really, really good. The size is intimidating. I can't eat more than a small, although a large is plenty large enough for sharing. You can gets subs hot or cold. If you get them hot, they grill them up and deliver to your table. It does take a little while, so I like when everyone in the party get the same (either hot or cold) so there is no waiting. Really cool decor, old fashioned and interesting. Subs can get really juicy when hot, kind of messy but so worth it. I wish the rolls were a little thinner, sometimes it seems like so much bread for the meat & cheese. The only downside is that I would really like fries with that! But I will settle for their enormous cookies, pasta or potato salad."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a good sandwich!  Everything tasted so fresh, and the sandwiches were expertly assembled.  Though I think the bread (which is made there in the store) really makes the sandwich, I am also a fan of the good quality meats they use.    The staff was helpful, friendly, and patient with me as an indecisive first timer.  Great location on Market Square.  Wish I had one of these back home!"}
{"text":"Ughhh.  The 3.5 star review dilemma.  Guess I'll round up today.  Dibella's subs is a step above your standard Subway chain.  Pittsburgh doesn't really have delis or other sub shops, like Potbelly's, everywhere so I think this location should do really well.  If there was some actual competition, I think I'd go somewhere else.  The bread is fresh and delicious, and it's pretty much the highlight of the sandwich.  I ordered the Godfather sub, which seemed like a safe bet.  The meat is fried, which makes it SO greasy.  So when they lather on the mayo and oil, despite asking for light, it's a little revolting.  It's not that I watch what I eat, but I actually don't like the feeling of my arteries clogging while I eat.  My acid reflux was so annoyed, and I had no desire to finish my whole sub.  But you just can't lie, it still tasted really good.  Only other complaint was that it feels a little grimy."}
{"text":"Awesome food, no skimping on the meat, and wonderful staff. I had the Godfather, and it was delicious. Had one of the cookies too, also fantastic. No issues with the Sanitary conditions of this location, appeared to be very clean."}
{"text":"Best subs! Lots of meet and great bread. Godfather and Italian are both great choices. Enjoying with Andrew now."}
{"text":"***Update Checked this place out again six months later and I still don't get the hype. I tried the cheesesteak and it was just okay. Better than Mr. Hero, and I do like the bread, but nothing I'd crave again. I opted for a chocolate chip cookie this time and it was basically like eating raw cookie dough, very under cooked and I wasn't a fan. Potato salad was just okay, definitely needs black pepper added to it.  Food was okay, but I probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"DiBella's is a great place to stop if you need a quick lunch downtown. While it does get pretty packed for the lunch rush, the line is usually better than it looks and it moves quickly. I've had hot and cold sandwiches here and have always enjoyed them. I usually get a small or medium, occasionally going for a large if I will need lunch leftovers for the next day. It's a little overwhelming with ordering if you've never been there before, so make sure you peruse the menu and know what you want before you step up to the counter!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today for lunch. We began at Grant Street and walked down Forbes turning our nose at every place since we have ate there 100x in the last 4 years.  We get to Market Sq and decide on DiBella's since neither of us have been there.   I ordered \"The Cowboy\".. which is cubed chicken, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and thick, smoked bacon. I enjoyed the sanwich and was surprised on the size of it.  Bobby ordered \"DiBella's Dip\" shredded roast beef with the side of au jus sauce. You can order it cold or hot. He ordered it hot and added sauteed mushrooms, onions and peppers. He gave the sandwich two thumbs up and again the sandwich was huge. I have no intentions on heading back to Subway, Quiznos, Penn Station Subs (yuck) or Jimmy Johns. They know how to make a sub! Also, their bread was perfect!   Prices are pretty steep though.. we each ordered the medium sized sub and made them both combos (medium drink + a cookie or bag of chips) Our total came to $25. Can't really eat Dibella's everyday but it will be a nice treat and I'm glad to have changed up my lunch routine."}
{"text":"Very good subs, selection and nice, courteous and efficient workers! Very clean, nostalgic atmosphere. Fries would be a great addition to the menu. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One on the East side and now one finally in Strongsville.  These subs are absolutely HUGE.  I went in to order a turkey sub and the guy behind the counter gave me a recommendation of a sub called \"The Godfather\" on everything bread.  Great suggestion and it was really, really good.  He suggested to me and I would suggest it to you.  Whether you go for a different type of sub...try the everything bread.  It has sea salt, pepper, seasame seeds and a ton other stuff........looking forward to going back again"}
{"text":"Fresh subs that are delicious! Far better than a couple Sub chains out there. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This is not my favorite sub restaurant, but it is OK. I visited in the evening after dinner when it was not busy. I still had to wait a little while for my sub. I did have a table and chair to sit at, which I appreciated. My tastebuds were satisfied but not thrilled with the taste."}
{"text":"DiBella's - just like Mom used to make!  My mom always made sandwiches where she would fry the meat and add it to fresh baked bread!  This is what DiBella's does.  They are famous for their sandwch called the Godfather!  They are also famous for their chocolate chip cookies!  The setup of this DiBella's is great.  They have alot of tables and traffic flows through the restaurant.    If you order a hot sandwich they deliver it to your table.  I have always found that they are very timely with their service.  I even used the facilities there and they are very clean!  Great Food, Great Service, and Clean!"}
{"text":"Favorite sub place!!!  I love their subs.  The first time I came across a DiBella's was in Buffalo New York.  I was so EXCITED when they came to Pittsburgh.  The subs are the way Gram used to make them: heat the meat and melt the cheese!!  The best part of the meal is always dessert and their cookies are to die for.  I love to bake and make excellent chocolate chip cookies but I love their cookies.  I had to give this place only 3 stars becuase of the setup.  The door is always cramped at lunchtime and the line is always out the door.  They always seem to have enough staff on hand to make the line go quickly but you are fighting the people coming out of the restaurant.  Once you pay for your food you have to fight to fill your drink.  Everyone stands by the registers to wait for thier food.  5 stars for the food but 1 one star for the setup!"}
{"text":"While the family loves Dibellas Subs and they make arguably the best subs around (including vegetarian options), we were so disappointed when going in today. No one even acknowledged us when we walked in. There were four people working, only one working hard making subs. The others were just standing around. There was literally not even one clean table in the place to sit. Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were geeat, I got the philly cheese steak and my wife got the Godfather which looks even better."}
{"text":"Nice place.  More than your basic sub.  Heartier in general.  Decent price for the quality.  Nice selection.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Decent tasting subs. I had the cowboy and the biggest take away for me is that the medium was bigger than I was expecting. I'd have to say the best part of my lunch was the potato salad."}
{"text":"The young man behind the counter smelled of marijuana stronger than any of the cooking going on in their establishment. Coincidentally I was given a completely wrong sub, imagine that! Sorry to whoever got mine, I hate mushrooms and yours was a philly so I feel your pain.  A+ to this location's management, nice crew!"}
{"text":"Best tasting, fresh, slightly buttery, flaky, fluffy bread of any sub shop. DiBellas is DiBomb"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to stop in here over the weekend to find out what their subs were all about and to see what makes them old-fashioned.  The old-fashioned connection for me was the vintage décor of the dining room and the huge high counter where your order is taken.  Other than that I am not sure if it has anything to do with the subs. Curious to know differently.  I thought the sub was decent in size and tasted OK but it didn't stand out as anything different or unique.  The bun was good-tasting but it was very oversized in comparison to the ingredients inside.  I couldn't even see if there was any cheese on the sandwich and I barely could taste any of the steak because it was all overpowered by the bread.  I am not sure if it is worth another visit or not."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken phillie sandwiches. Try them on \"everything\" bread, no oil or mustard. Has to be American cheese. Not always consistent but always tasty. My wife and I buy a large and share it, best way to go!"}
{"text":"Food was ok - nothing special.  We are seniors on a budget - first time there.  Large Chicken Caesar sub and Large Streak and Cheese - $11.29 and $12.09.  One drink $2.19 and one cookie $1.49 tax was $2.16 and we ate for $29.22.  EXPENSIVE."}
{"text":"Solid place to get a sub done the right way! Recently I started working on the Blvd. of Allies downtown and we are only a few blocks away from Market Square. Needless to say, there are what seems like hundreds of restaurants and places to enjoy for lunch. However, if you are in the mood for a fresh juicy sub, DiBellas is the place to go!  First thing I noticed when walking in was how quickly you get served. The cooks will flag you down and then you approach the counter and place your order. I went with the pulled pork sub that comes with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I know, to die for! I got the large because I was not too familiar with their portion size.   This \"large\" hoagie was massive! Literally it was like 2 subs. The cook was nice enough to cut both halves in half for me! The sub itself was delicious. The sub roll was so soft and you can tell the freshness after the first bite. The veggies were good, and I actually enjoyed the coleslaw that came on top as well. The only nit picky thing was about the pork itself, could have been shredded more. The big chunks of pork were tough to eat because they would fall out the sub and get pretty messy. But not a huge deal.   Overall, a solid 4 stars. At DiBellas, you are getting a quality sub with great ingredients, fresh rolls and quick service! The service was the second best thing about my trip, because when you are in Market Square on an hour lunch break, fast service is a essential!"}
{"text":"Instead of another trip to Primanti, I decided to try DeBella's, and I was very impressed. I had a medium-sized sub, which was equivilant to a large sub most other places.   The bread, sesame in this case, was excellent, and the tuna strong.   I wish they had DiBella's outside of the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"If this review were based solely on service, they would have gotten 1 star. I am totally unimpressed with the staff at the Robinson location. The teen who waited on me mumbled and I couldn't understand him as he asked me what type of cheese I wanted. He seemed annoyed that I couldn't hear him. SPEAK-UP KID! While I was ordering a young lady came in to pick up a sandwich tray that had been pre-ordered. They could not find the tray and it took 5 out of the 7 people working to look for it and resolve the issue. That means that everyone else had to wait longer. The manager should have been able to handle that request alone, but they all turned it into social hour-laughing about how the tray wasn't made. I was beyond annoyed.   But this isn't just about service...it's also about the quality of the food. The food is delicious. The subs are so yummy . The bread is perfect...not hard bread but not mushy either. Just perfect. They are a little bit pricy, but totally worth it. The house dressing is an oil dressing and it is perfect.   So DiBella's...love the food, but hire some more competent people with some manners, PLEASE!"}
{"text":"DiBella's definitely has some of the best high-quality fresh subs around. Unfortunately this location is not up to par. The food has always been enjoyable (4 stars), however, the service is extremely lacking (1 star). I don't know if their employees could be any more lethargic. Even at lunchtime they have no sense of speed or urgency and always seem to be understaffed. Last time I was there, we left while waiting in line for 10 minutes when we were only one of 2 parties waiting! (The guy behind us in line did the same and left too.) We might have waited a bit longer, but the staff neglected to even acknowledge us."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a sub. I have been here about three times,  eating 3 different sandwiches, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like DiBella's. The service and ordering system are both great. The sandwiches are very good and very fresh. I love their cookies too. DiBella's beats Subway hands down."}
{"text":"\"Everything that we are and do reflects our old-fashioned values. These qualities are what make the difference between an ordinary sub and a DiBella's sub.\" And I tend to agree, This sub shop blows Subway out of the ocean.   The office had a catered lunch today. When I heard that we were having sub for lunch I wasn't too thrilled, but never turn down a free meal in these hard times. First thing I noticed when I walked into the lunch room were trays filled with various subs, and EVERYTHING BUNS!!! There was a choice from plain, everything, or multi grain topped with white American cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, and a variety of meats. We could put on our own condiments. According to the website, the bread is baked fresh throughout the day every day so it's always fresh, and it shows! The meat is also flavorful.   Dibella's also has cookie trays. HOMEMADE!!! And man soft, gooey, and OH SO GOOD! Maybe I'll rethink my negative stand on sandwiches. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite while walking around Market Square, and was not disappointed!  I got the chicken cheesesteak, small size, which was actually not that small at all. They packed my sammich with legit chicken breast strips (not the usual shredded kind), which was awesome. The bread! It was soft and so chewy!  There is a decent size dining room if you want to eat in. They also have options for other hot and cold sammiches.   A good option for a quick, cheap and delicious bite."}
{"text":"Stopped here a few weeks ago. It was pretty late, maybe 7 or 7:30 not sure. Anyway, they were out of the bread that I wanted. I think I just got the regular bread. Other than that minor inconvenience, this place was great. I loved my sub and I saved half of it for lunch the next day and it was just as good. I would definitely return. The seating area was clean, the staff was friendly, and the price was reasonable. A favorite for sure."}
{"text":"I am such a sucker for a good sub! In my opinion, DiBella's cannot be beat. I've been to three different Pittsburgh locations, and every sub I get is absolutely delicious!! DiBella's has so many options! Many Italian meats, ham, turkey, chicken, meatball, tuna, etc. with many cheese and bread options and TONS of toppings that are FREE!! You can get your sub hot or cold, or made into a salad. My favorite is a MTO turkey and spicy ham, smothered with all the peppers they have.  DiBella's gets an A+ from me every time!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is great!  First of all, the food is by far the best Submarines I've had in a long long time.  Completely scrumptious from first to last bite.  And filling too!  They also have a great variety of subs on a variety of breads and a variety of toppings.  Lots and lots to choose from making it hard to get \"tired\" of the place.  The place is clean and has an awesome, classy, 1940's-50's feel without being obnoxious that goes with their old-fashioned theme.  The service was a little less than I expected, but wasn't terrible or even below average.  Just not anything special.  (Try the Cranberry Location for better service)  Pricing can't be beat for what you get.    Bottomline, within a few bites of my sub, I had found my favorite place to go when I crave a cheap and yummy lunch or light dinner.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I ordered ahead on the way to a concert and the gentleman answering phones told me 10 minutes. I arrived 15 minutes later to my order not ready and ever better, not yet started. There was only one person talking orders / cooking and three others hanging by the register having a conversation. I waited to pay and 5 minutes into me waiting I interrupted to ask someone to ring me out.. Spoke to who seemed to be the manager cooking / taking openers about the wait and all she said was 'oh sorry'. I had to wait an additional 25 minutes for my food to be ready! That's 40 minutes!!  Genuinely disappointed with this location. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go back home, I try to stop by DiBella's. The Godfather is pretty much one of the best subs that I have ever had. I can see how some people may not like this place, but I'm one of the ones who love it. DiBella's has a unique flavor that sometimes you just crave, like sometimes you just need a McDonald's fix or Pizza Hut, etc, even though those places are garbage. DiBella's gives you that craving, plus it's damn good! Their decor inside isn't bad. Nicer than Subway or Firehouse. I usually get it to-go. They would get 5 stars if they were to open one up in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The Bread.  Everything else is the same. I feel like that's all that is needed for this review. But that's the main reason I like DiBella's so much. I go regularly with a co-worker for a cold veggie sub on multigrain and leave extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the price. $8.99 for a large sub + $2.50 for a fountain drink and a bag of chips. Alright, it better be a great sub.  Ordering was a bit of a hassle. I ordered the Godfather.  The order taker then offered me many choices of toppings at a speed that reminded me of an auctioneer or the micro machines guy. Simmer down there Suzy sub-maker and repeat it again!  The high counters makes seeing any food or toppings impossible. Why so secretive DiBella?  Anyways, after asking her to repeat herself I think we're in agreement on what's getting put on my sub and I proceed to the register.  And wait.  Then I get to wait some more.  Six different employees walked past me as I stood at the register with cash in hand.  It was very frustrating especially knowing they bring your sub to the table.  I could and should be sitting right now preparing for this awesome sub for which I am about to receive.  Oh!  Here's the money-taker man.  Now let's go sit.  When the sub did arrive at my table it was HUGE.  The bread was great, the oil was very good, and the sub was overall a terrific sandwich.  Better than Subway, Quiznos, and Jersey Mikes.  Equal to Penn Station.   Worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok, I finally got my act together. When you order fixings that compliment each other you come out with a great sandwich.   I am now a fan of the 'Everything' bread here. Tons of poppy seeds and sea salt.   I now get a cold small Turkey submarine sandwich, (which is still larger than a Subway 12\"), lettuce and tomato, mayo. Throw in some jalapeno chips for good measure and voila!"}
{"text":"Ordered The Godfather on \"Everything sesame\" bread. This was a very tasty sandwich where you could tell the quality of the Capicola (Gabagool), Salami and spicy ham. I recommend adding the sweet peppers spicy mustard and oil, skip the mayo"}
{"text":"This place is great, \"Dibellas\" not exactly this location but all of them. It's a must visit when local to these shops. Today I am giving 4 stars cause I watched my grilled/Toasted godfather sit for 10 minutes before they wrapped it and delivered. Was warm when I got it at my table but not hot as hoped.  Will be back and will see if you get the 5th star!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place.  I have been going there for years.  Service can be slow but the food was good so I put up with it.  I get to Mentor a few times a month on business and this has always been my hang out.  Lately, service has been declining along with the quality of food.  A few times, the bread was very dry (multi-grain ones at least) and food quality was inconsistent.  I get oil dressing and sometime it is soaking wet and sometime not enough, making the sandwich every drier.  The worst part of it is the service.  Slow speed is a given these days no matter what time it is.  I stopped by last week around 3 PM and I was the only one there.  The guy behind the counter acted like I was such a burden and slapping on the ingredients every time I asked for additional topping other than lettuce and tomato he offered.  Unbelievable customer service I got with an attitude for years of loyalty.  I am done going to DiBella's."}
{"text":"Love their meatball hoagies.  Be aware that these things are BIG.  A large will probably feed three adults.  Their bread is delicious and the right balance between crusty and soft.  I've only tried one of their sides, the potato salad, and it didn't knock my socks off.  However, every sandwich I've had has been consistently delicious!  The restaurant is counter service and then if you are eating in, they will bring your food to you.  Very pleasant employees and always very clean inside.  Love the feel of the old school tiled floors and big booths.  Will definitely be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"My niece from Columbus Ohio told me about this place for subs she wasn't lying they are delicious I could only eat half I'll save the other for later, yes I'll return."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Dibellas I have a flawless experience. No matter what time of day, how busy, who's working, I always get great service and great food. My go to sub is the God Father, hot, on white bread with lettuce tomatoes provolone cheese and oil.. and of course that chocolate chip cookie.  When you walk in you're facing a long dining area/ordering line, which can be a little concerning when it's jammed with people and the lines out the door, but their staff is prompt and efficient, and although sometimes they lack the personality to go with their great service, I'd rather have quick, quality food than a chatty, overly friendly employee- after all, that's not what's going to satisfy my hunger.  And besides, when you're working on getting people in and out and concentrating on orders with no end in sight, I'd say it's expected to feel a little less chatty, and I'm ok with that! Continue to deliver quick service and great food, and I'll continue coming back."}
{"text":"I called in and placed my order before I went there, so I thought I didn't have to wait. But I was wrong. As I walked in, I saw a few people on the line, and no one was helping them. Since I had placed my order already, I went straight to the pick up location. After waiting for 5-10 minutes, someone showed up and took care of my order. One other thing, I was on my working clothes, so because of the nature of my job, it doesn't look like your tidiest cloth. The person who took care of my order was looking at me like I was the nastiest person in the world. One advice to that person would be that \"you should never judge a person just by looking at their clothes\".  Overall, It was a horrible experience, not planning to go back there."}
{"text":"Walked in at noon for lunch, no line...great. Waited for about 5 minutes with none of the 5 people 'working' behind the counter acknowledging me or the two people I was with. Asked if they were open...no response. Waited for another 3 minutes...nothing. Went down the street to potbelly instead."}
{"text":"The best submarine sandwiches you'll ever eat.  DiBella's wows you from the beginning, especially if you are there during a busy time.  You are likely to be greeted by a line just out the front door, which is always a good sign.  Don't let it scare you off, though, as it moves quickly.  Once you're in the first door, you will see where they bake their bread which is one of the two secrets to their perfect sandwiches.  Through the second door, you're greeted by 1920s decor and artifacts.  When you order, there is a very friendly \"Soup Nazi\" thing going on.  The person taking your order rapidly goes through several lists of ingredients that are somewhat logically grouped together.  If you are a newcomer, they slow down and do so with a smile.  But their \"all business\" attitude is what keeps the line moving.  The important part... the food!  I've only ever ordered the Hot Godfather (I should say the Godfather sub, prepared hot) and it is the best submarine sandwich I've ever had, and by no small margin.  I have also given Jimmy John's 5 stars because they have perfected their craft - lightning fast, high-quality cold subs.  But DiBella's is doing something different (something more difficult to get right) and they've also perfected it.  The bread is an A+.  Beautiful shiny crust surrounds flavorful, perfectly tender but dense soft-stuff.  I usually get the \"everything\" bread, but sometimes get the seeded Italian.  It's all perfect.  The meats and cheeses are an A+, as well.  Flavorful but not overly fatty capicola is hard to find.  They have it here.  And they give you a LOT of it.    The sandwiches are then cooked the perfectly correct amount, and dressed to your specifications.  No matter how high of expectations you come in with, the first bite of a Hot Godfather will exceed your expectations.  For sides, DiBella's has excellent chocolate chip cookies (with and without walnuts) and the best chips on earth, Miss Vickie's.  It doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"I keep seeing this sub shop chain and my verdict........ it's over hyped and over rated... Got the cheesesteak sub and the meat to bread ratio.... you may just eat a whole loaf of Italian bread. Oh yea I had a true philly cheese from philly but even Baltimore makes a better cheesesteak. Over price and I've over paid."}
{"text":"Ok this is my second time back here and I can easily say that this place has one of the best Subs. I recommend the spicy chicken if u like your sub juicy with a little bit of heat."}
{"text":"The sub was very good and the ingredients used you could tell were fresh. The biggest plus for me was the customer service they provided here...top notch!!"}
{"text":"I have never head of DiBella's until I ended up in Strongsville on business and needed some place to grab a bite for lunch. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I left a fan. The sub was fantastic. The bread was fresh and prepared perfectly. Fast, good, and cheap, what is not to like. Service was pretty friendly as well. I would definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"-Award Winning Bread-  I like DiBella's Subs. This is the top of the line when it comes to submarine sandwich chains. It's not without flaws, but the food vastly overshadows any complaint I have about it.  I will say that I think DiBella's Subs has the best bread out of any other sub sandwich chain. It's fluffy, it's fresh, it's big, it's just great. I always get the \"Everything\" bread option, which consists of poppy seeds, sasame seeds, and other herbs and spices. It's fantastic and I highly recommend it.  I've only every gotten a few of their signature sandwiches, which are good, but I prefer to use the \"Build Your Own\" option. I get a large, hot sandwich on \"Everything\" bread, filled with roast beef, corned beef, capicola, provolone cheese, oil, and mayo. It sounds a bit gross, but if you're a meat lover, I assure you that it's fantastic.  The staff at this location is always accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable. I don't think I've ever had bad or grumpy service in the many times that I've been here; the last time I went was no exception.  My only issue is ordering. You stand in line and wait to be called, but I never know whether or not I should go up alone, or go up with whoever I'm with. I typically ask politely to ensure that I'm not going about ordering in the wrong manner. I think that if they're not busy, they prefer to call you up one at a time so that multiple people can get your order taken and made faster.  If you're ever around a DiBella's Subs, I suggest you go there over Subway, Jersey Mike's Subs, or Jimmy John's. I find it to be better quality without spending a ton of money."}
{"text":"Pretty. Good. Cheesteak Sub.  I. Ate. The. Whole. Thing."}
{"text":"I love this place I go their all the time not anymore their workers need to do a little less talking and a lot more working every time I go here they make my sub wrong like you write the shit down don't you know  how to read"}
{"text":"DiBella's, Jimmy John's, Penn Station, Quizno's, then Subway. For chains specializing in the sub sandwich, I rank in that very order. DiBella's though, clearly stands above the rest.   The inside of DiBella's is much nicer than all the other sub shops. Coffered tin ceilings, Norman Rockwell-esque art and vintage soda shop detailing makes it seem like you're stepping into a time warp and into a much simpler time.   Besides decor, I think what sets them apart from the others is their bread. A fresh loaf, baked on site that's hearty enough to support toppings, firm enough to not end up floppy and soggy like Subway's bread, yet not too crusty where it would chip a tooth like the competitors toasted variety.   The method in which customers are attended to is different from other sandwich shops. Instead of getting into a single file line and each customer being waited on one at a time, there are multiple sub makers with individual stations. When I visited this location, I counted 4 or 5 customers being tended to at once. Choose your sub persuasion, choose whether hot or cold, the sauce and your personal sandwich artist will hook you up.   Can't wait to tell others about this place! Finally a decent locale for lunch that's not too far away from where I work. Inexpensive, great service, clean, fast and damn good."}
{"text":"A step or two above subway. Bread could be better, but good portions and fast delivery of food during lunch. I go often to dibella's"}
{"text":"First time at dibella's and I am a huge fan!! Customer service was good, the wait wasn't long and the sub was fantastic.    Definitely will be back.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Food and service was great as most locations are. Godfather on sesame is my favorite choice for a good old fashioned Italian sub. The bread sets it far apart from any other sub shop."}
{"text":"Had the Godfather and it was amazing!  The peppers really fired it up, the everything bread was flavorful, and the meats are high quality.  Justin (my sandwich maker) is like Yoda and Picasso mutated into a young man...crafting one of the best damn sandwiches I have ever had.  The potato salad was not so good, but I shouldn't have even ordered with the generous portion in that of a medium sub."}
{"text":"Good bread, but the quality of the meat is simply awful - tastes like something Giant Eagle would reject.  Some of the staff are clearly indifferent and seem annoyed to have to do their job."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and all I can think is, wow I was missing out. DiBella's subs are so good and the atmosphere makes it even better! They have the option to create your own sub and you can choose unlimited toppings to go on it. All their toppings are very high quality as well as the meat they use. I got the chicken and it was delicious and was made to order, not cold cut. I got a warm sandwich in the small size, and was only able to eat half of it!! For 9 dollars, you can get a huge (size small) sub with chips and a drink to go along with it. Such a good deal and they are very friendly and quick to make your order! I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Our work got a couple of takeaway lunch boxes from here and frankly I'm in two minds about the veggie sandwich I ate here. For my taste, the filling was too raw - there wasn't enough cheese  or tomato to balance together all the other ingredients.  The boxes also seemed to skew heavily towards BBQ crisps instead of just more normal flavors and our table left the majority of their crisp packets untouched.  Overall it was a very dissatisfying lunch experience and I'm not sure if would recommend that work order from this location again.  Yelp Review 56/2017"}
{"text":"Greatest Sub in Pitts so far.  It's a lot better than it's neighboring sandwich shop (sorry neighbor). The restaurant is super clean and has a old school feel to it. I had the Godfather with everything on it. Fresh meat, fresh veges, and just an awesome sub. It's definitely a great bang for your buck.   I'm headed back soon."}
{"text":"Date night something quick before a movie. Tables have been dirty every time we've come. Got a medium turkey to share. Could have gotten a small and it would have been enough. Good for a quick cheap dinner. Meats seem to be a good quality not processed."}
{"text":"On a 10/24/2011 visit I ordered a cheese steak sub and was asked if I wanted lettuce, tomato, olives, mayo or dressing on it.  Who puts any of that on a cheese steak sub?  When I got the sub I figured out why I was offered so much filler... Without the sub was only 1/2 full.  What I was handed was sorely lacking in meat & cheese.  Needless to say, I won't be visiting this or any other DiBella's again any time soon."}
{"text":"After leaving a nearby establishment due to horrible music, my husband, two teen sons and I walked into DiBella's. The wonderful aroma that created us was a warmup for our tastebuds. Our subs were ready quickly and once we settled with our drinks at a table, we enjoyed every bite. The boys inhaled their meatball subs and my husband devoured his buffalo chicken sub. The mediums filled them up. My small chicken philly melted in my mouth. The atmosphere was wonderful and we enjoyed our meal. Thanks for a great start to our evening in Pittsburgh. Now- Let's Go Bucs!"}
{"text":"I love DiBella's.  Absolutely fricken love this place. I wish soooo bad that there was one closer to me so if I had a complaint that would be it.   The subs here are unlike any other place you will get them. Blows subway, penn station...you know what. You can't even say those names in the same breath bc DiBella's is that much better.   I have got the got the Dagwood and the godfather before and they are both just ridiculously good. I have heard good things about their cheesesteak as well and I imagine that will be my next one I try.   Just move close to Cuyahoga Falls please!"}
{"text":"I just walked out because know one would take my order. This place need customer service training"}
{"text":"Peeps who read my stuff know how I feel about subs, grinders, hoagies, whatever.  They lame.  I would rather eat the stuff in the sandwich and pitch the bread.  Some people love bread like like a hoodrat loves his baby mama at tax return time.  I can care less.  They bread here is too much.  I guess they giving you more value for your money but give me more bacon or something, dude.  They kids here always nice and fast and they take coupons.  No complaints about that.  Also, its in Mentor, which is a pasteurized strip-mall from one end of the city to the next but some people find comfort in that..."}
{"text":"Amazing bread with veggies of your choice for vegetarian like me price is lower than subway on some.  Great ingredients I have  visited their other locations as I am from New York where they started"}
{"text":"I always stop by Dibellas if I see one during feeding time ! Place has seating area but was empty in the evening. Talking with my sandwich maker they were really busy. My veggie selection sandwich was really good-to go but decided to stay and enjoyed it"}
{"text":"We are from the home of DiBella's so we LOVE their subs. This location is pretty slow and not the cleanest. The tables were dirty and when it's slow they could be clean.  THe food quality is delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get lunch!  The subs are tasty and the pasta salad is amazing!  I love their special oil.  The employees are very efficient, fun and friendly.  The line always goes by really fast."}
{"text":"I liked the cheesesteak sub quite a bit.  The wait seemed longer than I expected, but it was worth it.  The sides and pickle were good too.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck type place. The \"godfather \" sub with spicy toppings on a wheat roll is delicious."}
{"text":"I just starting coming here recently and I really like it. I don't even think about Subway anymore when I want a sandwich for lunch. Lines(at least at this location) have never been an issue so it's VERY fast. Their bread is awesome. First time I had a hot dagwood(turkey, ham, corned beef) on everything bread. I can't say the everything bread contributed any to the sandwich though. I got a medium and finished the whole thing with no problem. Second time around I think I found my sandwich. I got a LARGE turkey, ham and roast beef(essentially a \"club\" but that must be too quick to say) on the sesame bread. Ordered cold with swiss cheese and their oil & vinegar dressing, the sandwich was freaking delicious. The meat combo was just right for me and the swiss cheese was nice and thickly sliced. I saw the oil dressing and the herbs it had in it but I can't say I really tasted it. The nice thing was that it didn't seem to make the bread soggy(like at Subway) which was great because I only needed half of the large sandwich to fill me up. So while a large sandwich is a but pricey at ~$8.50 it provided a filling and delicious lunch AND dinner so I can't complain.  I will also address the ubiquitous Cleveland sandiwch comparison with Dave's Cosmic Subs. I like Dave's a lot too. Their bread is a different style but equally good. Dave's bread is lighter but it has a very thin crispy crust which I appreciate. DiBella's bread is denser and has a glossy chewy exterior like that of a pretzel. I'm also in love with Dave's Cosmic Sauce! The problem here is that your money goes a lot farther at DiBella's than at Dave's. For almost $7 you get a sandwich at Dave's that is probably 7-9\" and is fairly light. Both times I've been there I have still been hungry after enjoying my sub. At DiBella's you can get a medium sub for around $7 that is at least 12'. has denser bread and more meat. Cough up and extra $2 for a large and you've got a meal for 2. So as far as getting the most bang for your buck, DiBella's wins."}
{"text":"So I went in here cuz almost everything I wanted was closed on a Sunday. Saw this place and figured why not. After going in I noticed the old school look. It felt comfy, so I look over the menu and see the cowboy a BBQ bacon chicken sub. I noticed all the food is cooked on the grill after ordering. After a short wait I bit in and taste what have to be one of the best subs I have had in my life. The price was good also and a med sub was more then enough. Would make this a reg spot I have to visit when I come to pitt along side the likes of primanti bro."}
{"text":"I love the food, but the service always seems annoyed. Second time I've been in and had this type of service. They close at 10pm, and I was there at 9:25. The cashier asked if my sandwich was cold or toasted, the mgr/person giving direction barked, \"cold!\" I wasn't given the option to toast my sandwich, and when I mentioned that, the cashier said that it was too late to fix. He asked if that was okay, but he already told me it was too late. I was really put off by the lack of concern by the mgr/person giving direction and the cashier. I just gave up, because no one else seemed to think that was an important part of service. I won't be back. As I walked out, I asked the cashier if he thought that was important, he said, \"Well, I don't know, because I don't eat here.\" I said, \"Really?! Well, it should be, because you WORK here.\" Unbelievable. ***Update*** Management reached out to me to apologize for this experience. I appreciate that gesture to rectify and correct the customer service issue. I will be back! The food is so good! Thank you!"}
{"text":"HUGE sandwiches! This place is pretty busy on a weekday for lunch. It sits in between Melt and Panera as a middle-of-the-road option when you're not looking to pig out (ahem, Melt) and Panera seems too boring. The meat seemed fresh and the sandwiches were perfectly fine, but I didn't think it was anything amazing. I did try both their white chocolate macadamia nut cookie as well as the chocolate chip cookie, and was pretty impressed with both."}
{"text":"I loved DiBella's! We had the godfather there and it was insane, we topped it with everything we could think of and then some. I liked all their options but if you're a vegetarian they don't offer a huge selection. It is however, worth taking a stop by and checking this place out.  I usually don't go to delis so this place really blew me away!! The location isn't the greatest, I love their subs but I wouldn't trek all the way downtown for them."}
{"text":"Great bread and fresh meats.  You'll never go to subway again.   The roast beef is awesome.  And they have a spicy horseradish to go with it.  The bread is definitely the draw though.  Sesame, muktigrain and everything."}
{"text":"the signature sesame buns dominate flavors from meat"}
{"text":"Not a clue. Busy Saturday and had 1 guy on grill. Watched them screw up 5 orders in a row."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Thursday and this place is busy! Holy cow! Lots of tables to sit at if you would like to eat in, but I was weary from class and for it to go. I ordered the godfather grilled with peppers and onions on the everything bread. I'm a huge fan of everything bagels and this bread was fantastic. I was a huge fan and would definitely order it again!  The meat was generous, service was friendly, sub was delicious! I will say I think they forgot my peppers and onions but it's on cause it was just that good.  Not to mention that they carry those delicious jalapeño chips that are just the best thing to have ever happened to chips! I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sub place in Pittsburgh. Their bread is amazing. My go to is always the old fashioned grilled on plain bread. It comes with turkey, ham, and salami. If you haven't tried dibellas yet you need to get there ASAP!"}
{"text":"Good Chicken Philly sub with cheese, peppers and onions.  11 inches for about $7.  Bread wasn't that great; definitely didn't look like the \"everything\" one I chose on the counter.  It was burnt but not crispy.   If they improved the \"fat\" bread I would give it 4 starts.  Beats subway.  $2.50 extra for drink and chips or drink and cookie."}
{"text":"Aesthetically, DiBella's harkens back to a bygone era. One that is, as you might expect, totally idealized. The walls are all adorned with drawings of smiling sandwich artists of yesteryear. Clad in clean white smocks and caps, and passing their handiwork rolled in white butcher's paper to chaste coeds in tartan and knee socks, these men look like they wandered out of a Norman Rockwell painting, or a sleepy town in a Stephen King novel before the ghouls come slithering out of the sewer grates. Nostalgia like this is a tricky thing for a restaurant to pull off. Oftentimes, it makes our teeth ache, or our eyes involuntarily fling back in our sockets like gems in a polisher gone haywire. DiBella's manages to strike a balance, however. Their romanticized photos (here's a Ward Cleaver facsimile slipping in with a bag of subs as Mom, Junior, Little Sis, and Scraps arrive to welcome him!), their tile flooring, their kind and cheerful staff all match up pretty well. Sure, the gigantic subs for sale might feed the Cleavers for a week, but it's important to keep up with modern go-for-bloat appetites, one supposes. And gee, are these suckers ever tasty. And easy on the pocketbook, to boot! Laden with half a garden of veggies on a seeded sub roll, a build your own sans meat is a mere $6.75. Vegetarians would do well to get a Classic, as grilling all the soft stuff like tomatoes and cukes leaves the finished product a tad on the squishy side. Go to DiBella's soon as you can for luncheon or Sunday supper. Shut off your Cheever brain at the door, and prepare for a nostalgic overload twinned with a familiar sense of 21st century gustatory indulgence."}
{"text":"good sandwiches period plenty of meat not like jimmy johns or subway if you want a good sandwich with a little bang for your buck try this place"}
{"text":"Great subs.  Steel City Trio warm, YUM :)"}
{"text":"Chains can only star so high in my life, because they can only be so good (or bad!). This location gets good enough marks. Dibella's is like Subway with better bread. Their small is actually twice the size of what I thought it would be. But they are not going to replace other sandwich shops for me. They really go light on the fillings unfortunately. I actually had to take half the bread away because it was just a horrible ratio of tuna to bread."}
{"text":"It took me quite some time to even try this place as there was a line out the door every single time I went. I'm not a fan of waiting so I always put it off. I have been here a handful of times since and always had a pleasant experience.  I think it's really great that Market Square is putting in so many food establishments, giving us downtown workers more options. Plus the subs are decent so it's not forcing you to eat something you don't like, ala Subway.  Things I don't like about it.  1.There is always congestion when you walk in because as soon as you walk in you order to the right. People just seem to be milling about for no reason. 2. It becomes a large cattle call as the employees are yelling for your business. It's kind of like those people at the mall with the stuff that makes your nails really shiny. 3. You're given numbers once you order so the entire time you're eating you hear the workers yelling out numbers like they're in a football huddle. 4.I like a warm sub but I don't think any of them are cold. I had a chicken cesar today and it was warm. That may be your thing, but it's not mine.  However 1. Their bread is amazing. Far surpassing any sandwich shop downtown. 2. The sizes are very generous. 3. Serves is pretty fast 4. They had great pasta/macaroni and potato salad.  There are plenty of sub options to choose so I can't wait to see what I get my hand onto next. Just make sure you pay attention or they'll be walking around the room with your sandwich and you won't even know it. And who wants to eat a meatball sub that's been sitting out?"}
{"text":"Very good sub place.  Their Sesame seed bread was absolutely amazing.  Very fresh and just the right consistency.  Great offering of meats for sandwiches and good service."}
{"text":"So, after further consideration I've downgraded my rating.  Great subs....still.  But, it seems as if they try to make paying as difficult as possible.  I've gone there several times in the past two weeks and it has taken between 5 and 8 minutes just to pay....this is after you wait 5, 10 or more minutes before you get your sub.  Not sure what the problem is. All I know is that, I have a limited time for lunch and don't want to spend much time standing in line.  My fellow diners agreed.  Needless to say, I can go across the street (potbelly subs), down the street (gourmonds), or up the street (heavenly ham) for a sub, without the wait."}
{"text":"How do they stay in business? Food is awful and overpriced. I never see anybody in the parking lot now I understand why."}
{"text":"Echoing what another reviewer has said about DiBella's, the subs are good, the staff is friendly, but the ordering system is a little disorganized. I went on a slow Sunday afternoon and although there were several people working the counter, I couldn't help but feel a little put-off by the number system used for ordering. Instead of an orderly queue where an order is placed, you pay, etc., people wait in front of the counter where staff are making subs, and seemingly just shout out their orders to them before taking a number and going to wait.  I ordered the cowboy which was pretty delicious. The bread and ingredients were fresh and my sub was made to order.  The atmosphere is interesting: with big band music spilling through the restaurant sound system and a long row of booths and tables set in a cavernous tiled room resembling a New York City subway station.  Cleanliness left something to be desired as it was hard to locate a table that wasn't dirty or covered with crumbs.  Overall, you come here for the subs and not the atmosphere obviously, and DiBella's makes a good sub."}
{"text":"Hope they bring a shop to the west side. This and jersey mikes are the best sub shop chains going."}
{"text":"While I won't subscribe to the \"best sub\" line that others are tossing around, DiBella's makes a pretty decent sandwich. Vastly superior to most of the chains, that's for sure.  I got the hot corned beef - made the mistake of getting a large which was ENTIRELY too large - on everything bread. Being a huge fan of everything bagels this was a great choice. The meat was of good quality and everything tasted fresh and delicious. I wasn't really crazy with the decor of the place so I ended up taking it home to eat.  That said, I'll go back."}
{"text":"I took my family to grab a quick bite to eat while traveling and was disappointed.  We got there around 6 p.m. on a Saturday and they did not seem to be prepared for dinner. There was about 6 people in line in front if us and we waited for 30 minutes before we ordered. When we ordered, we found that they had run out of plain bread. The process of ordering and making our sandwiches took another 15 minutes so what we had hoped to be a quick meal turned into an hour affair after eating.  It's too bad, the sandwiches were really good once we got our food but not worth the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Food is good but waiting for takeout is painful. They need to speed the process up a touch"}
{"text":"If you are tired like subways, I can guarantee this is the spot to go to. The subs are huge and delicious. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. I love going here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great service?, great food. When we got there the line was long but by the time we left it was our the door! The service was very friendly and helpful, both the godfather (slightly spicy Italian) and the steak were recommended (and both amazing) with the addition of a huge kids meal (3\" sub, applesauce, cookie and apple juice) and some of those chocolate chip cookies. The bread was fresh, soft and flavorful (sesame all around), the portions we're generous and the small was more than adequate (6\", I believe). Two adults and 2 very littles were more than pleased. Highly recommend stopping by and nomming on one while you enjoy market square."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim for a sub with my daughter.  I ordered the cheesesteak  and meatball sub. Both subs were hot which is an A plus in my book. The bread was soft and fresh.  The meatballs tasted great. I'm always worried about ordering meatball subs and having the meatballs taste like they were out of the freezer.  It did not disappoint.   I enjoyed my cheesesteak and would order it again.   I didn't give this place five stars because like other yelpers mentioned it is a little confusing when you walk in, and the pasta salad is smothered in Italian dressing.  I would also like to see kid options. A simple grilled cheese will do.   These subs are way better than Subway!"}
{"text":"While on vacation and spending my last day in Pittsburgh I was in the mood for a sandwich and one that I could not find in Cincinnati. While walking around market square someone recommended DiBella's so I stopped in. It like your typical sandwich shop, go to the counter order your sandwich, watch them make it, tell them what you want on it, then pay. The sandwich was much tastier than a typical sandwich shop though. They highlight for me was the freshly baked bread. I had an Italian sandwich and enjoyed the meats that were used. Even though it was a chain, it didn't feel too chain like and it was higher quality than a typical chain shop. I hope someday DiBella's makes it way to my hometown of Cincinnati."}
{"text":"Dibellas does not shy away from a generous portion of steak. Once again the thing that puts this sub over the top is the bread. All there bread is homemade and the everything bread is by far the best. Dibellas cheesesteak is as close to chessesteak perfection as you can get. Also dont forget that you can customize your sandwich to your liking. Want swiss instead of american cheese, go ahead. Want bannana peppers or grilled sweet peppers on your sandwich, go ahead. I ordered mine with American cheese, grilled onions and there amazing honey mustard.   Great fresh food. Great atmosphere. Great music! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious subs and very friendly staff!  I am in here once a week at least and would suggest the meatball, godfather, or Philly subs.  This place is clean, efficient, and staff is always smiling and pleasant.  Please keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the food as I have only eaten the food take out.  I have never dined in.  Now that that is out of the way:  This is one delicious sub!  I am a traditionalist when it comes to my subs and I like that these subs are pretty basic.  Nicely cut tasty deli meat, delicious cheese, and fresh bread.  There are a variety of toppings that you can include and you will end up with one delightful sub!  I also have to mention the pasta salad.  I normally don't get too excited about pasta salad but Dibella's is something special.  The Italian dressing that they use in it is just perfect and the olive and pasta combiniation is really great.  Dibella's has been very consistent each time I've gotten the pleasure of tasting it and I would definitely recommend their food!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the girl who took the order or whoever made the sub but they didn't put anything on the TWO subs that I asked them to. Just meat and cheese"}
{"text":"Good subs if you don't mind paying more than the usual fast food place and yes DiBella's is a fast food place made over to look like a restaurant. You stand in line and place your order like at Subway, then pick your table. Subs come in three sizes, and the medium is as big as a large at other sub shops.The staff was not particularly friendly, but I was satisfied with the grub. I was by far the thinnest person in the place, and I weigh 190 pounds. DiBella's is for beefy white dudes, definitely. Its probably the only place in Strongsville where its polite to belch at your table."}
{"text":"Bread is good when it's FRESH! They try hard to have a local neighborhood non-chain feel but failed. Maybe it's my bias and believing chain hoagie joints are a disgrace. If you enjoy hoagies from a local deli then this is not the place for you. Sandwiches are all bread with no meat or veggies. Very disappointing when I paid 12 bucks for a sandwich that could've been better constructed by a 6 year old."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sub place.  Once you take a hearty Godfather sub to the mouth you're done!!  get ready to lay on the floor in joy."}
{"text":"With all the competition around you would think things would be different. However, the person taking the order was less than cordial. More this is the way it is. Delivery yes but not nice about it. They were very early which normally is good but let whomever sign the receipt.  But did not leave a receipt copy. Not good at all. Then calling to retrieve the receipt was met with annoyance. Not good again.  They offer sandwiches. Ordinary run of the mill sandwiches. There are tons of places that offer sandwiches.  Be nice to the people who are paying for your food."}
{"text":"Dibella's come on! I expect more from you! They have a confusing number system to pick up your subs, it was super busy and someone else walked away with MY sandwich. They told me they would remake it so I was happy and didn't mind. Then I get home and realize it was completely wrong: no condiments, no cheese, plain bread. Dibella's you let me down!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Ordered the godfather. I give the sandwich a thumbs up. If you get a large sub, it is huge!"}
{"text":"At my job, I am responsible at times for ordering food for various events.  For the last event I coordinated I called multiple sub places for a catering order to include Dave's Cosmic subs and Jimmy Johns but they either didn't deliver to my area or in the case of Jimmy Johns just seemed completely ignorant that I didn't feel comfortable placing my order there.  I also like Brennan's Catering in Cleveland but find them to be a tad pricey.  So I called Dibella's as I had in the past and they are awesome.  They quickly helped me estimate how much food I needed and made the whole order process quick and easy. I even called them the day of to add to my order and it was no problem. They are very professional and knowledgeable and by now are familiar with my company.  The food arrived 15 minutes early and the delivery person helped us set up.  He was really friendly.  We ordered a variety of subs and the meats and bread were so fresh and delicious!  We also got chips, cookies and bottles of soda with our order along with condiments, utensils and paper goods at a rather affordable price.  I was (as I always am) very pleased with Dibela's - no complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"One of the best subs I've ever had! Not the first time I've been here, and it's always great. Friendly people, fresh ingredients, and just a great experience start to finish! I know a couple reviewers complained about price, but the bread is fresh, the quality is exceptional, and the portions are huge, so as far as I'm concerned, it's an exceptional value."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and awesome decor and ambiance. Makes you feel like you are in the 50's.   That being said, during lunch it can turn into mayhem as the line is out the door and nobody knows exactly what to do. Fortunately, the folks that raise their hands and yell at you keep the line moving.   It takes a while for them to make your sandwiches so I recommend that you take a seat and enjoy yourself, it can take a while."}
{"text":"I heard Dibella's sandwiches rivaled only Wegman's, and it is indeed true. Their bread is great, philly cheesesteak was delicious. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! I've never eaten here before but I'm a huge fan of their bagel style hoagie rolls! They were so good and make these subs a lot more filling for me. Be careful when ordering sizes and ask their staff because everything is a lot bigger than you would expect. This was very reasonably priced and the staff makes your hoagies pretty quick. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I am always a fan of Dibellas. Having worked at one previously, I know what is expected of employees. I walked in with my husband to grab some food to go, only to find 3 workers behind the counter, none of them moving very fast & no one greeting anyone. The only person looking to be making sandwiches was a blond woman with her hair down- this immediately grossed me out as hair should always be tied back when doing anything with food prep. The 5 people on front of us looked annoyed & as if they had been there waiting for a while too. We left & both agreed to never visit this location again. Giving a bad name to a good game..."}
{"text":"meh. uncle sams and jimmy johns are better. diBella's bread is delicious...soft and chewy...but jimmy johns tastes better. uncle sams cheesesteak is much more flavorful. the first time i ate at dibella's, i was very disappointed in their cheesesteak. it was bland. and i even got mayonaise on it. the second time i tried a cold cut sandwich. the roast beef wasn't as good as at jimmy johns, but the bread was really thick and tasty. i probably won't go back when jimmy johns is better and faster."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with DiBella's, but you can do better.  Not going to go into detail with this review.  The place is what you'd expect from a chain sub shop that is definitely better than Subway.  You'll be filled up with greasy cold cuts for around 10 bucks, the staff will give you the impression that they'd rather be anywhere else, and you'll be in and out in a jiff.  The subs are good, but there are better downtown."}
{"text":"Decent subs. New store.  Clean and bright.  Easy access.  Friendly staff.  Ample portions."}
{"text":"These are seriously delicious subs.  They serve them up with high quality meats and cheeses- and they don't skimp on the toppings.  The small size is a really big sub.  Even If you're a mayonnaise fan - I suggesting trying the 'Famous Oil Dressing' instead.  I recommend getting it HOT with spicy and sweet peppers.  When I walked in I noticed that everyone eating there had the 'Everything' bun...  I ordered it since I thought it was the thing to get.  My only complaint was that the little onions on top got charred from the toasting.  Maybe stick to regular buns for the hot subs."}
{"text":"Many options to choose from. Subs were worth the price. Couldn't finish eating it all but I got lunch for tomorrow"}
{"text":"Gross. Got a chicken philly which was very bland, the menu said try t with grilled onions and peppers but apparently that also meant mushrooms... surprise!! Eat here if you like a bread sandwich as that's what dominates every bite."}
{"text":"Kay wanted to treat me the other night, pledging to meet me in Market Square for a cheap dinner to commemorate her new, new job (long story, but it's worked out so far). I'd been wanting to try this somewhat upmarket version of Subway for some time now just to see if the hype was deserved.   Yeeeahhhh...I dunno. I was a bit let down by 5 Guys too due to its greasy, sloppy overkill. Yet, with DiBella's, I found most of everything to be merely edible and not much more.  The potato salad, however, was a Grandma's-level mockery that tasted as processed as a pop song. The potatoes were akin to tofu with the texture of gnocchi. I did love the bejeezus out of that sour and fat dill pickle, though, but sadly and strangely, it was the highlight of our delicatessen supper.   That's not to say that my custom-made, oven-baked (my choice, you can also have it cold) sandwich was an abomination. Comprised of ham, corned beef, roast beef, onion, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, oil, American cheese, mozzarella, and provolone, I opted for the Portuguese-ish, pretzelesque \"Everything\" roll to contain it.  The meat itself lacked in...something. Freshness perhaps? It simply didn't have the flavors I've come to expect from deli meats. I didn't find them at all \"greasy\" as another reviewer put it, but rather they were bland to me, and overall, there really wasn't much about the sandwich to set it apart from Subway aside from meats that were a little more supple.  Also unremarkable were two dozen mini chocolate chip cookies that came off as the mass-produced, vacuum-packed, and readily available sort one would find in a supermarket aisle along with Oreo's and Chips Ahoy.   On a positive track, I did appreciate the enthusiasm of the employees along with the almost fun, surprisingly effective, \"20-questions\" styled ordering system and the clean, period-piece decor.   Although, why they wrap the hell out of dine-in sandwiches is beyond my understanding. For takeout, yes. Eat-in, ehhh, why waste the paper?   DiBella's was founded humbly in 1918, and I get the sense that a lot was lost in its metamorphosis from mom-n-pop shoppe to national franchise. If I could, I'd time-travel backwards to try the original and would wager that the sandwiches were far more magical.   Primanti Brothers has recently made this type of demonic pact as well, and I hope that it doesn't cause them to become as homogenized as DiBella's.   P.S. Our tab for 2 medium sandwiches, 2 potato salads, 2 pickles, 2 fountain beverages, and the cookies was over $30! Affordable this wasn't."}
{"text":"Place was packed.  Hard to get a seat.  If it is you first time, it may take a little time to pick the sub you want to devour.  The Godfather is good, and you can customize your sub with toppings.  Good chocolate chip cookies, too."}
{"text":"Their subs are good. I got a basic cold cut sub on everything bread and that is what made it 5 stars for me. The bread was divine and added so much more flavor. It's not cheap though."}
{"text":"Everything bread for a sub! Yes you read that right, it's awesome. I absolutely love DiBella's everything bread for just about any sub sandwich as it gives it a lot more flavor."}
{"text":"First time trying Dibellas, man it was sooooo good. The bread was fresh, veggies were good and the meat was of good quality. The bread was definitely my favorite part. Big portions too.   I got the chicken philly, service was nice and super quick. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"DiBella's is the best sub I have ever had in my life.  I'm from New Jorsey and I agree that it is hard to get both a good slice, and a good sub in this State.  Why is that?????  DiBella's needs to open a place here!   This was my forth time in Pittsburgh I do three things:  1-get a garbage plate. 2-go to see theSteelers. 3-get a DiBella's sub!!!  The secret is the bread.  Baked fresh at DiBella's all throughout the day.  This aint no subway roll, bleaacchhh.  I don't know if they put an eggwash on the bread but it's got a shiny brown coating on it that is really good.  The next secret to a DiBella's sub is the condiments: all kinds of mustard and their oil is tops.  I prefer honey mustard and a thin coating of mayonnaise.  Secret # 3: peppers!!  They have sweet, hot, and banana. you gotta get the bananas!  They are those awesome sliced, neon yellow peppers that add just the right amount of kick to any sub.  DiBella's does not skimp on the fillings...many layers of top-quality meat and cheese make these subs the best around.  Average prices for incredible sandwiches, corny 1950's decor with black and white tiled floor and wooden booths, but nobody comes here for the decor, they are comin' here for SUBS!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to DiBella's with wife, mom, and son yesterday for a quick Valentine's Day lunch.  I ordered a medium Philly Cheesesteak, my son got a turkey and cheese, my mom ordered a Godfather, and my wife ordered a Buffalo chicken sandwich.  We paid, grabbed our chips and drinks, and then sat down with our numbers so the waitresses could see them.  They build your sammich and then hunt around the restaurant looking for your number.  When they see your number they give you the sammich and you can begin your indulgence.  DiBella's subs are larger than most sub shops because they give you almost twice the bread as other sub shops.  I'm really not a fan of all the bread, but it is fresh baked and very tasty.  I ordered my cheesesteak on 'everthing' bread, which had a great taste.  The quality of the steak used on the sandwich was very good.  I tasted the meat by itself and it had a good texture and a great taste.  The rest of the sandwich was delicious.  I loved it.  It was almost too big to eat at one sitting.  The large sandwiches - don't even go there and less you want to share one amongst two or three people.    I tasted my wife's Buffalo chicken and it was also delicious.  My mom gave me a bite of her Godfather and that was really tasty too.  My son's small turkey sub was too much for him to polish off, but he made every attempt.    Excellent subs!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best sub of my life, no lie. The Godfather and the BLT are ridiculously good. The atmosphere is great, staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean. Service is quick and there are a ton of great options. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"You get your money's worth. The meat on the sub is also really fresh and so are all the other ingredients. If you need something to eat and don't mind spending a bit extra for superior quality, then you should go here. The place has ample seating and the people that work there are pretty nice."}
{"text":"You can't compare this place to Dave's.  You just can't.  I had heard that DiBella's might be better than Dave's Cosmic Subs, so I immediately went over there to check it out, only to find out that they're completely different and that a comparison would do neither seller of submarines justice.  While I can't exactly articulate what makes them different, I will say that Dave's seems a little more natural and might have better ingredients, while DiBella's sandwiches are a tad greasier and make you feel slightly crappier after eating one.  That said, this is still an excellent sandwich.  I had the hot Godfather sandwich (an assortment of Italian meats) on sesame bread.  Do not, I repeat, do not, try the large sandwich here.  I was obscenely full after a medium and I'm 6'4 and 190 lbs of pure man.  The large looked like it would have given Kobayashi trouble.  Real talk."}
{"text":"I prefer local restaurants, but as fast food chains go, this is not bad. Same idea as Subway (custom subs to order, no table service) but more food for the money. A \"medium\" is about the same size (a little shorter but wider) as a foot-long from Subway, has better quality bread, and costs less. Similar vegetable options, more cheese options, and a large dining room with real booths/better atmosphere to sit in (I'd never \"eat in\" at a Subway if I could help it). They're about as fast as Subway for cold subs (I can't judge the hot ones). The ingredients are not on view: they ask you verbally whether you want each one. This system seems to work OK, except you can't visually verify that they've got it right until you eat it. They don't have full table service but they do bring your sub out to you (by number tag) if it needs to be cooked.  For vegetarians, always go for the Cold option. Hot means they grill the vegetables on the nasty Communal Slab of Melted Animals. (I'd also ask them not to slice the sandwich at the end, for the same reason: Communal Knife of Animal Tissue.) The veggie sub does have cheese (if you want it) but there's also a cheese sub--which I'll avoid in future: it has about eighty pounds of cheese on it! I find it hard to give up cheese 100% and go vegan, but that much cheese overload might just have pushed me over the edge!  Minus one star because they use too little sauce (kind of flavorless as a result), and because they don't have a veg patty like Subway (and if they did, it would go on the communal grill), and because there have been ingredient mix-ups; but they were nice about it and offered a free sub coupon.  Minus another star because my last veggie sub had a big chunk of tangy pink Mystery Gristle! Hwthleaughhh! Ingredient mix-ups can happen any place, so the real reason I hold it against the place: you can't see the food prep area behind the big counter. That means they have less incentive to keep things tidy, and you don't get to see what 's going in your sandwich. (Compare Subway: all behind glass, so you can actually SEE if there's a hunk of Free Range Cat or whatever among the lettuce, and tell them to take it off.)"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place SUCH GOOD THINGS.  Every man I talk to raves about the godfather.  Which, I'm sorry, I just can't consume and feel okay about it, especially when my left arm gets a little tingly and I'm only 29.  There aren't too many pre-made options for sandwiches, only about 5.  The rest is kind of 'build it your own' subway style.  For someone who isn't good at making decisions, I order  Philly Cheesesteak.  Then she asks me which bread I want.  Then which kind of cheese.  Then if I want onions.  Then I say yes, and mushrooms.  Then she says they don't have mushrooms.  Um, this isn't a Philly Cheesesteak.  For one of the few 'signature subs' you offer, you should really make it complete.  And frankly, just make it for me how you would normally make the sandwich.  I DON'T LIKE MAKING DECISIONS.  It was all bread, and a little bit of everything else.    Once again, I was more happy with the Doritos than the meal.  I think Doritos will be my next Yelp review.  They NEVER let me down."}
{"text":"High class subway maybe? The bread was amazing. The ordering process was a little more confusing. I wasn't exactly sure where to stand being that it was my first time there. Was it like a chipotle and I work my way down the line? I couldn't tell... and the employees didn't really lead the way. One shouted a few questions while she made my godfather sub from the center of the line- I couldn't see what she was doing or putting on it. (I prefer the clear glass of subway) As she is still making it another employee who obviously is bored and wants something to do directs me to the cash register and starts asking me what I ordered? Was it hot or cold? And if I wanted anything else with it. Felt like a test LOL. Proceeded to check me out while she was still making my sub. As soon as I was in the restaurant I was out of the restaurant and the place was empty again. I got home to try my sub and it was almost as much meat as bread and very skimpy on the veggies. Next time I will have to be specific about how I want it. Way too much meat. Definitely a manly man sub. Not a bad lunch on the go if your specific."}
{"text":"Not perfect and a little pricey depending on what you get but the quality is there. There bread is delicious. The meats and veggies are fresh. All around rather go here for a hoagie than anywhere else. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first since most of the pics were from the owner.  When I am on the road I always enjoy finding local places and this is one of those that when I return I definitely will be coming back.  Pittsburgh is full of local gems like Pamela's, DeLuca's and Primanti Bros to name a few and I would add this to the list.  There really are a lot of choices in the downtown area but this trip I did not have that luxury.  On my last night here I decided to finally to give in and I am glad I did.  This is hands down better than any Subway by far.  Also, for the price I got 2 nights worth of food.  The bread is probably the best selling point since it offers a light airy texture to the sandwich even though it has the appearance of being dense.  I didn't get to try the sides but the fact you have a choice is much better than any Panera Bread.  Anyway, this is must try if your in the mood for a deli sub and when I come back I will be exploring other options on the menu.  And the fact there are no pics, well it's probably because there's nothing to take a pic until you realize it's too late."}
{"text":"Went in there on a Sunday late afternoon when only 4 people were in the place and 3 people behind the bar.  Had to wait a long time before anyone took my order.  Told the guy the 2 sandwiches I was ordering, but he said to just focus on the one, so I did.  However, the one sandwich had grilled chicken on it, so when he heard I wanted the grilled chicken, why not tell the grill guy, but he didn't.  He then proceeded to take a very long time to make the first sandwich, asking me to repeat much of the ingredients...oil or mayo, which kind of cheese did u want, did you say lettuce and tomato...uggh.  How could such a young kid have such poor short term memory and if they do, why not write it down????  How complicated can it be, u have a paper with check boxes to check off the type of bread, type of cheese, type of oil???  Then I have to wait for the raw chicken to be cooked on the grill after the first sandwich took about 15 minutes to make - not a particulary efficient system.  My husband actually came in wanting to know what was taking so long and I told him they were still grilling the chicken.  Then once again, he took a very long time to make the second sandwich.  I had asked for extra lettuce and sesame bread and as it turns out it was made with plain bread and did not have extra lettuce on it...grrrr (but had it to-go, so didn't notice until after we got home).  And even after all this, if the sandwich was good I would've given the place 3 stars except I had asked how hot the hot peppers were and he simply said \"they are sweet peppers dipped in a hot sauce\", so I said to \"put on a few hot peppers.\"  As it turned out, my husband, who loves spicy food, was blown away at the amount of peppers on the sandwich and how extremely hot they were.  He said it totally overpowered the sandwich and you could taste nothing else by the heat, even after he removed most of them, as there were little pieces remaining.  And apparently this guy thought \"a few\" translated into a handful, especially if the sandwich maker knew (as he should have) how extremely hot the peppers were, why would he put so many on.  I put one pepper in my sandwich and it burned the corners of my mouth...those kinds of peppers do not belong on a sandwich.  If the sandwich maker was any good, or at least properly trained, he would've told me how hot they were and recommended the peppers be put on the side.  It's too bad as the bread was MUCH better than the ones at subway and the cheese and meats seemed to be of a high quality, but after such poor service and those screaming hot peppers ruined the meal, we won't be going back.  Too bad, I was hoping for a good sandwich shop, but just another lousy chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! I get there at 8:30 and they are already closed and have cleaned everything up. I come back another night earlier and they are already cleaning up, but they let me order I order a medium turkey, ham, and bacon hot sandwhich with provolone and tomato, lettuce, and mayo. I receive my sub and it is a small sub does not have any bacon, no lettuce and no mayo!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I have been really a loyal fan of this sub. Both my husband and I like the grilled sandwiches here very much. But today, I have to submit a complain here. I ordered two grilled sandwiches by phone around noon. (2018-03-7 10:17am) The experience is very very unhappy. The man who answered my phone speak in a very unpolite tone which makes me feel very uncomfortable. At the beginning, I asked to order two medium grilled sandwiches. He asked me which kind. I said I want to build my own. Then he asked me again which kind? I answered I wanted to build my own sub. After that, he start to be rude in his tone and He don't ask me what kind of bread that I want, what choices do I have for the meat, vegetables,...  He just waited there and when I said I want all the vegetables except olives, he said I have to name all the vegetables that I want but do not providing me any choices!!! When I finished my order for the vegetables, he didn't ask me whether I need any source or cheese. Just told me the time that it would be ready and then hang up the phone! You can not imagine how hard his tone is and this experience make me feel do not want to eat sub or anything anymore!!! His tone when he speaked to me makes me feels like I am his enemy!   A fan who loves your sub"}
{"text":"Not bad. Salty. Employees miserable. Large portions.  Right on Market Square.  I like the one in Cranberry better.  There the employees were just weird, not miserable and depressing."}
{"text":"Every time we are near this shop we always have to stop.  Such friendly workers and the food is just amazing no matter what you get.  The atmosphere is so fun and enjoyable as well."}
{"text":"It's good but not good for you.   You get certain ones packed w various meats and while they taste great you realize you just ate a salt lick when you are really thirsty hours later. The portions are large though.  I haven't had anything bad here. And surprisingly their cookies are insanely good. The only issue I've run into is the service, waited a while after they took my order and forgot to place it. Knew something was wrong when 5 people after me had theirs first.   They obviously then made it and mistakes happen but it is slightly rude not to offer even a complimentary pop or such that cost you all of 12 cents as a business.  Also, I don't like philly anything so while people enjoy those a lot here I've had them and well I still don't like phillys. I can't call it bad resulting as it is probably what you are looking for then if you like that kind of sandwich haha"}
{"text":"I have had their subs/hoagie three different times now. The employees are friendly and professional. The establishment is very clean-Love the 1950's vibe. Now, let's talk about the sub/hoagie. I'm fixated of The Godfather. All three times!  The bread is soft and fresh. I order mine toasted and the crust has a nice little crunch to it. This place has fresh quality meats and toppings!! I order a small. It's big for me and save the other half for later. All in all, it's the best hoagie place around. Quality fresh meats, breads,cheese and toppings!!!! Guess where I'm having lunch today?"}
{"text":"I took my parents to DiBella's for the first time on 11/16. Sadly, it's also their last time. The staff was not rude or unfriendly, but they place no importance on service or the appearance of the store. 2 of our 3 sandwiches were made wrong and they forgot an item from our order. Our subs were good- I especially love the Godfather.  That being said, we will not be returning due to the filthiness of this location. There was not a single clean table for anything more than a two-top. There was trash underneath most of the tables (I'm not talking a chip or spill of soda, I mean cups, napkins, wrappers...) the trash bins were all overflowing and the floor in the back was actually sticky.  We asked one of the workers to clean a table for us and he swiped all the crumbs, 2 napkins and a straw on the floor. My mother advised him, being in the industry herself, that he should have swept the crumbs and trash into his hands and disposed of properly. To which he replied 'oh it doesn't matter, we sweep the floor at the end of the night'.    Again, the food is good and I think the prices are even fair. But it was seriously disgusting in there. You can do better, DiBellas"}
{"text":"So when I try a new restaurant I want to be impressed. I want to leave there thinking this is my new favorite place to eat whatever that restaurant specializes in. I did not find that today at DiBella's Subs. As a former resident to Philadelphia I was intrigued and then was encouraged to order their cheese steak. I found the sandwich to be largely flavorless. It certainly was no Geno's. All in all I wouldn't say it was a bad experience, but with so many other sandwich shops like subway Sheetz Quiznos and the like comma I just found no reason to ever come back. Sorry DiBella's, not for me."}
{"text":"Just your average sub. Service very slow and not friendly at all."}
{"text":"My friend told me that the cheesesteak here is better than Gyro Bob's in Kent, so we stopped here on a Sunday. I think it may be one of the best in the area. There aren't too many great cheesesteaks around so this would be the place to go. I heard the subs are good so I got one carryout. Everything about it was good. I recommend eating here if you are on the southeast side."}
{"text":"Holy cow. On my way home from the airport after my flight from Texas, my parents and I decided to stop in Solon to grab some dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  As we drove down Aurora Road, I looked to the right and saw a building which looked new. Hmm, what's in there? Then I saw the sign, like a beacon calling me in.  \"DiBella's\"  Are you serious? I'll no longer have to wait for my random trip to Western New York to get one of these delicious subs? My Christmas gift arrived early. We stopped, and I got to introduce my parents to the world of  New York-style subs, with the large quantities of meat and cheeses at amazing prices on amazing bagel-crusted bread.  Yet another reason to fly to Ohio. Texas needs this chain."}
{"text":"You down with OCD?  Yeah, you know me. I'm down with OCD, yeah, you know me.  Okay, I'm a little obsessive compulsive and I like things to be orderly so that's why I'm tempering my rating.  The food itself was pretty good. My tasty cheesesteak with onions and peppers was only a medium but it was the size of a toddler's arm!    The guy who took my order was friendly and the dude who rang me up was nice but the ordering and paying process was so disorganized that I nearly had a panic attack.  Okay, it wasn't that bad but the place where you ordered was clogged with people waiting for their food so it was tough to tell who was waiting to order and who was waiting for food.  When you walk into a place and see a huge clump of people standing around, it doesn't really welcome you into the place.  If they could separate the food delivery from the food ordering so that everything was linear and tidy, then it would make my very uptight soul incredibly happy."}
{"text":"A classier Subway indeed.   I ordered a small (options: S, M or L) sub on multigrain bread (options: sesame, multigrain, everything or plain) and did not have it grilled. I chose one of the just over half dozen basic sub options: the Old Fashioned. It came with turkey, ham and Genoa salami. You can then dictate which veg and condiments go on top. I opted for spicy mustard, tomato and peppers.    I definitely liked the little spicy kick my sub had. I would compare this place more to a Potbelly than a Subway. The place was clean and service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Their everything bread MAKES the sandwich. I don't know who's idea that was, but we should give them an award. All the awards. I'm a sucker for a good sub. We love swinging through here and grabbing sandwiches to go eat at the metro park."}
{"text":"Digging this sub shop.   The patriot on plain bread toasted is perfect!  The bread is chewy without being overly chewy.  The multigrain bread is really good too.    The chocolate chip cookies are out of this world and the staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since after the opening years ago, so when I had the opportunity to grab a sub, turned in. Very disappointed!  The sub was what I wanted. Cheese sub with veggies and oil, on white bread. Loaded cheese, and veggies perfect for a \"quick\" stop to pick up lunch. Key word, \"quick\"!  11:45 basic lunch time and six people ahead of me. No problem, its lunch. But by 12:05, line ahead of me reduced to four! Two served in 20 mins, huh? Here is why. One person making AND training new staff person. One person cooking hot subs. One person cashing out and answering phones! That's all! At the peak of lunch hour. Bad staffing, IMO.   Finally at 12:20 placed my order and headed to cashier. Waited behind two others as the cashier spent 15 minutes more taking phone orders. Not one order, but three, while paying customers wanted to pay and leave!  Will I be back? Most likely not. Only visit to get something quick, and this terrible time waiting for the sub, which was less to eat tge meal, is worthy of this poor review."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are ginormous, fresh and tasty on delectable buns. Super filling. My office used to cater boxed lunches from here for meetings and what a treat that was."}
{"text":"Dibella's is the best chain (region) sub shop in Northern Ohio.  The everything bread makes the sub while the meats & cheeses are always fresher then Will Smith in the 1990s."}
{"text":"I got the cheesesteak here.  The bread is absolutely delicious - they say it's the best, and they are NOT lying!  The actual cheese steak was - fairly good - but a little dry and not a ton of flavor.  I would go again but likely get a different sandwich option to see what else they have :)"}
{"text":"I think that it's difficult to be a successful sandwich shop unless you have something different to offer. What I like about DiBella's is that they have quite the variety of meats and breads, and I love their famous oil dressing. It's full of herbs!  I usually get the Dagwood with roast beef instead of ham, hot and on whole grain bread. They have excellent hot peppers, and I always ask for extra... It can never be too hot!  A small sandwich is enough for me, and I can eat. A medium is close to being a footlong!  I wish that they would spread the meat a little better. One bite will be just vegetables, another just turkey, another just corned beef, etc... I ordered this sandwich to enjoy it all together...  Their pasta salad side is OK, they drown it in too much dressing.  I do love their huge pickles here!  Overall, I would choose DiBella's over Subway ANY DAY!"}
{"text":"Had the steak sub and it was fantastic. Will be going back as soon as I have a chance. Dining room is large. Parking is great."}
{"text":"My boys love it! They split the Italian meatball sub and gobbled it up. I really dig the old vintage vibe and large booths. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is that I cut out gluten and I would love for more places to offer GF options as well as vegan. I know that's not traditional for a place that opened a century ago but it would be helpful for modern day changes of diets (:"}
{"text":"Absolutely a forever customer. Always order their Philly cheesesteak always on point. Definitely recommend for people to try out. Staff is pretty nice/welcoming."}
{"text":"I used to love Dibella's...we would stop in at least once a week, a large sub would easily feed me for 2-3 meals. The bread was great, they put on tons of toppings and the oil is crazy good. They're a little pricey for a sub but since they are so big, I really wasn't that bothered by it. I don't eat meat other than fish so when I go to a sub shop I have my choice of tuna or veggie...Dibella's had the greatest tuna sub I had ever sunk my teeth into.  Then they changed their tuna to Albacore which I think is completely flavorless. And it is mixed as a little bit of tuna and a ton of mayo. Their tuna sub went from a great experience to a gloppy, mayonnaisey  mess. PLUS, they used Albacore as an excuse to hike the price up even more. I contacted their corporate office MANY times begging them to bring back the old tuna and they refuse. When we really get a craving for their bread & oil I order a cheese sub and add my own tuna....which is maybe once a year now. They went from a very loyal customer to basically losing my business completely."}
{"text":"The veggie sub here is better than most and a better value. You have three bread options and choice of many fresh veggies. You can also get hot sauce instead of oil to keep it oil-free. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I simply wasn't hungry or if the food wasn't that appetizing, but I really wasn't feeling my sub.  The facility itself had a very nice feel and outdoor seating in the Market.  If you are feeling a bit daring I would try something else, this sandwich shop is just the safe place for a picky eater."}
{"text":"WOW. How have I not come here before? Compared to other fast sandwich places like Subway or Quiznos would not even bring you close to this. Get your sandwich grilled and you won't be disappointed!  Their bread is amazing and fresh, and all the ingredients were excellent. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Pretty average to poor quality sandwiches... maybe you can consider that a level higher for Pittsburgh standards but I'm using an NYC Deli scale   Surprisingly for a place with a multiple POS line and pager system they're incredibly slow and disorganized. You can order and pay quickly but it may take ages for your sandwich to actually be prepared, that is if they haven't completely bollixed it and forgot to even make your sandwich as happened today. Never again."}
{"text":"Place was clean. I had an old fashion sub which was very tasty. Its a little pricey, but that is offset by the generous portions that are served. I'm not a big sub fan, but this place may change my mind."}
{"text":"I was in Independence to meet some recruiters, so I figured I'd stop in for lunch after hearing my buddy tell me how good their sammiches are.    The line was pretty long, but it seemed to move fairly quickly. The lady who took my order was very nice and was efficient. I had a small Godfather on multigrain.  The bread was hearty and fresh. Lots of meat in the sammich and plenty of seasoning for a zesty flavor! It was delicious and filling.  I'm glad I didn't get a larger one or I would've been on a food coma.    I'm never out in that part of town, but would go back if I was!   DRoe, you were right!"}
{"text":"Clean Restaurant! Nice staff! Great food!  Very Reasonably priced!  Staff was friendly, but they run through the options so fast, it was a little hard to follow! But the girls working were in a great mood and very patient with me, Thanks Ladies!!!"}
{"text":"Dibella's has quite possibly the best subs in the area.  When you walk in their ordering is streamlined.  Their staff asks direct questions and gives you a number for your order and shuffles you along.  My cheesesteak was the best cheesesteak I have had in a long time.  Their bread is soft and fresh and the entire sandwich was awesome.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back.  I live about 20 minutes away but it's worth the drive."}
