{"text":"I've lived in the area for almost 10 years now and have only just now made it in. I have to admit I was a bit blown away, not only by the food but the service too!   We decided to try out the breakfast. Not only were the portions bigger than my stomach, but the bacon was probably the best bacon I've ever had anywhere... ever. So thick and perfectly cooked.   To add to the experience we had this amazing waitress named Kat (I hope I spelled that right). She was so aware of the menu and made really great recommendations and her attitude was so genuine!!!   I would absolutely recommend and return again!!"}
{"text":"Not very good............ the service was exceptional but the food wasn't. For example, the syrup was watered down (not real maple syrup) and they didn't have fresh fruit on hand or real butter. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a decent breakfast."}
{"text":"The food - I ordered an omelette.  You can build your own and I went with sausage, swiss cheese, onion, mushrooms and bell peppers.  It was very good; as light and fluffy as it could be with all those ingredients.  The omelette came with either hash browns or fried potatoes and either biscuits/gravy or two pancakes.  It's a lot of food!  I couldn't finish and brought the biscuits/gravy home.  They have a number of breakfast options but I should point out that if you're on a diet you're not likely to find something light on the menu.  The price - the omelette, hash browns and biscuits/gravy set me back less than $9!  That works out to 1/3 of a cent per calorie.  The service - They were busy but the service was still very good. People were walking around with coffee and we were checked on often enough.    The inside - the restaurant has a diner sort of feel.  It's clean, nicely laid out with a lot of booths and tables.  Things are getting a big old inside but this isn't a fancy-schmancy place so it's fine.  Not on my side of town and my waistline couldn't handle coming here often but if I'm in the neighborhood I'd stop in again."}
{"text":"Fair prices for a upscale area, nice size portions, can't understand the negative we have read, oh well we have been 3 times all excellent experience even when very busy."}
{"text":"Been going to one on Bell for some time and always enjoyed.   Went last Thursday on way home from VA after cancer treatment. Both ordered the 16oz steak and eggs. There was about 8 oiz of fat, eggs were not cooked as ordered and pancakes were cold.  Complained, manager came and only offered to redo order which we could not do and gave two $5 off coupons only 1 per table.  I don't if chef changed or food came from different place, but needless to say, we won't be going back not would we recommend!!!"}
{"text":"It was ok. The hash browns were soggy on the bottom and my wife's were still frozen. There are ten people walking around for coffee and it becomes very annoying. Service was poor. Having to ask three times for a booster seat? Bathrooms were gross. For the money this place is in the lower half of places to eat. Food was blah and unrememorable. Pass on this place unless you just can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Service was fast, and attentive. Staff was friendly. The menu was quite vast, however it bothered me that the items on the special menu didn't have prices (which seamed atypical for a restaurant being that most guests would feel uncomfortable asking). Portions were generous however I was slightly underwhelmed with parts of my meal. Everything else was tasty however, and it is relatively well priced."}
{"text":"Just visited for breakfast despite my neighbor's warning.  I should have listened. My experience was not pleasant, and I did not eat my food.  There are so many better and very good options nearby for breakfast."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! The food was super good! Very fast service! Friendly staff! Huge portions! Affordable! And really clean! I will be back here often! One of my new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Too bad there isn't a zero stars rating. Very disappointing.  We were there on a weekend morning when there were only a handful of customers...that should have been a clue. We ordered cinnamon roll,  spinach tomato omelet, over medium eggs with sausage.   Cinnamon roll was hard and dry. The spinach was chopped frozen lump in the omelet (I know this because it was cold) and over medium eggs were runny white. We told the waitress all this. Her reaction was 'oh really', not let me fix it, not I'm sorry, just...nothing.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The place is nice and new, however the smell is horrible, Breakfast Joynt had the same issue with the drain system and was a constant battle for them with No help from management! I ordered the eggs Benedict and they didn't drain the eggs right causing water all over my plate! The eggs were hard, not your classic eggs Benedict, hash browns were watery and flavorless along with the hollandaise sauce! Just Meh The water also taste horrible as well.....I really wanted to like this place but it looks like I will be going else where..."}
{"text":"Interesting that The Place in DC Ranch has five star reviews and crappy ones.  We've been the a couple times recently.  Service was great, food came quickly, and everything tasted great.  Lots of options, including  \"comfort food options\" and some healthier options, and stuff in between, too.   The amazing looking Cinnamon roll would count as a \" comfort\" food, and folks nearby raved about it, but it really needs to shared by with a whole group of friends.  Next time."}
{"text":"Good prices, decent food, and huge portions.  The food definitely isn't bad and the prices are really good, but there aren't quite enough healthy options for me to give it a 4.  I like the place better than your average breakfast place, but not by much."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a nearby venue for breakfast post hiking gateway. Yelp found us \"the place\". We arrived on a Friday right at opening at 7am. We were the first ones there and had the place pretty much to ourselves! The waitress greet us friendly and had us help ourselves to any spot in the place so we choose a mice booth. We both had the build your own burrito. Mine was egg white and hers just regular. The burrito was good and the potatoes were nice and crunchy. For a side of biscuits and gravy just to try. Def. a lot of food with the side options all for $10. They food was okay. Standard breakfast menu. The atmosphere was quiet, no music. The waitress mentioned she couldn't turn it on until the owner was there. Maybe the radio is locked up? Anyhow, the food and service were fine. Maybe things will spice up after they have been her a bit longer."}
{"text":"I'm just not sure how this restaurant can produce a five star rating. The menu was lackluster hard to find something that was new and creative.  It was and embarrassment  bringing someone there for breakfast. Must've been a bad day for them not sure definitely off my list way too many places to go in north Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I had breakfast at The Place over the weekend. The portions are HUGE and affordable. I am not lying when I say that I had the best sausage patty I have ever tasted that morning. Delicious! I have no complaints and I plan on returning. The wait staff are friendly and Trinity Gondella (hostess) is the sweetest of them all."}
{"text":"We like Butters down by the airport, as well, but it's too far away for an early breakfast and the lines are a pain. While most of the restaurants at Market Street are lousy and depend on tourists, rather than repeat business, The Place gets locals like us to come back again and again. It's basically diner food items (plus mimosas and Bloody Marys!) done with excellent quality. Been here for breakfast several times, tried something different each time, and have been happy each time...though I have to say the prime rib skillet this past weekend was just okay. Also did lunch last week and it was delish. Staff are very welcoming and service is good and friendly. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The best compliment I can give this place is that it's The Place for Low Grade Dog Food. That is all."}
{"text":"SO FRICKEN GOOD!!! Just had brunch here and to my surprise the food was very tasty. This place was poppin since it is a Saturday, but we only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us a couple of times.  I had the sirloin tips with scrambled eggs, diced (yummy) potatoes, and biscuit and gravy. (These things are huge!) my husband had the chicken fried steak, hash browns, and the biscuit with gravy as well.  We spent about $30 including our two drinks. The portions are huge, the food was delicious, and the service was great. Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Great service, cool place, I don't think it's fair that people get to bash places or people without them to be able to respond. Called a coward behind a smartphone. If you look at the people who complained, they posted more negative than positive everywhere they went  Try and be nice people"}
{"text":"Brittany was our server and was amazing. Sold us 4 items on the menu and they were all phenomenal. Will definitely be coming back. Our food was out under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"CLOSED FOR BUSINESS!!! Very disappointed. March 8, 2018. Loved coming here after hiking. I see a review from 2 weeks ago, so this is recent."}
{"text":"We have driven from Cave Creek to the Glendale location of The Place for 4 years and are thrilled to have the same great quality breakfast and great service we have enjoyed but so much closer. Chef Ryan Mead does it right. Enjoy his home made sausage, bacon and brisket along with the generous portions and friendly faces. We walked in the door this morning to be greeted by smiling Bob the Manager, original and new staff , and they were all happy to see us. Try The Place...you will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! Great place! They were so accommodating to my daughter. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just went back this weekend. Not as good as 1st few times. A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills"}
{"text":"The only place my family and I will go for breakfast. Saturday morning regulars. IHOP, Denny's, eggstacy, nothing compares.  And it's dog friendly outside. Who doesn't want to eat and sit with your pup?"}
{"text":"This was a gem of a find. We always went to Jalapeño Inferno in the same Market Place shopping area, but never got a chance to check out The Place. It was super clean, great location, and the food was fresh and yummy. The orange juice was sweet and pulpy, so delicious. I had the omelette with spinach and ham and cheese--it was awesome. The biscuits and gravy were good, the best biscuits I've had in Arizona... but definitely not southern Florida or Georgia biscuits and gravy. They were a healthier, bigger version-- but still good. Great place overall."}
{"text":"Just opened and eager to give The Place a try. Good service and convenient location. Positive reflection ends there. Menu un-inspired, coffee bland. side fruit salad was not fresh, possibly frozen but clearly days old, sides of salsa served in plastic cups, entree good but poorly presented, even the water tasted funny. I want this place to succeed but am so disappointed. I can't imagine returning."}
{"text":"the eggs Benedict was so lame and the potatoes tasted like Arby's French fries. Service was decent enough but kind of awkward. The place was cold and ugly on the inside. Someone was screaming \"Ryan!!\" in the kitchen. My friends could barely stomach their food. It was super gross and not appealing to the eye either. We might as well get Arby's for real next time"}
{"text":"Finally a good breakfast restaurant that isn't overpriced.  The waitress and staff were very accommodating and welcoming.  The biscuits were huge and light and tasty along with the gravy. The only complaint we had was that the hash browns were bland and weren't crispy. Next time will try the other choice of potato along with the pancakes that looked great."}
{"text":"This is a nice little family style restaurant.  Upon  entering it is clean, well decorated, and you are greeting promptly with a smile.  I could tell that this place has a lot of regulars eating their this morning. The waitress all greeted everyone with cheerfulness and some by their names.     The portions are huge and the service was fast.  Temp was good and not microwaved.     My husband and I both ordered breakfast and my son shared off our plates.     I ordered the chicken fried steak, country potatoes, and biscuits with gravy,   When served I had two HUGE biscuits that were nice and fluffy. The potatoes my son chowed down I hardly got to taste them they went so quickly, my chicken was big and nicely cooked did not taste like it was frozen.  I was disappointed in the gravy though.  I LOVE gravy and this just did not work for me.  It had not flavor at all and I could taste the flour.  I added a lot of salt and pepper but it was still very bland. So for that I would not order gravy again.  But for the rest of it I was pleased.  My husband ordered the breakfast steak (medium well) and eggs with hash browns.    The steak was the biggest breakfast steak I have seen in awhile it was lapping over the plate.  It was a disappointment though that the steak was cooked medium rare and not the way we ordered. He ate it anyways but said it lacked flavor.  Hash browns are crispy and brown on the ends and the eggs cooked very well.    Prices are good for the portions.  I would go back and try it again sometime."}
{"text":"My usual fav breakfast joint. Most of the dishes are big portion & tasty. We always compliment on the food, but yesterday I was a little disappointed. I ordered the prime rib breakfast platter with eggs, biscuits & gravy($11). The waiter advised me it's not a whole piece of prime rib but shredded; & came with onions & potatoes. I gave it a try & when it came, I regretted my choice. The prime rib is so wafer thin (it 's shaved) that it disappears  into the dish & appears to look like crumbles. It doesn't look like even over an ounce of beef in the mixture. I would have paid more for a decent cut of prime rib with eggs than this sorry looking prime rib dish. It shouldn't even be on the menu as I think it smells like a rip off. Please take it off the menu. If you have to do prime rib, do it the right way."}
{"text":"Long lines and slow service but that's because the food is good!!! Chicken fried steak and the steak and eggs are a go too... Also the eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Waitress extremely nice. Kitchen speed completely sucked!   Been to their other location several times and never waited so long for our order.   It's too bad because the new location is 10 minutes from my house but don't believe we'll be going back anytime soon. I'll have to give the Breakfast Joynt across the parking lot another chance."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. The hollandaise sauce had started to separate and taste bitter. Eggs were over cooked. I only ate a few bites and tossed it in the trash. Yuck.....I will stick with \"Egg N Joe\" from here on out."}
{"text":"Ambiance: A rather generic brunch diner. Definitely new and well cared for but for lack of better words it is just plain.  Nothing to sink your teeth into. They would do well to give the place more character. Was somewhat busy on Sunday morning. Moderate noise level. Patrons: white collars from the surrounding area.  Food: All the standard breakfast/lunch items (eggs, French toast, pancakes, Benedict etc) but nothing unique offered or prepared in a particularly great way. Food wasn't bad but wasn't delicious.  Service: Everyone appeared too rushed to attend to customers (maybe short staffed?). I ordered the regular Eggs Benedict with Hash browns and got Country Eggs Benedict with potatoes slices. Coffee was weak. Waffle was dry.   Overall: Very forgettable. I may come back to give them a second chance but as others have said there are so many other good breakfast/brunch places in the area with more character."}
{"text":"Good food, service and value. Have been going to there location at 51st ave and Bell Rd. for over 15 years."}
{"text":"My wife, 2 yr old and I enjoyed a delicious breakfast on the patio...I haven't had Biscuits and Gravy that tasted this good since I was in college in the south. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This truly is The Place! I've been here a few times since I've moved to Scottsdale, and their breakfast does not disappoint. Food is served hot and very quickly! Kandace is such a sweet woman, best server I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service this morning. I enjoyed the Sausage Skillet with a side of Biscuits and Gravy. The dish was huge and so filling! We started with a cinnamon roll.... Yum! Be sure to check out this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in the area for business early in the morning.  After sunrise and a couple hours of meetings, I was looking for somewhere to get some breakfast.    The Place - \"for breakfast and lunch\" jumped out as I drove through the parking lot.  First visit and the menu looked pretty good.    Waitress listed the breakfast specials.  One was biscuits and gravy with eggs and smoked brisket.  Wait, what?  Smoked brisket for breakfast?   This has got to be great or terrible.  Sign me up!   It was great.    A little side note, they offer cut fruit instead of other carbs and starches as a side.   This was actual cut fresh fruit, not the thawed fruit IHOP serves.  Nice touch.    I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"These guys are way better than when the Breakfast Joynt was here. The waitress constantly said \"My pleasure\" and was very customer service-oriented. I had build your own omelet, and it was definitely affordable for a DC Ranch restaurant. Overall, I had a great experience, and I will be back here for more omelets, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal. The wait is a little longer because how popular the place is. It's worth it. Huge portions of great food. They have a true club sandwich there that is superior. My wife loves their waffles. We have never left disappointed. The servers are on top of their areas. Would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs!! The homemade green salsa is really good."}
{"text":"The Place is great!!  Food is always good and the prices are very, very reasonable!!  My wife and I drive a little farther for us to get there but well worth it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ate there on Friday must say service was good however hash browns were greasy ham as well was greasy my sense is they are not going to make it. Poor food quality I'll never go back there too many great choices in the neighborhood. Mojo, First Watch, General Store to name but a few!!!"}
{"text":"The wait for breakfast was 20mins for a two top but worth it . The service was top notch, the entire staff practically runs from table to the back. The hostess needed to brush up on her personality skills. She wasn't very friendly, not rude but inviting. ( petite blond). Our waiter, older gentlemen was friendly, told us about the specials, moved quickly, gave this same service to all his tables. The speed of the food was fantastic. The food its self makes the wait all worth it. I had the smoked brisket Benedict and my wife had the waffles."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I want to go back to try the Cuban!! I liked the Sunday morning menu."}
{"text":"We have eaten breakfast twice at The Place.  First time, Breakfast Burro [Burrito] was so moist could not hold in hands; however, the waffle was OK. Second time, Eggs Benedict was more like Eggs Hollandaise Soup and the Huevos was terrible.  Both of us had indigestion for the rest of the day.  Usually, we give a new restaurant three strikes,  The Place earned three strikes in two visits.  On a positive note, the wait staff is good, even though we had to wait 10 minutes before having our order taken on second visit.  Had high hopes for The Place since The Breakfast Joynt moved. Good Luck."}
{"text":"We read about this place as a destination breakfast spot. Unfortunately, it was sub par at best. The cinnamon roll tasted oddly like pizza and their eggs Benedict tasted like Cheetos. Wasn't our cup of tea."}
{"text":"I ate here for brunch today with my family and the whole experience was just a mess!! Right when we sat down our waitress peaked around the corner and saw our table and said \"Oh shi*\" loud enough for all of us to here. Maybe because we were a larger party (of 9) but I thought that was extremely rude.   They only had the cream packets and didn't serve fresh cream for the coffee which was my first turn off. I ordered a huevos rancheros which was their \"specialty item\" on their menu. When I received it, it looked like two store bought flat crispy tacos with beans in the middle and scrambled eggs on top covered in way too much cheddar cheese. It was cold and NOT good. My mom's chicken sandwich, her bread was so soggy and not warm either so we both ordered a breakfast burrito to split. The burrito wasn't bad. My poor husband and dad had to wait until everyone was done eating their food to receive their meal, which they both got eggs and bacon and even messed up on my husband's order.   The side fruit cup is canned fruit with the juice and everything which is gross, it should be fresh. My husband asked for a Dr. pepper and the waitress repeated back \"Okay one Diet Coke and anything else?\" And my husband had to say again Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this weekend and let me tell you, I was not disappointed! There was a wait, but they are efficient and got us in really fast considering. I ordered the country fried steak with biscuits and gravy. Very happy! Biscuits are HUGE and the gravy was very flavorful. We will be back."}
{"text":"The Place restaurant just opened at DC Ranch Market Street.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes with blueberry syrup...it was amazing and the service was fantastic.   We'll be back this week!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Glendale and grew up around The Place. I was happy to see that they opened one up in my backyard at D.C. Ranch. Went there last weekend and everything was great just like what I was used to in Glendale. Huge plates, low prices and great service."}
{"text":"Went to the place for breakfast for our daughters birthday.  We had a party of 12 they gave a table and a booth next to each other so we couldn't all sit together and the table and booth only sat 10 total.  We asked our server if we could push our table up against the booth which she happily said yes and that she would bring us two more chairs.  Problem solved... Or one would think it was solved.   The next thing I know a person with bleach blonde super short hair walks over and precedes to yell at us that she cannot have her tables pushed up together like we had them.   She was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet.  Before I could even attempt to apologize and let her know I was sorry our server said it was ok she just kept yelling and starting pulling the table away from the booth.  Which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving.  I kept trying to apologize for the issue but she wanted nothing to do with it.  She just kept saying I can't have this I can't have that...  I then asked can we pull up two extra chairs to the table so we have enough seats?  Again in a super loud voice we were told no.  I have never been so embarrassed by an employee at a restaurant before for something that was an innocent  mistake and could have been handled in a much more professional manner.   Myself and my family will NOT be returning to the place.  As a business owner myself I think they definitely need to hold classes on how to handle situations."}
{"text":"After lasting one night in that spooky L Motel where strippers go to die- I was idiotic enough to take a referral to eat here. But I always give second chances, and this one failed.  The place was crowded on Monday morning (labor day).   The water was dirty and delayed to arrive at the table.  The table was dirty, and the silverware and napkins were absent.   The food was horrendous, and the eggs seemed like they'd been soaked in water after being scrambled.   The fruit bowl consisted of one grape, and two or three slimy melons.   We sat but did not eat. Paid the bill and sought refuge in Safeway's deli.   When you're passing through town, get thee to the grocery.   Waitress was super nice though, it wasn't her fault the meal was awful or the place was dirty."}
{"text":"Closed and space for lease.  FYI Never ate here, was wondering what could have went out of business here and found that Yelp was behind as usual on things like this. Knew I could rely on Yelp to still have a closed business on its map.  At this point I think this is long enough to post as a review rather than a tip, so enjoy... some other place."}
{"text":"AWSOME breakfast and lunch place !! Saw people lined up for food . Min 30-45 min wait but worth it . Their egg white veggie omelet was to die for . Big portions . Pancakes were cold though. Waffles and French toast were good ! The waiters anticipate ur need !! Coffee is refilled without request . Great service , our server was JACKY  have ya prompt service with a smile !! thank you"}
{"text":"Sadly everything my friend and I had this morning was sub par. My bacon tasted and had the same texture as beef jerky, the biscuits have too much yeast in them and the gravy was just gross. The French toast honestly was disappointing too, tasted like something frozen that they heated up. On top of that the place (no pun intended) was pretty empty and we still had bad service. The waitresses were nice but they forgot to bring my friends almond milk with her coffee and never checked on us when we received our food we had to call them multiple times for things we needed, even the check. My first experience was just as bad and I definitely will not be recommending or coming back here. Two stars was a gift."}
{"text":"Came here with family for Sunday morning breakfast and as expected, it was busy. Plenty of parking though. Surprisingly we didn't wait too long until our party of 5 was seated.   Service was a bit slow and not that friendly. Our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters.   Food was okay. I've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in California. I was a little disappointed with the quality and portion. I honestly wasn't full after having my meal, which is not a good sign for a great breakfast.  Maybe I'm picky or all the great brunch places like Bill's and Evergreen Inn have spoiled me, but I expected A LOT more."}
{"text":"Everything was going great until they had the nerve to charge me for mayonnaise to put on my sandwich. My family of 5 will not be returning."}
{"text":"Is this place closed? I tried calling, phone has been disconnected. We went here last week at 1pm on a Thursday and no signs saying they were closed. All the doors were locked and the lights were off. Such a bummer because this was our favorite place."}
{"text":"The best! My grandmother first took me to The Place when I was a kid. I have continued to come back ever since.  I moved from Glendale to Scottsdale recently and was so happy to see another The Place opened up near me. My favorite breakfast spot with the best omelettes! I highly recommend it."}
