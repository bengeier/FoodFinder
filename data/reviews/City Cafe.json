{"text":"I was introduced to City Cafe by a colleague who owns her own firm.  City Cafe resides along the Liberty Avenue strip across from The August Wilson Center.  I am impressed by this man's, a small business owner, attitude.  He made us great omelets at 1:30 pm.  We were the only folks there for a late lunch.  We were able to chat in peace at a quaint bistro table with two large cups of coffee.  100% vegetarian, my colleague asked for an egg white-only omelet, to which the owner (who was also the cook and waiter) granted her wish.  He has been in this space for 17 months with roughly 19 more to go.  That means, yes, he will most likely retire in under 2 years.  With no website, I love that you have to 'stumble upon' this joint.  I am not sure how he would handle a Pamela's or Eat'n'Park type rush, but that is the magic of the place.  You feel like you are at his home enjoying QUALITY food.  He seems to take life one day at a time.  Oh, and he bikes from his Point Breeze home to work.  #inspiration #yum"}
{"text":"The food was actually quite tasty and VERY affordable.  Perhaps we caught them on a low-staffed day but the service was very, very slow mainly due to the fact that our server was also the cook, owner, barista, and cashier.  The whole breakfast took over an hour....if only they would just hire a server!  We sat outside and it was lovely!"}
{"text":"Just had brunch here with the family and we all loved it. The food was very good, the ambience was very nice, and the servers were very friendly. The owner, who was celebrating his birthday, even came out of the kitchen to ask us how everything was. When we walked in we were told it would be a bit of a wait but the delicious cup of coffee came out so quickly that we hardly noticed that our food took at little while. It was actually well worth the wait for three delicious home cooked meals!  The sides were ample and we left more than satisfied with the whole experience. We are already planning another stop in on our next trip to the city."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Served straight out of the oven and hot. The Huevos Ranheros was amazing. Would get again. The latte was solid and served vey hot. The atmosphere is like a haven from the city. Soundproofing is amazing and there is nice classical music playing. It's very peaceful. The owner is also the waiter and cook. He was very friendly to me. You can tell he pours his heart and soul into this business. He said he was moving in 3 weeks to a new location by the University."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch only if you aren't in a hurry.  No Carryout.  Cash only.  The owner is a character but a good guy who does all the cooking himself.  Not the best place for parties of more than 4.  All of the food is delicious and fresh.  Coffee & espresso drinks are fantastic and cheaper than the big chains.  Fresh-squeezed juices are a good, healthy option too.  I've only been here on weekdays, so I'm sure weekends are busier.  Be patient."}
{"text":"Food: The brunch menu is all vegetarian.  There are basically three categories of meals: typical breakfast staples (oatmeal, toast, yogurt, eggs), omelets, and burritos.  There aren't other typical breakfast items like pancakes or french toast.  The burritos and omelets are prepared with a variety of veggies and other goodies and there are at least 5-6 of each to choose from.  A California omelet came with a side of home fries/potatoes and a basket of fresh made toasted bread with orange marmalade.  The omelet nicely prepared and not slapped together.  The burrito was huge and came with fresh cantaloupe on the side.  Both meals were very tasty and the veggies were fresh.  We had to deliberate to choose our meals because so many things sounded good.  Price: Meals ranged from $4-7, and for the amount of food you get with fresh ingredients, its definitely a good deal.  Drinks: City Cafe has a full coffee bar to choose from.  The coffee was organic French roast, served in a huge cup, and was delicious.  Atmosphere: The dining area is fairly small, but the tables are nicely spaced apart.  There are plants scattered throughout with artwork on the wall.  There's a large street-front window which lets in sunshine.  The tables are mostly for 2.  They're pretty to look at but wobbly.  We almost spilled our hot coffee a few times.  Located right in the middle of Lawrenceville, street parking is available and there are a lot of other places nearby to stop after brunch.    Service: Our waitress was very friendly and quick to take our order and refill our coffee.  The cook (who acted like the owner) came out to speak to us personally several times, and gave us advice on what to order.  Both the waitress and cook were very personable and funny and made us feel welcome and appreciated.  The food was served quickly and we were checked on multiple times.  (+): friendly staff, fresh ingredients and homemade taste, great coffee  (-): more \"breakfast\" food on the menu would be nice for those who don't want something heavy or salty  Would I go back again? Yes.  There aren't many all vegetarian restaurants in Pittsburgh, so this is now on our list.  And we are anxious to visit the cook and waitress again."}
{"text":"Dude told us to sit at the one table in the restaurant that hadn't been busses. Then I he acted like a pompous ass. We left."}
{"text":"The place seemed nice when I walked in. Relaxed vibe, New Yorker magazines laying around, a young professional and retired couple eating. I waited 10 minutes before anyone came out of the kitchen, and when he did, he was very quick and rude to me, stating that it would be a very long wait... So I left."}
{"text":"Slow service because they do not seem to expect all of their tables to order food. The food was great and freshly made (even the oatmeal with steamed milk which I highly recommend). The chef took interest in entertaining the children at our table and the staff was super friendly. They also serve a great cup of Joe!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Lawrenceville and found City Cafe, a worthy addition to the excellent restaurants on Butler. I'd even go as far as to say best breakfast in Lawrenceville in terms of quality food. You're hosted by the owner in his quiet cafe setting with a bit of nostalgia playing on the stereo. Try the steamed-milk oatmeal with fresh fruit served in a bowl cup, or the dainty poached egg, fresh tomato and toast breakfast. Seriously though, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is average for this type place.  Bar service leaves you waiting, and they come  off like they are doing you a favor by serving you, also way overpriced compared to similar spots in the area!"}
{"text":"Food and drink: 5 stars. The coffee is from La Prima Espresso Co. in the Strip District, a local Pittsburgh neighborhood. I really like their stuff. I usually go here for breakfast and can't seem to order anything else but the Huevos Rancheros because it's so good. The portion is easily enough for one person and you possibly could split it.   Space: 4 stars. I really enjoy the atmosphere. The natural light from the large storefront window fills the entire place. You also can sit facing the window and watch passersby on Liberty Ave., one of the main streets in Downtown. The area towards the back where the bathrooms are looks unfinished. There are about four two-person tables and two larger, higher tables for larger groups. I like that he has plants around the place.  Service: 1 star. The owner is an older gentleman with white hair. His mood is very unpredictable. He can have a pleasant conversation, but most times his social encounters are awkward and rude. He openly admits that you might wait a while for your food since he is the only one who cooks, which is nice to tell people. The food can be worth the worth, but he goes about telling people in odd ways. During the most recent visit a group of 4 people sat down and he told them that they would probably have to wait an hour to get food, but said that they would be better off going to McDonald's or something. He never invited them to stay and have drinks, just dismissed them. It's as if he is miserable for having too many patrons to handle and seems to blame people for even going in, yet if you want to take coffee to go he gets upset with you. You also cannot take anything with you because they don't have containers. I would take your own. I can't figure out what he wants from or for his business or the customers, but he could be more accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. Locate in Downtown Mount Holly in what used to be the towns old grocery store. They have excellent breakfast for under ten bucks. A great lunch buffet and dinner option. Generally I get the bison burger or one of the sandwiches.  Highly recomend on the architecture alone."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast 07/26/2015, owner said \"We're not open. Just having a going away ceremony.\" Contrary to other reviews, he was quite pleasant with us. However, it had the feel like he was going out of business."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about City Cafe. Let me say this at the outset: the food was delicious, and not the standard breakfast fare. (All vegetarian, which we didn't realize when we entered but made my vegetarian wife very happy.) I had huevos rancheros: fried eggs over pinto beans, onions and spicy potatoes. Wife had great Irish omelet, and friend had Mexican omelet. Fair warning: all meals were quite spicy with a generous dusting of cayenne, even on the Irish omelet. But all delish, different and prepared with care.  Now, the warnings. We entered carrying Starbucks from our hotel coffeemaker. That set off the idiosyncratic proprietor, who went on a long rant about Starbucks causing the downfall of civilization by convincing people to drink from paper cups. Even brought mugs over and insisted we transfer our coffee to them.  The service was not anywhere close to fast. Don't know if this is always the case, but the owner was the only one working. The place wasn't busy, but he didn't acknowledge our presence for 10 minutes or so. A couple people came and went without having orders taken. All told, we were there about 30-40 minutes before getting our food, which again was delicious.  I expect that if the service doesn't improve, City Cafe won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"After walking around the city and nothing being open, I spotted this place! I should have known there was something wrong because there was only one person inside. I walked in and asked for 2 bagels with cream cheese to go. I obviously offended the waiter (which I assume is the owner). As I was waiting 2 other people from the group I was travling with came in and bought 2 bananas, and I said just to add it to my tab. Well thank goodness they were there because I went to pay with my credit card and he said they only take cash. There is not a sign in site that says \"cash only\", which would be nice for people in this world that only carry debit cards.  After giving back change I asked for a receipt, in which he ignored me and I had to ask again. The man got pissy telling me \"next time to go to Starbuck where they have take out, give receipts and and even 'super-size' it for me\".  Seriously?? This is why you only have one person in your restaurant on a Sunday. If you weren't a complete a-hole then you would have a line out the door of people wanting food!  Don't go here, there is a Starbucks down the street."}
{"text":"Ok. so this is a tricky place to eat. The other reviews are pretty accurate. The owner has his way of doing things and if you don't fit into that way, you'll hate him.  When we got there, we were lucky and were the first people there. This meant his attention was completely on us, This is important because this is pretty much a one man show. he takes your order, cooks your food, and brings it to you. But here's the thing, he will pretty much only work with one customer at a time. He wants the entire process to be complete before moving to the next customer. That means if you walk in 3 min after someone else, you have to wait for their entire order process to be be complete. This seemed to be about a 10-15 min wait per customer. To be fair, when you walk in the door, when he addresses you, he tells you that you're probably going to be waiting for 10 min before he pays attention to you. If being ignored for 10 min doesn't work for you, go somewhere else. He won't care if you leave.  I can safely say that, because in the hour or so we were there, he had as many customers leave as he had stay. some would stay for 3 min (knowing he told them 10) then leave.   He is also very to the point about things. He's not afraid to tell it how he sees it, even if it means you get mad an leave. Example: someone walked in right after they got done smoking. He asked them if they were a smoker. then replied \"I can tell because you're stinking up the whole place\". Needless to say, the guy left. (and if you're wondering, he did stink up the whole place and we were all thinking the same thing the owner said to him)  Ok, so the owner can be rude, short, and ignore you for fairly unusual amounts of time by american standards...why the hell would anyone eat here?  Think of it like the soup nazi from seinfield. The food was so good, people were willing to conform to his rules to get his soup.  The food at City Cafe is that good. 4 stars despite the awkward interactions.  Sweet georgia brown was the food good. (the owner's quirks cost him the 5th star)  If you're willing to wait a while and possibly be insulted to get some really really good breakfast food, then go to city cafe.   As noted, it is cash only so come prepared."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN PGH City Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in PGH and definitely the best downtown for under $15 total. The owner is a passionate chef who is quite eccentric and a little flustered all of the time. The atmosphere reminds me of a Parisian cafe: plants, classical music, outside seating, great natural light.   Food takes a while but is SO DELICIOUS and healthy. You can taste the love. Each dish is prepared separately. Good coffee.   If you have time to wait for food this is a worthwhile breakfast/lunch spot in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give a 1 star rating is because of the convenience and the ladies who make the burritos/sandwiches. They are amazing and always have a nice thing to say.   The reason I give such a low rating is because of the customer service help at the coffee-bar, in particular one person. Most of the employees there will take my order, give me my change, and hand me my drink, no bells no whistles, just good old customer service. But the one person who generally works there the days I go in, is the rudest person I have ever met. The following is just one exchange I have had with her:   *approach the counter, nobody is in the store. She sees me, continues cleaning, I wait a few minutes until she walks up.* Her: Small coffee? Me: Just a medium hot tea please *hands her the tea bags* I'm trying to stay away from caffeine Her: yeah, I don't care.  Me:  ...........  I have been a customer here for the two semesters I have attended ASU and I can't foresee myself returning for a third when I return for the spring semester.  As an assistant manager at a locally owned business, I support and always go out of my way to buy at local, small, non corporate business. So finding these type of people who are continuously allowed to interact with customers like this is appalling and off-putting.   I have no problem with the business, but the interactions with this person over the course of two semesters has left a bad taste I can't shake off."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 was looking for a breakfast place during a quick trip through Pittsburgh.  We found the City Cafe.  We ordered the huevos rancheros, the Brazilian, the Florentine, and the oatmeal.  Absolutely delightful!  Vegetarian menu and classical music - a lovely way to start the day.  Would gladly return."}
{"text":"I walked in one morning before catching the train to ask if I could have coffee and breakfast to go, I was told to \"get out\" and \"go to McDonald's\", seems like the owner was insulted to be asked to put his food in a container. Wow, it's gonna be difficult to run a successful business if you are that easily offended. Anyway, an owner has all the rights in the world to run a business in any style he would like, but I certainly also have the right to stay far far away from this business and suggest anyone I know to do the same."}
{"text":"I - like another reviewer that I found after, attempted to ask for an order to go.  The owner advised me to go to McDonalds.  His attitude makes me wonder how he is even in business.  All I wanted was an omelet on my way in to work on a Sunday and I had to be turned away.  I understand he may not want to offer to go service but there is no way I would want to sit in this place and eat a meal with this rude individual."}
{"text":"One thing I must say is the entrees are absolutely delish but the anti mass transit owner is a bit eccentric to say the least... I've indulged here two different pleasant occasions, you have to have time on your side if you wish to dine here because there is a strict NO TO GO policy that owner adheres strictly... I had a very tart and bitter banana strawberry smoothie... I would go back but I do not believe it'll stay open for the long haul."}
{"text":"It's strange to see lots of reviews complaining the service. I've been there at least four times in the morning around 6:00 for breakfast during 2012. Lots of energy when you were young enough to catch a 6-hour night bus only to see your boyfriend in another city. Sadly, megabus has cancelled the night route from DC and I have to waste half a day on the bus instead of sleeping through the night.   Anyway, I didn't come across one time that the old cafe owner ever was rude or insane. This little cafe is warm, limpid and comfortable for a lazy morning. Specially recommend freshly squeezed lemon juice"}
{"text":"We live just up the street from this place and LOVE the coffee.  As many others have stated, the owner is a one-man show and is a fantastic cook.  He is verbally disheartened by the lack of business and is actually relocating downtown in January of 2012.  We will be sad to see him go, but we hope that more people will appreciate him there!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the coffee which was excellent.   The conversation with the owner was interesting, but a bit one sided."}
{"text":"First, i was on vacation... I visited city cafe after reading other reviews. Had to try these huevos rancheros. I really enjoyed them, and I was full well into the afternoon. About this slow service stuff: I reckon the proprietor is also the barrista, server, and cook. He was reading the paper when my daughter and I walked in. He was warm and friendly. He shuffled some furniture around so we could eat comfortably and leisurely. Had a great cup of coffee while he made my breakfast. It maybe took 10 minutes max. In between washing dishes and cooking orders for another table, he chatted with my daughter and I about places to visit in Pittsburgh. My experience was very positive. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"The owner of this business, who also seems to be the only person to work there, is an insane person. He verbally harassed me about my appearance. He told me that the reason I have tattoos is because I wanted to mutilate myself to keep men from being attracted to me. He went on like that for a while as I edged towards the exit. I've never been more insulted in my life."}
{"text":"The owner here abruptly told us, \"I don't have time for you. Go somewhere else.\" We obeyed."}
{"text":"Over priced bland food with poor service.  No one is nice, no drink refills.  Thankfully it is closed, maybe a good place will move in there now."}
{"text":"I've driven by the City Cafe several times, but I never had time to stop in.  The other day i was walking by and decided to try it for lunch.  They have a limited lunch menu right now, but the owner told me he was planning on expanding it.   I had a burrito and a marvelous glass of fresh brewed green iced tea.   It was great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Went there once about a year ago.  Huge cavernous building and we were the only ones in there.  The place felt sterile and dirty at the same time.  Bland walls, plastic grape vines, old beat-up carpet, tables, and seats.  The food was unremarkable.  Drive by this place often and the only thing I see filled is the bar.  Other than that, it looks relatively empty.  Not sure if that is because it's a large space to fill or people avoid it.  I'm willing to give it another try, but not jumping at the chance."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure how they intend to succeed in their new location (moved from Lawrenceville) downtown when they don't do take out and are cash only.  \"We don't have to go containers here.\" If you are worried about the extra $0.50, tack it on to go orders. If the containers cost more than that, find a new supplier.  Last, but not least, answer your phone at lunchtime and record an outgoing message on your voicemail.  I didn't sample the food."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? Pretty solid with typical food and coffee stuffs. It's located on the ASU downtown campus. Pretty affordable and there's a nice selection. I particularly dig the spinach and Feta croissant. At the risk of sounding too eloquent, this place is A-OK."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people are saying to rate this place three stars, but I stumbled onto it while staying nearby for a gig. This town is cute and has a great feel - and that's exactly what City Cafe offers. Having enjoyed it so much the first time I'm back again this morning and it's even better this time.   Granted, I'm a male and I'm alone (which is the key demographic for the huevos rancheros according to its creator and cook, who I spoke to at length) but for me the serenity and calm energy here is just what I want for a positive brunch experience.   I was bummed not only by the three star rating, but by the fact that I was the only one in. Sure Sunday brunch will be more populated than a Monday morning, but I'm pushing for this place, which has \"practically no distinction between\" it and its owner who says:  There are three ways to find out what people like. One, you ask them, but they'll end up lying to you most the time. Two, you can watch them, which works some of the time, but they often lie to themselves. The third way is to ask yourself, because what you want to find out is what humans like. Everyone is a person, so to find out what someone else would like you ask yourself, because you're a person.\"  I'm very much misquoting him. But if this place is a direct reflection of the owner then I gotta say I like the owner. He's created a wonderful sanctuary that, oh!, happens to make delicious huevos rancheros.   The espresso chai soy latte. The background music. The art on the walls. The plant life. The open space and the Complete History of the World resting in the shelf. Banners of Gaia and Persephone hang on the wall. And a tree of life takes up most the central wall inviting us all to remember that we are all people coming from the same place.   *In my continuing conversation I learned he's closing up and leaving downtown. The business has changed. People have left and those who remain \"don't have time.\" Well I encourage you to come support this man and this cafe. And take your time, you have more than you think.   Well, that's somewhat true: You have four months left before he moves back to the neighborhoods and we lose these huevos rancheros forever."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! The owner is an insane man!  He locked me and my fiance in the restaurant.  I had to call 911 to get out.    My fiance and I went there for breakfast a little after 6 am.  No one was there.  He insulted me for my facial hair in the middle of ordering food.  I sat there for a few minutes and decided I couldn't eat there.  I went back to his kitchen area and told him we were leaving as I was insulted.  He immediately started screaming at me saying we have to pay for the food as he had already put it in the oven.  I refused and started walking out the door.  He grabbed me by the arm, pulled me back inside the cafe and closed and locked the door all while screaming at me and calling me a thief and that I was going to jail (and had probably been there before).  I called 911.  He continued to prepare food so as to have it sitting out when they arrived.  Thankfully, it didn't take long for the police to show up.   The owner continued to scream about me to the police while pacing back and forth through the restaurant.  A cop had to yell at him and force him to sit down and told him we didn't have to pay for the food and let us out the door.  I got a phone call from the Pittsburgh police about an hour later saying they might have to arrest the guy because he was repeatedly calling them demanding they pay for our $20 breakfast.  INSANE!"}
{"text":"City Cafe proved to be a wonderful choice for a pregame breakfast with my parents in Lawrenceville.  Contrary to other reviews, they did have a server who handled the tables and coffee while the owner kept his focus on sending great food out of the kitchen.  I ordered the heuvos rancheros and can easily say this is one of the best versions of this dish I've ever tasted.  The beans were fresh, not canned.  The hot suace had bite, but no Tabasco.  And the eggs were fresh and perfectly fried.  The only thing that might have pushed this dish over the top would have been to lightly fry the tortillas that were served on the side to give them a touch of crispness.  And I'm sure if I'd asked, they'd have done it.  Next time!  My parents both ordered omelettes and both were wonderfully fluffy and stuffed with fresh ingredients and just the right amount of cheese.  The coffee was very good.  In fact, my cappucino was so good I ordered a second one, something I rarely do.  Overall, a very good breakfast at a quaint and comfortable place in Lawrenceville.  Yinz need to try it sometime!"}
{"text":"This quiet, chic little cafe was the perfect place for a Sunday brunch. My husband and I were wanting to grab brunch before we left to head back to Illinois and came upon this little gem. The atmosphere is casual, there was one server who was very nice. We were able to sit anywhere we wanted, we chose a high top w stools, although there were cute iron tables and chairs set for two. The decor was simple and chic. There were many different coffees, teas and juices (freshly squeezed) to choose from, and the menu boasted an array of deliciously described entrees. My husband started with a strawberry smoothie, yummy, and ordered the Florentino Omelet. He loved it. I had the Tropical Fruit Green tea, iced (so refreshing I got one to go...) and the Italian Omelet, which was wonderfully delcious! Both plates were served with seasoned red potatoes and veggies (I believe I sensed curry, but not overwhelmingly). The experience was great, the food left us happy and full...we recommend this little Cafe for brunch for sure!"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is a little strange (it feels a little too industrial for a breakfast place), the food was very good. I had fresh toast with honey, and it was delicious. It was pleasantly surprising, and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"French toast was excellent. My friends enjoyed their omelettes. Be warned no meat on the menu but all enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Great little cafe, stopped in to wait for my ride after a long overnight bus ride. Good espresso and friendly owner. I just had the coffee, but the food looked delicious and really reasonably priced."}
{"text":"City Cafe has the best breakfast in Lawrenceville, even better than Coca Cafe. Everything on the menu is vegetarian, but even meat eaters will find most of the dishes to be hearty enough for their tastes.  The menu is mostly limited to omelets and wraps, but honestly, everything is prepared so well that I don't mind. The cafe is more or less a one man shop and everything is made to order so his menu compliments the atmosphere of City Cafe--small time, simple and fresh.  I'm always discouraged by the lack of people dining in what I consider to be one of the best breakfasts to be found in the vicinity. The owner is nice and the atmosphere is calm and quaint, perfect for a simple, quiet breakfast and conversation. I learned today, straight from the owner's mouth, that he was probably not going to renew his lease in 11 months, instead opting to move back to his regular location downtown.  His reason? Not enough foot traffic and not enough business. Give it a shot, try their fresh squeezed lemonade, their hearty vegetarian soups, their delicious coffee, their milkshakes, their omelets, their wraps, their egg dishes...try ANYTHING! They're all good!"}
{"text":"I will agree that the food is good, but the service is so bad and the owner is so rude that it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Quaint breakfast spot with a European theme.  I truly believe, like in Elf, that they have the world's best cup of coffee, however they make no such claim.  I had the country breakfast which was superb.  Fried eggs over potatoes served with fresh fruit and a sliced baguette.  Skip the hotel breakfast and head here.  I will warn you though - this place is a one man operation- so if it's busy it could be slow.  However I did not have any such problem."}
{"text":"Hostess was NOT friendly. Waiter was not an ougoing guy either but gave me good service. I ordered a Blackened Chicken Sandwich with fruit and the sandwich was OK but  a little plain. I was not impressed by the plate presentation. The fruit was terrible. it must have come from a can. (is it really that hard to cut up some fruit?) the food took too long to come out in my opinion. The building is nice, new and clean with new fixtures and flat screen tv's and decent decor. Parking in rear only. Front of the building has outdoor seating. Temperature was comfortable. No strange smells. It was Friday at 1pm. Will not repeat."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this café. They are incredibly vegan and vegetarian savvy. The soups come with a baguette, and did I mention they are delicious? Soup aside, the fresh pressed juice is the real MVP. It's juiced on the spot for the freshest you could ask for - I recommend the apple/carrot/beet combo."}
{"text":"We came to this hidden cafe looking for a good breakfasts. The tiny little tables and interesting books to read made our experience even more pleasant. The only waiter/cook/owner was very efficient. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. The complementary bread was excellent. We were very please with this place."}
{"text":"Can someone please tell me why I had this place bookmarked?  I have no idea why.  But it happened to be two blocks away when I was waiting to meet with some friends so I decided to stop by in desperate need of caffeine.    I walked in and the place was empty.  It was around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, though, so I wasn't surprised.  The interior is made to look like a sidewalk cafe you might find in Paris - at least I think that's what they're going for here.  I perused the menu board as the owner appeared from the kitchen, explaining that he was cutting potatoes for the day.  I wasn't really hungry but wanted a good cup of coffee.  I decided on the Mexican Mocha.  I thought about getting it to go but before I could say anything the owner told me to have a seat and he would bring it over to me.  Sure, why not?  I had the time.  And the next day after reading some of the other reviews, I was glad I hadn't asked for mine to go.  It would likely have changed my whole experience.  My Mexican Mocha was served in a huge cup piping hot.  While it cooled I caught up on emails and current events via my phone.  The owner was the only other one there and checked on me several times.  Once he told me he never got into the smartphone craze, perhaps trying to engage me in conversation.  Once he came out to discuss how he's usually busy in the mornings but never in the afternoons and he's not sure how to change that.  Another time he came out and told me that I was listening to opera as it was being performed at the MET.  He asked me if I liked opera and I replied that I didn't mind it and it suited the atmosphere.  He didn't seem to think I was enjoying the music, maybe because I was on my phone or maybe because I was wearing my awesome \"Dog Drunkard\" tee (https://www.threadless.com/product/4800/).  I felt a little judged.  But the Mexican Mocha was one of the best beverages I've ever tasted and I happily told him so.  And then he sat down after he finished cutting his potatoes to read his newspaper.  While my interactions with the owner may have been a tad awkward at times, I never thought the service was poor or slow.  I think he wants City Cafe to be a place where people come in from the noisy streets and enjoy a peaceful atmosphere and stimulating conversation.  Maybe he feels misunderstood when someone simply orders a coffee to go.  I get that.  And I think next time I'll get those huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Had the huevos rancheros and a latte and both were delicious. Great service and a really pleasant atmosphere. The owner himself was running everything and he was delightful.  Food is amazingly fresh and tasty. This is no greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Wow just called to place a order to pick some food up while im staying at the hotel across the street. Never have I been told by a place to go to McDonald's. This owner is a piece of work so rude to a payibg customer must be from out of the country doesnt have any manners or any idea about customer service. Would never recommend this place to anyone who is spending their hard earned money on a dump like this what a joke especially the owner wont be in business much longer."}
{"text":"there is no consistency here and the past few years it has gotten bad.  I just heard there are new owners so I am hoping for the best.  I always envisioned a comedy club kind of entertainment there.  The bar side is perfect for it.  if anyone has eaten here recently please post ."}
{"text":"Delightful little cafe. I definitely agree with those that have said they don't understand the 3 star rating. The fruit and bread plate with my breakfast was on point, and the eggs and potatoes really hit the spot. Quaint and homey feel with a welcoming staff. I am happy I started my day here."}
{"text":"Great service. Warm, relaxed atmosphere. Classical music playing the whole time. It's a perfect place to sit and just drink a coffee with a book, or to meet a friend for lunch. The owner is so sweet and honestly cares about making you something you will like. He makes everything, so don't expect it to be ready like a fast food restaurant. All fresh ingredients, only uses the ones in season. I had the fruit nectar (apple, banana, pear and lemon, $4.50 in a 22ish oz glass) which was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place was just OK. The atmosphere was a little bizarre - Paris meets downtown warehouse. The tables were super small, we were only given one glass of water (no refills), and we waited far too long for our food. Once we did receive our breakfast meals, they were quite tasty, however we then waited too long for our bill, only to learn they didn't accept credit cards - just cash. If it weren't for the spicy food, this place would be one star."}
{"text":"Service -- 0 star.  Be patient. They're a little short staffed. There's the owner, then...well...that's it.  An older gentleman who's wait staff, cook, buser, food runner, and cashier.  My friend and I watched him turn away at least 8 potential customers with the \"I don't have time for you.  You'd better find somewhere else to eat.\" line. I'd never heard that from a restaurant. Talking to him after breakfast, he's stubborn, doesn't trust \"front-end\" people, thinks everything happens in the back, and won't do anything that could hurt quality.  Don't think anyone's gong to change his mind anytime soon.  Too bad.  He told us that \"service will be slow\"...three times!  I'm glad we ignored him.  Food -- 7 stars.  I had the Greek Omelet and my friend had the Irish (with black bean...don't get it...but they were still good).  Hands down, the best omelet I've ever had. Ever. Period. The warm baguette and butter served ahead of time was perfect. The coffee was hot and smooth.  All of this was worth the wait and reluctant service.  Ambience -- Charming, chessboard ready for play, NY Times sections, laying around, and classical music playing in the background.    I just wish the service was a charming as the ambience.  Package this up and franchise it with quality controls and this guy would make a fortune.   Go there when you're not in a hurry.  It's worth it.  And, yes, I'm going back when I can."}
{"text":"We have eaten here in the past and it was at least a three star. Upon entering today the sanitation grade was 92.5 and completed on June 10, 2014. The food on the buffet was cold and some items were warm. We notified the waitress who said she asked them to turn up the heat. The items that were cold were never trashed and replaced. Other items were over seasoned. The window sill where we sat was disgusting with cob webs and bugs. Other walls had food items stuck to them. The waitress brought our bill. I was not going to pay full price for this meal and the manager needed to know these issues. We called her over. She apologized and reduced the bill price. I just now hope that my family doesn't become ill from the horrible food preparation practices and unclean environment. Even my eight year old that eats anything was disgusted by this experience. I don't know how we could return unless I see other reviews or hear that this place has invested in capital improvements, management training and employee training. I love shopping local but don't know how you can when local fails to provide quality and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Cute place. The music sounded like it was coming from a record player, very old-timey. Decor was cute but we stood helplessly for a while before anyone came out to help us. The fruit nectar juice with blackberry was amazing though! I'll come again. Great refreshing snack on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"Best cafe in Pittsburgh. Beautiful, great vibe, good coffee, and wonderful conversation. A place to enjoy. America needs more like it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. The whole \"cook one dish at one time\" doesn't work. We were told lunch would be ready in 40 minutes. An hour and 20 mins later we got our food: bowl of pasta with marinara; burrito with beans, rice, red peppers; omelet with a side of potatoes. I just don't understand why it takes so long for them to get food out. If you look at the menu it's all stuff that is pre-prepared (granola, yogurt, bagel, bread) or the ingredients are the same across dishes (pasta with beans and red peppers, burrito with beans and red peppers, omelet with beans and red peppers). The food was not mind blowing at all. I would expect totally delicious food for this kind of wait and it wasn't. This is not like the soup nazi where you put up with crap because the food is that good. It's not. Go somewhere else.  Someone later told me that this place supposedly has the best coffee in town. I had a cappuccino and it honestly wasn't anything special. In fact it was bitter.  Service was OK. Looking at previous reviews (after the fact, of course) I am grateful we didn't have to deal with the ornery owner. The waitress was nice but just seemed stressed out and unable to complete simple tasks - all of this with about 6 tables in the whole place. I asked for a glass of water with my coffee and didn't get it. 10 minutes later I asked for 3 glasses of water for all of us and the waitress brought out 2 glasses and left me out.  This is not a big place so why the glacial speed at getting food and drink was kind of unexplainable. I could cook at my house faster than what was being done here. It was also *really* hot in there.  Very disappointed. I spent almost 2 hours there for a mediocre lunch. Don't go."}
{"text":"Actually, no star!!! Called in to inquire if we can order to-go because we have to catch a train, but the rude patron told us to call McDnonald's and hung up. Terrible customer service..."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent.  Very well prepared and always fresh ingredients.  I'm glad the owner sticks to his principles and focuses on the food rather than pleasing everybody.  He was always nice to me.  The bad reviews are hilarious and part of the reason I went there in the first place.  The coffee is also excellent - try a Mexican Mocha."}
{"text":"Going to City Cafe is an experience that most Pittsburghers have not had the pleasure to have. I went downtown early on a Sunday before work to run errands only to realize that I am a fool. Somehow after 10 years of living or working in town, I had forgotten that nothing opens until 11 on Sundays. I searched for a place to eat breakfast and to seek refuge, thinking I would be out of luck. Amazingly, City Cafe was open. When I walked in, I was pretty surprised by the decor. Tiny marble tables with shelves and lamps holding leather bound menus. It looked more like a library than a restaurant.   I ordered an iced Americano and hue is rancheros. Everything was so good and so fresh! The Jarvis rancheros had zucchini, onion, jalapeños and celery with potatoes and pinto beans. Amazing. The beans were the stand out, fresh and a little toothsome, just as they should be after rehydration. The whole meal was perfectly spicy. The server was also efficient and friendly. I got a best, apple, ginger and carrot juice to go which was also great!"}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service. Excellent food all from fresh ingredients. Juices were fresh squeezed and very tasty. While eating breakfast, 9 people walked in and the last 4 complained the only waiter said it would be about 30 minutes for the food.  I got the hue is rancheros and my girl got country breakfast and they were both delicious. Just the perfect amount of food.  Props to the owners, cook, and waiter for everything here."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in downtown breakfast options.   After talking to the owner, I learned that the cafe used to be in Lawrenceville, but has been located Downtown most of 2013. Lawrenceville's loss is Downtown's gain. The large space is softened by lots of green houseplants and tables for 2 accented by art deco lamps. The larger high-top tables fit about 4 people, so this isn't a good place for big groups.   The food is cooked to order, but while you wait you are served fresh slices of baguette, jam, and butter to tide you over. The individual breakfasts are served piping hot and quite tasty. My husband especially enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros with its fresh roasted vegetables, spicy sauce, and home-cooked beans. I was a big fan of the super-fluffy Greek Omelette. Lastly, they serve big cups of La Prima coffee.   If you want a hearty vegetarian breakfast before going to the Convention Center, this is the place to go.   As an aside, some of the reviews mention the surly owner/cook, but I'm happy to report that he has hired a waitress who is very friendly. I found the owner to be a bit gruff but friendly."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite little stops in Pittsburgh! Cute ambiance and delicious food. Feels like a mom and pop kind of place. Definitely recommend it for a nice breakfast or lunch of you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Walked out. Went with a group of five for breakfast and the owner said that \"big groups should go to Eat-n-Park. We're just a little cafe.\" I suppose our money wasn't good enough. If you've got three or more in your group, go to Hanlon's Cafe just down the road."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on Sunday (the line for Coco Cafe was too long) and we had quite an interesting experience. I'll start with the simple stuff: the food. I had a burrito with potatoes, eggs, and something else (though they were out of avocados so the one I really wanted was a bust) and it was fine. Nothing special. My wife had the peasants breakfast which was tasty, but also nothing to really rave about.   The interesting part was the service. I don't know if this was a Sunday thing or the norm, but there was only one employee working that day. One employee for the kitchen and the front of the house. Meaning, this guy would take our order, go to the kitchen, cook it, and bring it out. No help of any kind. This was fine when it was just me and my wife, but once other folks started showing up, he was very much overwhelmed. At one point, the guy (I'm pretty sure he was the owner) told one couple that it would be at least 20 minutes before he could even take their order and told another group of three that they should just leave and go to Eat N' Park since it would be faster that way.  So, it's a cute cafe, with mediocre food, and, um, interesting service.   Would I go there again? Nah. I'd rather wait the 45 min for Coco Cafe or go to Dozen when it reopens."}
{"text":"City Cafe is unique and unexpected.  I highly recommend reading a few reviews before you go, so you know what to plan for.  I had a wonderful, quirky brunch experience here a week ago with a good friend who'd been there before, and loves introducing other people to the delights of the City Cafe.  Parking is actually free right in front of the cafe, so that's a plus.  We walked in (on a Saturday at noon) and it was totally empty.  I know this seems like a bad sign, but just bear with me.  The owner greeted us immediately - he is host, server, barista, cook, and conversation all in one - and served us Earl Grey and coffee in large mugs.  He asked if we were ordering food - he is a fantastic cook, but he also really values the fact that this is a CAFE, and food is optional.  But we were hungry, and came for his cooking.  I ordered the huevos rancheros, and my friend ordered the Brazilian peasant breakfast.  He disappeared to cook it, and we sipped our drinks.  In this time, another customer appeared and sat at a table.  The owner did not emerge from the kitchen.  She left within 10 minutes, without having been greeted.  I feel guilty, like I should've explained it to her.  This is how the man operates - he runs the entire show - and sometimes you will need to wait.  If he doesn't greet you, he's back in the kitchen cooking.  If you want to order food but he's making a cappuccino, then you need to sit tight.  He said he couldn't afford to hire a server - I think it's a vicious cycle where he can't hire someone to serve, so service is slow and people don't come, and then he doesn't make enough money to hire someone.  People just need to come and be leisurely!  Have a little patience!  Our breakfasts were served in small baking dishes, straight out of the oven.  The accompanying tortillas and baguette were soft and warm, served with butter and jam (and, I think, hot sauce for me).  My eggs were marvelous.  Deliciously soft, with a runny yolk.  The potatoes, onions, and beans underneath were toothsome and creatively spiced, in a rich, warm sauce.  For such a large meal, it felt light in my stomach afterwards.  It made me happy - fed the soul, if you will.    All the food here is vegetarian.  It is also hearty and inexpensive, as well as prepared with skill.  As the only people in the cafe, the owner chatted with us a bit about his future plans.  He does have an unusual conversation style - sort of, excited and talkative with an odd turn of phrase - and he has very strong opinions about what matters in our culture.  He clearly values quality, freshness, patience, and you need to feel that way too in order to come here.  Don't come here for a greasy breakfast, or if you want to get in and out in 30 minutes.  Come for a cup of coffee in a sunny room, a homemade brunch, and some memorable conversation.  Prepare to stay a while.  But please do try it - help the man hire a server, for goodness sake!"}
{"text":"Go to the City Café when you have some time to kill and want a spectacular breakfast or lunch for a great price in an intimate setting: breakfast with your significant other, lunch date with a good friend or if you're headed out alone.   It's slow because it's a one-man operation, but slow in a café--especially in the European sense of the word (and this café would easily find a comfy home somewhere in Paris)--is also known as relaxing, refreshing and enjoyable.    They make the perfect bowl of soup. It was so perfect I had two bowls of soup. Yup, the biggest compliment I can pay a restaurant-going out of my way to order seconds. Everything is made from scratch by one person, something worth thinking about.  The breakfast menu is mainly omelets ($7) and the lunch stuff is burritos (also around $7).  I actually didn't even notice it was vegetarian until I heard one of the customers mention it, another big compliment coming from a pork-product-chomping gal like myself.   The owner alone deserves an entire review. He tossed out a Bartlett's worth of sound bites, but I think it's better to meet him face-to-face than try and explain him here (hell, I don't even know if I can explain him). His personality is a big part of the City Café experience.  I will say this: he knows a lot about a lot. And they're cash only."}
{"text":"Very tasty, eclectic, good & well prepared foods. Made with fresh ingredients & good coffee. Love it that the owner is full of stories, political opinion & fun conversation."}
{"text":"Go for the food, not for the service.  I was originally put off by the older man's attitude when I came in with two other people - he said, \"If you can't handle waiting, go to the McDonalds down the street.\"  It was strange because those were the very first words he said to us, no \"hi\" at all.  Nonetheless, we sat down and he took our order.    We came in at about 7 AM, and the food came out at 7:20.  There was a younger guy, possibly in his early 20's, that came in to help.  He was definitely a lot friendlier."}
{"text":"We had an hour to kill between trains.  I was surprised to learn the only Starbucks within walking distance was closed on Saturdays ... seriously?  I took a walk around to find sustenance and stumbled upon this quaint diner.  I was the only customer at 6AM.  I waited patiently for a good five minutes and still saw nobody.  I had to yell into the kitchen to flag down the owner.  No apology or even small talk.  He merely looked at me waiting for my order.  \"One large mocha, please.\"  As he reached for a fancy glass mug I chimed in, \"to go please.\"  He gave me a serious glare and reached for the to-go cup.  A few minutes later I was on my way.    The coffee was good but a little sweet.  The service was rude and curt.  The diner was charming.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I always think this place is going to be awesome, and then remember that it's \"southern style home cooking\" which to me, is gross.  Everything's fried, veggies are no doubt from an industrial sized can or jar, and for the price, I could make it better, fresher, and cheaper at home.  The sunday \"brunch\" buffet is $10/person, for a bunch of fried stuff, soggy and bland veggies, and iceburg lettuce for salads.  Maybe I'm a food snob, and I realize it's a buffet, but I could get more options for less moolah at Ryan's or Golden Corral, as much as it pains me to say that.  If you're part of the over 55 crowd, then this might be the place for you, which is sad, because the Sunday brunch options on this side of town are seriously lacking.  Hate it if you want, but this kind of buffet offends my delicate Northern tastes.  Can't say anything of their regular menu, but as for the brunch buffet... not a fan.  As a side note, I realize it was a buffet, but I watched our server stand at the table next to ours talking for about 10 minutes after our plates were cleared and we were ready for our check (which she had in her hand).  Apparently the place is under new management, and they're trying to make things better, but as far as food and service goes... would not return here."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu, very well done. My party had an omelet, a burrito, and the Brazilian peasant lunch all for a late lunch, and the service and food were excellent. The dishes are artful and healthy. Admittedly we were the sole customers at the time. There was a waiter and a cook (the owner, I presume). The juices were also very good. They accept credit cards."}
{"text":"This is a charming little place with a warm ambiance... marble table tops, classical music in the background, softly lit, tasteful little pictures adorn the walls. I sat myself, looked around and noticed a stack of menus by the juice bar. I helped myself to a menu and a gentleman appeared shortly afterwards and asked if I'd like some coffee.   I declined on the coffee but asked him what he would recommend off the menu that might have some \"zest\" to it. He suggested the Huevos Rancheros from the breakfast menu. Although it was lunch time for me, I went with it.  A bowl of nachos came out shortly after placing my order. The salsa that accompanied it was in a tiny container and was really only enough for about half the bowl of chips. I wasn't expecting nachos to be served and I wasn't here for that. But I'm sure if I asked for more salsa I would have been given some.  I noticed a few other reviews stating that the service is slow. That was not my experience at all. My dish came out in less than ten minutes, probably closer to five, and it was visually a thing of beauty. After one bite, I was sold.  On one side of the dish were potatoes with a slight bit of onion and celery coated with a perfect blend of spices. On the other side was a serving of pinto beans in an enchilada sauce. This was all topped off by a pair of sunny-side up eggs. I don't consider myself a vegetarian by any means but if all vegan dishes were this yummy I'd consider converting to the bean side.  The meal came to $.8.51 plus tip. I didn't expect to be rating this place with five stars when I walked in the door but the meal was so delicious that, as I was leaving, I thought to myself that anything less would be an injustice."}
{"text":"I overall like this place...plus it is convenient. However, the prices are a bit high. $1.95 for a candy bar! The cafe also hasn't been as good since Daisee and Deena left. The pastry case isn't stocked well and there is almost always a long line to pay. Something needs to change to make it better again."}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD, POOR SERVICE - PLEASE READ  I had been wanting to give city cafe a go for quite some time. I didn't get around to it until today. As I walked in I was immediately attracted to the space. It's small, cozy, and quiet. It felt a lot like being in a garden -Iron furniture and bright green plants.  I thought to myself, after choosing a seat and opening their small, well put together menu, even if the food isn't good I'd at least come back to sit for a coffee. I had not created any expectations until this point in time, as I waited to be greeted by a waiter or waitress. I imagined a young, kind, forward thinking person so I was surprised to see an older man come from the back. After briefly speaking to a friend about city cafe I learned that man is usually there so I came to the conclusion that he probably owns the place.   Said old man approached the table at which I was sitting. I said \"Hello, how's it going\" with an inviting smile. I was given no response. I then kindly asked for a water. Again, no response no facial expression - he walked away. He quickly returned with a glass of water that splashed onto the table as he slammed it down. I felt unwanted. I gave him the benefit of the doubt as I have previously worked in the service industry and we all have bad days.   I made a quick decision. He didn't ask me if I had any questions, he didn't even ask me what I wanted. He just stood there staring into my eyes until I blurted out \"I'd like the Greek omelet, please\" still giving him a faint smile. This man still radio silent.   I am multitasking - working, sending out emails and half surveying the scene around me. The only other person in the cafe finished his breakfast and approached the counter to pay. I watched the old man who probably owns city cafe light up with a smile. They exchanged some words and laughs.   I'm still, at this point, making excuses for this waiter. I'm thinking he probably knows this guy sees him a lot, what have you. For a moment it was only me in this cafe.   My omelet was delivered along with one word \"hot\" I thanked him. The omelet looked and tasted great.    Enter two middle aged women- they just ordered some drinks. I couldn't help but notice they were given the same kindness as the man who had just left. At this time I was done making excuses for this old man. It was me. I was his problem.   I turned up my headphones and finished my meal. Ten minutes later the waiter returned. Said something that I missed due to my decision to stop caring. I assumed he said how was everything? So I responded \"everything was great thank you.\" He looked a tad confused and said \"You done?\" I giggled and replied \"yes, thank you\" I realized he probably asked the same question twice.   I followed him up to the counter to pay my tab.  -silence, printer printing check, he said \"8.75\"   I handed him my debt card and thanked him again. Tipped him more than 20% and way more than he was worth. Reminder : I worked in the service industry before. It takes a lot for me to stiff someone.   To conclude this, I will not be returning and I will share how poorly I was treated with a lot of people. I was singled out. Maybe it was because I wasn't in my best business clothes, maybe he was upset that I'm a young tattooed woman. Either way I felt unwanted. I felt like a chore as I watched everyone around me be treated with kindness.   My money is the same as everyone else's.   I'm pleasant.   I don't fully understand.   Bummed out.   Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Group of four of us walk in. Old dude walks out and squawks \"I don't do groups.\" We all laugh because we think he's joking. A few minutes later he walks out again and dismisses us the same way. We storm out. If you have some weird and arbitrary policy like that you need to put up a sign or something. Screw you too buddy."}
{"text":"I heard the food was awesome, a point that was confirmed by a older gentleman just finishing his breakfast. He warned that the service would be slow, but it would be worth the wait. I had nowhere to be for hours and looked forward to a lazy morning.   Then the proprietor emerged from the kitchen, a stern-looking fellow with thick white hair and a mustache. He sized me up and asked, \"Yeah, can I help you?\"  I knew from reading other reviews of this joint that I was in for something strange. I wanted to experience this.   I said, \"I'm just one. Can I sit anywhere?\"    His response? \"I'm alone here. You better go someplace else.\"  I smiled. I wanted to laugh, but I feared he might not react kindly to that. So I left and went to Hanlon's down the street.  I'll try again next time. Getting kicked out is half the fun."}
{"text":"Line of 3 guests + 4 open tables = 45 minute wait, just for coffee... If you want to order from the menu... Double your time, and please don't ask any questions, too busy being annoyed by paying customers to answer questions... One star is as low as you can go...but somehow it's too much"}
{"text":"Weekend, so I was only customer. Very friendly and helpful. Excellent espresso, very smooth, not bitter. Fantastic huevos rancheros - perfectly delicate eggs on top of spiced potatoes, beans and onions. And freshly sliced jalapeños, since I challenged the owner to make it hot.  Finished up with a freshly made lemonade. All juices squeezed from scratch.  Quirky, personal service, great food, all fresh ingredients. Great job! Viva le slow food revolution!"}
{"text":"We originally were headed to brunch at some \"new\" coffeehouse in Lawrenceville, but when their menu was NOT very brunch friendly, we decided to eat somewhere else.  We walked to New Amsterdam and the menu looked lackluster their as well.  We turned around to see if anything was near us and that is when we saw the City Cafe.  We walked up and upon just seeing how HOT the server was we decided to eat brunch right there!!  ;-)  Anyway, it's a vegetarian restaurant.  The food is good...IF you can get the old man (the owner and cook unfortunately) to actually want to prepare something.  Each time we have been there when he doesn't have a server, he is somewhat rude and acts as if he is being put out to make our food.  WHEN it's made, it's always delicious.  He makes a point to mention each time how his old restaurant in San Fran I believe it is used to be a \"lovers\" soda pop shop.  Tables were for 2 people ONLY.  I think he is somewhat irritated if more than 2 arrive.    Anyway, the entire scene is very weird.  If only the food wasn't so dang good!"}
{"text":"Ever been to your grandparents? Lets talk about it for a moment.   Cons: They want to make you food and if you aren't hungry...you are still getting food. They can't hear very well if at all. They smell like old people   Pros: They want to make you food and if you aren't hungry...you are still getting food. To them, you are the next president/ superhero.  Welcome to City Cafe.  The food is delicious. The service is well...it's \"unique\". The man who runs it is extremely hard of hearing so if you talk with your hands, this may benefit you. If not? Good luck.   The lemonade truly is fresh and the breakfast I ate really did make me feel like I was in someone's house as oppose to a restaurant. It's a rare thing these days but I loved it.   The space is small and the price is decent, cash only fyi.  Pro Tip: The super nice man there is more or less a hippie who hates automobiles so if he asks you about how you got here, say you took a bicycle and thank me later.   Two non pollutant thumbs up."}
{"text":"I guess they were overwhelmed by breakfast .  \"Food will be a half hour wait\" - a bit ridiculous for a place named City Cafe."}
{"text":"Excellent food and amazing coffee! The perfect place for a soothing cup of coffee and delicious healthy food.  I could eat here everyday! Brazilian Peasant breakfast was wonderful. Flavorful beans and potatoes- perfect eggs. Accompanied by fresh melon and the best cup of coffee I can remember."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. We were looking for a place to have brunch in town on a Sunday morning, and this one came up with decent ratings. I had the Mexican omelet, my girlfriend had the Florentine one. It was more of a scramble over potatoes, but the flavors were very different, in a good way. The pros: interesting menu, great portions for the cost, quick service, eclectic decor. The cons: small place, seating for maybe 20 people max, no meat on the menu (and I'm all for vegetarian friendly places, but give the carnivores an option, too) and the kicker, we didn't get a paper bill, our waiter just came to the table and told us our total. The amount was correct, but its nice to be able to check, and the awkwardness of it was a turn off. That all being said, we'd definitely go back again for a quick, inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"the service is terrible; the waiters (if you want to call them that) pay no attention to you after you're seated. the food is mediocre, like if I wanted to pay top notch for a plate of bacon and eggs I would have shopped at Whole Foods for the quality and saved me and my friends the hassle of going out to eat. the bathrooms are disgusting, this is my second time being in this place and I don't think that they've been cleaned since they opened. and to top it all off, the owner is an ignorant old man who has no conception of individuality. my friends aren't the polo shirt and boat shoes type, we have tattoos and gauges and we (God forbid) like to wear hoodies. the entire time we were seated this gray haired gentleman was harassing us, making fun of us, calling us names and basically making the whole dining experience uncomfortable. if I wanted this type of service, I would rather have asked the bums that sleep on Smithfield street to make me a hot dog. a one star rating is beyond too much to rate this place"}
{"text":"I like the juice. That is it. Can be rather unfriendly if you just stop by for coffee. The food is middling. Just get a juice."}
