{"text":"Nice and chill place to grab a great coffee at a reasonable price. Moreover, they always have some interesting art posted on the wall. If you are around you definitely should try it!"}
{"text":"So I went in today, I had been before awhile ago when they first opened. I remember liking the service and the atmosphere, though the latte wasn't great. Thought I'd give it another shot. 

I walk in and said, \"Hello! How are you?\"  to which the man behind the counter (who is working alone) replied in a low toned, unfriendly \"Fine, what would you like?\"  I give him my order of a latte and a cookie, and then someone gets in line behind me. The man behind the counter (the barista) not only starts making conversation with him, he starts his order before mine. I get that you know him, but how is that supposed to make me feel? I have to know you to get served first? I wasn't even in a rush, it just seemed rude. 

I work in customer service, so I like to give the benefit of the doubt, not write him off yet. But then other people  walk in, and the barista starts to chat them, and says \"Hey guys? How are you? The usual?\"  Wtf!? Still hasn't even rung me through or started my drink. I thought that was so rude, I honestly almost turned to leave. However, the weather was crap and I wanted to warm up before my journey home. (and use their WiFi to catch up on Adventure Time) 

I get my drink and cookie eventually, and take a seat. The seat is very wobbly, but whatever. The barista is chatting with his friends so loudly, even with my headphones in at full volume, I can hear them. Afterwards when they're done talking, the barista turns up the music. I get you like the music, but let's be honest. People come to a cafe to do their own thing, not to listen to blaring music. 

I'm not usually one to turn down a place so quickly, but he made me feel very unimportant by ignoring me/talking to his friends, and I wasn't comfortable in there. 

The cookie was okay, but the latte was too hot/burnt milk. 
Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I think the world of this place! The coffee and tea are solid. The owner's sweet. The pastries are tasty. The music and staff set a great vibe and there's always interesting art on the walls. 

They also have gelato that's pretty delicious. Haven't tried the ice cream sandwiches but I'll report back when I do. Cause I know you'll be waiting. 

It's my favorite coffee shop to sit and get work done. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Good hang out.  And YES they have wi-fi / wireless. Good for individuals or small groups as they have a long bench area which could seat about 8"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to stop by solely based on the name because \"Super Jet International\" coupled with the signage reminds me of some ad you'd see in an '80s magazine out of Hong Kong or Japan.

Anyway, this morning I was going to stop into Ezra's Pound on the way to the subway, but upon seeing the line up I thought no thanks.  I'm glad I kept walking.

SJI is a little place in an oddly shaped building that, in honesty, is not as cool looking inside as the signage suggests, but since it's about the coffee I'll get on with it.  They have a \"Double Standard\" where all espresso-based drinks are made with a double shot as the standard. So, my reasonably priced Americano at $2.75 (significantly more elsewhere) was delicious AND it was a double!!  No wonder I'm typing so much.  Am I typing too fast?  I feel like I'm typing too fast...

Bottom line: if you're near by, you should go."}
{"text":"Great service!
The guy who works here should train every barista in Toronto.
Cute, no-frills, no AC, unpretentious."}
{"text":"The coffee was not good and the place was not clean, but there was something in Superjet International Coffee Shop I could not say bad about. The barista or owner seemed to be nice. There were customers who loved to come to this coffee shop. This was near a Psychotherapy school. Other customers seemed to be relaxed. There must be something good about Superjet International Coffee Shop. At least you can cure your craving for caffeine and baked goods."}
{"text":"This small dainty little coffee shop occupies the perfect corner on DuPont. I'm a tea drinker so I'll speak for the leaves. 

First time, I got a green tea. The best thing was they pick loose leaves out of jars and fill little sachets rather than a tea bag. So I remembered for next time to ask whether I can blend different flavours. Second time I got jasmine green tea. As a tea drinker I love to have somethibg sweet with my tea so I had the salted chocolate chip cookie...mmm!!

Cute little place and they have outdoor seating as well.

Service is great!"}
{"text":"Just awful. Tried it twice. Second time was worse than the first.  Received a \"latte\" completely devoid of any milk foam or froth and very watery as a result of too much milk.  Oh and they charge 25 cents to use Interac. (See uploaded photo).

Next time I'll make the extra walk down to Ezra's Pound."}
{"text":"The guy with long hair working here is yummy.
Good coffee too. 
That's all :-)"}
{"text":"First review for @superjetYYZ. Boy, does this strip need this coffee shop!

Super-Jet International was 5 days old when I stumbled on it on my way from the DuPont subway station. I feared I was hallucinating; how could there be an indie coffee shop in this place that only seems designed to get you from point A to point B without getting distracted along the way? But someone must have noticed, as I have, that all those Annex homesteaders and George Brown students have nowhere to get coffee that won't evoke a gag reflex. I know that's not nice to say but it's true.

UPDATE - It turns out that I was premature in my judgment of the Dupont Strip. Good stuff lays eastward. There will be reviews on this soon.

On to the happy news! Coffee so good you will not want to disrupt it with sweeteners. Please, try it before you think you have to mask the flavour just because you are on Dupont; it's really good. Unpretentious friendly service from the proprietor, frequent flyer cards that you will definitely want to use and, this morning, trip hop played at a volume that allows me to groove and still think! The space is comfortable but a bit spare at the moment; art arrives in a few weeks. 

Only shortcoming; my scone was decent but nowhere up to the quality of the java. But the take-out container was a cute little paper Chinese-take out box; how can I resist?

There is definitely potential for doing a bit of work there. I've already mentioned that the music is of a style and volume to evoke your muse, but there is also wifi available and a few electrical outlets for keeping your equipment juiced. 

Oh, I should mention that there is also loose-leaf tea and you can purchase David Lynch Coffee (yes, that David Lynch!).

Really like it here!"}
{"text":"Who cares if it's super hot inside? Not me because I don't think that I would choose to work in this hood cafe. Great to grab something on the go, if not exactly hurried service. That's fine; this is a cool indie coffee shop and so you deal with it. 

Love that taxes are included; prices are reasonable; and each drink automatically comes with a double shot of espresso. Starting this summer, they also offered Artegelato, which is an exciting treat option."}
{"text":"Great coffee and service! Such a good vibe, I really like supporting this business and am grateful that it's my local coffee shop. 
 It could only be improved by them getting a vegan option for food..maybe a nice breakfast muffin or cookie. That's not too much to as for, is it? Bonus points for not charging extra for almond/soy milk, though."}
{"text":"Great iced coffee and nice little area to sit outside in the summer. The barista is super nice too!"}
{"text":"This place has been pretty awful more than half the times I've been here. It really depends on the person serving you, I find.

When this place first opened, I popped my head in and ordered a latte- the person working there was super friendly and polite (presumably they owned the place.) The latte was pretty decent, it was on the way to campus from my house and the prices weren't god awful. The second time I went it was also decent and the cookies were alright. I was paying less than starbucks prices for what was essentially a starbucks latte/cookie, which was reasonable once in a while.

Now, more recently since this place's business has picked up a bit, both the patrons and the staff have become pretty rude. The last three visits have all been a waste of either time or money. Essentially the last straw was my fifth and final visit that I had been served a lumpy latte which I ended up dumping on the street and getting coffee from the Subway restaurant at Spadina/Dupont.

I wouldn't bother with this place at this point, unless you personally know someone that works there/owns the place. Seriously, there's a million better coffee shops in Toronto. If you're in a rush at that intersection: go to the new Subway or the convenience store with a Country Style in it."}
{"text":"Prior to Super Jet, the Chai Bar at The Indian Rice Factory was the closest decent coffee place to my house. Unfortunately, they closed. Strolling down dupont, wallowing in misery, I found this little gem and everything changed. As soon I stepped in my olfactory senses were tingling with anticipation. Ordered my usual double long espresso with a little bit of water, (mini americano.) Usually I tend to get hassled for ordering this slightly pretentious drink, but to my pleasant surprise, it turned out this is the baristas go to drink as well. And boy of boy, he really nailed it. It was the best version of this drink that I've ever had. All the proportions were perfect, the coffee pulled perfectly, with an exquisite amount of crema, and let me just say the taste was remarkable. Coffee wise, this place is perfect. The decor is simple and tasteful, the music was great and the fact that the place has huge windows is a big plus for me. Lots of light and great vibe. Highly satisfied with this new addition to the upper annex area."}
{"text":"Small, unassuming
Cool patio gets the love
Where is the jet theme?

Super chill vibes, yo
Double espresso it all
Might just make you fly"}
{"text":"Cheaper than Creeds and Ezra Pound and most of the time better coffee. Wifi and kind staff. The art on the walls is always changing and refreshing. Free wifi and usually right level of music. 
I wish they took credit card/ didn't charge for debit. I also wish they had nitro cold brew in the summer."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in the Dupont area. My friend and I were on our way from our food hunt at Schmaltz for some delicious bagel sandwiches and felt like some coffee after - that's when we came across this cute little joint. 

Both of us had the Cappuccino and it was great! Perfect amount of milk and espresso and we were both very happy. The music were really great -  a great combination of new and old French music. 

Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Small but cozy. I like the loose leaf tea.

The barista was playing Radiohead - The Bends... on repeat! I happen to love that album, but it could have been annoying. Bring your own earphones, just in case."}
{"text":"Great coffee - among the best coffee I've had in this city. The coffee is hot, strong with smooth creamy microfoam. Beans are always fresh.

To the reviewer below that wants more foam - ask for a cap. 

The pastries look good - only had them once or twice but the blueberry scone was not overly sweet and tasted healthy. 

As for comments about the proprietor - no question he's a little bit cool, but the coffee is well priced and good. Not much of a vibe in the place in he mornings so he might consider  turning up the music and the lights (and the heat!)

Update May 2016
Has continued to do well and is a nice spot to visit and even work in the mornings.  Quality as good as Ezra's Pound and cheaper.  Not as upscale though."}
{"text":"I have spent many a day here working on my Master's degree.  It is a lovely place to sit and work.  The salted chocolate chip cookies are amazing,  and the coffee will not disappoint - every shot is a double, and they have multiple milk alternatives.  The service is outstanding."}
{"text":"The decor is sparse, no wi-fi, they have a \"frequent flyer card\" for 7th coffee free, no loud music, and decent cups of coffee at a little more than $2 a cup. 

Ezra's Pound needs some competition though, so I'm glad this place exists. That and the Chai Bar down the street."}
