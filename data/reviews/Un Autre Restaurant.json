{"text":"Out to supper on a Sunday night. Had the St-Laurent pizza, ravioli soup and my friend has half smoked chicken. Everything was awesome. Delicious."}
{"text":"La pizza è buonissima ingredienti di qualità siamo rimasti contentissimi sia io che mia moglie.  Continuate così"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, a must-visit for everyone! GO HERE!!! Food was AMAZING (I had pizza and calamari) and our waitress was the most attentive waitress I have ever had the pleasure to have serve me! BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Hubby made reservations at this cute pizzeria for date night last weekend and it was great! Ambience is super cozy and friendly, menu is varied, and prices are fair. We had the sangria which was delicious, shared the fried rice balls and meatballs, I had the pasta of the day (fettuccine in a cream sauce with veggies), and hubby had the Laurier pizza. The rice balls were delicious and the meatballs were good (but nothing phenomenal). My pasta was outstanding and refreshingly not swimming in a heavy Alfredo sauce but rather just lightly coated which was a welcome change from what you usually get in the city with this type of dish. Hubby liked the pizza but I didn't find it special to be honest. Overall ratings would be a 3.5 but because I can't give half stars (read: please let us give half stars Yelp!), I rounded up to 4 because of the amazing service and friendly attitude you get in the restaurant.   Not sure if I'd come back to be honest, but it's a solid choice for some yummy Italian food!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome with a great selection of pizza and other Italian dishes. The wait staff was great and friendly, able to communicate in both French and English perfectly. Great casual ambiance. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Mile End!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Montreal, it's amazing! I got the cheese pizza and tried one of their tomato-less pizzas, I much preferred the cheese one although the latter wasn't so bad either. Prices are very fair, staff is really fast, and there's beautiful decor. My only complaint is that they don't have almond or lactose free milk for their coffee but it won't kill me"}
{"text":"Ça fait déjà plusieurs fois que nous allons manger à ce restaurant qui est tout près de chez nous. Il faut absolument goûter au poulet fumé, il est extrêmement savoureux! On y va aussi pour la pizza, cuite au four à bois. La St-Viateur est notre préférée. Le service est très amical et attentionné. Leur seul point négatif est de ne pas offrir de menu pour enfants, pourtant ils sont tout équipés pour les recevoir: chaises hautes, crayons à colorier..."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this great pizzeria in the heart of the plateau!  A true hidden gem...great for a romantic dinner for two or a night out with friends. In either case...this resto will not leave you disappointed. The resto has a beautiful wood oven located in the rear of the restaurant where one can watch the classic art of pizza making! Their pizza dough is one of the best dough's I have tasted in the city...one bite of their thin crust pizza will make you feel like you are in Italy. What makes their dough standout from other pizzeria's  is that they let it sit and rise for 24 hours which results in a beautiful light thin crust pizza. Service is great ...everydish served with a smile. Great selection of pizza toppings as well...very fresh. Can't forget to mention their amazing calzone's perfect for sharing!"}
{"text":"Pizza was what I was craving today and this restaurant was the place to go! I also found out that the chicken wings were to die for! They were smoked wings  with the right spices for my tastebuds! Bravo!!! Definitely a place to return to try other dishes. BTW, the owner came up and gave us a quick shout out and asked us how we liked our orders... That's personal"}
{"text":"Enjoy going to the restaurant. We go there as a family every few weeks.  Good atmosphere for families, friends out for dinner and drinks, couples... They serve great individual pizzas with fresh ingredients, grilled octopus and grilled chicken. The portions are generous and enough to share."}
{"text":"Started  with Supli. Wow! They were delicious! Unfortunately I had to share them!  Then we shared a delicious  pizza and even better pasta. The pizza choices  they have are all original and sound amazing. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them!  Lastly.. a most excellent  off menu desert of fried pizza dough with berries.   Absolutely  amazing!  I highly recommend this place. If you like to eat, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Being from New York City, it is very hard to find something that is simple yet tastes as fresh as moms home cooking. The owner walks over to every table and preparers everything fresh! If you stop in Montreal, definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious. A real hidden gem. The smoked chicken is definitely my favourite dish! The pizza is also excellent and very fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, 5 people in total.  We ordered several pizzas and they were all delicious.  I took some home and had it for dinner.  Service was quick and pleasant, I will def be going back again"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating at this restaurant is really adorable. You could choose to sit under the grapevines or right under the sun, either way the fresh flowers will brighten your day. The thin crust pizzas were pretty good and so was the fennel salad. The fries in the chicken platter were  little soggy and the mayo looked like it had been sitting around for hours in its dish. The spicy oil for the pizza was amazing. Overall, considering the reasonable prices, the lovely decor and friendly service,  I would have to say that this restaurant is worthy to try out for a nice casual dinner this summer."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. The restaurant has a home and cozy feel. The calamaris are pretty amazing and the chicken wings are there to compete. Great ingredients and dough make the difference for me. The menu features a few unconventional items you won't see in other pizzerias."}
