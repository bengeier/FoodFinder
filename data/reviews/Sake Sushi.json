{"text":"Great service, best sushi in Vaughan right now. The rock shrimp is amazing and the sashimi is cut thick and very fresh! You can order blindfolded and be very satisfied with anything brought to you"}
{"text":"This place is f*cking awesome!!! Great food, fast and friendly service. I almost cried from happiness..."}
{"text":"Definitely great quality in terms of freshness with raw and cooked dishes. Service is always friendly :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. Fresh.  Considering it's all-you-can-eat, the variety offered on the lunch menu was very extensive, better than other all-you-can-eat sushi places i've been to.  iPad ordering was a little impersonal, although very efficient. I would go back.  But I would warn that if you don't know your sushi very well, you'll have a hard time flagging down a server to answer questions because they are few and far between ( and don't seem particularly friendly :-) .  )"}
{"text":"Was there Saturday for lunch.   Excellent food.  Service was good.   Price was a little steep for lunch.   Would go back."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through this app. I got tired of the sushi at Akita sushi and wanted to try something new. Within minutes I knew that this was my new go-to for sushi in Woodbridge. This place has awesome food, reliable service and an easy i-pad menu to place orders. This place was absolutely delicious! I have been waking up in hot-sweats thinking about going again soon. A 5 star for sure!!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I was having an excellent experience at first, but by the time it was over I left with a somewhat sour taste in my mouth. 

I thought food was tasty, more so than some of the other sushi restaurants I've been to. The service was friendly and very quick. I was surprised how soon they brought our food out. The presentation was also nice. I would give this place 5 stars at this point, however there are some downsides. Towards the end the service declined. Each order was coming out cold (for the hot dishes) cut very thick to the point where it wasn't chewable, and just thrown together on the plate. We all got the feeling they wanted us to leave. We weren't there for a long time at all. Yet they asked us a few times if we want the bill. While we were still eating...and hadn't yet ordered dessert. At the end, the server was very pushy about paying with cash. They had a promotion going on where you get scratch cards/prizes for paying with cash. I told him 3-4 times that I did not have any cash and I want to pay by card. Eventually my friend paid for me & I won a cheap little glass statue."}
{"text":"Service isn't alls that great at this restaurant, however, the food is very tasty. Fish is fresh, presentation is outstanding. They don't have coat hooks, but you can hang your jacket on ur nipples; it's freezing in here!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT even think about ordering food for delivery!! An hour and ten minutes after I placed the order, and a promised delivery time of 45-60 minutes, I called to find out where the driver was....I was told he was only a few minutes away. I thought, ok, I'll give him a few more minutes. After an hour and a half, I called back, and confirmed again that they have they correct address. The woman who answered said she was going to call the driver. The driver called me directly and I could not for the life of me understand him. I was trying really hard to. I was really being nice. Finally I gave up. I told him not to worry about the delivery. I called the restaurant again and told them what happened and that after nearly two hours later I was no longer interested in the delivery. The driver finally arrived at the door laden with several bags But 5 minutes later. I told him that I had called the order off and unless it was free I wasn't interested. I was so fed up at this point. He called his boss and gave me the phone. The owner (I guess) offered me 20% off, then 30%. I said that wasn't acceptable and was polite to the driver but refused the order. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Best service of any AYCE sushi I've ever been too, kitchen was a little slow, but it was a Friday night and the restaurant was full. I had the tuna and the unagi sushi, which were excellent and the raindrop roll is a must try. 5/5 would come back"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and really liked the sushi. Sushi taste fresh and the service was good too. The price was standard. Will definitely do back"}
{"text":"Sake is an all around great dining experience. Some of the friendliest staff you can hope for, serving the freshest and carefully prepared Sushi and Sashimi. Delicious and fresh ingredients served creatively by amazing chefs and servers makes this one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Canada. Not to mention the all-you-can-eat menu is a great deal with all the favourites and some very unique and tasty house creations."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi at it's best!!! Great service & even better food.  We went for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon and will definitely be back in the near future.  Our bill came to $30 for two of us, and we left feeling very satisfied.  

Their rolls are full of ingredients with only a minimum amount of rice (yay for not filling up on rice!).  We really recommend their Spicy Salmon Rolls!  We also ordered a spicy beef udon soup that was very flavourful!  

** A previous reviewer stated that seaweed salad was not available for lunch, but it appears their menu has been updated and it is available now!! 

We definitely recommend this sushi place!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for lunch, all you can eat for $14.99 and the food comes fast! Amazing quality and everything we had tasted like heaven. Amazing spot, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good food and reasonable prices.
Staff is very polite which is a bonus, as I'm not used to the politeness from similar establishments"}
{"text":"Very good place. Just driving by and found this place . It was very clean and elegant comparing to other ayce sushi places. They brought the food so fast and cleaned up the table (finished plate) even faster. The food is very very fresh and delicious.  Try their breaded crab meat. And salmon belly . It's super tasty. Fair price too . Nice atmosphere.  Will go back for Sure."}
{"text":"Best local sushi.  I would die without a good sushi close by and it's the only one I go to after having tried them all.  Great all-you-can-eat as well...at a decent price."}
{"text":"This is my favourite AYCE sushi in the gta. The quality, variety and service is why I always come back. I've been here over 10 times and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Came her for lunch AYCE. The food is below average and mediocre at best. Don't even order the salad Bc it's just bad. First and last visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"First off I have to say the food was delicious. The reviews for this restaurant's food is bang on!

MY issue is totally related to the ambience and the service.
I arrived on a Sunday evening here and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. Not bad considering the lineup was easily an hour when we left. The problem is we were led to a filthy table and it remained that way for the entire meal.
After being seated we proceeded to wait for 15 minutes to be offered drinks and to take our food order.
Food came 10 minutes later and was great, however incomplete. They forgot to bring one of my items. I ordered it again and it had still not come an hour later. 

Servers were cold and barely acknowledge our existence. I have to say this is the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant.

Food is great but they need more staff and need training for that staff."}
{"text":"I tried out this AYCE sushi place in the winter, and I wasn't impressed. I went in December, and the place was about half full, but the service was very slow. We had to wait 45 minutes to receive our first order, and they didn't bring everything we ordered. They also brought us several things we didn't order. It just seemed disorganized. They also took forever to come around to refill our drinks. 

The food was nothing to go crazy over either. It was good, but some items were more bland than I'm used to. It was decent food though. 

There is a main room and a second floor with some seating, but it's somewhat crunched up there if you're in a group. 

I would go back, but I would choose other AYCE places in the area first."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has a 4.5+ rating, lovely food. A little on the pricier side as we went for the buffet but everything was very tasty. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The best AYCE place in the GTA; the cheese wontons are a must-try!"}
{"text":"Ohmgheee, this place has amazing service. They are sooo nice my sister and I absolutely loved it. The sushi was sooo good, and they presented your plate sooo well. Everything about this place is perfect, they deserve soo much success. I will admit the place is a little small but everything was fresh and tasted amazing. I recommend this place, way WAAY better than hockey shushi."}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I want sushi and a good selection of other food items, I head to Sake sushi. Their customer service is great, their prices are similar to other sushi buffets and their food is good.

I've never had to wait when I've gone (which is normally on a Sunday afternoon). All of their sushi is really good and fresh. I would stay away from items like their mango chicken and sweet and sour chicken. It just taste like a couple of condiments thrown in together. Other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite sushi place in Vaughan! The service is always friendly and the food always comes out at a reasonable time. 
The number of items to choose from in the iPad ordering menu is extensive. And their food is always fresh and tasty!
But make sure to make reservations during dinner time, because this place gets packed !"}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese food!! You get to choose as many items and see what they look like, you order from the tablet and they bring the food right to you! Very fast and friendly service. Delicious sushi rolls and you must get the black pepper beef, it melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"So today was the second time I come here because the first time experience was great. However, this time the service went down the drain. First, I had to ask three times for my tempura sauce, sashimi platter had no wasabi, then they were in such hurry that one girl spilled our soy sauce plate and didn't even apologize not giving us napkins to clean. Ran out of tea and asked three times and no tea was served. We ordered our eel pizza and it had a shrimp tail on it like someone spit it out by accident.Being able to have such good reviews on Yelp and no consistency in service level...2nd time here and probably my last time. Also, their sashimi wasn't fresh at all today so we didn't touch it barely, the server came to us and said she will charge extra $5 because we didn't finish. I told her that the sashimi wasn't fresh because the white fish areas were yellow and the mackerels were sour, she didn't even apologize and said what's wrong with the other fish and charged us still. I really didn't bother arguing because this is the last time and will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We come here often. Sushi is fresh and service is good and quick. Sashimi comes in good quantities and they bring you what you ask for!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are amazing! It's the perfect place to get your sushi craving satisfied! Easy to order from iPads and food comes fairly quick once ordered. I've been here twice and they only ever missed one dish order (which wasn't a big deal). Lunch pricing is also reasonable!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for an all you can eat sushi. 

We were very happy with the prompt and friendly service else. You can tell they take pride in their food and it's presentation. There is definitely effort in trying to be innovative and it is appreciated! Tons of variety. 

Now if we are not speaking in terms of \"for an all you can eat place\", there is definitely lots of room for improvement in terms of flavour for rolls and freshness of fish. But of course you really can't compare an all you can eat place, with something like Japango or JaBistro - they're just totally different caliber.  

Hence Sake gets 4-star, for an all you can eat."}
{"text":"I was craving  so I decided to give their lunch menu a try. I've been here before for dinner once and from what I recall, it was a pleasant experience.

Anyways, I guess I wasn't hungry as I thought I was bc I only ate about a round and a half of food before I called it a day. Maybe it was the food, but I just wasn't down for anymore sushi after my first order. The only thing that stood out to me were the sushi pizzas, everything else was mediocre. I normally stay away from the sushi pizzas, but they were surprisingly delicious here! 

The service was absolutely terrific. Attentive and friendly. What more could I ask for? Lol"}
{"text":"Came in for an early dinner to this AUCE sushi restaurant.  Like many of the AUCE sushi joints around Toronto, you can do just fine with the basic sushi though I always wish for better sashimi options.  The menu is also on a tablet with pictures of every option - nice.  I had good salmon flowers (not sure what they're called) and a nice spicy salmon roll.  I wish there were more roll options without anything fried and always wish more of these places offered mochi ice cream.  But what I had off the menu was good and seemed fresh.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"It's never a good sign when dessert was the best part at an ayce sushi joint. Do not recommend. 

Realistically I'd rather 2.5*, but their service was pretty good, so the servers deserve the bump to 3 stars. 

The place is tiny (about 12 tables?) - which isn't necessarily bad, but when you have mismatched furniture in the dining room and dirty chairs? And somewhat an eery vibe.

It certainly doesn't feel like an ayce joint, and not much of an atmosphere. Place was super quiet, even with a huge group.

Rolls, although there wasn't an excessive amount of rice, they were mediocre and cut in all different sizes.  Sashimi was 'aighttttt. Luckily we didn't come across frozen pieces, but there were a few mushy ones. 
All the 'grilled' apps were overly greasy, as if they were pan fried in a ton of oil. The Kalbi was TINYYYYY. 
The seaweed salad tasted off, and the spicy mayo was runny... Sigh.

Super disappointed after walking in CRAVING.


Side note/ we totally went to mcdonalds after."}
{"text":"The sashimi is really fatty which I liked. Prices are cheap for an AYCE. A great place to eat at in Vaughan. There aren't that many ayce sushi in Vaughan for a low price. Place is somewhat small but it is ok. Loud Asian music playing in the background."}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint. The only downside why I took off 1 star is the fact that they made us wait almost 30 minutes when we had made a reservation. I understand that the place is small and tight but what is the purpose of reservation when they couldn't honor it? 
Food wise, all were delicious (at least it made up for the waiting time spent). fast service! I Overall, I would definitely come back here again on my next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I am a very particular eater, and I'm an avid fine diner. I do not like going to ayce sushi, buffet, or anyplace with a hot table for that matter. But I went to Sake Sushi, kept an open  mind, and I must say IT WAS GREAT!! I will definitely go back and will definitely send friends. I recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was very bad which basically turned the entire night including the food experience into an unpleasant one."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that our latest experience here was subpar. The quality of the fish took a dive.

We had a reservation for 8pm, we arrived on time but they only sat us at 8:50pm. 

The fish was not fresh this time. Particularly the squid sashimi, octopus, and scallop sashimi. The scallops tasted frozen then thawed, tiny and tasted bad. The beef enoki roll was also very disappointing, especially because it's our party's favorite dish.

The food was really slow. We kept ordering things and certain items would not come, even if we reminded them. We had to keep asking for them. We had one party member who didn't eat fish and he ordered a bunch of chicken. It took so long to come. Everyone else was eating while he had an empty plate. Like 1.5 hours later, all of the chicken arrived at once.

Same for the tempura that we ordered at the beginning of the night only came 2 hours later. Our reservation was at 8 and we ended up coming out at 10:40. 

On the bright side, the summer icecream roll was good.

My advice for those wanting to come here is that they avoid dinner time on a Saturday (after 7:30pm) because it's just too busy."}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden spot.  My new fav place to eat sushi.  Service is rather quick even when we went on a busy night."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why the reviews are so good for this restaurant. I eat sushi regularly and I used to come to this location as a last resort, the sushi is very basic and there is not too much variety. I came one last time a few weeks ago and was even more disappointed that they had upped the price. Overall, an unpleasant experience and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for some time so I was happy to be able to come here and finally share a review with you guys as this place did not disappoint. 

We were seated promptly upon entering, and noticed the ipad ordering services they have going on here for efficiency. Their cold dishes were different than some of the other places I've been to for all you can eat sushi. The food was pretty good and we didn't feel rushed. They did, however forget a few items but nothing re-ordering can't rectify since it was all you can eat. Even just letting our server know, he never made any fusses about it and brought it to our table as quickly as possible.

It was a Friday lunch date, so this place was actually pretty packed, and we were still able to get seated at a nice corner booth pretty quickly. There were different kinds of ethnic backgrounds dining at this restaurant and it made me feel comfortable knowing that they have a diverse range of customers. Service was also on point and our server was one of the better ones - his attitude, friendliness and willingness to justify a missed dish was pretty good to me! Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi restaurant in the area. So much to choose from with the all you can eat and they also have a lunch special. It gets really busy after 7 on weekends."}
{"text":"We came out from Yorkdale mall area to see Sake Sushi, a 4 1/2 star place.  Really people? 4 1/2 stars?  For a dollar less, there are other places out there.  But having the beef and tuna tataki is a plus.

The food is alright.  
The ponzu sauce is used in too many of the dishes.

Is it just me or AYCE places has a tendency to have great service at the beginning but towards the end of the sitting, the service decline dramatically?!  Any way that's what I have experienced.   

Anyway... If you are in this area and you NEED your AYCE then give this place a try...."}
{"text":"My partner and I like Sake Sushi mainly for their lunch AYCE and their bento box take-out. The sushi is fresh, the cooked food is pretty good (the beef teriyaki is better than other AYCE places) and the dessert options are good (my faves are the tempura ice cream, fried bananas and mango pudding). I do think it's a little too pricey for dinner. The restaurant is nice and clean and the service is pretty quick, I also like being able to order with the iPads."}
{"text":"Ok so still new to this AYCE sushi concept here in Southern Ontario. But this Manitoban born and raised gal sure has no objections when it comes to AYCE at Sake Sushi.

Here with a friend one evening, we were greeted by a young woman who graciously allowed us to pick a booth in a quiet corner for our face stuffing event. Even the two men at the sushi making counter thing greeted us with hellos. My friend was pretty impressed by that alone as he is in the restaurant business as well.

Onto the sushi. 
Both of us are Sashimi fanatics and we were not disappointed. The fish was fresh, great quality and large pieces for an AYCE! 5/5 already!

We continued to try the Salmon and Tuna Sushi Pizzas which are to die for.
Bacon wrapped asparagus with a maple bbq dressing had my food-gasm explode!

The service was fast and very friendly, but it could also be the euphoric state we were in from all the deliciousness being devoured from between our chopsticks.

We definitely got our money's worth and I can't even remember all the things we ordered but it was all gone and we were deep in regret from the feeling of our bellies ripping at the seams, but as we rolled ourselves out of there we had nothing but great things to say about the food as we drove away holding back our sushi comas to come!

Definitely going back and it will be hard to beat this one."}
{"text":"What a gem hidden in the west end of Woodbridge. The sushi is fresh and there are very many unique dishes. Ordering is done by computer so that's always a plus in getting your food quickly and accurately. Friendly staff and prompt service."}
{"text":"Went here a year ago. The sashimi was terribly wet and tasted like the ocean, not like the fish itself. I almost threw up on the table because of the white tuna! TERRIBLE. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Very happy they developed the Ipad ordering system because I hated how we had to tell the waiters what we wanted before! That was the only thing i didn't like about this place glad to see the change. The food is amazing! The price is really good and the service is good too! One waiter in particular is adorable and i love him :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great menu and choices. Speedy service. Servers were efficient but could be more friendly. Amazing price."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite sushi restaurant I've been to and I've been to many in the GTA. Sake sushi has the freshest sushi and rolls. Their meat tastes great and I am absolutely in love with their General Tao and mango chicken. My favourite rolls are the mushroom tempura, shrimp tempura, and chicken teriyaki rolls. They're so crispy, seasoned great, and it basically melts in my mouth. This place is definitely worth the price. 
The service is great too. I'm greeted every time I walk in and the servers take their time to ask you if you need a refill of water or if we need anything else. They're service is sweet, unlike other sushi places. I recommend this place for everyone, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place has good quality sushi and fast service for an AYCE. The fish is fresh and rice is cooked properly. There are neither Green Dragon nor Salmon rose included in the lunch buffet. I really liked the mango salad and wasn't impressed by Rock and Roll maki. The salmon sushi was not delivered but got salmon avocado maki which was nice. If I am around this area I would visit here but won't make a dedicated  trip for it."}
{"text":"Pas mauvais, ca reste des sushis classiques. Ceci dit, pour le contexte. J'ai grandi avec une partie de ma famille d'origine japonaise. Ma mère, décédée depuis, tripait aussi sushis, moi moins, l'abondance j'imagine... Par nostalgie, j'ai commandé, en mémoire de ma mère.

Bref, pas mauvais mais classique"}
{"text":"I went to here for lunch. I though the food was extremely poor quality actually, unlike the rest of the reviewers here. The service was good, no complaints, and the food came out quickly, but the food itself is where this restaurant fails. Their sweet and sour chicken (i know, not a Chinese food place) felt like the sauce was straight out of a jar purchased from NoFrills. Also, for lunch, the menu is heavily restricted. I'm used to sashimi to be the restricted from the menu, but this place restricts some \"basic\" stuff. For example, seaweed salad (Wakame), short ribs, any premium rolls are all on the dinner menu only. Needless to say, I won't be trying this place again. My home location is in Markham, and there are some great AYCE sushi places there."}
{"text":"We've tried out this AYCE Japanese restaurant twice now and both with consistent experiences.  First dined here as saw it had higher reviews than another similar restaurant nearby.  We've been to the other one many times so I feel I can make a fair comparison.  Restaurant is modest-sized and menu seems a little less expansive.  You order from an iPad.  Sushi rolls are not loaded with rice so it's really true what the reviews say!  Beef sashimi was a popular one that our table ordered twice, never seen before.  I personally enjoyed the salmon belly as salmon is my fav and it's very omega3-fatty, lol.  A few items we ordered mysteriously never arrived but thankfully as we were stuffed by then.  Dessert options were a hit - deep fried milk is a must try!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Monday holiday. Before I went, I checked out their website. It said $13.99 for lunch weekdays, and $14.99 for weekends  no mention about holiday pricing.

When I asked the waitress about the pricing, she said it was $15.99 because it was a holiday. The pricing on their menu at the restaurant was $14.99/$15.99. so they really need to update their website.

The waitress was very friendly and nice - especially compared to other all you can eat places. The iPad menu was very user friendly. The sushi was surprisingly very good and fresh - one of the best I have had from all you can eat. 

However, the cooked foods were not good. I wasn't a fan of their tempura or their soups. Their beefs for their stir fry dishes were extremely tough and dry.

Overall, even though their pricing is quite high compared to their competitors, I would come back and just have the sushi, no cooked foods."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite sushi places. Great selection in soups salads appetizers noodles sashimi sushi hand rolls, you name it. Friendly staff. Food service was surprisingly very fast. Super delicious and amazing desserts. LOVE LOVE IT !!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for a lunch date with my friend who had cone from BC.  I think I finally found a great sushi spot with amazing all you can eat menu. The Food was fresh, delicious and service was promt and polite. A Beautiful restaurant, great for a date night! I will definitely be back with my hubby"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer... Sake sushi was awesome!

Hubby and I were in town for my cousin's wedding and Sake sushi was 3 minutes away from the hotel we were staying at.  I never turn away an AYCE sushi restaurant, so we put the address in the GPS and off we go.

We are used to the \"check off sheets\" at most AYCE places, you check off what you want to order and hand the paper to the wait staff and wait for your food.  At Sake, there is a whole menu book full of AYCE items.  The wait staff puts in your orders on an ipad, which was very convenient.  All the food came out with a very presentable appeal, which not a lot of restaurants care since it's AYCE.

Sushi was fresh, excellent selection of sashimi and sushi.  I find it strange that red tuna was the more rare item, in the US red tuna would be included in a lot of the basic entree, but I noticed in Canada you need to pay extra to get red tuna in your meals.  They also have an amazing dessert selection, which I wish I got more room in my stomach to try.  The price was $22.99 CAD for weekend dinner, how can you beat that price??"}
{"text":"I really like this place ! I thought it was very good and the sushi was probably the freshes sushi I actually ever had. The food had great tastes... lunch $15.95. Little pricey.  Ordered on the iPads and they said they open 11:15 but they didn't get three till 11:16 and we didn't start getting food still 11:40 but still very good

Also. Right now if you pay cash , 2 lunch 1 dinner. You get a scratch ticket... today I won free dinner. They looked so surprised like they have never seen a winner haha."}
{"text":"Love love this ayce sushi, portions are great. They don't stuff a lot of rice and everything is fast and fresh. Really love the service and the place is always pack, which means it's popular hot spot."}
{"text":"Cheap at twice the price.  Very large selection. Dinner all you can eat 24 cAD out the door. Excellent service and speediness.  Some dishes a bit sweet which should not be.  Ate here 2 nights in a row!"}
{"text":"Great cheap place for AYCE sushi. I've come here a handful of times and the service is pretty consistent, and fast which is always a plus.

The quality of the sashimi is kind of hit or miss, but that can be said about a lot of cheaper AYCE places. Besides the raw fish, everything else has been pretty consistent as well. 

The restaurant itself is relatively small, so when it gets busy you may be put on the second floor. The top floor is not really an ideal setting - a bit of a cramped space with room for about 4-5 small parties."}
{"text":"This spot has raised the bar for sushi in Vaughan. Overall, the experience was great. I went with my girlfriend - who has never experienced all you can eat sushi. She was blown away at the quality and variety of dishes available in the all you can eat. 

The menu has salads, soups, maki and sushi (of course), deserts and other great items. The maki was very good, of an excellent quality.

Service was friendly and quick. Our drinks were being constantly refreshed. The atmosphere was very relaxing, romantic and cozy. The place smelled nice as soon as you walked in! 

We went around dinner and the place quickly filled up with hungry people. Obviously, this place was popular before we got there. 

This place is recommended for sure."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim one day because I wanted all you can eat sushi.  I had a few pieces of sushi, a spicy seafood roll, a hand roll, grilled salmon belly and some desserts.  

The sushi and spicy seafood roll were delicious.  The fish was super fresh and the spicy seafood roll had a good kick to it.  As for the desserts, WOW-WE! I loved the red bean paste puff as it came out nice, hot and flaky.  They also had an interesting dessert called tempura ice cream, which was kind of cool.  It wasn't hot, but inside the ice cream was a nice crunch. It was different.  

Also, service was great as they came by every 10 minutes or so to check on you and as you finish your last place, they ask if you want a 2nd order.

Verdict: A nice little place with great service, ample varieties of sushi/maki (some of which are a bit different than the usual) and great desserts for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi spot 

Is conveniently located right off of highway 407 and highway 7 and is one of the best AYCE menus I have seen. 

The ipad ordering if a huge plus as if you frequent AYCE sushi spots you know they more often than not forget to bring certain selections, not a problem here

If you want to know what is in certain roll just ask for the hardcopy menu as it has description (did not find out until my 2nd visit)

If you are one of those who is not the biggest sushi or sashimi fan never fear their cooked food menu is actually quite expansive and good..the chilean fish and mango chicken were two of my favorties

All I can say is, if you like Sushi and live in North York, Brampton or Vaughan you owe it to yourself to try this gem"}
{"text":"We came here with no reservation, I know...how could we just walk in... *sarcasm* The server was super accommodating and we just waited around 10 mins for a table to be set up. It was during the weekday so not very busy, there is seating on the patio outside as well. Party of 6 we got seated in a nice comfy booth. They do ordering by iPad mini here, and it was great. The service was awesome here, the servers made sure our cups were always full. Never had to ask. They offer a great selection of different dishes, and sashimi too. They were generous pieces and the spider roll was very good. Ordering with the iPad was so easy, didn't have to wait for the server to confirm it-it was sent to the kitchen asap. They have a great selection of desserts also, trying deep fried milk for the first time and it was ah-maz-ing. I can't believe we've never had it until now, it is pretty life changing. This sushi place is one of my favourites now, definitely will be back next time we're in that area. After being disappointed by all you can eat sushi places back here it's very refreshing to visit a restaurant that is so efficient and accommodating. Prices are the same as most weekday dinner sushi places."}
{"text":"This place had terrible service the first time I went, the second time I didn't receive my food till the end & this time I waited 30 minutes to ask what's going on? They than put my order through. Decent food but terrible service"}
{"text":"This place is cheap!
However service is poor!
Place is not well insulated!
Only cold water in the washroom and cold air to dry your hands, washroom is freezing!
The maki rolls are made in advance.... they pour different sauces on top of everything.... you order by IPad... in the picture it has no sauce... so by the time you get it it is too late!
Basically everything taste like one sauce or the other.... we had all you can eat dinner and they only had vanilla ice cream... on a Friday night!
Not worth the time .... I was frozen by the end of the meal!
Will not return!"}
{"text":"The food here actually wasn't too bad. The rice was a bit off, but overall status quo for AYCE sushi. The reason why I'm giving this such a low rating is due to the service. The server came around every 10 minutes or so and told us to finish pieces so he could take the plates, as if they were running out of clean plates (which was not the case). It was as if they were trying to rush us out of the restaurant. And right after dessert was brought out, he brought our receipts and asked if we wanted to pay right now. We barely just got into our ice cream. And he continued to come back and hover until we paid. That's not the kind of restaurant I want to be in, so if you're looking to enjoy your food and the company you're with, then I do not suggest this place."}
{"text":"Sake Sushi is an acceptable and passable option for AYCE in Woodbridge, but I wouldn't come out of the way to come here if you're going to (especially if you're from the east end).

We came here for a late lunch on a weekday and it was fairly quiet. The first thing I noticed was that it was so unsuspecting from the outside, and the inside is fairly underwhelming, but gets the job done. It's in a random plaza and isn't facing the main street, so keep your eyes peeled!

Overall quality is passable and they have a wide variety of items on their menu. You use an iPad and the ordering process is simple. Some standouts were there spicy rolls here! Especially the spicy salmon gunkan sushi, there was no breadcrumbs and the spicy mayo had a nice kick to it. I found that all the nigiri sushi was good here; the fish wasn't too small and the rice wasn't a huge clump. In addition, their hand rolls were loaded all the way to the bottom and wasn't packed with rice. The maki and special rolls here were average here but I wish there was a better selection. We did experience a slight reduction in the amount of items as the meal went on but that was fine because we were getting quite full as well. But overall they gave you what you ordered and the items came out really quickly! Overall service was quick and efficient, water was filled often, and the value was fair. It's not a bad option in Woodbridge for AYCE sushi!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday evening and were promptly seated. Based on the reviews I was excited to try this place. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the quality of the food items. 

After sending our order to the kitchen on the iPad ordering system, the food came quickly. However, it was clear that a number of items had been prepared far in advance. The seaweed salad came dry and the small bowls they came in very cold, so they'd been siting in the fridge that way for an extended amount of time. The cheesecake was frozen solid and we had to wait for it to thaw before being able to take a bite.

The sashimi was good, especially the salmon, which were thick pieces. The beef sashimi was sold out and we were only told so when I asked if it was still coming. I had to ask after a few other items that were missed as well. Overall the service was good and attentive. When I asked about the missed items, they brought them out quickly. Water was refilled regularly. 

Parking is found outside on the lot."}
{"text":"Impromptu date night :) We really enjoyed this place! Sake Sushi is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall beside a gas station."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place. It was wonderful. Great food and friendly service. Very busy but food is delivered quickly and is delicious.  Pay the one price and eat all you want. Order a little at a time via iPad."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and modern decor. Uses iPad ordering system which is great! Service was OK. One server was on top of everything while the others were slow and often forgot to bring things we asked for such as wasabi and napkins.

Food was really good! Sushimi tasted very fresh and they have a good variety of rolls to choose from. Their hot food was really good too. Beef ribs, fried udon, baked mussels, and pan fried dumping were all good. The California salad was very tasty. Try the sesame ball for dessert! 

Note: Deep fried milk may sound good but tasted literally like nothing. Like skim milk cooked with tons of corn starch into a thick block then breaded and deep fried. Don't waste your time. Also the \"cheesecake\" is actually coconut cream pie frozen like no tomorrow. We're talking rock hard frozen. Go with ice cream, fried banana, or sesame ball instead."}
{"text":"Our go to place for pick to order food. Food is consistently tasty, hot and freshly made straight from the kitchen. Sushi is fresh and not just an overzealous roll of rice. The only time we haven't had a great meal was when it was crazy busy inside and we got 2/4 of our ordered food. It will not set us back from going back though! Looking forward to our next dinner there!"}
{"text":"This was our go to sushi spot for me and my co workers. The price was good, sushi delicious. But all of a sudden they don't deliver to our location anymore, which is a hospital. Called once for delivery and the lady that picked up said that the driver called in sick and that there will be no deliveries. Called again an hour later thinking that reasoning was ridiculous the lady said the driver just didn't want to deliver to our location. Instead of giving us an explanation why they make up crazy excuses."}
{"text":"In the broader world of sushi, I would certainly go again if I was in Vaughan and needed a sushi fix.  The Asian community is not nearly as strong as in Markham and Richmond Hill, so I can agree with 5 star ratings within Vaughan, but if you compare on a wider scope, Sake is clearly behind Markham/RH.

Ordering off of an iPad means the uninitiated will have a picture to reference, and the menu sorted in categories.  For the experienced, it is handy, and the real benefit is having a more responsive ordering system.

In general, all of the sushi choices I had were a bit light on fish, compared to the amount of rice.  As with many AYCE joints, the emphasis is to get a lot of carbs built into the item.  Flavours were pretty good, and there is enough variety to keep everyone happy."}
{"text":"Best sushi place for all you can eat and bento box. 

I used to work near by ,  twice in a week I take out the teriyaki salmon bento box. 
They give enough food for 2 person. healthy food. 

Beef rib bento box is good too. 

Our office parties usually held there. All you eat sushi. Every thing is super tasty.   
California roll, tempuras everything is good. 

I will recommend this place for everyone if you want a sushi treat."}
{"text":"Good food, better service than other places similar to this style. Many choices on the menu, and the price is fair. The environment is nice as well- very clean."}
{"text":"Personally, not a huge fan of AYCE, and this was not the best place for it. I mean, it was okay. The sushi is what you would expect from a typical AYCE restaurant. They had all the usual options. They don't have free refills. The usual favourites (unagi, and spicy salmon) were surprisingly hard to find in their menu. Also, the environment was okay. They don't have a lot of space so for our party of 8, they had to have a makeshift long table. 

They did let us bring our own cake for my buddies bday, so that was nice of them. Come to think of it, the servers were really nice."}
{"text":"Sake Sushi is a small all you can eat place that (by its clientele) seems popular among college students. The menu items are unique, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy all you can eat sushi. Lots of great maki rolls, the rock shrimp is great too. There is a weird summer dessert roll for dessert I recommend staying away from because when I ate it all the ice cream melted in my mouth and the rice wrapper didn't so it was the oddest texture and was unpleasant to eat. The sesame balls were so fresh and warm, I'd highly recommend ordering those along with the fried milk for dessert. All in all this is a really great sushi place. I hear it can get busy so reservations are a good idea. We went for an early dinner at around 4:30pm on Saturday so we had no problem. This was my second visit and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Tried a bunch of different sushi rolls and fell in love with this place. I'm not a big sushi guy but they made me want to come back. Big variety of options and for a reasonable price you can eat all the sushi you want. Our waitress didn't explain the ordering process at all but it was easy to figure out. Just pick out what you want on the iPad and send in the order. Boom! Food on the table and chopsticks in hand. Excellent job Sake Sushi!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend on a Saturday. It was not full, but there was a couple of tables with people. 
One thing I can say is the food is great (little less rice would have been preferred), but the service is extremely slow. 
We were waiting around for sushi for a long time, but when it did come, it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is my new spot for sushi. Best place in Woodbridge which is full with fastfood places. 
I totally surprised since such a good place is hidden in the plaza. I think most of customers are local residents who live around.
I don't have any complain about this place. In general, they are pretty deserve 4.5 ( i kinda round my points up). Waiters are pretty polite and they keep checking on us. 
Pretty trendy and modern design with big fancy chandelier. We ordered by ipad and the food came pretty quick.
Sashimi is fresh which I love about this place. This is only place actually present their dishes as its best. Most of places they don't pay much attention on presentation. When I eat here, I feel like it's a a la crate restaurant but not AYCE. 
For dessert, I recommend to call summer roll. It's icecream rolled by paper roll. This is first time I eat such creative and tasty dessert like this. 
I think owner should have bigger banner outside of the plaza so more people pay attention and come to this place."}
{"text":"Recently, I've been staying away from all you can eat sushi places, but this was on the way home.  My girlfriend ate from the al a carte menu but I decided to stick with all you can eat.  I must say, I've had better even from an all you can eat place.  It wasn't bad, I've just had better.  The wasabi also tasted \"cheap.\"  I also assumed they forgot about one thing I ordered (that's Ok, it happens).  So I ordered it again and waited so long that I finally just gave up on waiting.
I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Went with a group. Very fast service. Quality isn't great, so I recommend sticking to the cooked items and rolls and avoid raw. The rock n roll rolls was a hit with our group, as was the general tso chicken."}
{"text":"It's sushi..... Kind of hard to fcuk up sushi. So just get it right. Which they generally do except for one thing.

It's good, been here twice. Only complaint is there actual level of education. They give you an iPad to order ... So let's break this down. 

1. press button to order item 
2. Item gets delivered 

Asians, you're good at math and creating stuff and being innovative and all that BS. Both times I've ordered stuff that doesn't get delivered ..... 

Can build a rocket ship but can't drive it.

{"text":"Food is decent
Service is so-so

iPad ordering makes it easier to get your food ordered

I go here once every 4-8 weeks... decent overall."}
{"text":"Sake is one of my favourite places to go for sushi! It's always fresh and really flavorful, the restaurant is decorated nicely, it's a little small but cozy and it never gets busy to the point where the servers overlook you, price is great, a little below the average price for woodbridge sushi (average for me is about 23-25 dollars I believe sake was 20 per person?) but quality is excellent! 
And now I'm hungry! Sake here I come!"}
{"text":"Great place eat without having to drive too far. Still not as good as New Generation Sushi in Vaughan but a good runner up.

They have a wide variety of items and all items have a picture so you can see what you are ordering which is great.

Nice and clean, service has always been good when I went. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting GTA with family for a weddings, and we need to find food the kids would eat. 
We went on yelp and found this place, and honestly for the price and value it was top notch. I wish they were down in Texas... you order in a tablet and the food is out to you within 5 mins such a cool concept when done properly.
Excellent place with quality food and service."}
{"text":"I feel like they're not many sushi options let alone good options when you reach this part of town. What I enjoy about Sake is their expansive AYCE menu, even during lunch hours. I'm a salmon guy and their salmon is better and more fresh than most places. The problem I usually have at AYCE sushi places is that service is very inconsistent and slow, even at the higher end places. I've never had that issue at Sake, typically when you send your order through the iPad, food items quickly roll out of the kitchen immediately.  At this low price point the only other sushi place I can think of is Kyoto Sushi in Downtown Toronto, and Sake definitely blows them out of the water."}
{"text":"My go to sushi restaurant when I don't feel like driving to J-town or Toronto.

This is a great AYCE sushi place. The menu is pretty extensive and pricing is great. The food is delicious and fresh and I've always left satisfied  (although there has been a time or two I've left feeling the food was subpar). They do iPad ordering here which is great because it gets rid of the hassle of handing in a paper every time you wanna make another order.  Service is decent,  nothing amazing. Food is prepared and brought out really fast.

Some of my favourite dishes to order:
- any udon dish; their udon is made and ptrpared really well and they give generous amounts of veggies and meats with it
- the handrolls; the ingredients are proportioned really well without the roll being over or underwhelming to eat
- miso soup; it's not salty!!! 
- their entire dessert menu; a lot of sushi places only have ice cream, at sake they have ice cream, pudding, cake, pastries, and deep fried ice cream. They're desserts are sooooooo good. I usually order about 5 rounds of desserts and it's never a problem.

This is a great place if you're craving sushi but don't wanna spend much or drive far. The atmosphere is great for hanging out with friends. I probably go here every month or so."}
{"text":"Fav new ayce !
Good price
Good food
Amazing staff and service! 
Ipad ordering is better than checking off with pencil and paper
I love everything about this place, kind of small but cute.
Could use some updated decor but who cares, the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a birthday party and I have to say my socks were blown. I dont normally agree to going to sushi buffets because consuming large quantities of sushi tends to make me feel like puking. 

The other reason I tend to avoid sushi buffets is because I come in expecting lower quality sushi. This was all out of the window today when we came in - all of the sushi had proper proportions, meaning they didnt stuff the sushi with lots of rice! They even offered spicy mayo for everyone!

Some of the dishes that really stood out to me besides the sushi and sashimi were: 
- mango salad ( loved the mango sauce) - this could be used as a dessert
- Kalbi beef ribs ! (So good!)
- Grilled mushrooms 
- tempura green tea ice cream ( this is like fried ice cream!)

The waiter with the blonde hair did an amazing job today with climbing all the stairs and making sure we have water and food at all times and the food came instantly once the order was sent thru the ipad. Near the end of the night, he noticed that some of us may not be able to finish all of the sushi that was pending in the order and offered to reduce the incoming order which we GREATLY appreciated.

At the end of the night, they let customers who paid by cash have a chance at scratching for a prize! I won a free dinner and several others won small prizes which I felt was really sweet. 

Overall I cannot recommend this place enough. The location is incredibly far which is my only concern about coming here but I feel like its obviously worth the trip.

Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5. 

The restaurant is not much on the inside and they provide you a printed menu, but what is prepared is decent sushi in a town full of expensive overpriced sushi.  Here it was 20 pieces for $14.95?  Am I in Vancouver with this pricing?  No I'm in the east end!  Sure 8 of those pieces were 4 tekka maki (cucumber) and 4 (avocado) but the rest were decent in size and quality!  

Speaking with the staff they were super friendly and so this is why I bumped it up half a star.  

Restaurant is not your fine dining sushi experience but for a quick sushi or takeout it's more than acceptable.  

In Montreal I have found the sushi of lower quality and hard to find anything excellent (that's not super expensive).  Sushi Shop, Yuzu, Suhi Taxi and all the other chains bore the hell of me.  I'd put this a leg up on those chains but cheaper!"}
{"text":"For an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, this place is great. Most of the staff are helpful and actually quite decent. Everyone works quite hard and the food is great. Sashimi is really good too. Rolls aren't full of rice like most places, and the soda, unlike some other places is not bottomless... However it is quite cheap and always cold. For actual Coke/Coke Zero cans it's only around $1-1.50 a can. That's quite cheap! 

Place is always clean, and unlike other sushi places *cough* Makimono *cough* they actually care about their customers and are never rude.

My favourite all-you-can-eat restaurant in York region, and one of the top in the GTA."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area! The place has limited seating so you might have trouble finding a spot on Friday and Saturday nights. The food is fresh and they have a wide variety. The service is great and the prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"Not bad for all you can eat sushi they got tablets here which were pretty cool just like kaka for all you can eat sushi it wasn't bad. The spicy salmon and especially the hand rolls were delicious and the green tea once cream was really good as well. My favourite is the ice cream especially green tea. Overall the experience wasn't bad I ate to much but everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened and its my go to AYCE sushi place! Food and service are always good! Food is tasty and fresh. Have taken multiple people here and all enjoyed it.
Have also ordered takeout but much better value is you do ayce"}
{"text":"Great sushi joint, not too much tempura or avocado in the spicy crab, reasonably priced and good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good, quick food. We had AYCE for dinner, which we ordered from a tablet placed at our table. Food came out quickly. Overall, the food was really good. Loved the mango salad - it was fresh. The veggie spicy California roll was really tasty. The mango ice cream was delicious. I really liked the extensive veggie options this restaurant had. 

Couple of things that irked me were: 
(1) they put the veggie sushi and the meat sushi on the same platter without informing us. We didn't know and had to ask (see next point); and 
(2) service wasn't the best - pretty non-communicative. Example: We asked the server delivering the sushi platter to our table about the sushi on it. She was very unclear and was rushing. We then asked if it was all meat? She replied yes and quickly walked away. Obviously, this wasn't true since my veggie sushi had not arrived and we subsequently discovered that they had served the veggie and meat sushi together. They did prepare a veggie plate for me once we informed the server."}
{"text":"The outside of the restaurant looks a little sketchy, but the inside is fairly clean and appealing. There are not that many menu items (we went for lunch), but the food quality was okay. You can tell the salmon is not fresh, but the other dishes were good, especially the eel. The mango ice cream and mango pudding were both delicious. The main problem in this restaurant are the servers. There were two women and a man waiting on the entire restaurant. One of the women completely lacks any customer service skills, the other woman was a mediocre server who rarely dropped by, and the guy was a fairly good waiter. The overall atmosphere  was okay until one of the waitresses yelled at a table for talking too loud. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to a friend, as for 2 more dollars you could go to 168 buffet which has way more menu items and a much better atmosphere. If you do decide to go to this restaurant I don't recommend going with a large group as there is only one large seating arrangement (as far as I observed). A group of 4-6 is okay, anything larger would be a problem."}
{"text":"The best AYCE Japanese restaurant in Toronto. They served good maki and rolls.Not to mentioned they provided various option for desserts. My friends and I had a good time and we definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is just too good. The iPad ordering system is brilliant. It's probably the reason why everyone loves going here."}
{"text":"I give Sake Sushi a 4.5
I've been to many AYCE sushi places, especially in Vaughn & only place I would give slight edge to is Masa Sushi who gave 5 too cause there both great but masa's cheese wontons are amazing. Sake is great sushi place the service was great, really friendly staff.  Had a server but each time any servers went by would take my order or get me another drink if needed. The sushi is delicious well cut melt in your mouth sashimi & the deep fried valcano rolls are amazing. If your looking for great sushi experience I would definitely recommend Sake Sushi!!"}
{"text":"Yummy AYCE! But I've been here on several occasions and it's not the best place for sashimi. I usually have the tuna and salmon. I feel like tuna almost always tastes great, but at times their salmon sashimi is more on the slightly slimy side. It's also not as cold as I feel like it should be at times, definitely not the greatest, compared to the other AYCE sushi within its neighbourhood. Everything else though, tastes reaaaal good and there are a ton of delicious options to choose from, love the easy ordering and pictures of food."}
{"text":"C'est une évidence. En matière de cuisine japonaise, Saké Sushi ne réinvente pas la roue. Ce restaurant, tenu par une famille vietnamienne, vous sert des sushis bon marché préparés avec du riz un peu trop collant. Chez Saké, on vous sert les grands classiques du genre, ni plus, ni moins. Le menu n'a rien d'original. Il ne faut donc pas y chercher quelque chose de nouveau, car vous serez déçu. 

Le décor est à l'image de la nourriture, c'est-à-dire banale. On se passerait bien des frigidaires Pepsi alignés près du comptoir et de l'éternelle formule « servez-vous » lorsque vient le temps de choisir une boisson gazeuse. À mon arrivé, la plupart des tables n'avaient pas encore été nettoyées des assiettes sales des clients précédant. Point positif : le service est courtois et très rapide le midi. Les prix sont convenables. 

Saké Sushi ne s'imposera jamais comme un grand resto de cuisine japonaise. Disons plutôt qu'il s'inscrit dans le registre des places à éviter si l'on désire vivre une expérience gastronomique. Mais si vous êtes pressé et désirez manger des sushis ordinaires et à bas prix, cet endroit est pour vous."}
{"text":"Decent food with avg pricing that goes with all you can sushi restaurants.  The staff are friendly and accommodating.  

One thing though, try not to go there when it's busy (height of lunch Hr).  They have have a hard time getting the orders on time or forget who ordered what."}
{"text":"This be the sushi place to go when in the area because not only do they have cute green dragon rolls(I could fit 3 in my mouth), they've got some deep fried varieties rolls that is sure to kick up the taste granted you load up on wasabi for the zinger.

Service was fast and friendly, they seem to work as a team so if you're server is caught consoling other costumers demanding more ginger, another one is more than happy to ask you for the what the hell you want...or they point to the ipads where you can place orders genuinely showcasing their lack of interest in human interaction.

Hey that's okay as long as the grub is good and that it was. I'm gonna have to come back to try more of the items out and with an even hungrier appetite and maybe steal hubby away from the kids to save a trip to the washroom because there is no baby changing section available (fyi moms) and you get a cold draft in there like you're taking a peepee in an igloo.

Will update soon on more when I take a trip back."}
{"text":"This place was really great until we ordered a bunch of their rolls. They look amazing but had this sweet sauce poured over everything. You couldn't taste anything. Not winning sake sushi."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst sushi I have ever had.... it literally was wet. They also tried to charge me an additional 8$ as I couldn't finish what I ordered due to how horrible it was. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch finally! After driving past for years, I made it inside. I was not disappointed...I loved every bite. 
Service was fast and pleasant. 
I really like the AYCE concept here, it makes me more open to trying new things. I had tempura veggies, teriyaki beef and chicken, tempura tofu, dumplings, and of course the sushi (red dragon roll & dynamite roll). Everything was delicious, I am already planning on coming back again soon..I need to save room for dessert next time!"}
{"text":"Probably the best AYCE Japanese restaurant I've tried so far. Impressed with the number of items you get to choose from during lunch. Plus, everything we've tried tasted above average!

Costs only $13.99 per person (drinks not included but hot tea is) and they already have IPAD for ordering purposes.

Theres a variety of options for desserts too. Again, so impressed and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here over two dozen times. It's always consistently good and sometimes amazing. 
The variance for that is always the odd chewy piece I find in my sashimi which is out of their control in my opinion.  Super tasty, fresh and awesome service!. 

Maybe theyre nicer to me cause I frequent so often but I'm surprised to see the odd negative
service review. One of the servers there specifically is hilarious.  I ordered Shitake Sushi and he shook his head and laughed at me. We both had a good laugh but I said I had to try for curiosity sake.

The owner is a hard worker and is often out on deliveries"}
{"text":"I've been to Sake Sushi numerous times and each one was a pleasant experience. The all you can eat menu is quite extensive, fresh and not too expensive. My only gripe was the ordering method, all verbal which led to confusion.  But they recently started using an iPad with a special app which makes the process a breeze."}
{"text":"We were craving for sushi and this place is close to home so we decided to give it a try. 4 stars for the menu selections, 3.5 stars for food and 3.5 stars for service. This place is more Asian fusion than authentic classic Japanese. For the price of $25/person (before taxes and tips) on a Sunday night, I guess i can't complain"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. The service is on point. The fish is fresh, the tempura icecream is worth the visit alone.

The mango chicken, sweet and sour chicken, are the main reasons why I go to this place. 

The only con I found about this place if you go there exactly at 8pm... you wont get a table."}
{"text":"Writing a review while waiting for dessert. Everyone is so nice here! Food was yummy my fave spider was super good the mussels were good salmon and mackerel were good everything was fresh. Everything was fast no complaints here and they actually have chocolate ice cream this is very rare!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening and were promptly seated . I came here based on the positive reviews but my expectations were not met at all. 

All the orders are done through a mini Ipad system. Once we ordered the food came very quick.  Too quick in my opinion. We ordered miso soup, beef dumping soup, a hand full of different rolls, spring rolls, and nigiri. The rolls did not look very appetizing and were badly put together.It seemed all the rolls were covered in this generic sweet sauce that over powered everything.  It seemed pushing out the food is their number one priority rather then quality.The soups were very bland and the spicy mayo that we requested 3 times smelled and tasted very bad, as if it was not stored properly in the fridge. 

 I was also very disappointed in the lack of sashimi. Some items that are very commonly ordered were hard to find, such as unagi nigiri. Another major let down was that pop was not included in the buffet. There was a extra charge $1.25 for a coke. 

Overall, for $24.99 for a dinner buffet, i was very disappointed. I do not understand how this place had so many positive reviews."}
{"text":"It's decent if you eat inside.  But don't get takeout or plan to wait long.  Took 45 min when lady said it would take 20."}
{"text":"We came her for dinner tonight. And it was flawless as usual. We come here at least once a week and so far have not had a bad experience. Food and service are always fantastic. It's usually very busy on the weekends so we avoid it. But week nights are quite. The food is fresh. It's always brought out very quickly and the order is always correct. They have the iPad ordering system which is great as you can see exactly what you are ordering. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to several different AYCE sushi places in and around this area and I have never been as pleased as my experience here. Many differnet options you don't see regularly like deep fried maki rolls, mango chicken and many more.

Loved the ambience of the restaurant, service was fast and frequent. Nothing bad to say about this place. Can't wait to come back.

Ps. their spicy mayo is the spiciest I've had!"}
{"text":"This place is literally 5 minutes from my house and is the yummiest all you can eat sushi in Woodbridge!

Make sure you have reservations because even with reservations you might have to wait! The place is extremely small and only had a few waiters. There's even an upstairs but I feel bad watching all the girls run up and down the stairs with all that food! 

I love it because it's all you can eat sushi and also has some Chinese food options as well! 

I'd recommend everyone try the cheese wontons OMG SO GOOD! I never seen anything like this before! I can eat at least 6 or more! YUMMM!!"}
{"text":"This place is nice on the inside. The service is like all other sushi places the servers just bring food and the bill and don't say much. But they were friendly when asking us for drinks. Came here for lunch today. The sign on the front of the store says 150 options or something to choose from but the lunch menu was bare minimal. There wasn't much to choose from at all for lunch (not sure what the dinner menu is like). Anyhow I don't think i'd come back but it's not bad for the price."}
{"text":"I liked Sake sushi! M and I came here for dinner. He had the AYCE and I had food from the a la carta menu. I like that they offered choices other than avocado and cucumber rolls. They have a spicy avocado roll which was delicious! I let them know that I didn't want any mayo on the first roll I ordered (yam and avocado) and when I ordered my second roll, the server or cook double checked that there is no mayo (awesome!!)
M had ordered off the iPad menu and something didn't come out, so we double checked (after we paid) and we waited for what must have been another 10 mins and it still didn't come out. We just picked up and left."}
{"text":"Love this place, small but cozy, fresh sushi and lots of variety, great and fast service, been here 3 times already and plan to come back many more"}
{"text":"50th REVIEW WHAT WHAT!! 

Came here the other day because I was craving sushi and in the neighborhood (my boyfriend got a new job nearby). I went on Yelp and pressed nearby and this was actually the first thing to come up! And you can never go wrong with a 4 star rating!!

The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant was PACKED! There was only one table left for us! As annoying as a packed restaurant can sometimes be, it's a good indicator of whether or not it's good. It was an AYCE restaurant and had ipad menus. Everything came super fast and they didn't miss anything like a lot of AYCE places tend to do. The staff were SUPER FRIENDLY!!! Like amazingly friendly. Were very consistent with filling up our water, we never had to ask and constantly came and asked how the food was. My favourite was definitely the spicy crab roll.

The bill for 2 of us was very close to $30 meaning 15 each on top of tax- very reasonable! I feel like a lot of AYCE lunches end up costing 20 or over with all the taxes and charges and blah blah blah.

Great place and I'll definitely be back!!

Also I know I usually post pictures but I was so into the food I forgot to take!! :P"}
{"text":"Came here cause it was close to my house and had a 4 .5 star rating... Yelp tricked me again. I forgot all the sushi places in vaughan are rated a star higher than what they should be... :( Anyway first thing i noticed was the atmosphere. Like a hole-in-the-wall bar. A bit cramped and busy.  Didnt mind it. They have an upstairs where we were seated. That i kind of minded. Atleast there was a tv. 
They have an ipad ordering system.. surprise! I dont get why people are so hyped about this.. they have it everywhere. There was a lot on the menu as advertised but limited variety if that makes any sense.. its like how many different dishes can you make with salmon, cream cheese avacado and tempura bits? Jokes aside food was decent and the tataki, although there was only beef and tuna, realllyyy good. I just wished they eased up on the tempura bits, eel sauce and spicy mayo. Like 80% of their rolls were drenched in sauce. Happy eating :)"}
