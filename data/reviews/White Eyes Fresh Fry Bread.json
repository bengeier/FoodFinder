{"text":"Just found this place this weekend. I was SO happy to find a fry bread place in the north west valley. The place is clean, the prices were reasonable and the girl working the counter was very nice. 
I am going to be eating here again :) I had the vegetarian and my husband had the crane asada - both were fresh and fast. :)"}
{"text":"This was the nastiest fry bread I have ever eaten. The bread was very greasy, wasn't fluffy and the beans looked and tasted like they were from the can. If you like fresh food this isn't the place for you. Save yourself the disappointment and your money."}
{"text":"It was okay.  I probably won't return.  I had the carne asada fry bread and the meat had a lot of gristle.  The bread itself had no crisp which Is my personal preference and the beans were tasteless. The salsa tasted like mere tomato sauce.  The place on 7th is way more authentic and tasty.  
That said, the portion is big enough for two to share and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Just tried this place. I had the Indian Taco. The food was on the bland side. I wish the beans and meat had a bolder spicier flavor. The guy behind the counter was very skimpy with the toppings."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, home made fry bread with a very authentic taste.  The owners are very friendly along with the entire staff.  Don't settle for imitations and come enjoy the true fry bread taste.  They have plenty of options to choose from."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the hours of operation. Who serves food and closes at 7pm?!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Sorry but as a Diné female who grew up on the Navajo reservation, the taste is too bland and has no flavor, one of my least favorites here in the valley. I'm sticking with the frybread restaurants located near downtown. I know the establishment claims to have lived on the rez, but I cannot go on just a \"claim\" to say this is authentic."}
{"text":"Come here if you've never had fry bread before and you will leave satisfied! 

Huge portions with decent pricing. They also customize your toppings(chipotle style) so if you want more salsa or jalapeños and cheese, that's your opportunity. They have a few tables indoors and outdoors 

Indian taco is the way to go because the fry bread is already folded for you and easier to eat"}
{"text":"Very average at best. Nice clean place with good service. Just not very good fry bread"}
{"text":"White Eyes is located on the NE corner of 59th Ave and the 101 just south of Albertsons.  The inside is tiny with about 6 tables for 2.  The menu is simple.  FryBread with choices of green chile pork, carne asada, red chile beef, chicken, and vegetarian.  The bread comes with your choice of meat, beans, and toppings from lettuce, cheese, peppers, dice chile, olives, onions, salsa and sour cream.  

I have tried the carne asada, the green chile, and the red chile.  The bread is good.  It is fluffy and a little chewy.  Not the best bread I have had but definitely worthy.  The green chile was the best out of the three toppings I have had.  Flavorful, a tiny bit of heat and some nice chunks of pork.  The red chile had no heat at all and was a bit bland.  The carne asada was dry and over cooked.  It tasted like it had been on the grill for a very long time and reheated multiple times.  I cook carne asada on the regular and know when it is fresh and when it is reheated.  What I was given was definitely not cool to be serving to a customer.  The beans were generic store bought refried beans.  It appears they also have homemade beans as an option.  The toppings were also store bought and either came out of a bag or a can.  

The lady at the counter is very friendly and nice and for that I am rounding up to 3.  The food was all very average for me and borderline cafeteria quality.  It is right between two to three stars.  After trying three different items I wouldn't recommend it as it is very simple and could easily be made at home with fresher ingredients.  For 9 bucks a pop I expect freshly grated higher quality cheese, homemade beans (get rid of the canned beans altogether), fresh cooked carne asada, fresh chopped roasted green chiles, maybe even something else like diced fresh tomatoes.  That would gain my repeat business.  If you are craving Fry Bread there aren't many choices anywhere near this place and it's cool to have the option.  I just wish they would step it up a notch.  They also offered a variety of dessert frybreads but I have not had them.  The owners seem like nice people and I wish them well and hope they make some small changes in the quality department and thrive."}
{"text":"Just got home from eating and I have to say it was yummy! The place was clean and very comfortable and of course the fry bread was to die for. I wanted to get a picture of my food but I was done eating by the time I remembered. I did buy some frozen to bring home so I will be enjoying those sometime this week. If you haven't been to this Glendale location I really suggest making a pit stop for some great delicious fry bread."}
{"text":"Been passing this place for a few months, so today was the day for a visit, and boy, were we glad! ! Hubby had the green chili and LOVED IT!! Said it was the best he had had. ..Hatch Green Chilies,  nice and spicy!  I had the carne Asada, which had a wonderful seasoning!  Sooooooooooo yummy! ! Then we just had to split a traditional fry bread - honey and powdered sugar. Served up hot,  very hot and oh so yummy! Haven't had one in many many years, and this was worth the wait!  OMG!!! Amazing! ! On way home,  Hubby couldn't stop talking about the green chili - it was THAT good!  We will be back! !"}
{"text":"Don't let the size of this place fool you. It's filled with big flavor. This was my first visit and I was pleasantly surprised. The dough was fried perfectly. The bean and red chile were delicious but a sample of my friend's green chile set my order for my next visit. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and have had the green chile, the red chile and the bean Navajo Tacos. Its good, in general.

The green chili is ok, good, but not great.

The red chili is quite good.

The beans are abysmal. Bland and the consistency of wall paper paste, which is a shame because of all things, refried beans are basic and quite easy to make great. A shame more thought hasn't been put into that.

The fry bread is good to, not great.

The condiments (i.e. salsa) and veggies seem to be right out of the can which is a shame as well.

It's food truck food. What can you do? All in all three visits and 3 three stars are about all I'm willing to invest with white eyes."}
{"text":"Having grown up in N. Arizona I have had more than my fair share of fry bread/Navajo tacos, but White Eyes food is unlike any other. Every single item I have ordered has always been fresh and delicious. There is not one thing I wouldn't order but the green Chili is definitely my favorite! The staff is pleasant also!"}
{"text":"Finally a fry bread place I don't have to drive 30 minutes to get to!  I've been here twice so far.  The green chili is great, the ground beef is pretty bland.  Cost is $8-$9 for a fry bread (they are really big).  It looks like a pizza when they're done.  The quality of the fry bread is pretty good, the owners are super nice.  If you feel like fry bread and don't want to drive downtown, this is the place to go!

Edit:  I'm downgrading them from 4 stars to 3 because of my experience trying to set up a catering event with them for Midwestern University.  My experience consisted of calling and getting put on hold (and dropped), calling back and getting hung up on twice, then calling another 3-4 times without any answer, and finally leaving a message without any call back.  I would never try to order from them for a group again, but I'd still recommend them for a quick bite if you were in the mood for fry bread.  Unfortunately, this experience definitely soured my opinion of the place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Only one small complaint - price. I thought the product and price were a little off. That said, It won't deter me from going back and having the half fry bread special with chips. 

Glad to have such a unique place in our community!"}
{"text":"Cool new place in Arrowhood! Finally something different for lunch. That hot fresh Fry bread is sooooo good. Tried the carne Asada and green pork....both were bomb.com!!! The desert was super good, I had enough to share. Side note; They need to start jarring that salsa bcuz I am in love."}
{"text":"I walked in for the first time.  I often get indian tacos at festivals and so just tried to go up and order an \"indian taco\" thinking that meant bread with beef, beans, cheese, etc...but the young man at the counter began to explain that it was not a real taco but he could fold it in half for me if I wanted.  ...I think there was some miscommunication with him thinking I was trying to get normal tacos.  ???  So then I asked how to order, and he explained their concept.  It's like the \"Subway\" of fry bread.  You choose the meat you want (ground beef/green chile pork/red chile beef/carne asada/chicken) and whether you want beans.  Then they bring the fry bread out to a toppings bar behind glass, and you tell them which toppings to add.  Toppings included cheese, lettuce, white onion, green onion, olives, what I think was either green bell peppers or green chilies??, salsa, and sour cream.  Fry bread runs about $9.  They also have fry bread dessert options for about $6 and a cooler with assorted bottled drinks.

I ordered some sweet puffs for my kids.  They were chunks of fry bread sprinkled with your choice of sweet toppings.  My kids loved them with cinnamon sugar.  I opted for the green chile pork fry bread with beans to-go.  I took it home to share with my husband.  He was not overly enthused and only took 2 bites.  He wasn't a fan of the green chile and thought the lettuce could be fresher.  I found it to be okay and finished off the rest.  The bread was not greasy like some other reviewers found, but I agree that, while it did not taste old, it seemed like it could have been fresher.  The green chile and beans were okay by my standards too.  Their salsa was really tasty and was the highlight for me.

Overall, my experience was positive.  The people there were friendly.  Restaurant was clean.  Food, while not mind-blowing, was okay.  I feel like they could kick it up a notch with the freshness.  I do think I'll be back now and again when I'm craving fry bread.  3 stars.  Will review again after a few visits."}
{"text":"Yummy food. They go out of their way to provide good friendly service too. Great place to grab a bite. Nice little mom and pop style place."}
{"text":"I was \"Yelping\" Fry Bread and came across this location which happened to be very close where I was staying. I went, ate, and went there to eat again!  Too bad they no longer serve Breakfast Frybread.. :(.

WONDERFUL Hatch Green Chili!!

This place is now a mandatory stop when I visit Arizona. 

To the Owners of White Eyes Fresh Fry Bread, will you come to Southern California and open a restaurant please?"}
{"text":"That was the most amazing food I've ate!
Something you gotta try.. They are friendly and knowledgeable people. My favorite new spot!"}
{"text":"THE BEST INDIAN FRY BREAD EVER. I travel a lot and have tried Indian fry bread in multiple states but White Eyes gets it correct every single time! The green chili is delicious! Not only is the food good, but the people that work there are always fabulous and so nice! Just a nice little slice of paradise :) if you're in the area.. EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant not a food truck review. Saw trailer in parking lot but found tables, bathroom and good food inside. 
This was the most non-greasy fry bread I have ever enjoyed. The bread was cooked to perfection and very tasty. 
The menu featured many topping options and daily specials. We had a carne asada and a green chili. Both were delicious. The chunks of pork in the green chili were generous. The carne was not dry and quite tasty. 
Prices were reasonable for a large serving. Could even split one and feel okay. Forget about room for a dessert topping fry bread if you finish a savory one. You will be full!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place! The fry bread was great and the customer service was even better! The cashier took the time to go over the entire menu with us since it was our first time there. He also surprised us with a little basket of dessert fry bread for free! Even the cook came out once to check how everything was. Sadly, there aren't too many places around these days that provide this kind of service. I would go back just for the service...but of course the fry bread was delicious too!!"}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT!!  Yes there was a line.  The fry bread tastes very authentic and is fresh.  There is a good selection of toppings and they offered a to go box that was very nice.  Best of luck to White Eyes."}
{"text":"Pretty good, service was fast and friendly. Place is clean. Food was decent.. I had the red chili and bean fry bread.... The portions are good, I left very full. The frybread wasn't as fluffy as I'm used to but all in all was good."}
{"text":"I wanted genuine Native American fry bread and narrowed down to three places, this being one of them. We were coming from California so I wanted to have my experience be the real deal when it comes to fry bread. After reading the reviews for the other two places, my husband suggested coming to this one.

It's located in a little plaza, the facility seems very clean and minimal, which is how I like it. The menu is straight forward and the lady serving us was very nice, we got to talking and she seems very sweet.

I got the Indian taco while my husband got the carne asada fry bread, we got the sweet and savory fry bread for my daughter (we ate some of her sweet fry bread) and it was really good. 

The reason why it lost a star is because my husband's fry bread lacked crispiness, it was kind of soft. The food is a generous amount, I had a hard time finishing mine and it took me awhile to finish it."}
{"text":"Had the Indian taco today. Unfortunately I wasn't anywhere near as impressed as I was a year ago. This place has really gone downhill. I swear the fry bread I had a year ago was completely full not half of it cover with the ingredients and then folded in half therefore making the price too high. It was entirely too salty and the grease obviously wasn't hot enough because it reeked of grease and was not puffed up like it should be. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love the fry breads.  The green chili is one of my favorites.  I love that they have the food truck too!!! Very yummy!"}
