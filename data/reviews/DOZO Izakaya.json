{"text":"I usually don't eat Japan cuisine but the food was exquisitely delicious the 4 stars would have been five if the guy that worked there kissed me but it didn't work .-."}
{"text":"Boss is extremely friendly. No doubt the best and most authentic Japanese restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. Friendly staff and good atmosphere. With the exception of saying good evening in Japanese at 12:30 in the afternoon. Sushi rolls were delicious and needing to try the ramen next."}
{"text":"I'm from Japan. This review is the view from the native Japanese person.  The presentation of the ramen is probably the best in Arizona. It looked really close to what I usually see in Japan. However, the flavor is weak. Especially, the soup of Tonkotsu ramen was very weak. Tonkotsu soup should be thick and strong. Of course it's healthier not to make that way but ramen isn't healthy food.  Other izakaya foods tasted good but they are $1~$2 more expensive than the same quality restaurants in California. Onigiri shouldn't cost $5. It's usually the one of the cheapest food in izakaya. It's maybe hard to make it as inexpensive as California but still too expensive.  If they could lower the price by $1 for all izakaya menu, I'm sure this place will be packed with Japanese people."}
{"text":"You must be very patient waiting to eat here. You need to wait 15 minutes for water, 30 minutes for menu, 1 hour for the food to be served, 2 hours for the check to be printed! 1-star service, three- star food, average 2-star"}
{"text":"Went there with the girlfriend who was convinced the original Dozo restaurant, which was by far her favorite in Arizona, was long gone. Luckily I convinced her to try this Dozo as I know restaurant owners are sometimes known to relocate.  Boy am I glad we went, even though this place is easily a half an hour drive away from our home, it's absolutely worth it. The best Japanese I've had in my 2 year stay in Arizona period! I've looked in all the more well known Japanese restaurants in the Tempe/Mesa area and hardly any at all were even able to prepare a basic Katsu Curry dish! Dozo however delivered exactly the caliber of Japanese food I'm familiar with being from California, everything came with a delicious flavor, nothing felt like it had been sitting in the freezer, fish was fresh, appetizers were varied (we had the Hot Rock and Baked Scallops, absolutely delicious) my Katsudon Curry was perfect and her Sushi was top notch.  For desert the Tempura Ice Cream really hit the spot, it felt very authentic with little decorations that made it awesome and different from any other place I've tried it at. This will become our regular spot for japanese/sushi for sure!  Thank you to the very kind waitress who offered to call us when they're offering Spanish Mackerel too! :)"}
{"text":"This is not a real sushi place i have to say. We ordered the 15 pieces sashimi plate, which should come with five fish and each in 3 pieces. But one more expensive fish was substituted with much cheaper fish, without telling us. The chef probably think we won't notice. We asked for the replacement and the chef did. But feel this kind of sushi store is dishonest and will not go again.   The fish quality is in average, not really fresh nor very bad, but they come in quite thin and small size than other sushi place. So if you are really into sashimi or sushi, you will feel disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!  It is so nice to see that although the location has changed, this family owned restaurant has maintained all the wonderful qualities of the former Scottsdale location.   Our usual favorites Albacore Tuna shashimi and Keita roll are still extremely fresh and tasty.  The crispy calamari is delicious now made with a lighter rice flour batter.  The ambiance of the new Tempe location is fun and trendy and accessible from everywhere.  Robert and Risa are always the perfects hosts and go out of their way to make everyone feel welcome.  We arrived early for happy hour specials and the place was filling up quickly by the time we left.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty ramen and rice bowls. Sushi are beautiful and yummy. We got some free chocolate today cuz it's Valentine's Day. Nice service. The outdoor seats are fancy."}
{"text":"So good food is fab just went here with my awesome children and awesome soon to be hubby and we ate lots and lots of noodles. Don't even get me started on the sushi I wish I could start a food blog about this place !"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to love this place but the service is so painfully slow whenever we go (doesn't matter when - weekdays/Saturday, lunch/dinner...just SLOW). Like some fellow Yelpers have pointed out this is a Chinese/Taiwanese owned Japanese Tapas-like place. Overall the quality of the food is good as long as you can close one eye and forget about the authenticity of the food. Consider it as a Japanese-Taiwanese fusion diner then you are fine. Sushi is a *meh* for me, Yakitori and other skewer items are OK, Ramen depends on the kind of broth that you order (Tonkotsu  and  Shio are better than the others) but the noodle itself that they use tends to be salty. Since the place is new and the staff is super nice, I shall wait and see how this place can mature and evolve into a more established place to go in coming months. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Good food and good service!!  The manager was very attentive of our request since it was lunch time, he recommended us to change the order in order to get back to work on time. The item he recommended was great!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I tried the tonkatsu noodles.  IT WAS DELICIOUS love it.  I've been looking for a place to get my noodle soup and now I know where to go. Place is clean, very clean and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"The Reman impressed me much, delicious and health! The owner was very friendly and patient, deserve to be try more."}
{"text":"You know the place is incredible when you are the minority. I haven't had a thing yet that wasn't amazing. The restaurant is clean, service is fast and friendly, and it feels like family."}
{"text":"Service was good, clean and happy hour prices reasonable though the portions were small based on our experiences at say, Sakahana.  Although not overly crowded and a Monday night, three of our selections ended up not being available (ran out).  Appeared to be one server for the night that was polite and kept up with things though the items came out slow from the kitchen.  Food was good -- really like the crunchy tuna roll.  They have an extensive Sake selection (both cold and hot) and serve coke products (which I prefer).  Traditional items that we appreciated having a chance to sample in anticipation for our upcoming trip to Japan which is why we chose to visit and found out about a coupon we received in the mail."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with my wife tonight.  We got some miso soup, a few basic rolls, a bento box, some sake and mochi ice cream. The bento teriyaki salmon was cooked to perfection and the rolls were very tasty and fresh.  The staff is super helpful and friendly and the decor and ambiance is nice as well.   They also offer(only one in az) what the owner explained to us is Japanese tapas.   We tried the chicken thigh which was really good and well be sure to try more next time we go. Definitely will be making a return trip soon!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit after reading the glowing review in the local paper.  We came on a Friday night at 5:00 when they first opened so there were no crowds but it filled up quickly soon after.  We ordered the salmon and yellowtail sashimi which was so fresh and amazing (from Scotland and Japan), best we have had in a long time!  Also had the nasu dengaku (miso eggplant), tako-yaki (octopus rice ball), grilled chicken hearts and gizzards, and mackerel.  The grilled items were good but could use some more seasoning.  The presentation of each dish was simple but elegant.  The service was excellent... the server was very friendly, the dishes came at just the right pace, and dishes were removed quickly as we finished.  Prices were very reasonable.  Overall, we were pleased and will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Found this place while searching for sushi. We are not from Arizona so we were hoping yelp reviews held up to the expectation. It most certainly did! Kids had the ramen, the husband and I had a few rolls of sushi and some tempura. Excellent food and the service was spectacular. Thank you Dozo Izakaya for providing us with an outstanding dinner!"}
{"text":"We just happened to stop here for dinner. Service was nice and friendly. This is one of those small restaurants that no one notice, but once you come, you'll be a regular. Every dish we ordered was good: the pork belly was delicious, the baby octopus was something different to try, and the ramen noodles is in a huge bowl big enough for the whole table to share.  And the final price tag is even better: $40 for 2 people!! The food looks and tastes authentic Japanese."}
{"text":"Found this place interesting as it's always been a changing restaurant at this location. Sushi was good and so was the takoyaki. Of course came for the ramen and wasn't disappointed. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Just left from dinner on a Thursday night and have to say that this was one of the best dining experiences that I've had in quite a while.   To start, we got there a little early ...4:55 (our daughter has volleyball around the corner from 5-6:30). The owner/chef saw us walking up and invited us in telling us to come in early, out of the heat. Every member of the staff greeted us exuberantly and made us feel welcome, but in a \"come in and have a great time\" kind of way. Since we were early, we had our choice of seats. The was exceptionally clean and had a nice look and feel to it. Both the waitress and chef/ owner engaged us in conservation and after finding out that this was or first time, took the time to explain the menu offerings and, most importantly, the happy hour specials, which are fantastic!   Because we (my wife and I) were with with my parents, we ordered a variety of items both off the happy hour menu as well as the IZAKAYA menu. All were outstanding. My parents ordered some standards, Philly roll and california roll, which were really good, but not what I was in the mood for. I was looking for some more excitement, so from the IZAKAYA menu, I ordered the beef, onion, and rice bowl (melt in your mouth great), the sausage (which you MUST eat with the fresh garlic or really not understand how good it is), the chicken skin (best I've ever had), and the baby octopus (which were perfectly grilled and just the right amount of heat). My mother, who is of Polish descent, was  excited to find chicken hearts and gizzards on the same menu. Both were exceptional. My wife, who is vegetarian and usually not too excited about sushi places, was thrilled to see such a variety of options. Along with spring rolls, she ordered the yam and avocado roll which I also tried and loved.  But best of all, in my opinion was the service. Impeccable is the best word to describe it. Not over bearing, but always right there before you think you need it. Plus, the owner, chef was a great conversationalist and happy to offer suggestions and really went or of his way to make us feel welcome.   To sum up, there is only one thing to say...this is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and menu but service was terrible. Quality sashimi. The grilled baby octopus was great. Would come back to try other menu items. Sat at the sushi bar and food came out timely. Getting my check took a bit long then I had to ask for an itemized receipt waited and waited and the server forgot my request."}
{"text":"I ordered the miso ramen with pork, and it was good enough to earn a 3.5 star review (I need to explain it here cuz Yelp does not have 0.5-star rating). The portion was right enough for me, but I wish they could have put more veggies in that ramen though. The soft-boiled egg was a bit over cooked, and the slice of pork was ok.   I hope that they can have more chicken nuggets in stock for dinner next time when I go there."}
{"text":"I had not written any Yelp reviews until I dined here. I was starved and left the place feeling hungry, shortchanged, and discriminated. Let me tell you why.  We were looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant in Phoenix and thought this was it by the name.  Instead it's a Chinese run Japanese style restaurant that serves premium priced half-Japanese food at a starvingly slow rate.  We ordered saba , tempura , udon soup , and ramen. The saba took 40 minutes to arrive, and the rest arrived within the hour. We originally arrived at 6 pm on a Monday night. When I observed the kitchen, the staff was stopping and double checking nearly every order. Their system was grossly inefficient.  The food was only half Japanese. I am married to a darling Japanese girl, and she grew up with her uncle who owned a successful LA restaurant that once catered the Japanese Emperor. I have also visited Japan 4 times and eat Japanese food every day. We both agreed that the head cook conveniently uses cheaper Chinese alternatives to save some money. The udon broth was watered down and had soy sauce in it , and the ramen soup was weak with garlic added.  The ramen noodles were few as well.   I dont know why a few elite Yelpers rate this place 4 or 5 stars. Ive never been disappointed with Japanese food nor service.  Ive never waited more than 20 min at legit places. Perhaps Phoenix does not have them yet for Yelpers to experience true Japanese cuisine and service. I felt discriminated because a larger group of middle aged Caucasian Americans were served a more complex meal first when they arrived 15 min later than us. Dont come here unless there's no customers and if you are willing to pay more for less."}
{"text":"Was very pleasant atmosphere and the staff was great, very attentive.  Had the Sushi Combo lunch and it was fresh and tasty.  The only thing I was disappointed with was the Portion size of the Nigri was small compared to other Japanese restaurant in the area.  Loved their Crunch Roll and their Miso soup too.  All in all a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were really pleased when we came in on a Monday night. The sushi chef/owner was very nice explaining things about the menu and the type of restaurant.   This isn't your typical sushi joint. It is a style of eating that Japanese go to for happy hour. This is to say it is casual.   We ate delicious 3 sushi rolls, Taiwanese sausage, and a grilled rice bowl. Fish, veggies and fruit was fresh and tasty.   This is such a fun experience because it is a little different. The style is clean and sleak and we look forwrd to sitting outside when the weather is more favorable."}
{"text":"This sushi bar is by far the best one in the Ahwatukee and Chandler area.  The sushi chef has the timing/pace set on the sushi delivery such that the moment you want more it's landing right in front of you.  Also, for some reason, the fish has a way better texture than the surrounding sushi joints in the area.  Worth pointing out that the chef knows how to balance the flavors in all the different rolls they offer; this goes a long way in the experience and taste IMO."}
{"text":"So close to home. How did I miss this one?  We live nearby, and this restaurant spot has gone through at least five iterations in the ten years I've been in the neighborhood. So once again, another name pops up, \"Dozo\", and I think Here's another ma and pa short-lived business adventure.   Alas, we give it a try tonight, and wow! The decor is well-done, the staff is warm and friendly, and the menu is deep and provocative.  The food: we tried 3 of the izakaya items--chicken skin, chicken hearts, and beef tongue. Interesting, and I will try more, but 4 out of 5 stars. A bit more \"chewey\" than I think it could have been. We then had the carburetor roll. This was outstanding, and the shrimp tempura in the middle had an excellently thin, light, crispy batter. Made us want to try the tempura items by themselves next time. The ramen was also really good, and we'll explore that further as well.  I really hope this place is a continuing success. This is a gem in south Tempe that we need as a local hot spot.  I reserve the fifth star for future visits, only because I like to remain objectively very critical of the truly best places."}
{"text":"Best RAMEN in Arizona. I eat lunch here at least once a week. Can't go wrong with the ramen sushi combo."}
{"text":"We like the food and service here.  Authentic, good service, but limited seating."}
{"text":"Delicious noodle soup.  Be aware that there is only a small eating area inside and a large patio for outside eating. The patio is nice, but some parts of the year it's just too hot to eat outside.   This is a great place for an inexpensive bowl of noodles for lunch, or a nice place for a drink and sushi on the patio at night."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious. We ordered the steamed gyoza, DOZO Roll, Negi Yellowtail Roll, and the Tonkotsu Cha-Shu Ramen. The fish was so unbelievably fresh and the rolls were the perfect size to eat in one bite and they held together really nice.  All was excellent. The serving staff was attentive and super sweet. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Superb food! Never disappoints with the high quality service and food. Best Oyako Don in the country...the sushi is fresh and ramen fantastic. too many other amazing items on the izakaya menu too mention.  They are always busy especially on the weekends...well worth the wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving for ramen.  We chose to come here.  We both got the Spicy miso ramen.  It's been a while since we stopped in.  The ramen was okay.  The noodles were not as good as I remembered a few years ago.  It seemed more chewy.   But the broth was still yummy.  We also got several items from the grill and that's what made my tummy sing.  The chicken gizzard and chicken heart was grilled perfectly.  The takoyaki was so oishii (delicious), creamy in the middle that was packed with umami.  I wished we had another serving, but we had to leave soon to pick up the kids from Taekwondo.  I think the next visit we will be ordering more from the grill, and I am curious to try their Hawaiian poke too."}
{"text":"Really good. I've been twice.  First time i went for lunch:  I chose a beef teriyaki and tempura bento. It wasn't the normal cut or flavor of teriyaki i was expecting, but good. The sauce was not sweet, and the beef was in little squares as opposed to the strips in sweet sauce I'm used to. Not the norm, but by no means bad. The tempura was absolutely fantastic. The tempura assortment included a shishito pepper, something I'd never seen in tempura.. but now all I can think of is eating a whole basket of them. The batter on all pieces was extremely airy, almost lacy, delicate, but not falling apart, and served only seconds from the fryer. A+ on technique. Dozo Izakaya understands the critical and oft forgotten art of serving the dish at it's absolute best moment... more on that later.  The sushi was well made and traditionally sized, everything able to be eaten in one bite aside from the futomaki. The miso soup was not from a packet and had a very good dashi flavor with proper smoke and mirin flavors, with silken tofu. The rice in the bento was a bit cold but not bad  My dining companion had the pork katsu with philly roll bento, and did not have any complaints. The bento included a nice sesame ball, the salad had a nice sweet mayo/vinegar dressing.  Lunch service was good if a bit slow, but the place was packed, and the lone waitress did comment on and apologize for the delay. This place is pretty small, about 50 seats total. Best for parties 4 or fewer, but can accomodate parties of six, and they offer reservations. The sushi bar seats only accounts for 5 so it's a solo or 2 person affair. They have a patio but it was too hot on our lunch visit.  Now on to dinner. I went with the intention of only eating from the Izakaya menu. i've eaten [and drank] at 'the real deal' in Osaka and Kyoto and this is the only place I've ever seen in Arizona that has a menu that even resembles theirs. It's an assortment of yakitori, soups, and small plates meant to be shared and enjoyed with beer, sake, rice whiskey (shoju/shochu), or a fine cocktail. The yakitori selections here include 'nasty bits'; artfully grilled chicken gizzards, hearts, skins, and beef tongue are available on little skewers (2 per order, per izakaya tradition norms). These are truly worth the visit as they present amazing flavors and textures, and rarely seen in casual establishments out here. You can also get spiced fried wings, grilled chicken breast with green onion, grilled sirloin, and many other 'less daring' options.  The dish that drew me back for dinner were the shishito peppers... I knew I wasn't going to get them tempura style, but the fact they were on the izakaya menu piqued my curiosity. They arrived cooked a bit more than expected, no longer crispy, but fried with garlic and either butter or olive oil, and garnished with sesame and the best garnish I have ever seen anywhere. They were just laid in a bowl, and then topped with very finely shredded bonito flakes in tiny strips. It was moving and dancing in a very noticable manner as the light-as-air flakes dissolved and collapsed into the heat and oil of the peppers they were resting on. Another testament to the importance Dozo Izakaya puts on prep-to-table presentation. They did it again with the takoyaki, which was served piping hot with a delicate crisp outside and an almost molten inside. Really REALLY good, but again, the dancing katsuobushi garnish were just unexpected and beyond the standard 'extra mile' a cook could take. I finished with my first ever whole fried sweet prawn... I ate every last bit except the tail.  Dinner service was attentive if a little hurried, despite the place not being as full as it was at lunch. I really dislike servers asking if I want more food while everyone is actively eating or enjoying a sip from a drink, but again it was one server for the whole place, and they were always on point with getting the food from the pass to the table ASAP. This is a tight operation that knows what it is doing, and it is worth every one of the 4 stars. It's not perfect, but it is unique and very very good.  I wish I could just get a whole pile of tempura shishito peppers. They're on to something here. Also, this place closes way too early. An izakaya should be open until midnight or later.   P.S. Other reviewers point out this place is not Japanese owned, and there is a bit of fusion going on, keep an open mind. This is a Japanese based menu with Chinese and Singaporean twists."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Nothing to write home about and the service was mediocre."}
{"text":"I am not a huge Japanese food connoisseur but I do know that in this area, we do not have much authentic Japanese going for us. My husband and I tried this place last week and were pleasantly surprised with how clean everything was and the various options on the menu (their sushi rolls all have a description, I don't know about you but that is a big plus for me lol)   I had a bento box with spicy chicken teriyaki and my husband had the spicy miso ramen with pork. Both were great, everything seemed super fresh and the server was really nice and helpful.  Is it super authentic? Maybe, probably not. Is it really tasty and fresh? Yes! We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Food is great if you want some authentic Asian styled food. By the way this is not purely Japanese food. The whole thing is ran by Chinese people.   Bad thing is that the service is very very very  slow."}
{"text":"Never a yelp reviewer but this was hands down the best sushi I've gotten in the Tempe area, so I gotta show some love. The price reflects the quality, and it was worth every cent. My mom and I went for lunch today and each had the sashimi lunch special, with two seaweed (wakame) salads and a poke tuna roll added on; all were fantastic even though the seaweed salads were tiny, tiny, tiny. Some of the best tasting salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore and escolar I've had in the valley (and I worked in a sushi restaurant for 5 years!) Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"have tonkotsu ramen, soup doesn't taste too rich. Had grilled shishamo and it is very good but small octopus doesn't taste good as it is extremely chewy."}
{"text":"Love Dozo's ramen noodles ... this is definitely not the packaged ramen noodles you ate through college. I've tried all their different broths and my favorite (and most of my friends' too) is the Tonkotsu (pork bones broth). The fresh noodles are also uber flavorful. Prices are reasonable and the portions are large and should satisfy the hungriest guy."}
{"text":"The grilled stuff is highly recommended. Tried grilled chicken gizzard, beef tongue, chicken skin and grilled fish, all pretty good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Oyakodon and the Katsu Don Chicken, We just wondered what the fried rice was because we knew it was called the Chashu but was not sure. So I asked for my Katsu Don Chicken with the fried rice substituted for the white rice. Before my food got to the table I asked another waiter if the Chashu fried rice was going to be in my Katsu. She obviously said no. So i politely asked to return the fried rice and she said its being made already, but this time i will take it off for you but next time i wont. But no communication to the other waiter was made. The Food came to the table andI told my waiter I didn't want it and she said \"ITS ALREADY BEEN MADE\" SO i couldn't return it. Me and my boyfriend was already disgusted of how our waiter was treating us. We automatically knew they weren't Japanese because of the language they spoke was Chinese. They also didn't know much of what the food was and couldn't speak to the other cooks in Japanese. I ate what i had ordered and kept the fried rice how it was set on the table. Never touched. I wanted the get out of there. Didn't want to cause problems but when the waiter saw we weren't eating the fried rice she came to us and asked us for a to-go box. I said NO. She never asked how my food was or stopped by to ask for a drink refill. I didn't ask for my Check either. She brought it to me like she wanted us to leave and so I put down the money and calculated what i had eaten. She saw it wasn't including the full total and she asked for it but i said i am not paying for what i didnt want and didnt eat. She said \" But you owe me\". I also said the other waiter told me she will take back the fried rice. Like i said no communication was made. And so i didnt pay for it once she came back with my change it wasn't the full exact change but i didnt want to argue more. So we left and once we left the other waiter comes out and stops us and says \" SO YOU DIDNT GIVE YOUR WAITER THE TIP WHY\" I told her that she was rudely stopping by once in a while just to look at us but never asking us how my food was. She said \"SO YOURE SAYING ITS BAD SERVICE\" and I said yes."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  From.ramen to sushi they have it all.  Great couple who run.the place.  I have been several times and each time was a treat.    In the evening s they do a izakaya style menu.  This is very hard to get in phx and harder to do right.  They nsil it.  Outside seatibg as well"}
{"text":"We had the shrimp tempura starter which was very good.  The batter was very textured and quite good.  The shrimp themselves were very large.  We also had the mackerel and butter fish ngiri.  The mackerel was very good.  The butterfish was mild (I prefer a stronger tasting fish) however the sliced pickled pepper on top was a terrific addition.  The curried rice with tempura shrimp was good.  However, the standout item for me was the Japanese peppers in garlic sauce.  These were mildly spicy chili peppers in a smokey garlic sauce topped with bonito flakes.  Fantastic!  I've never had these before and by themselves are worth going back.  They have a casual atmosphere with very friendly staff and a nice patio.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken has always been my place to go in the valley and nothing would compare to it, but after tonight, I think I found my new favorite place! For appetizers, the pan-fried gyoza was on point. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen combo with a side of poki-tuna don. The wait was really long considering how busy it was for a Friday night, but for sure worth it! I'm definitely coming back here again in the bear future with all my buddies!"}
{"text":"The owner/chef was extremely rude. Came out and straight out told us  thwre was about 1 hour wait. We said okay, then he went in. All of a sudden he came back out said. No seats, no food for you."}
{"text":"Went last night to sushi bar. Owner Robert served delicious dish after dish. I'm very experienced with sushi, and Robert and his staff dazzled me with dishes like Oshinko, the best Salmon I've had in a while, a great Alaska Skin roll with Yamagobo, and more. No prepackaged junk sushi or sides at this fine place. Passed my scrutiny w flying colors. You'll be very happy here."}
{"text":"We are so glad we found this place tonight and are excited that it's in our neighborhood! The poke roll literally was made for us right then- they marinated the ahi right then and there and that's why it took longer than the other rolls but it was totally worth the few extra minutes!!! Really looking forward to going back here from now on anytime I feel like sushi, a definite go to spot from now on! Not to mention our waitress was probably the nicest waitress I've ever had before. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I feel like if I was to visit Japan this is exactly what the food would taste like. The yakitori menu is absolutely perfect with just the right amount of char and sauce. The takoyaki are absolutely delicious and the Tonkotsu Ramen is simply the tastiest ramen Ive ever had. I like to try a different restaurant whenever I go out to eat, but I could eat here everyday. The waitress that served us spoke Japanese can't remember her name but she was thoughtful and attentive without being pushy. Fantastic service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service....went to eat there and try this place for the first time with extended family. Including kids we were a total of 12 and they refused to sit us inside as we were too large of a group and \"they needed to save the inside space for their regular customers\". We even said that we could have separate tables, hence one for the kids and one for the adults. They preferred to see us leave, than sit us inside. Great way to never make any of us regular customers..."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!   It was busy that night & a server seated me & a friend at the sushi bar. We needed a table for 4 & we were still waiting for the rest of our party. We politely sat there instead & had drinks & appetizers. After getting passed up for a table 2x, I asked about it & the owner abruptly said, \"ok, I'll seat you next.\"   While we continued to wait & I then needed to add 1 more to our party. I asked her nicely if we could make our party for 5. She then yelled at me at the top of her lungs and told me that they have no seat for me. I asked nicely, \"Excuse me? You're not able to seat us with one more?\"   She then aggressively told me,\"NO!\" To the point where the sushi chef behind the counter said something to her in their native language & she yelled at him too! I paid my bill & We will never go back.   If you want poor service like, Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld show. Come here. Otherwise, there are plenty other sushi places in Phoenix that you can eat at.  correction: I assumed it was one of the owners but it was not. Still, they represent the business & I have never been treated so poorly!"}
{"text":"The rolls taste good but I felt like as soon as I asked for it to go the waitress was dismissive. They aren't as nicely rolled as other places. I still tipped but now that I see I didn't get and to go items like soy sauce or napkins I'm not sure how I feel about returning. I wasn't even asked!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I got the chicken ramen bowl and the poke combo.    The ramen tasted great.  Probably the best broth compared to other ramen spots.  They also serve it with a proper spoon, that has some depth to it for spooning broth. Every other Japanese place I've ever been to used really shallow spoons that are frustrating to use for anything besides collecting noodles.    The Poke was outstanding.  The fish tasted super fresh, and the sacue was a well balanced mix, more salty than sweet.   My biggest take away was the quality of the ingredients.  The chicken was tender and tasted super fresh.  Same story with the Ahi tuna in the poke.  I want to go back today.  Just might."}
{"text":"Very average food. Chicken teriyaki was really dry, the rice was dry and the spicy tuna roll really didn't taste like anything. Like air until I put some wasabi on it.  The miso soup was lukewarm and just ok. It was a weird color. And they play really weird foreign language elevator music. $17 for a very sub par lunch. Service is fast though. But there was really no one in the restaurant. Maybe that's why stuff is dried out and not fresh."}
{"text":"Great for Izakaya (like Yakatori, but more than just chicken) and Katsu (especially curry)!  Their homemade tofu ice cream is fantastic and happy hour is a great way to try a lot of different small bites.  We love to walk over for happy hour, spend a couple of hours an waddle home happier!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the kitchen lost my ticket and I waited for almost half an hour for takoyaki and karaage chicken. I plan to return soon, and I am looking forward to a better experience."}
{"text":"Awesome local restaurant! Food was incredible. Happy hour from 5-6:30 was great. We had a tuna roll, veg croquettes, dumplings and pork fried rice. Wait staff was friendly too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a terrific experience at Dozo. We weren't particularly starving, so we ordered four  small dishes to share.  The pork, chicken thigh, sausage, and the salmon fried rice. They were all delicious! My husband particularly enjoyed the sausage, while I loved the salmon fried rice. We also ended up ordering some ramen to sample. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen. It was great! Not too spicy!  The staff was very friendly. They kept our drinks full and always had a smile. Overall, it was a delightful experience! We will definitely be back to try other menu options!"}
{"text":"I wanted so much to love this place! We are in desperate need of a great Japanese Izakaya restaurant.  Maybe it was a Monday but that shouldn't really matter.  We ordered two rolls, I didn't even taste the spicy tuna roll..the spicy salmon we had was not fresh.  The salmon sashimi wasn't fresh.  The uni was ok....I've had better at the cheap rotating sushi places.  The tuna poke was pretty fresh and very flavorful  I also had butter fish, dressing on the salad that accompanied this dish was amazing.  Fish was ok, not great.  Ramen broth was very tasty (spicy miso) however the noodles weren't very good.  A little too on the mushy side for my taste.  All in all I was expecting a lot more, especially for a restaurant that is having a grand opening.  I'll be back to give it another shot, but I think I'll wait awhile as my stomach isn't too happy with me right now.  The waitress was really nice and noticed we didn't eat any of our sushi, so she took off one of the rolls.  She really should have taken both rolls and the sushi off if our bill as we didn't even touch them they were so fishy  I hope they freshen up their fish for our next visit"}
{"text":"Wow!  Had dinner last night and what an excellent experience.  Sampled many of the special small plates...the octopus balls (not the testicles BTW) and chicken skin was great.  Sampled the sashimi of which all was fresh and tasty.  Service was great .  I cant wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Decided to go here to celebrate a Singaporean friend's birthday; best decision ever.  We went during happy hour, leading us to splurge. From what I can remember we got the vegas roll, mango tango, spicy tuna roll, shrimp roll, dragon roll, spicy squid, meatballs and few others. There were 5 of us, and we went through all the food in less than 15 minutes. Amazing rolls and the squid and meatballs were no less either. Definitely recommend this place, especially during happy hour!   PS: We were too hungry to take a picture of our food. Sorries!"}
{"text":"Great little Japanese restaurant in AZ, best I've had in the mainland U.S. period. Sukiyaki beef with onions was tasty, chicken thigh skewers were delish! Sirloin beef skewers were good, too. Price is right too. May have to eat here the next 2 nights I am in the area..."}
{"text":"update: don't come here during dinner time, the place is so packed ! 2nd time coming here during dinner time and I've waited at least 45 mins to get my food not to mention the 10 mins I waited at the door without anyone helping me. the food is great but I'm exhausted and famished waiting for an hour to even get my food. I'll probably come back during the day or at weird hours"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Just sit down and start ordering. It's all good! The yakitori is phenomenal, especially the beef  tongue, and so was literally everything else I had. Go here. Just go."}
{"text":"I tried their ramen shrimp noodle soup as my first dish. It was good and the flavor was decent. Nothing too crazy that sets it apart from other Japanese restaurant in the valley. The chicken karage could use more flavouring, it tasted a little bland to me.   The ambient was decorated nicely despite the fact that it's a smaller space than what we are used to.  It's a little pricey. Look to spend about $15-$20 for lunch..yes that includes the lunch special pricing."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and  there were like jst three other people inside. I dnt understand why the ratings is so high for. Bento box came out 40mins later and the side of sushi I ordered came out 10 mins after that. I jst don't get why it took so long and the food wasn't even good. Sushi was horrible. Service sucks and they messed up on my check and gave me the woman across me her bill and took them 15 mins to fix the issue. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Really nice interior.  Infact despite it being a small space (by American standards) it does its best to replicate a Japanese style Izakaya.  Modern and clean.  The folks that run this place seem nice.  I think they are Chinese (based on some of the interesting menu items that are not Japanese).  It was funny but awkard that some Japanese businessmen came and sat at the table next to us, but they seemed disappointed that the staff were not Japanese -I digress.  I ordered the Miso Ramen.  It's no Cherry Blossom quality, a bit bland regarding the broth, but not bad.  We shared some Gyoza, good.  My dinner companion ordered the Teriyaki bento box, seemed a bit small on the portion of chicken itself, but it had good flavor.  Not too sweet.  I will add this into the rotation but I would prefer Shimagamo or Cherry Blossom before this if I prefer Japanese flair.  I will try their sushi and Izakaya style skewers next time."}
{"text":"This is a great little place!  I came here on a Saturday at about 11:30 am.  I was worried that the place would be packed, but to my surprise, it was fairly empty.  We were seated as soon as we came in.  The decor is very nice and the place is very clean.  My only complaint is that it was very warm in the dining area.  I cooled myself off with my menu and decided on the spicy miso ramen lunch special.  I opted for the tuna roll as my side.  My girlfriend ordered the bento box and spicy tuna roll.  Hers came with a miso soup for starters.  The miso soup came first and I had to resist the urge to ask my girlfriend for a taste, but I knew I'd have my own huge bowl soon enough.  My ramen and sushi came next, and my girlfriends food came right behind that.  I was amazed about how huge the bowl of ramen was and worried if I would be able to finish it.  I tried a little bit of everything from my girlfriend's bento box, and everything was very good.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  Her only complaint was that she wished there was a bit more food, and she's very petite and isn't a huge eater.  I'm sure it would take a few bento boxes to fill up a guy of my size.  The ramen was so good.  It's the first time trying restaurant quality ramen and I'm glad it's more popular and available now.  The spice amount was just right, my nose was running by the time I finished the bowl. And yes, I did finish it.  Since this is my first time, I can't say it's the best I've ever had.  I will try some other places and see how they all stack up.  I was also pleased when the check came.  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, and usually, when I'm in this area, I spend twice for lunch with my girlfriend.  I hope I'll get to try the Izakaya portion of the menu, since it's one of my favorite types of cuisine.  It's not really close enough to me to try it in the evening, but the next time I am in the area at happy hour time, I will stop here for sure.  I'm pretty envious of people who live in this area considering all of the options they have.  A very strong concentration of really good restaurants."}
{"text":"The first and second time I came here I enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and food (sushi, poke bowl, ramen, bento boxes are all delicious!). However, last night when I arrived my husband and I were ignored to the point where we left and went elsewhere. Now, we are reasonable and patient people. We saw a very large group of patrons and understood that the wait time for food was going to be increased. Regardless we were willing to sip on some beverages and wait. Unfortunately as we entered the restaurant no one greeted us, so we politely waited at the 'please wait to be seated' sign for 10 minutes. Another gentleman who walked in at minute 10 walked straight up to the bar, asked the chef if he could sit there, and proceeded to sit down. This wasn't upsetting, perhaps we should have done the same since there were 2 seats open. But then, while we were still standing and reading the menu we then saw the waitress bring this now-seated-gentleman a glass of water. This was all before we were ever even greeted. We left after waiting at the door, ungreeted, for another 5 minutes. So, ok maybe 15 minutes doesn't sound like a long time. But it is for people who worked a 10 hour shift and wanted dinner. It's also a long time to not even be greeted. And it's certainly annoying when you watch them serve someone else who walked in after you. Dozo, I'll give you another try because I liked your food. But you're in the service industry...please be better prepared next time and don't ignore other patrons just because a large party is present!"}
{"text":"Okay so we went there at 7 pm and ordered one takoyaki and one spicy miso ramen and we wait for 45minutes and between those time we asked waiter when is our food coming?? And they are keep saying soon and soon and finally takoyaki came out and we waited another 15min for ramen and we had to leave so we cancelled the ramen and owner came out to ask us why we cancel the ramen and he was very very rude... but we really had to leave so we left..they did not charge us but it was worst experience ever btw it was not just our table all other tables were complaining bc food was coming out late too"}
{"text":"Been craving sushi and my brother suggested this place.. too bad we missed happy hour...  Atmosphere is just like a regular Japanese restaurant...and it was pretty busy but we got seated right away...  Ordered rolls...prices are pretty regular too...the rainbow roll was pretty good...the other rolls were okay tho.  The skewers were soo good tho: my faves: sirloin and chicken liver!  I wanna come back for happy hour so I don't have to pay too much for okay sushi...but I would come back for the sirloin and chicken liver! yummmmm :)"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place. A friend chose it because they wanted to try the ramen.   When we first walked in the place was nice with good ambiance. We were seated right away and given menus. Waters were on the way.   As I started looking over the menu this is where the excitement began.  I consider myself an adventurous eater and there were definitely some items I could not wait to try.   I ordered sunagimo (chicken gizzards), Hatsu (chicken heart), Reba (chicken liver), Gyu Tan (beef tongue), Hotaru-Ikayaki (baby octopus), and Katsu Don which is a panko style deep fried rice with onions, egg and soy sauce.   I ate everything and was so excited to finish it.  Each had a different flavor. I do have to say the gizzards are chewy and likely not for everyone. There were more items on the menu worth a try but it will have to wait till next time.   Overall the restaurant was really nice. Service was good and the food was unique. Will be going back to try more."}
{"text":"This place is great! We go frequently for sushi - especially during happy hour (5-6:30pm) when there are good deals on rolls and appetizers. The staff is super friendly and attentive, plus the patio seating area is awesome. The sushi is fresh and delicious - try the Carburetor Roll!"}
{"text":"Great place with outstanding food. Restaurant clean and service excellent. Food came quick and the sushi was fresh and delicious. Had also the spicy miso tofu Ramen oh my god I feel in love with it."}
{"text":"Dozo has great chicken gyoza dumplings, that got it off to a great start with me. They also have awesome ramen. Its very much on par with the better ramen in Phoenix like Hana. My go to is the tonkatsu ramen and they totally nail it. I wish they had actual bottles of sriracha though, because if you ask, they give you a little plate with some squeezed in there and being able to season it to make it more spicy would've made my day - they have a great miso based ramen too that I like as well. Their cha shu or pork is super tender and very flavorful.  They also have sushi rolls which are good but the main reason to check it out is the ramen. Stop by its a great date night location."}
{"text":"This review is for the ramen as I did not try any other items on the menu. Came here with a co-worker on a Friday for lunch. Saw the grand opening sign outside and when we got to the door, we could hear Japanese metal blasting out the speakers. Interesting... I opened the door and was greeted immediately with Irashaimasu! Wait. WTF? It's supposed to be Irashaimase! Felt a little awkward and uneasy for a moment. The waitress sat us at a counter facing the parking lot. After a quick look at the menu, I decided to try the Tonkotsu Char-Siu ramen. Co-worker got the spicy miso chicken ramen. Waitress seemed disappointed we weren't ordering any rolls or Izakaya items and kept asking \"that's all? that's all?\" Another awkward moment. We're here for a quick lunch within our lunch hour - not a 3 martini lunch while splurging on the corporate card FFS! While we waited for the ramen I noticed that the music from the speakers was a curious mix of J-Pop and Japanese hard rock and heavy metal - bands like Thee Michelle Gun Elephant - which I don't remember ever hearing at a Japanese restaurant anywhere in the United States nevermind Arizona. It did give the atmosphere of stepping into another country for a moment. I also noticed that the staff were speaking what sounded like Chinese amongst themselves. That explained the earlier awkwardness. When I finally got my ramen, I grabbed my spoon and sipped the tonkotsu broth. It had the tonkotsu flavor alright - a little weak though. Noodles were alright. Char Siu was very flavorful and perfect and so was the menma (bamboo) in the ramen. My only other benchmark for ramen of any kind in the Phoenix metro area is unfortunately Republic Ramen on University - which of course, gets stomped to the curb by this place. Doesn't say much though because most 25 cent ramen packages at the grocery store can do that to Republic Ramen's ramen as well. Let's just say that for now, if I'm craving a bowl of ramen and don't want to cross state lines, this will have to do."}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood Japanese restaurant. They have a great happy hour, the bento boxes are a fantastic deal, sushi is always fresh, ramen, and pork belly are to die for. Service is the absolute best I have ever received at this type of restaurant, ( if they are very busy service is a little slower but still very friendly and accommodating).  Definitely give this place a try, we need to support local businesses doing things right and this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour and everything was great! The service was excellent; everyone was nice and attentive. My wife is pregnant, and there were plenty of cooked options for the sushi. We really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"All I keep seeing are people talking about California in these reviews.    \"OH PHOENIX HAS NOTHING AND L.A. HAS EVERYTHING!\".   \" OH MY, CALI IS THE GREATEST AND I MET GOD THERE AND HE GAVE ME A FOOT RUB WHILE I ATE A BOWL OF RAMEN!\"  \"OH YEAH I MEAN I LOVE HOW I CAN LIVE AND EXIST HERE FOR A REASONABLE PRICE ON A REGULAR WAGE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SHARE A STUDIO APARTMENT WITH 4 OTHER PEOPLE BUT THE SEAFOOD IS LACKING, ONE STAR!\"  I dunno. Maybe you're all snooty bitches.  Maybe I'm a sour puss.  Maybe I'm writing this from the toilet and have nothing better to do than gripe about my most hated of all places.  But that's neither here nor there - what this is about is Dozo, and it's awesome.  Chicken thigh and sirloin beef skewers were amazing.  So tender and grilled just right.  Gotta try the beef tongue next.  Yakisoba was cooked to perfection, the veggies still had their crisp and the flavor was very good.  The ramen is fantastic, plentiful and presented exactly the right way.  Happy hour on Saturday as well, people! Service was great too, we were treated well.  I mean, it's no California..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is lovely. Super clean and modern decor, with a distinct Japanese feel. I had the tonkotsu ramen and I can say it is easily the most authentic and best tasting tonkotsu ramen in Arizona. Better than sushi Ken, republic, cherry blossom, umami (yuck), and even the previous title holding yatai ramen. I can't wait to come back and have the other items."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful spot in Tempe! We arrived on a Saturday night and grabbed the last couple available seats at the sushi counter (around 6:30 - when we left at 8:00 people were waiting for tables). We ordered the shishito peppers, pork ramen, salmon fried rice, and carburetor roll. All were excellent! Service was efficient. We also brought our own wine ($6 corkage fee)."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice decor, reasonable prices. Only place found so far to have breaded chicken sushi the \"Tori roll\".   I feel like we have the best service when the middle-aged woman is our server, as she seems to clarify and get our orders correct. We never have any issues with her on the floor and have an enjoyable experience.  We did have an incident where a young server with a thick accent couldn't understand what we wanted (a pork dish) and brought a fish dish (the next item on the menu below it) to someone who was Allergic to fish. Luckily we determined the error before it was consumed, but WE were still penalized for the error and had to pay for the unwanted dish.  But we keep going back for the tori rolls. so...it wasnt bad enough to drive us away completely. Just left a bad taste in our mouth from a customer service standpoint..."}
{"text":"Good sushi and good noodle dishes. They have a few veg. dishes. They also have a great lunch special in which the chef mixes a few diff types of sushi for you. Its a great way to see what they do best. They have a small restaurant but their is outdoor seating. We will def. be back in the future."}
{"text":"I went here on Labor Day around 6:45. We were a total of 4 and they did not have a seat for us (very small place). No problem, we just waited on the patio. The owner or manager was very friendly and brought the menu and some water out while we waited.   It wasn't too long before we had seats open, and since we've been looking over the menu we had a good idea of what we wanted. Unfortunately, we had to wait almost 30 minutes before the waitress took our order. We tried to get her attention several times but she was too overwhelmed with the work. I think they would benefit from hiring another server, at least for the dinner rush.   The food, however, was DELICIOUS! The Cha-shu ramen I ordered was very thick and flavorful, not at all salty like at most other establishments. I also had the yam and avocado roll, and that too was tasty. Their prices are also very reasonable. I would've given 5 stars if not for the snail service.  I will definitely come back, just not around popular meal times."}
{"text":"Me and my wife shared some sushi and appetizers here and liked everything we tried! Good deals at happy hour too! Me and the wife ate our hearts out for under $30. Spicy tuna and Dozo roll were definitely on point and the service was nice and quick. Good atmosphere too, small but chill! Like I said, only sushi but can't wait to try the yakitori and ramen. Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of Japanese food!"}
{"text":"The food is GREAT!  The service, SLOOOOWWWW!!!!  Its a small place but the food is so good they pack the people in, which is great....for them.......for the guest, it is a practice in patience.  Long wait for drinks and having order taken, once its busy, they wait for sushi is long but worth it.  They have great Ramen too and that comes out fairly quick.  Great place if you are not in a rush."}
{"text":"4.5. But not a 4. Great ramen. Real dashi flavor. Love the skewer menu best in AZ. Check it out. If you don't enjoy food and enjoy your ego stroked then stay away. But if you know what a good hamachi Kama smells like you'll fall in love."}
{"text":"We have since tried new dishes and I got say, I used to think that Cherry Blossom was the best Japanese joint in Phoenix. However, Dozo has definitively own us over. The best Japanese place in town for sure! Their ramens are so flavorful and tasty that it's a must have!"}
{"text":"I have been to Dozo so far about 4 times and I have to say the Ramen is fantastic. I recommend the Tonkotsu Cha Shu Ramen. It is very rich with a buttery garlic taste. The Cha Shu is actually pork belly not pork loin like some other places I have been.  The service is also very good. I have been for both lunch and dinner times. Each time i dined here the server attended to me quickly and they were helpful answering my questions. In addition the food arrived quickly and piping hot!  The price is also very reasonable :)"}
{"text":"The salmon sashimi was so fresh! Like butter. The other sushi rolls were equally delicious with lots of unique ingredients and the menu is big. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Came in lunch to try the ramen. Greeted by a very nice staff and was seated promptly. My wife ordered the Shoyu Ramen and myself the spicy miso Ramen. The cost was $11.95 but for $3.50 more you could add a small order (3 pieces) of perfectly crisp and tasty gyoza and then either choose a milk boba tea or side of rice. Wife chose the drink I chose the rice. WOW - Plenty of food to feed a small army. Now I know when people review Ramen they tend to become very territorial as to what's best in their opinion. Both my wife and I have had Ramen in Victoria, Canada as well as San Diego and all points in between. I must say each of ours were outstanding. Both broth's where very good- just enough salt and the noodles were chewy without being gummy. Decent size menu with a big focus on grilled meats of different cuts. Nice clean and I stress clean dining room - sushi bar area as well. My wife and I pulled up about 10 minutes prior to opening and watched several staff members clean down ever piece of patio furniture and canvas the entire area for any trash. We will be back - Ramen is a must!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here to try some new food. I was not disappointed at all! The food was absolutely amazing, I highly recommend the chicken skin, beef tongue and the ramen. The sushi was also really good, but nothing too special. The atmosphere was really pleasing, it was very clean. Also, the service was amazing. Our waitress was very friendly and extremely helpful in helping us decide what to get. 10/10 experience!"}
{"text":"Food OK. Service slow and inattentive. Others arrive later and get food. Excuse was our order. But our order had all kinds of food. Inexcusable."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good sushi place in Chandler for a while now! Finally found my spot, the sushi was delicious and fresh! The service was great as well.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"This place has some great ramen! I'm always more favored to get tonkotsu and the broth is packed full of flavor and would definitely go here when I'm in the area. It's a bit difficult to choose because there's Hachi ramen across the street and they're also good too. I guess it depends on the busy times."}
{"text":"Great ramen! Nice environment. The service is good. I will definitely come back again with my friends."}
{"text":"Having just recently moved from San Francisco, I was worried about not being able to find quality Japanese /seafood in the desert. No longer! This place isn't just a stand-in for my favorite izkaya places back home, it's a truly authentic Japanese restaurant with a bunch of super tasty dishes that automatically give this place 5 stars. The best part about this place is that they manage to offer a wide variety of menu items without substituting quality. The staff is super nice, the place is really clean, it's conveniently located off Warner Rd, and has plenty of parking. I will definitely be back as I can already tell this will be one of my new favorites in the area."}
{"text":"This little place has become a staple for my family.  Every Wednesday, we enjoy a good bowl of ramen.  Rain or shine, but mostly searing hot Arizona weather, we have to have it.  You will understand when you take the time to try it for yourself.  Just can't skip a perfectly cook ramen especially when you pair it with spicy hot tuna or spicy salmon sushi.  Highly recommended and I strongly suggest that you try it."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times already and I love this place!!  A staple of mine at a Japanese restaurants are salmon skin rolls. I've had that every time I've been there and it's pretty good. Every so often I also like to order tempura udon and here it is just amazing. I like that their happy hour ends at 6:30 because I get off at six and work not too far away. They also have a small bites menu that my friend and I have ordered from. I haven't ordered any alcoholic beverages, but I will be returning and probably soon!"}
{"text":"I took my 11 yr old daughter here to try authentic japanese ramen. We order negima (the chicken skewers) which were amazing. She ordered a california roll which was also delicious. Our orders can out at separate times which is odd here in the US but standard in Japan. My Udon was excellent, she loved her Miso Ramen with shrimp. Both orders were very filling we ended up taking some home to leave room for Mochi ice cream. The restaurant was small but nicely decorated. On a saturday evening the place was full. There was plenty of outdoor seating but summer in AZ is not the time for that. Next month in october it should be lovely. Our order took a long time but the staff was attentive and we were not in a hurry. My daughter suggest that we come every month as a bonding thing and order something new each time. I'm all for that idea,"}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere, family owned, reasonably priced, great friendly service. During the cooler months when the patio opens up, this place is gonna rock. This one goes on the \"regular\" list. Second time we showed up, a bunch of our friends were already there!"}
{"text":"I am with  a group of  seniors for a Romeo lunch  outing. We had one  primary waitress, Yeezel,who did a absolutely  wonderful  job of  serving our group.  The food was very good and the\"view \"  was worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Do you ever have a meal at a restaurant and spend the whole time thinking that you can't wait to come back? I had that feeling during this delicious lunch. I had the Bento box with spicy salmon teriyaki and tempura. It was so delicious I kept thinking about ways I can manage to get here for lunch more often. The service was super friendly and it seemed like a family establishment. I was very happy to enjoy lunch here and I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"My most favorite place to be - it feels like a second home with all of the amazing people working here. The spicy miso ramen is out of this world, I crave it every day! Highly recommend coming here"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Dozo. For my daughter, she craves their rice dishes. And the ramen is solid. My family doesn't like sushi but I'm the exception. Dozo does great sushi, too. But I think my favorite is their barbecued skewers."}
{"text":"This place is honestly have the worst service, THE WAIT IS NOT WORTH IT FOR SOME AVERAGE FAKE JAPANESE FOOD, THEYRE NOT EVEN JAPANESE these people are Chinese. They need to hire a new waitress they're probably family, the waitress took forever when I asked for chili oil, my dad ordered the beef noodle and they didn't have it he asked for same noodle that I had ordered but she wrote it down wrong and ended up giving us attitude. The food quality went down definitely not coming back. It's not good for parties cause they take forever to make the food. OH I CAN HEAR THEM TALKING SHIT ABOUT REMAKING MY DAD FOOD, IM HALF CHINESE THESE IDIOTIC PEOPLE."}
{"text":"I was happy with my special sushi lunch - Soup, house salad, 4 pcs of Nigiri and crunchy California Roll for $10.50! Yes, I do love California Roll. :)  I will be back to try their Ramen Noodles!"}
{"text":"I'm Japanese from Japan and I can attest that this Chinese owned Japanese izakaya is not only unauthentic but also the service is ridiculously slow.  We came on a not so busy early Monday night around 6:15pm and yet it took more than 50 minutes for them to serve us food!! I felt discriminated because the Chinese waitress would serve bento box to white customers who came 20 minutes later than us first while we had to wait nearly an hour for them to bring simple ramen and udon (which are not that hard to make.... 15 min max!!) and yet she still forgot to bring all our order. We decided to cancel the order they forgot to bring because we figured it's gonna take another 20 minutes if we were to wait. The poor female customer sitting next to us didn't even get served until more than an hour later for a mere katsudon ! I also noticed that the waitress didn't clear the messy table next to us until 30 min after the customers left which is not very efficient and gross. The food itself was acceptable but with the service like this I cannot give more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Robert (the main-man chef-owner) runs a top notch shop.  He was awesome in Scottsdale and stepped it up in Tempe.  So glad to have re-found Dozo.  The food is out-freakin standing!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of ramen but this place will be considered when I'm craving it. We were originally here for the takoyaki but ended up trying the ramen just to make sure we don't miss anything. Both the \"pork bone broth\" ramen and the \"extremely spicy\" sure do live up to their description. The pork bone broth is filled with flavor and is extremely rich due to the pork bone being simmered. While the spicy one is not for the weak of heart. Both are very delicious, and the takoyaki is not too doughy which is a big plus for me. I would definitely return here as mentioned and will recommend others to come here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Tonkotsu ramen bowl is always on point. The chef and the rest of the kitchen work hard and you can tell"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch. Fast and friendly service. I will definitely be coming back for more..."}
{"text":"Was craving izakaya type of food so we decided to try this place due to its receiving a lot of good reviews. But we were disappointed for a number of reasons.  When we arrived, we were greeted in a friendly manner and seated right away.  That was nice, but the setting was that of a typical, small teishoku restaurant and not that of the typical izakaya.  No small, low tables with low seats; no low tables with the charcoal grills built into the middle.  I also believe they grill the kushiyaki in the kitchen instead of on the charcoal grills; at least that is what I think because the food has no charcoal flavor.  We were told that they had a big party the previous night and they ran out of most of the beef and chicken types of kushiyaki and did not have any to serve last night --- WTH?  They also had no chicken wings.  That was last night; why didn't the owner/manager make some more immediately this morning?  Pretty lame if you ask me.  We are told we are in luck since it is happy hour time and given a happy hour menu.  Very weak menu -- no \"good stuff\" on the menu, just routine things.  I order my GF a margarita and she says it is OK, although it looks pretty sad.  I try to order a pitcher of beer, but am told that pitchers are not on happy hour, only glasses.......how sad is that?  I order some food for my GF -- edamane, agedashi tofu, and the chicken katsu dinner.  Those were decent and I have no complaint about those dishes.  I ordered shishamo which were two little skimpy fishes, about the size of a #2 pencil.  I also ordered shishito's which were a nice sized ordered, but drenched in a very salty soy based sauce.  They had no yaki onigiri because nobody was ordering it so they took it off the menu....WTH?  Sacrilege!!!  You got rice -- make a rice ball and grill it on the charcoal grill......oh yeah, maybe there is no charcoal grill.  On the \"specials\" blackboard they had aji, which is one of my favorites.  So I order one, sashimi style with the bones and head deep fried.  This one dish was pretty expensive @ $14, and I was disappointed.  The fish was not fresh so the sashimi was mushy and off tasting.  However, they did fry the bones nicely. I also order a buta kushiyaki and that too was disappointing.  Not very good or appropriate piece of pork and just grilled with salt -- no sauce or seasoning on the two sticks.  So all-in-all, I was disappointed and will not be back.  I will keep searching for an izakaya in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"We tried Dozo last weekend and just loved it, the food and service was excellent. My husband accidentally left his wallet there and they were closed the next day, he picked it up on Monday morning and the $375 in cash was still in it, they refused to take a reward. So, wonderful food and great integrity, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my family.  Ordered about 8 items from Izakaya menu and some sushi.  Also ordered a Tonkatsu ramen.  Each grilled meat dish was cooked perfectly with a tasty sauce.  Grilled seafood was very tendor and not over cooked at all.  Sushi was fresh and prepared well.  Ramen was the best I had in the Phoenix area.  My 2nd and 3rd favorite Tonkatsu ramen would be from Sushi Ken in Ahwatukeee and Univeristy Ramen in Tempe.  Some interesting beer/drink choice as well to go with Izakaya.  Will definitely return to try out other stuff."}
{"text":"We have phô for dinner many times while we are out and I wanted to try something new. The ramen at Dozo was great. We started with sesame balls and gyoza and then had mochi ice cream for dessert. The service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I arrived just as they were opening for happy hour and dinner. Service was very good, my waiter was attentive and my appetizers delicious. I got the shrimp shumai. For my entree, I tried the curry chicken katsu. Great portion and very delicious. I like the spicir curries, so next time I'll ask of they can kick it up a bit. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Outstanding Japanese curry and chicken cutlet. As someone who used to live in Japan I know my curry and this was great!  When it isn't scorching hot outside I will be sure to come back for some Ramen too. Great food, quick service."}
{"text":"The skewers came out cold and did not look like it was charcoal and they taste blandddddd..... My ramen bowl has a paper thin broken piece of meat. And no wood ear mushroom.... -_- still, I will admit the broth was light and actually taste okay.  Service took forever"}
{"text":"The place was packed. The customer service was good. It would have been better if they had more servers. But I gave them some slack since I saw a hiring sign. The food was really good. I tried the yakitori of fish balls and chicken hearts. Those were cooked to perfection. I had a few sushi rolls. They were tasty."}
{"text":"Tonkatsu Ramen was delicious but the dragon roll was soggy.  Next time I will stick with the Ramen and skip other menu items.  (Chicken katsu was not impressive either last time I tried it - very thin and not much flavor)."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite restaurants in the valley. The owners are genuinely nice people with great service. The food from the izakaya menu is delicious and fun to order and the sushi is so good (try Escola). Nice, cozy neighborhood Japanese joint for sake bomber, bowl of ramen noodle soup, udon, spicy tuna hand roll, you name it. Everything I tried on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Great place! On the izakaya menu the grilled whole squid, taiwanese sausage, baby octopus are awesome. If feeling adventurous try the Jellyfish salad( really good)  or the Nato (acquired taste).   Love the grilled mackerel fillet on standard menu. Sushi is great, my fave is the Keita Roll. Great service, staff is friendly and just overall consistently good food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Ramen spot. There is so much more as well! Pork Belly app was ridiculous. Also added the pole bowl side and why tasty and a good size. Tried the chicken skin and beef tongue skewers. I enjoyed both."}
{"text":"There are only two Japanese restaurants in Phoenix that I frequent often. This is one of them. My family and I love their takoyaki, yakisoba, katsudon, unagi, and ramen. I'm always happy they have iced green tea available. I look forward to trying more items from their menu."}
{"text":"Small but well appointed place.  The service was very good.  I really enjoyed the happy hour menu and tried the yam and avocado roll.  It was delicious and if I ever went there again I would order 2!  What I wouldn't order is the Ramen.  The flavor was fine but I just did not enjoy the smell.  (I would stick with Republic Ramen or try somewhere else.)  I ordered the soy sauce broth verses the salt broth (shio) with tofu.  There is very few other ingredients."}
{"text":"Pretty average sushi. Service was fine. Nice patio (even if on a parking lot). Prices too high for what it is. End of day these prices are like San Diego or San Francisco for much less quality. Meh."}
{"text":"Decent Japanese place for Arizona. Yakatori was pretty good and the Spicy Miso Ramen was tasty but had the smallest piece of pork ever in it, literally one bite. Biggest gripe about this place here was the beer. Only 1 beer (Sapporo) on tap and it was $6 a glass and was about 1/3 head. For an Izakaya restaurant they should at least know how to pour a beer properly and have at least a few selections. A true Izakaya should be first and foremost about drinking."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Japanese in the Tempe/Ahwatukee area, DOZO is definitely the way to go. It is hidden in a lot where there's not much going on so it is pretty easy to miss but thank goodness for Yelp for helping me find this little gem! It is a tiny restaurant with few tables inside, sushi bar seating as well as generous outside patio seating but I have never seen this place very busy. (Keep in mind their hours, they do close during the day for lunch as some Japanese restaurants do). You are most likely to be seated right away by one of their very kind waitresses. They are really so lovely. They are timely and so attentive. This is what I love about small restaurants. And the rest is as good as it can get. I've always come with the craving for ramen and their special tonkatsu pork is the bomb diggity. I've tried the spicy miso as well but most definitely prefer the tonkatsu flavor over miso. If you are an adventurous eater, they have small plates of what I'm guessing are delicacies of Japan such as beef tongue and octopus (which isn't bad I must say). Last time I came in, I got the chicken katsudon and I killed the whole thing in one sitting. And that's saying a lot because 1, it was a huge portion. An entire cutlet of breaded chicken with lots of rice. OH man was I full and satisfied. The chicken was cooked and breaded to perfection with egg and caramelized onions with an amazing sweet soy based sauce that the rice was drenched in. I finished every last bit of it and I am a tiny girl. I rarely finish my food. The sushi is great as well. Definitely make a visit to this place if you are in the area. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could. This was my first time at Dozo, but according to my friend, the restaurant was under new management for about 6 months now. She told me that the chef was from Thailand, which probably explains the variety of food items that the restaurant offered. This wasn't a typical Japanese restaurant - they had lots of other menus as well.   Dozo had lots of great interesting appetizers - I tried foods that I wouldn't normally have been able to try in typical sushi restaurants. For example, I saw some beef tongues in the appetizer, but I wasn't daring enough to try. Instead, I had the bacon with okra - I never had okra before but it tasted like a chewier and juicier version of cucumber, for a lack of better description. I highly recommend it - I ended up liking it a lot. I also had the Vietnamese sausage which tasted like a less-saltier version of sausage with teriyaki sauce and a different aftertaste. Lastly, I had the squid dish (sorry I'm blanking on the name) - it was shaped into little balls. I posted a picture for reference, just in case you want to try it - that appetizer was great, too.   I ordered the poki tuna don, which was basically white rice with lots of marinated tuna slices. I loved the sesame flavor. My 10 year old friend like the beef bowl, and told me that the kids' size was perfect for her. The Bento box (chicken katsu) came with lots of food as well, including rice, chicken katsu, salad pieces, and other side dishes.   I will come back again for sure, possibly with family. It has unique concepts, and a really pretty outdoors seating area too."}
{"text":"Really great neighborhood Japanese place. Can be a bit pricey for what is offered but definitely a solid and tasty meal."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for delicious ramen for years now. I've had some tasty bowls in Seattle and LA, but never found much luck in Arizona. I usually go to Cherry Blossom in Phoenix for their cha-shu ramen, and it's amazing...but I really wanted s good bowl of ramen with all the fixings. Egg, nori, narutomaki, pickled bamboo, ginger, you name it, I wanted it. This place delivers exactly that!   I ordered the tonkatsu cha-shu ramen. The broth was buttery and had a wonderful garlic taste to it. The noddles were cooked wonderfully (though I still prefer Cherry Blossoms noodles), and the fixings were just a lovely added bonus. This stuff comes so close to the ramen I had in LA last year and it is to die for. The service was great and the staff is friendly. I am so happy I found this place and decided to give it a shot. Will DEFINITELY be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually take the time to review restaurants, but this time I feel compelled to do so. This place is outstanding. The ramen soup is absolutely amazing. I love their spicy tuna rolls. Excellent service, super friendly sushi bar staff. Overall, 5 stars in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu ramen is the best I've had in Arizona so far. The broth isn't greasy like most of the other ramen places and they add bamboo shoots which gives it a nice touch. I enjoy coming here for dinner for the izakaya menu. The baby squid skewers are hands down my favorite. I would give them five stars, however, they're not really dog friendly. They do accommodate meaning they sat us in the corner of the patio and had us tie our puppy to the outer rail. Other than that, the food is phenomenal and the service is prompt."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise!  Looked on Yelp for a sushi bar in the area, and tried DOZO. Their extensive menu was so impressive!  They have so many rare fish you don't normally see on the menu.  Service was excellent!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken katsu and sesame seed ball are very good. Bento box dinners are great; they give you a good amount. My husband likes the philly roll."}
{"text":"Food, and service is good here! I enjoyed my Tonkotsu ramen, and baby octopus! Its got a nice atmosphere inside and outside. Great place for catching up with loved ones! Night time is prettier for sure outside!"}
{"text":"For those of you who aren't familiar, izakayas are more drinking establishments than restaurants.  Usually you and your buds drink sake or beer and eat a bunch of small snacks to accompany it.  The best snacks to me are items off of the grilled menu (yakitori) - usually chicken skewers.  When paired with an Asahi superdry, something magical happens.  Does this place serve world class yakitori?  No.  But the fact that there is a place in the Valley to scratch this culinary itch is easily worth 4 stars in my book.     My rec:  GO!  With coworkers or friends.  Order a japanese beer (preferably Asahi Super Dry).  Order off of the Yakitori menu - try at least one unusual meat - Beef Tongue is incredible.  Say \"Kanpai!\" a lot.  Drink more beer."}
{"text":"This was a chance find that I really enjoyed.  I was  bit worried after looking at their menu that they were trying to be the \"jack of all trades\" and Master of none in regard to izakaya style food, but it was good enough that I went twice during my short trip to the area.    I highly recommend the various yakatori items.  The first night I went I mainly had those.  Nicely done.  Be sure to try the pork belly and the mackerel.  I really wanted some Hamachi Kama but they were out.  The chicken harts were good, but not the best I every had but way above average.  A nice selection of sake was a welcome sign as well.  The next night when I went back for a second go round I wanted to try the ramen.  It was fine.  I had the Tonkatsu style, which I typically prefer.  Theirs was good, but it lacked the richness I come to look for in this style.  Noodles were nice, egg was cooked properly, but the broth was missing something.  Not saying it was bad, just not up to what I've come to expect for this type of ramen.    Service was friendly and excellent.  Prices are reasonable, I plan to go again when ever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on Saturday and were happy with the experience overall.  They are still working out the kinks here and there, and the restaurant is a bit on the small side.  However the food choices offered are good.  We focused on the lunch menu which provided a good variety of sushi and cooked food.  I tried the sushi combo which I found to be a decent lunch portaion.  Overall I would return, though I could see the place filling up fast during a weekday lunch given the small size."}
{"text":"We've heard so much about this place from our family and friends, so we decided to try it out.  We arrived when it first opened at 5pm and were greeted right away.   We ordered:  (2) Shrimp Shumai - I was not impressed, I thought it was going to taste and look like the shu mai at a dim sum restaurant, but it wasn't. This is something I wouldn't order here.   Tori Roll - We ordered this because it was on Happy Hour and it was an \"okay\" roll. I probably wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad I tried it.  Salmon Sashimi - My husband loves this. Every time we go out for sushi, this is one of his go to's.  Chicken Heart BBQ skewer - I didn't try it because quite frankly I'm not a big fan, but my husband loved it. He said there was a lot of flavor there.  Baby Octopus BBQ skewer - Very delicious and tender!   Taiwanese Sausage skewer - It was sweet, but not overly too sweet. It was pretty tasty.  Spicy Miso Ramen w/ Pork - The broth was delicious and even better with the chili oil. The only downside for my husband were the veggies. He said there were way too many in the bowl.   Katsu Don Rice Bowl - There wasn't anything too exciting about this bowl. The bowl consisted of rice, breaded chicken, eggs and veggies.   The service was great! Our waitress and even the cooks came by to make sure we were doing okay and that we were comfortable. We'll be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices! Highly recommend for lunch the bento box. Great spicy tuna roll and spicy beef teriyaki!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty versatile sushi/asian food place.   In my most raw opinion, sushi is mediocre at its best. Period. So taking that into consideration, it was generously decent here. I tried their \"Mango Tango Salmon\" roll and didn't like it. I recommend getting fried/baked rolls because fresh sushi is hard to come by here in the desert lol   Their Spicy Miso Ramen was also okay for me but I have been much spoiled in the city of Torrance, apparently \"Japan's sister city\" in California so you may want to give it a try.   Despite all this mediocrity, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was very cozy. Also, their Tempura Udon and Beef Tongue yakitori were perfection!  Definitely give it a chance and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! The bento box is a great deal and super delicious. The service is very friendly. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"A hidden Tempe treasure.  The sushi was fresh and beautifully prepared. The happy hour menu has variety and a little something for all. Special  authentic food for those loving that food. On the negative side, the seating is not private and comfortable. The tables will benefit from an interior redesign. Server was attentive and knowledgeable. Coming back."}
{"text":"Wow, I absolutely love this place. It's taken me a really long time to find a good ramen spot but I think I've finally found it. The spicy miso ramen is pure perfection. It's a bowl of delight from the noodles and broth down to the delicious soft boiled egg. They also have other yummy food options so if you have someone that isn't into ramen they can order a bento box, sushi, etc.     I've come in during lunch and a busy Friday night and both times I've gotten great, friendly service. Definitely will be back for more heavenly bowls of ramen soon."}
{"text":"Definitely on the lower end of Japanese places that I've been to but at least the prices weren't too bad during happy hour. The spicy tuna is actually spicy but to an extent that it doesn't have very much tuna flavor. I also got the pork tonkatsu with curry. It was adequate."}
{"text":"I like this hidden gem in chandler area! Me and my friend had been craving for Japanese food and I have decided to give it a try. We went there at lunch time, not super packed so we were seated quickly. I ordered lunch special ginger pork bento. It is a decent portion for lunch break which means it is fulfilling but not stuffing. Will be back for their skew bbq next time?"}
{"text":"Excellent resto for fresh fish and izakaya! Go with a date and dare each other to have chicken heart and cartilage kebabs. True test of compatibility."}
{"text":"Hang out there with friends last night. It was a great place to talk with friends. The food was good but it's not a \"cheap\" place."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place closed on mill so my friend and I decided to come here and give this place a try. The restaurant is kinda small and there is limited seating inside, but they do have an outside seating area so it's not to bad. We started off with some Matcha Teani (soju mix with matcha green tea, splash lemon juice and mint schnapps ) & Lovely DoZo (soju with sky pineapple , triple sect, red wine and sweet & sour). Both drinks tasted good but we really couldn't taste the alcohol . Then we shared a tuna poke salad which I enjoyed but the poke was thinly sliced. I didn't necessarily hate it but when I think of poke I expect bigger chunks almost cubed like pieces and the small slices of poke was ok. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with pork and my friend order the spicy miso with pork. Both were pretty good and the flavorful. The spicy miso could have been spicier but my tolerance for spicy food is pretty high so it wasn't spicy to me. Overall the place was clean, our server was nice and I would come back to try some of their other food."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister to have dinner. It was my first time. I ordered their sirachi bowl, decent. One of the fish smelt a little fishy so I didn't it the macrel. Their skewers is very juicy and tasty so get that if you don't like raw food. This place is very small so stay away from bringing groups of 6 here. I would say this place is good for intimate conversations and small groups. Their food prices is fair so try it out!!"}
{"text":"Great place, we stopped by for some food and it was a wonderful atmosphere. Food was great my wife was craving sushi and it hit the spot. Not to mention the prices are good. Will come back here for sure."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that the place is very clean, modern, and the server we had was great! She was Very polite and attentive. Now, for the food, we had some sushi, the Spicy Miso and Cha Shu Ramen with chicken and pork respectively. The portions were big, the flavors were amazing, and everything seemed fresh! We also had the mochi and the non-dairy Coffee ice cream for dessert and both of those were great as well. We are definitely coming back and just wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch, and I will say that every time I have been pleased with what I have.   I always go for the sashimi or sushi that does not have all  the whatever mixed in it.   That's what I'm used to and that's what I like.  Pleezzzz!   What is that stuff that is mixed with the fish that people seem to like??!!   Anyway, I have had the assorted sashimi dish, which always has an assortment of different fish, and it's always fresh.   Or I have the sushi combo.  With that dish I eat the sushi, and I give the \"California roll\" to my companion.  Yes, the restaurant is a bit on the small side; therefore, we go early so we don't have to wait.   Waiting at lunch time equates to eating somewhere else since my lunch companion is on a time clock.   The staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and the Ramen was excellent.  Total for four for lunch was pretty good as well.  I like this place and it turns out it is very close to my job.  Who knew."}
{"text":"I truly wanted to love this place since it's conviently next to where I live. I ordered spicy miso ramen with chicken karrage and I did not like it at all.  The chicken was pretty tasteless but they do provide a dipping sauce for it. The ramen broth wasn't good either.   I was planning on giving this place another try until I discovered that my broth had a piece of a STEEL WOOL scrubber  in it as I was swallowing it!!!! Im so glad that this happened to me instead of my 2 year old daughter that was sharing my meal.  I immediately called the restaurant when I informed them of this they offered me a free ramen.  If you want awesome ramen, head to Sushi Ken or Fujiya Martket! Fujiya Market has the best Ton Katsu Ramen but it's only served on Saturdays @ noon in very limited quantities."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat. Went there with a few coworkers during lunch break. Will go back FORSURE! Next time I'll take the wife. Great affordable prices good food."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding, I enjoyed the grilled dishes from the Izakaya menu. Tuna Poki was good, pork belly was tasty, but the sushi rice in the two rolls we got was a little off. Good sake selection and some nice beers, everyone was friendly. It was a Tuesday night so not busy, all we had to do was glance at someone working in the dining room and they were right there to get us whatever we needed. I will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love,love, love this restaurant! I have lived in AZ for over ten years and gave up on finding an authentic Japanese restaurant years ago. I was so excited and pleasantly surprised to stumble upon DOZO. Fantastic variety on the menu and food is fresh. Beware...this place is popular. We were there on a Wednesday night and there wasn't an empty seat in the restaurant. Service was a bit slow because of it but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Well the staff wasn't very friendly to me when I first walked in...shoving me in a corner table for 2 when pretty much the whole dining room was open.  I asked to move to a bigger table and they told me no  so I guess that set the tone.  I got the house ramen and thought it was average at best...likewise with the tempura...I wouldn't go out of my way to return here especially after the service."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Got the tempura udon and it was tasty! So was the uni and surf clam nigiri"}
{"text":"Everything I've had is delicious. Happy hour is big fun to try everything. Soooo good!!  If I lived closer this would make it to my favorites list...however my last visit was not as great as the previous three, they used minced tuna in my maki roll.  I found a new love closer to home... Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here multiple times over the past 3months and have never been disappointed with the food or the service. Recently, my brother & sister in law were visiting from NC and we went to DOZO because of their menu variety & food quality...again - we were completely satisfied & our guests were completely amazed. This visit: spicy edamame, sunomono, Poki tuna salad, Escolar & Hamachi sashimi, Keita roll and Spicy Miso ramen with pork - all shared.They even sliced an avocado for my 8 month old nephew. Go to this restaurant if you value quality & like different things."}
{"text":"I'm on a quest to look for the best ramen place in Arizona..unfortunately this isn't it :(  I tried their spicy miso pork ramen and my husband tried their shio chicken ramen. My broth tasted ok but for something that claimed to be spicy..it wasn't spicy at all...which is fine but it's also lacking a lot of flavor. Same with my husband's shio broth..it wasn't very flavorful. The chicken in my husband's ramen was tasteless. The pork in my ramen was supposed to be the star of the dish but it wasn't good like other ramen places I've been to.   Overall food was okay. Service was fine, too. Will I come back? Probably not. But I guess it's good to try."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was bad. Stood in front for 10 minutes before I was acknowledge."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We are lucky to live close and have been here a few times. The prices are a tiny bit high as people noted, but reasonable for Japanese food / Ramen, I think. I love that they have a ton of different choices for ramen, including broth; and I can get a vegetarian option. Actually, they have a ton of vegetarian options in general here. My parents love the pork and pork bone ramen, and have tried a few of their rice bowl and tempura dishes.  The restaurant is clean and well organized; everyone is friendly (we usually get take out so I can't comment too much on the service). A definite place to try if you like ramen and you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Yelp really came through on this restaurant!    We started of with the Hot Rock: essentially mushrooms stuffed with crab and tuna, fried, and topped with eel sauce. They serve four bite size treats that leave you wanting more.   Next was the garlic fried hot peppers followed by an egg that unfortunately I can recall what they called it. For sushi we went with the mango tango roll. They ran out of mango and asked if we would mind avocado. The pieces were not to large, and were surprisingly delicate.  The spicy Ramen with tofu was right on. The noodles had a great texture, and the broth hit the spot. The kids had the chicken katsu bento box.  It was way too much food but well put together. The chicken was not greasy. Boba tea was just ok.  The boba was mushy on the outside and a bit hard in the center.    The ambiance was kool, the music was not too loud, and there was a good mix of people."}
{"text":"The flavors were seriously delicious. I had the poki and hamachi kama. So nice to eat somewhere that serves these options and happy they were delicious. I was looking forward to some yakitori because I haven't had any since eating it in Tokyo so it was refreshing to see somewhere in the valley serving it. However, I'm not sure if it's only available for dinner but the food was good enough to where I will come back and find out. Love supporting local!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that this place was so terrible even though it had 4 stars on yelp. I'm guessing the other reviewers have never been to a real izakaya. The food here was honestly pretty bad. Negima is standard izakaya food. Grilled chicken and scallions. The chicken was rock hard and not very flavorful. The scallions were over cooked and dried. If you can't serve a decent negima, you shouldn't call yourself an izakaya.   The rest of the food we ordered was just as disappointing. Ramen, hamachi kama, and sushi rolls were all mediocre at best. The waitress was not friendly at all, almost to the point of coming off as rude. The only redeeming aspect of this restaurant is their cheap beer. But I can drink beer at home and microwave better food than this place serves. I live within a 5 min walk to this place and I will never be back."}
{"text":"Wow what a pleasant surprise in Tempe for some legit Japanese food. Not to be a ramen snob, but I set my expectations pretty low for ramen joints in the US...but I take it for what it's worth. I like to base ramen places on how good gyoza is at the place. Gyoza and ramen go hand in hand like yakitori and beer. So I was very happy to have some perfectly lightly pan fried gyoza. There are several types of ramen: shoyu (soy base), miso, shio (salt base), and tonkotsu (pork base). Tonkotsu is my favorite and I was not disappointed. Best part it comes decked out with all the toppings and an egg which I'm used to paying extra for.   Service was pretty slow but it seems like a newer restaurant and we did come on a Friday night. Still no excuse to wait 20 min for water after being seated. Also for an izakaya I'm surprised there are no sake choices other than the house sake.  Overall, not the best I've ever had, but definitely pretty legit Japanese food with some izakaya food too. I can't wait to come back and try the yakitori and karage I miss from Japan! Dozo!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like okra but wrapped with bacon it's a different story, love it!! They have Sapporo beer on draft but ask for a cold glass unless you like warm beer, lol. Overall 5 stars for the food and ambiance, that is because I love asians, lol."}
{"text":"I know this place is a sushi place, but, their chicken is amazing and fresh, I need to go back. Their soup is perfect for any day, & their plates are bigger than expected."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this is the only izakaya in the valley. Anyway this is pretty cool place for sure. They serve fresh asahi draft for good price during happy hour 5 to 630. They don't have great menu for happy hour but their menu and price is generally reasonable. Food was really good. We had squeeze with tare seasoning which is soy sauce flavor. Squeeze was surprisingly fresh! Next time I'll try more seafood there. All chicken was delicious. Beef tongue was really really good. Much better than I thought  If you wanna try very Japanese style light food and drinks, I really recommend here!"}
{"text":"Highway robbery! Saw a pic of their caterpillar roll online and was looking forward to it. Also ordered the spicy yellowtail roll. Caterpillar roll was barely the size of a quarter and the yellowtail was about the size of a nickel.  For $10.25 and $5.95, expected a little more fish and rice.  Spicy miso ramen with chicken looked like some hot oil was drizzled on the surface. Three eighth inch mini medallions of chicken,  $7.75. So not worth the trip,  left unfulfilled. Worst dining experience ever."}
{"text":"I like this place. It is clean and well organized. The Ramen was great while the Don-Katsu was not so pleasant. I would come back for Ramen and Tacoyaki. The service was ok. The price was little bit expensive but fair considering it is Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Small but elegant atmosphere. I highly recommend the spicy miso ramen. The hot edamme was awsome. The sushi is fresh and priced at $4.50 a roll during happy hour 5 to 6:30 pm. The service is unbelievably friendly. Once you try it you'll  pass it on to your friends it's that good, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I thought their scottsdale location was pretty good but this place is unbelievable!!! The restaurant is gorgeous,  new, great outdoor area and bar, and the location is so easy to access now not far from highways and the whole southeast valley.   The Food Is fresh, Tasty And affordable. The drinks have the typical selection you would expect at this type of place. The sushi is perfectly balanced and the tapas and hot items are flavorful with great texture. I think this place is going to really get popular so get in now while people still figure it out...no wait and the service was spot on. You can tell it's locally and family owned as they care about every detail."}
{"text":"This review us only for the Tonkotsu ramen. After seeing reviews for Dozo Izakaya I decided to check em out. I saw they had ramen and udon (never really seen that at an Izakaya) but thought what the heck can't be worse than Republic Ramen (nastiest ramen ever). I walked in and the lady who greeted me was very nice, I ordered my tonkotsu ramen and waited to see what it was all about. I am really picky when it comes to ramen (I go to Kurume Japan about once a year and all over Kyushu to eat ramen). In comparison to the ramen in Arizona I must say it is the best here. In California I don't know if I would order it...  The broth was ok but felt like something was missing, the noodles were cooked well but not the right kind of noodles... It was over all ok and I might order it if I'm not going to California or Japan anytime soon. For me they will be a place i can eat ramen without being utterly disappointed. I'm sure many people will like it! As for me it's ok, cuz I'm picky as hell. I want to try other stuff here and I'm sure I will. This is the first place where I am actually willing to return to in Arizona. The service helped a lot and gave them the extra star.  I want to try some other stuff they have and I will update as I try their other items. Give em a try"}
{"text":"Great selection, the nigiri is done properly.  The ramen is delicious and authentic.   Tried the Dynamite, Four Seasons and Tuna Lover rolls, all were good -- not amazing, but enjoyable.   When they get busy things get chaotic, but they were quick to communicate updates."}
{"text":"As a Japanese person I am always looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant. This place was a major disappointment. This restaurant is a Chinese restaurant trying to be a Japanese restaurant. Tonkotsu ramen was wrong in every sense, wrong broth, wrong chashu, & wrong menma.  Gyozas were more like Chinese dumplings (they are mostly pan fried at ramen shops in Japan not deep fried), sauce for agendashi dofu was not right either.  All wait staff were nice (but slow), I just feel deceived about the food.    I will not be retuning to dozo."}
{"text":"we had the salmon sashimi. it was NOT sushi quality and left a bad taste in my mouth. service was good but chefs were very slow."}
{"text":"Very long wait for food even though there weren't that many people. Servers were indifferent. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is not worth of your money! It was our first time and definitely our last time after being told we couldn't be seated because they had to keep their seats open to their \"regular customers\". So disappointed, we really felt discriminated."}
{"text":"Great place for ramen, i tried the tonkotsu and have had the spicy miso before as well. Both were delicious and good sized. The tonkotsu was probably my favorite so far.   I also tried the spicy edamame which has a different type of red chili paste than i have had before but it was very good.  They do you have a nice menu of small grilled items, I got one of the baby squid it was really good and I'm interested to try some of the other grilled items they have.   They have a sushi menu as well I tried some nigiri and one or two of their sushi rolls. Shrimp tempura was different then I have had at other places. I'm not sure it was my favorite. But the nigiri was really good.   I will definitely be back here, this is probably one of the top two ramen places I have been to In The Valley."}
{"text":"I do Like the food here. However the service is not good. My friend and I came here one night. It was not my first time there. And the service is usually very good. The lady who sat us, came and asked us what we wanted to drink. We were ready to order our food as well, so we let her know that. She said she wasn't our waiter, so couldn't take out orders, then left. It took 30mins for the guy who I guess is our actual waiter to come and take our drink and food order. Then we got our food before our drinks. 45mins after."}
{"text":"Best gyoza I've ever had. Sushi and Ramen were good. Service was very attentive. Nice outdoor patio in the front."}
{"text":"I loved my experience here. With all of the different small plates and unique choices it was a lot of fun. My favorite was the takoyaki and the grilled squid! A small restaurant and we got there just in time before the crowds started coming in. The servers were great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When in Chandler and in need of a wonderful bowl of Ramen this is the place. If your an egg fan these guys have it down. The Sashimi and Sushi looks great as well but I have not tried it yet. The beef stew is also very good."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  The service is incredibly slow. We  waited for any item in our order for 45 minutes with a half empty restaurant.  Knowing we were late, we tried to check what items were not being cooked yet in order to cancel them and just eat what was ready.  When the sushi chef found out he cancelled all our order and pretty much kicked us out.   Wouldn't be back even if they paid me to go."}
{"text":"I saw this new place in my area and we went to try it out since we felt like Asian food. It's small and has a cute little patio. Modern Asian flair on the decor. We were greeted and seated by the waitress who recommend the pork bone broth ramen to me and my friend had the bento box. The bento box was beautiful and had quite a bit if food I really liked that. The ramen was very tasty and amazing it was actual pork vibe broth. It did take a few minutes but I can see that they take their time putting the plates together that's the reason why."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Japanese food! The Bento boxes for lunch are a great deal. Spicy Beef Teriyaki is delish:)"}
{"text":"Dozo Izakaya 440 W. Warner Road, Tempe, 85284  Our group arrived at 6:00 and was promptly seated. This is a relatively small restaurant and they had three large groups all at the same time, which made service a tad slow.  Drink orders were taken, and I had a wonderful cup of hot green tea (possibly Genmai Cha) which had a nutty flavor to it. Over the course of the meal I think I drank at least 4 cups of it, it was so good.  For the starter, I ordered the Baked Green Mussels - Very nicely made - not smothered in sauce like some places do. We were off to a good start.  Next I tried some of the sushi. Because it was Eel Day in Japan I ordered Unagi (freshwater eel). It was nicely presented with the proper sauce on top and still nice and warm. Next was Tako (octopus). It was cut nice and thin so that it was not chewy at all and had nice flavor. I ordered Tamago (egg omelet sushi) and Inari (Tofu pouches filled with sweet rice), but never got to taste them because a number of my companions grabbed them before I could! They loved them.  Because happy hour was not over until 6:30 and we arrived at 6:00, I ordered a California Roll and a Crunch Spicy Tuna Roll at a reduced price. Both rolls were nicely made and of a good size. Special kudo's for the crunch roll which was extra delicious and had wonderful flavor.  Finally, I got to the Izakaya Menu. In Japan, Izakaya shops are known for small plates usually served with good cold beer. Most often they serve Yakitori which are individual small pieces of chicken on skewers, grilled over special charcoal and coated with a flavorful glaze.   The waitress brought out a large assortment of them for me. The Sunagimo (chicken gizzard) was nicely chewy, and the Hatsu (chicken hearts) melted in my mouth. The Negima (chicken breast with green onion) which is very popular in Japan was excellent and the Tori Momo (chicken thigh) was delicious. The Teba (chicken wings) were nicely cooked and had just a touch of spice to them and the Tori Kawa (chicken skin) was so good it brought tears to my eyes. At every bite I was reminded of eating in Japan because the food was so authentic.  Lastly, I had Tako Yaki (Octopus flour balls), a favorite street food in Japan. They were nicely made with a hardened outer shell, a type of bread filling, and a piece of octopus in the center. It had some Japanese mayonnaise over the top along with some bonito flakes. It was so good.  My ending bite was Saba (seasoned raw mackerel sushi) which was some of the best I have ever had.  Companions (6 of them) had some wonderful super light tempura, as well as a Curry Katsu (pork cutlet curry) and a Katsu Don (Panko breaded pork cutlet over rice with egg and sweet onions).  The restaurant was nice and clean, and while service could have been better, one has to take into account that they were trying to handle 3 large groups at one time.  4 stars for outstanding food, cleanliness, and trying their best to serve three large groups in a small restaurant. I will definitely be coming back to eat here again and again."}
{"text":"Another great find in the Valley.  Good fresh sushi and a good kitchen for hot foods.  Service was friendly and the decor was nice.  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Dozo! Go ahead and make your way in to this cute little restaurant where seats are limited. A great place to eat but make sure you plan ahead. We arrived hungry and was seated at the bar area. It didn't take too long for us to get our order. Which is pretty good considering they are jam packed. Best dish of the night was the pork belly. You can't go wrong with this dish. Worst dish, unfortunately, was the spicy miso ramen. I wasn't a fan of the bamboo shoots. It gave a slightly weird aroma that I couldn't get over. That's just me but everything else was good.   I'll definitely be back. Their grilled items are delicious!!"}
{"text":"An izakaya in the Phoenix area? Excellent! We came here on a Friday night, and due to the liliputian space inside (I think there are only 4 tables or so in the restaurant) we were limited to outside seating. Snagging the last outside table available, we browsed through the menu after the waitress came over to take our drink order.  We ordered a vast quantity of food, enough to feed quite possibly a small army. We arrived just a few minutes before happy hour ended at 7 P.M., so we were lucky enough to partake in happy hour bites as well as regular dinner items. Our array of food included takoyaki, grilled meats, oyako don, spicy miso noodle soup with tofu, \"The hot rock\", sashimi, agedashi tofu, and a massive array of sushi rolls. Out of all the items, my favorites were the takoyaki and the spicy noodle soup. The takoyaki tasted freshly made, with a nice crispy outer shell and big chunks of octopus. The spicy noodle soup had perfectly cooked noodles, with a light broth. The sashimi was fresh, and while the rolls we had were cheap (Approximately 5-6 dollars per roll), you get what you pay for since they were plentiful numbers of them, but they tasted just OK, nothing special. The hot rock was an interesting creation, which I enjoyed. It had a shitake mushroom base, and was topped with cooked spicy tuna, crab, and eel sauce.  Service was friendly, but due to the popularity of the restaurant (There were a lot people waiting inside, and a huge line of people waiting outside the restaurant as more time progressed during our meal), our waitress was a bit absent minded about getting items for us and checking up on us.   The owner is Taiwanese, so the menu isn't strictly Japanese by authenticity standards. Just think of it as Japanese with some Chinese flair. :)  I'll come back here if I'm wanting good takoyaki and other small bites, and if I'm planning on eating here at a less busier time. If you do come at a typically busy time, you've been warned about the wait and limited seating!  Overall, 3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"This place was nice inside, small but not crammed. It took awhile for us to get service after we were seated but once we got our drink orders in, everything ran smoothly from there. If you're a fruity drinker like myself, I recommend the Pink Geisha, this drink can be dangerous, it tastes so good you just want more and more. The food was really good. I ordered Gyoza but only got to eat one, as my husband and son gobbled down the rest, I can only assume they enjoyed it. My husband got the spicey Miso soup with chicken, which he really liked because it wasn't greasy like all the other places we've tried. Our son got the regular Miso soup with chicken, he loved it so much he ordered a side of rice so he could mix it with the rest of his broth and finished it. I had the Sho-Yu ramen, also with chicken, I also enjoyed my food very much, down to very lazy drop.  Definitely will be coming back for more of that drink plus, I really want to try their soba!!"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I have found in the area...I think they use sun noodles which is fantastic and they don't over cook them like some places in the valley. I had the spicy miso which tasted really good...the egg wasn't as soft boiled as I would like but this place is doing their ramen right go check it out...note this review is only for the ramen"}
{"text":"I go here a lot for lunch. After sitting at the bar, where the fish cooler is kept, I smelt a rank fish smell waft out of it. I've been served very 'fishy' sushi and sashimi several times. I eat a lot of sushi and it's never suppose to smell or taste fishy, that's a sign it's not fresh. When I am eating raw food, it better be fresh and not make me sick.  They serve ramen and teriyaki bowls among other things. None of the food was that great, Also they charge premium prices. There is definitely better places..."}
{"text":"There were multiple reasons why I loved this place!   I have been wanting to try ramen for AGES but I'm not a big pork eater (I basically never eat it), and I didn't want my ramen to have pork broth. I love that this place had many different options!! Even vegetarian for my veggie friends! I got the Spicy Miso, which was delicious but a bit too spicy for me so I added some soy sauce. Next time I might try the regular Miso and add some spice but the Spicy Miso was delicious with lots of flavor! I added shrimp to my bowl.  I also loved their service. The server and the other employees were SO incredibly nice and attentive. My friend and I came one hour til closing time (sorry!!) and usually some employees will be hasty or rude if you do that, but not this place! They were kind and allowed us time to order whatever we wanted! My friend and I had literally the exact same order: Thai Iced Tea with Boba, Shrimp Spicy Miso Ramen, One Spicy Salmon Roll (we split it), and One Green Tea Ice Cream (we split it). It was all delicious, I highly recommend any of those items.  Next up were the prices which were AMAZING. Also, the place was so kind and didn't charge us for the ice cream! I paid only $17 for all of that ^^ !!!!!!and the ramen is HUGE! We put it in a to go box LOL   This place was also clean and felt super authentic! I had such a great experience trying real ramen (Not Republic Ramen, ew) for the first time!!   Thank you so much DOZO Izakaya I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is my weekly ramen/sushi spot! There hasn't been a thing on the menu that I've ordered and didn't love! My go to is their spicy miso ramen, spicy tuna roll and/or their poki tuna roll. I like to visit during their lunch time because they have a great special on ramen + sushi together. Their bento boxes are great as well! Ryan, our usual waiter is awesome! He always remembers what my boyfriend, sister and I orders and also is very patient with us when we ask to change the TV to baseball. Because this cute little restaurant is little, table waits + dinner rushes can be lengthy (my only complaint), however, the wait is always worth it! Highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here after work for an early dinner. I was craving sushi and saw the yelp reviews were good. I tried their scallop appetizer to start and got two rolls. The appetizer was really very good, it came in a big seashell! I would absolutely get that again. The rolls were ok, nothing amazing but pretty good. I tried two classics; the philly roll and the spicy tuna roll. Both were on their happy hour menu, yay for discounts! They were good but too warm. I expected them to be cold since they weren't baked or fried. That was the only thing I didn't like... which leads me to wonder how cold are they keeping their fish? But I didn't get sick or anything and I'm hoping it was a fluke so I would go back and try them again. Also service was friendly, a little slow, but that was ok, I was enjoying a slow paced evening to start my weekend."}
{"text":"We tried this establishment twice. First time we had two different ramen. Both very salty.   This time, I ordered the bento box with chicken teriyaki and philly roll. I feel like I just ordered food from costco. The chicken tasted just like the Costco ready cooked salad grilled chicken you can buy. It was dry and old chicken. The philly roll had small thin pieces of smoked salmon, like the ones you can buy from Costco. By far, the smallest bento box I've ever had. Salad and miso soup were good though.   Takoyaki. You can play the game \"where's the octopus\" because there is no octopus. And they only give you 4.   Curry ramen was plain and watery today.   Establishment is clean and servers are very polite.   We really tried to like this restaurant. However, I think the quality of the food can be upgraded."}
{"text":"This place is great! Hidden place found on yelp and not a disappointment. Great for kids and groups. Great environment and service. Loved everything sushi and ramen. Must try!"}
{"text":"To start, we were happy to see that they were not sold out of pork belly bun ( even though the sign outside said they were). it was delicious we wanted to order more!! My girlfriend ordered the Tan Tan noodle and her broth was ver yummy and the egg was perfect! I had a bento box with pork katsu and spicy tuna roll- I loved the variety and it was just enough to fill me up! The only negative thing was the pitcher of beer. When the lady poured our beer out of the pitcher, the entire glass was full of foam. So they had to wait to drink it until most of the foam went away... Which was a little disappointing. My girlfriend also ordered the chicken heart and chicken liver skewers which I'm not personally to thrilled about but she loved them so that's all that matters :) we will for sure be back!! we will just order our beer bottled next time :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night before my flight home to SFO (ten minutes from airport). There's a parking lot and outdoor seating. My boyfriend and I got seated right away around 6:30pm and ordered with a pencil on their paper menu. We got served the ramen first and then the yakitori. We both had the tonkatsu ramen, which was rich in flavor, but we added chili powder and oil too - and that made it perfect! We got the yakitori of squid legs and chicken gizzards while eating our ramen. They sold out on the beef tongue which was disappointing but eating the yakitori definitely brought my rating down for this restaurant. They tasted over cooked with more of a charred/burnt flavor than the sauce and meat itself. I would come here only for ramen next time. They also have 5-6:30pm happy hour, which we made it to but didn't want anything off that menu (which included rolls and alcoholic drinks). Service was quick and ramen isn't bad so 3.5 stars if I could rate with halvesz"}
{"text":"Fantastic family place, with lots of appetizers and fab pork ramen bowl with best broth ever. And super cheap! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Their pan fried gyoza is so good! I can't do nori in my sushi, so I love the fact that they have soy paper!  The crazy roll and gyoza are my go to!"}
{"text":"Came here to try their ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu and spicy miso. Both pretty good. The broth was flavorful. Ramen had a more chewy consistency but not bad at all. The hospitality is so awesome here! Love the servers! Super polite and friendly. FYI, if you're going for the yakitori, they only serve that in the PM. Overall, a legit place especially for a city not known for Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Cozy. Delicious. Excellent service. Happy hour specials are quite reasonable. Wait, there's takoyaki too! My new go to."}
{"text":"Been here Saturday for the first time w friends from Malayesia. First for them as well. Loved it. Small and intimate place. Really busy. Very clean which is super important if I eat sushi! Enjoyed everything. Great service."}
{"text":"I could spend a lot of money here every week if I lived nearby. Not only because the Japanese food is my favorite but nearly everything is a la carte. I have had ramen here a couple of times, but the true stars of the menu are the grilled meats on skewers. These are really authentic Japanese street food that you don't find in many restaurants.  By the way, ramen here is excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant of all times. My son loves all things Japanese so we went her to celebrate his best language student award. I thought I would just get a little miso soup but ended up eating everything! My son had steak and sushi and I, being a vegetarian, at two kinds of soup, cucumber, and California roll. The ice tea was great too. Great service-lots of fun."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good... We ordered the spicy miso ramen and yakisoba.. My BF ordered the pork belly buns which was on their special for the day.. The pork belly itself was pretty good but wished they added more meat.."}
{"text":"Decent ramen, horribly slow service.  Came here primarily for the ramen and the fact that they serve Yakitori. Arrived around dinner time to a full house, patio and interior but found it's business due to the lack of staff. Took about 5-10 minutes before actually being seated. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and a Gyu Tan skewer (Beef Tongue).   The ramen took a bit to come out, but I was pleased. It definitely is a large portion, noodles eggy but on the thinner side (think Chinese egg noodles) and cooked a tad bit over. The broth itself was rich, not too fatty but very opaque and had an interesting smoky flavor to it. Smoky broth was a first and I really enjoyed it, it definitely gave the ramen richness and umpf! You get two thick, but tender and fatty pieces of Char shu, a marinated half boiled egg which is probably the best ramen egg I've had here in Arizona along with typical toppings such as green onions, a tiny bit of bamboo shoots and a small pieces of seaweed. Definitely a better ramen than that you can find here, though I wish they had some Chili Powder or crushed garlic on the side to add.   The Gyu Tan skewer was kind of sad. Tiny pieces of beef tongue on two skewers, though tender and flavorful I felt that a little green onions or splash of lemon would've elevated the skewer. It was also $5, yikes!  Service is pretty slow, to the point that a few people left while waiting to be seated. From waiting to be seated, getting our order in and actually getting our food took an hour. Also when our food did arrive we didn't get any utensils or napkins. Price point is decent for ramen and typical, skewers are overpriced and lacking. Typically, skewers should be around $2 and upwards only for seafood and seasonal market type items.   *Take aways: good, solid bowl of ramen worthy of 4 stars*  This place has a lot of potential, please increase your staffing ratio or retrain. I've worked in a restaurant where I was the only server working with a manager serving a full restaurant and it is stress inducing and straining for workers and doesn't lead to good quality customer service."}
{"text":"Randomly, I ended up at Dozo during happy hour, and was glad I did! We loaded up on Happy Hour sushi rolls and were definitely not disappointed. The Alaskan and the Caterpillar rolls ended up being my favorites.  I'm sure I'll end up back at Dozo for sushi Happy Hour again, and will definitely have to splurge on some Mochi and other fun options on the menu."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I agree, the service here can be slow.  I also agree, this is not your typical izakaya joint.  But you know what, some of the best izakaya in LA aren't \"traditional\" izakaya joints either.  So that being said, there is much good food to redeem this place.  First, a note to the sushi people.  This is NOT a sushi joint.  If you're coming here expecting great sushi, you will be disappointed.  The sushi here is average at best, and I people that come here just for that, don't know what izakaya is about.  Izakaya.  Japanese gastropub.  Not sushi restaurant.  You order beer.  You eat tapas-style.  You get yaki-tori and fried food and eat with your hands.  In every case, Japanese restaurant does not equal sushi joint.  As noted by many, the tonkotsu ramen here is actually pretty darn good, and I'd say one of the best in the Valley.  (See my review of Tampopo in Tempe.)  They don't make their noodles in-house. but they are always chewy.  I have always, ALWAYS, gotten a perfect soft-boiled egg here, which is no small feat.  The broth is deep, rich, and on the right side of salty (although I do suspect they use some MSG, which really isn't a huge problem.  Get over the MSG thing people, very few of you actually have sensitivity to it, you need to eat huge amounts of it, and glutamates are in SO MANY FOODS naturally, says - almost every study out here.)  The yaki-tori also shines here, along with the other skewered delights.  Try the chicken hearts people.  And the gizzard.  They are chewy and delicious.  So is the beef tongue, and the ama-ebi (whole sweet shrimp).  EAT THE HEAD.  It is good, it won't kill you.  Also delicious are the flash fried shishito peppers and the cartilage.  (Not cartridge, as it's written on the menu.)  Every deep fried here is deep fried in rice flour, which makes for a ever so slightly crunchy and delicate batter.  The cartilage is crunch on crunch and when you have it alongside the cabbage with sweet mayo, the salty-sweet combo makes for a satisfying snack.     And the fried chicken wings.  These may be, very possibly, the best non-Buffalo wings in the Valley.  They come out hot.  They come out crispy.  They are huge.  And they are damn tasty.  So again, I implore you.  Don't stick with the sushi.  Treat the place like an izakaya, drink some beers, and stack the skewers.    (Honda Ya, Furaibo, you guys are still safe at 5-stars at home in LA.)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day. I had the bento box with spicy ahi sushi and pork katsu. The taste was great and the setup was very appealing. This is the best Japanese food I've had on Tempe. Can't wait to try the ramen and yakitori next!"}
{"text":"Ramen is excellent and super friendly service... the place is just packed, so expect a bit of a wait. Worth it, though!"}
{"text":"If I can give a 0 or negative rating I would. Very bad customer service and very rude Owner. We waited for more than 10mins before the server greeted us and gave the menu. Waited maybe more than 20mins and I followed up for the rolls to be served first at least. I asked how many minutes before we'll be served and owner/sushi chef? was very rude and said if we cannot wait it's okay. First time to be treated like that.. Instead of apologizing for the long wait that is what you'll hear. Very rude.."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, especially for the ramen soups.  There are a lot of different choices on what kind of broth you would like.  The noodles are delicious!  I have also had the milk tea, and it didn't disappoint me.  They have a few types of hot and ices teas, but since I liked that one I haven't tried any of the others yet.  My most recent visit was to try the Chicken Yakisoba, and that exceeded my expectations on both taste and portion size.  I'm picky about soba noodles, and these were delicious.  I will be heading back there to have these dishes again, as well to try others.  They have a big selection of Japanese food that I haven't found in other restaurants."}
{"text":"My experience? It was great to start but ended with big disappointment.  When I found out about this place I was ecstatic because there's no izakaya in Phoenix area. Yes, there are sushi and fast-food type places but nothing like izakaya. So, just for that reason I gave it 5 stars.   In our party we had 4 adults and a 19 month old baby. We sat at a table around 5:30pm and the service was soooooo slow it took about 4 hours to get all of our food. We left around 9:30pm. For that reason alone I deducted 2 points.   Cooked food was pretty decent but sushi was not so fresh and tasteless. Sake was overpriced and beer was warm. So, i deducted another point.   This place is also not kid friendly so minus another point. There was no crayons or anything to keep a child busy and there was no changing station in the bathroom either. Luckily the baby was well behaved and didn't get too agitated but other kids in the restaurant were screaming.   We had to ask for our order numerous times and average service time took 20-30 min for each order. One of the dish we ordered was so salty we asked them to take it back.   This places is very small with 3 waitresses and several cooks so you think they have this down but they seemed very confused and customer service was very poor. I understand this is a new establishment but hope they get their act straight so they don't disappoint more customers.   So, where does that 1 star apply you say? Well, all else failed but the tonkotsu ramen was pretty darn good. LOL!"}
{"text":"2nd time here.  Had the carburetor roll, tori roll, and shrimp tempura. All excellent. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I'm impartial to japanese restaurants because I used to work at one and I rarely go to any other ones out of loyalty to my old boss. But his place is in tucson and I happened to be in Phoenix.   This place has really good Raman. I ordered the tonkotsu and my husband the miso. We ended up switching because he loved my tonkotsu Raman so much. I was fine with the miso Raman because it was also very good.   My aunt ordered some sashimi and we had teriyaki bento box to take home to our uncle. I definitely will come back again.   Excellent Raman"}
{"text":"Good service. Nice comfortable vibe. Standard California and Philly rolls are great (especially when you get it cheap during half hour). Really loved their DOZO roll, and seed weed salad was the best I've had. Excellent. I'll be back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I tried the tonkotsu ramen. So much better compared to tampopo and nishikawa ramen. Must try"}
{"text":"Ordered a bento box with california rolls and was not disappointed. Good portions, good quality, and good price for a lunch outing with my co-workers.  Good for group lunches, but it is located in a very poorly designed plaza. Look at a map before coming, but it goes to show that the best things are sometimes hard to find!  They do not split checks more than 4 ways, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Came here cause the 4 start view, was a bit disappointed.   We ordered two ramen dish, miso and tonkotsu, have to say the tonkotsu ramen was probably the worst one I have had in Arizona so far. The pork was not prepared right, lean meat was cook too old yet the fatty part are still greasy; the bamboo was cooked way too long, it's suppose to be crunchy not soft; and the soup itself, they probably added a gallon of salt in it.  The only thing I liked was the o'nigiri. Other than food, the restaurant has a nice environment, waiters was very niceWill give this restaurant another try, probably something other than ramen tho lol  ____________________________  Updating 2/19!  2nd time was much better, ordered bento box for lunch and the tempuras were great! Takoyaki was well made too, I'm definitely coming back for after work snack time, their appetizers and small plates are pretty good!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended! I frequent a lot of Japanese restaurants and this is one of my favorites because they have friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"I went here with my family half a year ago. Very good! Servers were excellent, and food was tasty. Never had the sushi, so your mileage may vary on that. One of the authentic Japanese restaurants in Chandler area by far."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Phoenix!   The staff is absolutely amazing, adding to a very pleasant dining experience.   I highly recommend the any ramen variation and sushi combo for lunch.    Food so good I've come in for lunch and dinner service on the same day."}
{"text":"The curry beef ramen has got to be one of the best things I have ever tasted! A quaint, authentic ramen and sushi spot, very friendly and attentive staff. The appetizer/small plate selection is great, and specials sounded delicious."}
{"text":"I know I have been slacking on my Yelp reviews, The Boy and I are diet which explains the radio silence.  We get one cheat meal a week and decided to try Dozo for some Ramen Cheat.  We got thereat 8 PM on a Friday and the place was PACKED, always a good sign.  We didnt want to load up on food before the ramen so The Boy ordered the Gyoza, pan fried, and I order Escolar Nigri.  I have struggled to find good Escolar aka White Tuna aka Butterfish here in the Valley but this was amazing.  No fishy smell, no odd flavor, just buttery deliciousness.  I could have eaten it all night.  The Gyoza are a do not miss.  The pan fried bottoms were ah-may-zing, the perfect amount of light and crispy.   We each got Ramen for our entree, The Boy got the Spicy Miso with Chicken and I opted for Sho-yu Ramen with pork.  The broth was very good, the noodles a little but too al dente for my tastes but still good.  The piece of pork that came with my ramen was the best part of the dish.  I gave The Boy and taste and he regretted going chicken with his ramen but still liked his dish.  He really liked the spice of the Spicy Miso and finished his dish.  The service was a little slow so make sure you budget your time but everything else about Dozo was awesome!"}
{"text":"So I have been in a bit of a ramen kick lately..... Fairly obsessively eating it and trying to find new restaurants that serve it. I met a friend at dozo because....they serve ramen plus they have happy hour...win win. We tried a couple of their happy hour rolls -sweet potato roll and spicy tuna (i think). The rolls were pretty weak.... Very small and lacking flavor. I wouldn't get these again. We each also got a drink, which were decent, but nothing special. For ramen, I ordered a special they had that was supposed to be extremely spicy (i think they were calling it fire ramen or something) and my friend got their regular ramen. Well, they really delivered the fire! This thing was seriously spicy! I really respect that since most places don't have enough kick in their supposedly spicy dishes. The ramen was making my eyes water....in a good way! My friend's ramen, however, wasn't as delicious....kind of plain and boring. Would I return? Maybe... I'm bummed the ramen I got was just a special and I wouldn't come back for their regular ramen."}
{"text":"I was excited to try lunch here after all of the good reviews. I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could. I had the Salmon Bento and it was accompanied with very tasty miso soup, a Philadelphia Roll, Rice, Salad and a Sesame Ball. While everything was good, especially the creamy dressing on the salad, the portions were very small. My husband had the Chicken Katsu and it was perfectly fried and not greasy but a minimal portion. When we asked for refills on our Green Iced Tea the server indicated there were no refills. We dine at a number of Japanese restaurants and have never had to pay for refills on the green tea. With many more options available with more generous portions I won't choose to return to Dozo."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ramen here in AZ. My friend actually recommended it and I've been really craving Ramen.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Cha-Shu Ramen (pork bone broth ) Ramen. This was actually really good, I really enjoyed the broth and it was also a good size bowl of ramen. The only downfall was there wasn't enough meat in it. They only give you 2 pieces of meat. They also have happy hour on Monday-Saturday from 5-6:30 pm. Everything is very reasonably priced for happy hour. Around $3+ for rolls. I ordered the Philly roll, but it wasn't anything spectacular. It didn't taste as fresh. They also have drink specials. Around $4 and up.   I'd definitely come back for happy hour or to have their ramen again, but I would definitely recommend them adding more meat to it, otherwise it tasted great."}
{"text":"The reviews do not lie, this place has amazing food and service.  When ever we goto LA we always goto get our ramen on in Japantown, as we could never find a ramen place in Phoenix area, until now.   Food: The ramen is what we came for, but we found that sushi is also really good. Most Japanese restaurants in the phoenix area are Korean owned and have Korean mixed in, but this has a lot of true Japanese dishes. My wife likes the   The Pork Ramen is a must! Very flavorful and delicious.   Atmosphere is pleasant and can be family friend or intimate They do have a sushi bar to sit, seating is limited inside, with plenty of seating outside, they are limited on highchairs to just two.   Service is excellent, and very accommodating, as we have a kid that has a very high pitched yell that we decided to move outside so we don't disturb others, that they were more then helpful to relocate us.  I would highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Dozo Izakaya is a simple eatery - no fancy izakaya decor here. I think a lot of students frequent this place for the decent food, large portions and quick service. Think of it as your typical strip mall family run joint. On the two visits here, I've tried the ramen, sushi, curry and a few other appetizers. I've noticed quite a few typos on the menu and learned this place is Chinese run, rather than Japanese, so it's not 100 percent authentic (which explains some of the food)   With that said, the miso ramen broth was decent but nothing special. The noodles were pleasantly curly and al dente but a bit too much in portion. They do have a decent veggie option for ramen, so my coworkers like this place.   The curry was not amazing. It was just like the boxed mix with no veggies in it like other restaurants might do, but they did give plenty of the fukujinzuke (red daikon pickles) and you can can add egg to it. The sushi is just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Wow, just returned from Japan and this is truly a treat! Authentic bento boxes like you wouldn't believe! Well done! Hope to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"I love Dozo! It's quality Japanese food- we have ordered yakitori skewers, several different sushi dishes, tempura and gyoza- all have been great! I just moved from SF to AZ and I'm so glad I found this spot. Next time I'll copy the other tables and try the ramen."}
{"text":"Lots of good things about this place! The sushi and ramen are pretty great. I also had a fried soft egg which was pretty awesome. My main dish was the Katsu-Curry. Unfortunately, the tenderloin was not cooked properly. What should have been a hard, crispy fry was soft--kinda like when you have chicken nuggets that have been frozen and you hear it up in the microwave. The curry on top was exactly as I remember it growing up. Overall, it was a great meal but I had expected the pork to have a nice crisp shell and it did not. However, I'd still recommend them highly!"}
{"text":"Sat down at the sushi bar and the waitress said something about happy hour. The sushi guy behind the bar then said something about it not being happy hour then took the waitress behind some parted curtains where we could see him giving her an old fashioned finger wagging dress down. Later the same guy took our credit cards for payment and waited on a table handling menus, etc then we watched him go back behind the bar handling raw fish without washing his hands.   Otherwise it was an ok evening."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp a couple weeks ago and I've been here 4 times now. The spicy miso ramen and California rolls are excellent. Very glad to have found this place. Excellent service and the environment is very-cery clean."}
{"text":"\"I've never really wanted to go to Japan. Simply because I don't like eating fish. And I know that's very popular out there in Africa.\" ? Britney Spears  Strutted into DOZO on Friday night and walked away content.  Although my actual rating is probably closer to 3.5 stars, I think they're definitely more worthy of 4 stars than 3.  Here are the details:  I ran across this Yelp listing by an off-chance and saw that they offered izakaya/yakitori.  What!?  Is this really in Tempe or am I accidentally looking at a Los Angeles listing?  The outside of the restaurant even has red lanterns like real izakaya joints!  Wee!  After a few weeks of pining, I came here with skewers of yumminess in mind.  We ordered everything I was hankering for:  Chicken hearts, chicken gizzards, chicken livers, beef tongue, chicken cartridge, atka mackeral, fried sweet shrimp, takoyaki, and a pork bento on the side just in case the small bites were really small.  The offal [tongue, heart, gizzard, and livers] were all over-cooked.  I think this is so because the cooks were afraid of serving customers under-cooked meat.  I had been watching the chef the whole time and never once did he leave his grill so I do think it was intentional.  Working in the food industry, I know the pain of customers thinking the chicken could be too raw and not safe for consumption so let's burn the heck outta it.  Next time though, I would ask them to not cook it so well.  The cartridge seemed to be really crunchy things and I'm not too sure if actual cartridge was used but it made for an interesting texture after eating so much rubbery offal.  Skip the salted smoked fish --- nothing special [save yourself $11, folks].  The bento is ridiculously huge with lots of sides but you get a tiny pork cutlet and some not-too-cute tuna rolls with it.  The fried sweet shrimp and takoyaki with bonito flakes were probably my favorite bites of the night.  It was fun playing with the giant shrimps and the takoyaki had generous large pieces of octopus inside.  Yum!  While the service could be better with hiring another waitress/hostess and the wait time for food seems pretty long considering they're \"small bites\" with at least three cooks present, I would definitely be back --- I want to try the ramen.  Everyone here is really nice.  Yes, the owners and staff all speak Mandarin but hey, we're in America folks.  Koreans are making sushi so why can't the Chinese make izakaya?  America is great because we're a melting pot of cultures.  Stop complaining, people!  Why make this a scandal?  Dinner for two came out to be $56 [without tip].  Not bad, DOZO.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Great place, great people, great food!  Been coming to this establishment for years!  Ask them anything, ask for anything, get a friendly answer!  I have asked for special things I like, and WOW it was done - if at all possible!  Treat these people like family and it's amazing what service you get!  I don't go anywhere else for my sushi fix!  In fact my Father in Law introduced me to this place years ago when it was located in Scottsdale!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the tonkatsu ramen was very good. All their tapas dishes was good for the price. Most of the customers that went to eat there were Asian.  Thats a good sign that the food is authentic. We will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have found a restaurant in this area that I'd go back to more than once, and have it become a regular stop for lunch or dinner in our neighborhood! In fact, i'm ecstatic as there are so few good restaurants in general in south Tempe.   I really liked the tempura...light, fresh, not greasy and the miso soup and california roll was excellent. Looking forward to going back to try the ramen dishes and more of the sushi rolls.  Everyone working there was super friendly and attentive. They also have a good selection of beer, sake and wine. We will for sure be coming here again!  We had a huge lunch with a large Kirin and the bill was only $36. They also have a nice, large patio which is great because the indoor seating is small, but cozy."}
{"text":"Got there right at 5 when they opened for dinner service. The main server guy was pretty quick with giving us out menus and water and getting our orders so I didn't experience the slow service everyone is complaining about. I got the spicy miso which was good and my husband got this other ramen that was written as a special on the white board by the entrance called Jigoku ramen, which is way spicier than the spicy miso and has great flavor! (I highly recommend the jigoku ramen if you love spicy food). We got the chicken heart, chicken gizzard, and baby octopus yakitori and they were all pretty good with good flavor. You have to eat them when they get to your table and not yet them get cold because it's not as good. I probably won't get the heart again because the texture is pretty different. Prices are good, waters were filled, food was great! Can't complain here."}
{"text":"Something a little different from the usual Japanese food around the area. Try the skewers and ramen."}
{"text":"Wow!! Great service, great food, incredible choices and options for everyone in our party of five. I seriously cannot remember the name of one dish we ordered but it was all delicious from start to finish - the Japanese kabobs, the miso soup, the fresh sushi, and on and on to the dairy-free ice cream dessert. Can't wait to get back!!"}
{"text":"The best tonkotsu I've tried in Arizona by far! The broth was perfectly savory without being too salty and the pork had a great taste without being too fatty. Oh and the bamboo shoots! I've honestly never tasted bamboo that delicately sweet!   The service was very accommodating as well considering my friend was late showing up and we dipped in to their break times. They were very pleasant about it and didn't even hint at closing so I was able to enjoy my whole bowl without any rush. 10/10 can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch a few weeks ago with a co-worker.  We both ordered bento boxes and iced teas.    The food was prompt and delicious and the service was friendly and unobtrusive.  Lunch for two was about $25 before gratuity.   I was pleased to see how nicely they had converted this restaurant into a Japanese eatery from its former incarnation; the décor is simple and elegant.   I'd like to see this restaurant succeed, as this part of the Valley needs more Asian eateries.  I'll be returning soon to sample their ramen bowls!"}
{"text":"It has been over a year since I've been back to this restaurant. My friend Jose came here recently and told me that they start serving food on skewers and love it. Despite the fact that I didn't have a great experience the first time I was here, I have to trust my friend and gave it another try. Am I glad that I did. When we first showed up, it wasn't crowded at all. Servers were friendly...tables are clean. Totally love it. We ordered a spicy tuna roll from the happy hour menu. We also ordered many skewers to try out. My favorite is the chicken wings. It is crunchy on the outside and it was absolutely delicious. My second favorite is the octopus. Chicken,beef, and onions were equally delicious too.   I've got a feeling that the owner recognized me and my yelp review from a year ago. I could feel his not so happy eye contact towards our table from time to time lol. I saw him smiling at and being very nice to everyone except to us. It is all good. I still enjoy the food. Overall it was a good night."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Sushi spot of ALL time! We recommend this place to everyone- AND think the drive from North Scottsdale (even in rush hour traffic) is 100% worth it every time. We bring all of our out of town guests here :)"}
