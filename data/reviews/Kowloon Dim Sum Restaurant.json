{"text":"We came all the way from Michigan to get dim sum, but had no idea where to get good dim sum -- Hong Kong style. 

Browsing through a list of Chinese restaurants on a GPS, we found this place and thought we should give it a try.

 We got to the restaurant at 10-ish am on a Sunday. The place was still empty, and looked dark from the outside. So we checked if it was open. The owner/cook said it was. So we dined in. The food was delicious and inexpensive. The variety is great too. Yet, they did not have a fancy dim sum menu. But we had want we were craved for :)"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese restaurant. The dim sum is fresh, hot and delicious. I recommend the chicken feet, beef tripe and pork congee with thousand year old egg. The staff is very friendly and speak English very well. Don't be intimidated to ask for anything!  The prices are very reasonable and the place is clean. I will be returning."}
{"text":"The dim sum was quite good.  The main courses were terrible, disgusting in fact!  We ordered a \"black\" cod dish.  I don't know what kind of fish it was (for sure not black cod!).  It was so chewy and rubbery we could not even cut it with a knife or chopsticks.  The waiter (owner perhaps?) kindly offered to take it back. He said that all the fish was frozen because how could he possibly provide fresh fish!  I don't know but other restaurants get their fish from a fresh fish market like everyone else.    We ordered braised duck.  It was almost inedible, but we were hungry and salvaged some of the duck meat and left most of it.  Although it was well cooked, the duck was extremely chewy  It was stuck to the bone and there was very little meat. The texture of  both the fish dish and the duck dish indicated it  had probably been previously cooked, frozen and reheated.  We will never ever  return to Kowloon!  btw, I only gave it one star because the dim sum was tasty enough."}
{"text":"We ordered Peking duck and all we got was 10 small pieces of duck and 6 wraps. We paid 36 dollars for not even one tenth of a duck.  

Service was terrible the server sounded  like he was yelling at us. 

The tea pot had lots of yellow stains on it.

I came home feeling nauseous.

Willl not recommend to anyone. 

There is no value just a rip off."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience at Kowloon today -- it's a rather typical-looking dim sum joint, though in a prettier location than muggy Chinatown, with plastic tablecloths and such. I only had $15.50 on me to eat with, so some of the fancier things on the menu (which is huge by the way) were out of budget.

I ordered bean curd with eggplant and black bean sauce. It was a bit greasier than I expected but I have eaten beancurd dishes in Chinese food more often than I really should if I'm so anti-grease, and it was no greasier than any other beancurd dish I have eaten. It was still very good and they give a \"just right\" portion size... it looks huge but the dish they serve it in is rather shallow. The sauce was good but could have used some more black beans -- they also give you a good amount of eggplant so you don't feel as guilty about eating so much fried tofu.

I had very quick service and very friendly. It wasn't packed when I got there but regardless five minutes for my tofu was rather impressive. After I was finished the server (also the man running the cash) tried to make a bit of conversation with me, asked me if I was vegetarian because I had the tofu, made a little joke about how I was vegetarian yesterday but not today... it was nice because he wasn't too personal but it still showed that he was interested in the customers.

He gave a very nice thank-you when I said he could keep the change and almost forgot the fortune cookie but made sure to rush to the back and get some rather than send me home without any. He gave me two.

I am happy I went."}
{"text":"My goodness.  This was my first time eating here for lunch and by tradition I ordered General Tsao's chicken which is my baseline comparison for all chinese restaurants.  Never order General Tsao's chicken here it's the worst I have ever eaten.  It's not even General Tso's chicken.  Its chicken balls with bbq sauce poured on it.  BBQ sauce!  Like the garlic flavoured Kraft brand you buy on sale at No Frills for $1.   Why did I even eat it?  I just got back and I am disgusted beyond belief.  I feel terrible.  I have anxiety sweats.  My head in pounding.  But worst of all, I feel personally insulted by the food I just ate.  I noticed Chinese people eating there, but I get the feeling they modified my dish, maybe with good intentions, in order to serve me the whitest food possible.  One of the balls had a fork poked into it.  There was already a fork on the plate!  Am I so white that I need two forks?  I eat with chopsticks my friends.  And half the balls had no meat in it, just fried whatever that nasty foamy goo is that is the chicken ball.  To make things worse, the food on other people's plates looked and smelled so delicious. Goddamn!"}
{"text":"NO STARS!!

Kowloon has seen better days, haven't been in there in a year but at !!:30 on saturday when we are one of 3 tables that says enough.  We went by Rol San on spadina sooo busy.  So decided to visit our old haunt.  The prices are crazy.

Har Gow $4
Sui Mai $4
Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf $5.50
Shrimp Cheung Fun $5
Tofu stuffed with fish $6
Shrimp w/vermecilli $6
Soup in Pouch $5
Bean Curd Roll $5

2x pop $4
Tea for two $3

The Shrimp w/vermicelli not cooked shrimp raw, the bean curd roll not cook pork raw, the har gow shrimp fishy old taste. the soup in pouch no ginger. the sui mai very dry must have been made yesterday.  the best thing was the rice in lotus and tea.  Kowloon used to be sooo good.  The owner who i called over to let him know the shrimp wasnt cooked took the dish without even looking at me or apologizing.  Never to go back again.  The chilli in oil dish was dirty and the worchester sauce jar was soo old i think they are the same from 10 years ago.

Again, they had these old guys drinking draft beer and filling up their cups themselves.  When a restaurant resorts to this kinda of stuff it says alot about the business.  the bathroom a total disgrace for 11:30am.  stay away!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had Dim Sum in the best of restaurants in Montreal, New York, Detroit and this place....as simply decorated as it is...has the traditional taste that Dim Sum should have....the meals have to be of a distinct flavour and tradition for years is how this is susposed to be! Its is very reasonably priced, I even oder dim sum in the late evening and every time it is done steamed fresh! The leaf w the rice inside is tasty and has pork and ground meat in it....just like the way a 5 star New York restaurant does it....tradtional taste! ive been in some high quality restaurants paying an arm and a leg for Dim Sum and it wasnt as tasty!! The shrimp dim sum, pork dim sum, short ribs, beef noodle roll, shrimp noodle roll, stuffed pepper and congee as well the other choices are very tasty!! You can eat so much for so little. no fancy decor, plain and simple but its all in the quality, freshness and taste and this is it for me! Been coming bk since my 20's so they must be doing something right!! 
I think throughout the years they have changed owners but...they kept the traditional way of cooking and dim sum choices! if you enjoy traditional taste of Dim Sum, this is it!!"}
{"text":"Finding good chinese delivery downtown can be problematic.  We're swimming in terrific Chinese restaurants but few of them deliver and those that do usually serve up over-salted food swimming in oil.  Plus, my husband is a vegetarian and that usually gets us responses like, \"So...fish?\"

So tonight, after several failed attempts at finding good chinese food, we tried Kowloon.  The person taking my order was efficient and warm.  He suggested some options for us, joking that, \"Even meat-eaters like this dish!\" and told me the origin of a noodle dish he suggested (apparently it's named after a monk).  The food was delivered quickly and hot.

The food itself was the best delivery we've found so far.  Hot and sour soup was spicy and tangy with delicate tofu and a hint of ginger.  The tofu and eggplant with black bean sauce was a total stand out - rich, dark and gingery with no trace of the gloopy cornstarch mess we often find with thick sauces.  Stir-fried pea shoots were garlicky and still a bit crisp.  The vegetables with cashews were delicate and tasty, although nothing special.

All in all, I think we've finally found a winner.  We'll definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This is the kind of resurants that should be CLOSED DOWN for false advertisement and dishonesty! 

If there is a negative rating that's what I would give to this terrible restaurant.

We ordered delivery on Foodora from this restaurant as I was drawn by the image of a Peking duck dish on their front page and said \"2 courses, Sliced skin with braised shredded duck\" for $49.99

When their \"Peking duck\" came it was merely normal BBQ duck (on their menu for $16.99) cut up into chunks, no garnishes, no crispy skins, no pancake wraps.

So we called the restaurant to see what happens maybe there was a mix up in the order and to which they replied \" this is the way we do Peking duck and there is no garnish or wraps, nobody ever complained\". 

When I investigated more it just made me more angry how they can use a photo of a real Peking duck and false descriptions while serving regular BBQ duck and still charge $50 for it. 

And when I called them again they admitted to \"not equipped to make Peking duck at the restaurant and told us to contact Foodora to get a discount\" then took down the dish from their foodora page. 

We definitely going to contact Foodora and see how his can be solved but the restaurant tried to pass normal BBQ duck for Peking duck when they could have simply called us and said they don't do that, then tried to talk themselves out of it by saying that's just how they served their Peking duck until finally admitting they can't even do Peking duck and took it off from the menu.

If you are reading this please do not go or order from this restaurant there are much better options out there!"}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Kowloon for the last 20 years. I have to say it's never let me down. 
Friendly staff who as the years have gone by I have come to know well. They serve me constant food and some dishes I ask for off menu. Their chow mien is great as its crispy like my grandma used to make it. House soup is great on a cold day before your meal. Don't order \"white\" dishes like General Tao and Chickenballs. I don't know who goes into a Chinese restaurant owned and run by real Chinese and orders this stuff. Ask them for the green beans with pork, Cantonese chowmein, steamed fish and maybe a couple they recommend."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant as it was under the CIBC bonus rewards program for my credit card.
I got the Shrimp dumplings ($3 plus tax) for 4 modest size ones. Shrimp dumplings tasted good, not too greasy and was surprising filling (went during lunch).
Was a little upset when the restaurant owner skimped me of 'tax and rounding'. Ontario charges 5% food tax for total prepared food order $4 or below. Owner not only charged 13% but also rounded up the tax.
Not that I didn't mind paying an extra 25 cents, but this goes to show how unethical the owner is.

Canada Revenue Agency: Run an audit of this restaurant. The owner ran my credit card through a separate terminal from the register that entered the order. I bet he knew the 5% tax below $4 rule despite charging me $0.25 extra. I won't be surprised if the owner pockets most of the 'tax' he collects."}
{"text":"A very solid 3.5 - 4 star place. It had been a very long time since I had last visited Kowloon, and I was just there this past week for dim sum and then a separate visit with some workmates just for drinks. 

The only reason people decided to come here for drinks was because it's probably the cheapest place to get a beer in the area, so if you're hard pressed for money with that beer craving, get yourself here. 

Now the actual time I came here for food was during lunch time and while they do have lunch specials at a very good price, their dim sum did not appear to be any cheaper than most other places out there. They have your regular dim sum fare for $3 - $4 a dish. It's not the best dim sum I've ever had but certainly not bad. 

A big reason for the extra star I give this is their staff. They are actually friendly and take the time to go through your order properly and made sure that we understood for e.g that 3 of us ordering 2 of a certain dish might be too much etc. This is a quality that I find lacking in some other dim sum restaurants. 

While the lunch was by no means the cheapest you can find in Baldwin, it does a good job of filling you up with yummy Chinese."}
{"text":"We were visiting in Toronto for the first time and found this restaurant.  What a delightful experience.  The waiter (Simon Ng) was excellent and helpful in ordering - extended selection of items on the menu.  The meal was very good and our grandsons, who are picky eaters, even liked the suggested servings.  We would definitely go back.  Be sure to ask for Simon he made the dinning experience fun."}
{"text":"We went at their odd hours and it clearly shows as the Kitchen Staff were out in the dining-room enjoying the night Meal and TVB gameshows right next to our table.  Exactly how I like to enjoy my Meals from time-to-time.

Lobster in Black Bean and Garlic Sauce($13.99)
Oyster with Green Onion and Ginger($11.99)
Snow Pea Leafs with Garlic($11.99)

The restaurant is interesting to say the least as the Manager/Server was friendly with jokable when meeting us Cantonese speakers but for some reason there was this street-Gentleman that kept coming in for some weird conversations other than Food.

Complimentary starter Papaya Soup was MSG filled.
Oysters were solid mush, no crisp outer coating and tasteless dish.
Lobster didn't have the Wok fried high heat bite.
The only dish we were willing to dig in 2nd bites were Snow Pea Leafs.

This Kowloon gets 2 out of 9 Dragons."}
{"text":"Inexpensive. Great waiters. Fast surface. Large portions. Fast service. Will make specialty dishes (for me anyway). My favourite restaurant of any kind."}
{"text":"This is one of my all-time favourite restaurants.  The dim-sum is the raison d'etre for this place, make sure you don't miss the sticky rice in leaf or the curry squids (oh yeah, that's how they spell it).  While I haven't had much of it, their regular chinese food has always been solid."}
{"text":"Kowloon has become a typical spot we go for birthday lunches at work. The main reason is it is SO CHEAP, with lunch specials around $6 which are huge (definitely split-able if you're not.. me.), the service is good, and they can easily accommodate a group of 10+ for lunch. 

Lunch specials, while nothing super special, are cheap and tasty. My personal favorite is the \"minced pork and bean curd on vermicelli\" though I'm also partial to \"beef and eggplant on rice\". The food comes out (almost eerily) quickly, it's hot, tastes decent, and is filling. The only complaint I've ever witnessed is a coworker who said the BBQ specials are not hot (and obviously not made fresh). But with that knowledge, it's definitely still worth checking out. 

The only other things I've had at Kowloon is dim sum, which is decent, but a little on the pricey side. For dim sum, there are certainly better places, but for Chinese lunch specials, look no further than Kowloon."}
{"text":"Why am I eating at Kowloon Dim Sum Restaurant out of all these restaurants lining along Baldwin Street?

Can I tell you I was forced? But really no one can be forced!! I went in because I was following my Yelp eating Buddies.... and when it was 3 against 1......... 

I really don't want to eat dim sum at 9 PM at a strange place so ended up we ordered

Lobster in Black Bean and Garlic Sauce ($13.99)
Oyster with Green Onion and Ginger ($11.99)
Vegetables with garlic ($11.99)

All was Meh!! And heavy on MSG, I was thirsty for the whole night!

Oysters were not too fresh and were overcooked........

Staffs are friendly and speaks good English so non Chinese speaking would feel right at home!!

I think I would not be coming back to Kowloon again............ oh please Yelp eating Buddies, can we go somewhere else?!!"}
{"text":"i was craving chinese food last night and found a great place that will surely be my go-to place. it's called Kowloon Seafood and Dimsum Restaurant. it's located on baldwin street.
they have all the usual chinese food offerings, BBQ meats, as well as hot plate dishes, AND *drum roll* dim sum! also the prices are good which is a bonus.
i think i've been here during my days in undergrad, from what i recall it's nothing special to go to. BUT LET ME MAKE CLEAR THAT I THINK THIS IS A great place for chinese food delivery! 
 the food delivered though was awesome, and really quite good. i was impressed b/c i have been loking for a decent chinese food place that will deliver to the Spadina/Bremner (cityplace) area.
last night we ordered: singapore noodles, thick noodles with beef satay, hunan egg plant, beef rice noodle (dim sum), tripe (dim sum), spare ribs on rice (dimsum) and it call came up to $42. the portions were generous, the food was hot and fresh, service and delivery was top notch.

in my search for chinese delivery i've gotten it from Spadina garden and New Ho King, but both were really terrible (greasy, bland, and gross!) i ordered from these places based on recommendations and i was really disappointed. also before ordering i looked over lots of threads here too and was unable to find chinese food that was cheap, and would deliver to my area, so i just wanted to share the wealth.

here is their online menu: http://www.kowloondimsum.com/main.htm"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times for lunch as it is close to work and they have a lunch specials for $6.95. The food came really quickly which was convenient. I had their general tsao chicken and another chicken dish. Food was okay for the most but very greasy and I found the portions quite small. You get what you paid for for $7. The service was good but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"A couple of friends brought me here yesterday for dinner and I was very pleased!

The menu is extensive and very affordable. The portions we got were HUGE! The food came out in a very timely manner and the gentleman serving us was great. He was very attentive and answered all of our questions about the menu without missing a beat or getting irritated at us. This place reminds me of the old \"Taste Of Hong Kong\" that used to be on Queen West before it became Aji Sai. The plastic table covering bring back good memories, lol.

I ordered:
Fried Noodles with beef - $8.99.
Vegetarian Spring Rolls - $1.79 each. 

The spring rolls were a little plain, and next time I think I'm going to try the pork spring rolls instead. They were still yummy, though!"}
{"text":"There's a mixture of good and bad reviews of this restaurant. My parents and I have walked by many times but never stepped foot inside. We were glad we decided to try it out. 

It took us a while to get through the menu and other specials listed on the table and posted on the wall. We had recently been disappointed in a salt with spice/chili style dish at another restaurant. We're glad we ordered this one. The food came out fast and delicious. 

The price is decent and I could tell that some of the customers having lunch were regulars. The waiters joked with them and were friendly with other customers. I'm sure we'll be back another time."}
