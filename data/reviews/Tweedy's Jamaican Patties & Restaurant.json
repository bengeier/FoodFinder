{"text":"Just went in to pick up patties. Got 3 dozen. 12 mild, 22 spicy, and 12 chicken curry. I JUST got back from Jamaica so a little picky. They were a little too flaky for me, and meat in every type was a little mushy for my liking. Flavor was good however, just can't get past the cat food consistency of the meat."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Tweedy's.  The food is amazing, the staff is so nice, and the prices are great.

They catered a lunch for us a couple of weeks back and the food was outstanding!! Everyone loved it, we had more than enough to eat, and the price was perfect.  Amazingly friendly service and an total pleasure to deal with.  

Thanks guys, keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"One of the only Caribbean places in Newmarket, and it does not disappoint. 

Tweedy's is located in an industrial plaza, north of Mulock on Leslie. In terms of decor and design, there's not much to the place, just a few tables, very dive-ish.

The food though is great. I had the curry chicken roti and a spicy beef patty. The curry chicken roti was a large portion and had the right amount of spice that hot sauce wasn't even needed. The patty was fresh and looked like it was made on site, a rare thing for most Jamaican places around Toronto. 

Even tucked away, there was a steady stream of mostly takeout customers. Will return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went here cause I heard good things about this place. Had the jerk chicken and pork combo. Jerk pork was dry and really not tasty, the jerk chicken was pretty good though. The homemade beef patties are what keep me coming fresh tasty crispy and all around probably the best I have has in a long time. I would go back again but skip the jerk pork."}
{"text":"I got the jerk pork roti...portion size was good, but the meat inside was bland and flavorless...its was almost like beef stew wrapped in a roti shell, which was stale and tough. Maybe I'll give it a second chance but I was not impressed..."}
{"text":"I went back for my second time and had curry chicken roti and a beef roti. Sigh..the curry chicken was too salty but overall had good flavour and filled the roti- no skimping. The Roti shell was where I was severely dissapointed! It was so dry & tough! I could barely chew it & swallow. So I I ended up pulling out all the meat & ate just that. So dissapointed. 
The beef roti was filled to capacity with no fillers and tasted really good - but it was not curry flavour more of a beef stew flavour. The beef was shredded beef consistency and was tender. Again the roti shell was horrible! 
I think it will be better to stick to the Rice options in future; due to both times I've endured their roti shells were below par for a Caribbean restaurant. 
Lastly, I do want to end this update on a good note and say I would go back but order the rice options as their food has flavour. As this is pretty much the only place near Aurora for Caribbean food they are my only option for a island fix. This place is owned by Jamaicans so jerk is their specialty.  The owners are very courteous."}
{"text":"Went for a drive at lunch the other day to Tweedys- based on the previous reviews I did manage to find the place after driving past it going north. Unassuming from the outside, I side has an appearance of high vaulted ceiling and I believe an upstairs sitting area (unconfirmed). Fast service, I ordered the curry chicken Roti wrap (more than enough pics here) which had a lukewarm filling of potatoes and chicken wrapped in what some would call a Roti; but it wasn't fresh and like other reviews the wrap itself appears pre made and cold- which suggests it is cooked on a previous day, frozen then thawed. I think a nice crisp Roti on those Roti metal thingies would be expected for the 10 you pay for the wrap. Come on guys!"}
{"text":"Honestly as soon as I went in the smell was off the hook, I stared endlessly at the menu and who I think as the owner suggested that I just leave it up to him. Honestly some people may get offended by giving their choice away but I thought this was an awesome gesture and he cam out with not just a jerk chicken w. rice and peas, but kinda a combo of the jerk and curry chicken over rice and peas. I told him I was hungry and I believe he underestimated my appetite lol, so I added 3 patties (beef, jerk chicken, curry chicken) and 2 saltfish fritters (never had before, thought why not)

Wow.... ok so it still isnt my ALLTIME favourite place to get this type of food, but considering that m #1 is about 45kms away and this is just a 8 min drive from my house its a wicked alternative and the prices were totally fair. So great service, great price, great food = win...... go here.!!!"}
{"text":"Love these patties! Reasonably priced and they just taste amazing. My favourite is the original beef patty spicy, if you can get these fresh out of the oven do so! 
My mom tried the curry chicken patty, she really enjoyed that, wasn't my fave but she loved it so that's all that matters. 

There is some seating in there if you want to dine in. 
These patties are so good I have to stop myself from eating 6. 

Best place to get patties in Newmarket."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tweedy's for years, ever since they use to be a tiny little take out joint on Bayview. They are now on Leslie in a spacious location that allows people to sit down and eat or wait for their take out orders. 

I find that hands down the have the best patties! They are made fresh and are so tasty! They also do catering orders and have mini cocktail patties for parties! I have had their curry chicken roti a few times as well and find it very tasty (just a little salty for my liking) but the portions are great. The oxtail is quite delicious as well. If you are use to Caribbean food and restaurants then you may agree with me that they are slightly pricier than other restaurants but I'm still willing to pay an extra few bucks for good food!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Perhaps I was expecting too much after the good reviews but I haven't been impressed. Tried the jerk chicken, curry chicken and oxtail and none were good. Lacked any sort of rich Caribbean flavour. Portions aren't that big. The patties were terrible. Not sure how anyone could like these. Sorry, disappointed."}
{"text":"EDIT - I haven't visited this place in quite some time now and it tasted very different than I remember when I I itially reviewed the place.  Such a shame.  Bland curry chicken roti with doughy pastry, bland curried chicken patty (lovely flaky pastry though), and a gross vinegar coleslaw. I wonder if this place has changed hands.  I won't be back sadly as I can't drop money on bland food.

---------------------------

Today was my second time in the restaurant, both times it was for take out.  

I've had their homemade patties and really enjoyed them; flakey and flavorfully good. Today I had the chicken curry rotti and it was AWESOME!  Big portion with large chunks of chicken and potatoes made on site.

If you like this type of food you're taste buds are in for a treat.  Restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tweedy's by a coworker, and I love it. I get the jerk pork, but the pattys are great too. The staff is great, and the food is great, with reasonable prices, can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Love Jamaican food! Came here during lunch and the lineup was longggggggg. 

I ordered a small jerk chicken. It was very flavourful where you can taste the different spices. It had a spicy kick to it which goes well with the whole meal. 

I wish they had put more veggies/beans so that I won't feel guilty eating all the meat.  

I also got a beef patty which I hear is pretty good. To be honest, it's okay. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to Tweedy's by a co-worker. As we stood at the counter my mind was blown by all the choices that were offered. Finally I decided on the Jerk Pork. It came with rice and peas/few veggies/and bit of gravy. It was EXCELLENT. The portions are quite generous and I found it very hard to finish mine. I purchased some curry chicken patties on the way out. Let me tell you they were EXCELLENT as well. The staff were very friendly. 

I highly recommend a visit here."}
{"text":"Beef, Jerk Chicken, Curry Chicken or Vegetables Homemade Patties! 

Maybe I should have got more than 1 when everyone else that walked in were all loading up on patties.

Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas ($6.99) has just a touch of spices that made it interesting without overpowering. Chicken though all chopped up boneless and soaked in gravy. The oh so gingery Grace's Ginger Beer went well with the food.

Seating area is spacious and I wish some one would come and wipe down the table once in awhile as some of them were covered with rice....

Come to Tweedy's if you are in the area and have craving for a Taste of the Island, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"You gotta be joking me with these portions.  Could go to Ritz and get literally double portions for the same price, thats how stingy these portions are.  Food was so-so."}
