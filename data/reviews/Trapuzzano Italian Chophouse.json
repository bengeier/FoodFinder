{"text":"Since Girasole was closed, we decided to try an Italian restaurant on walnut we haven't visited. The meal started off great with calamari and bruschetta and went downhill after that. The service kept getting slower and slower and the martinis were subpar. The food is good but not good enough to stay for two hours."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Shadyside for an errand and we fully intended on heading to Capital Grille. It was a dark, rainy night so the evening called out for a warm, dark atmosphere.  By this time, it was getting late ( 9pm) and we were famished. We noticed Trapuzzano's and decided to go for it. We were familiar with the Elbow Room so it seemed like a good fit for the evening.  Plus, I was craving steak.  There was only another table there when we arrived. we took seats at the bar ( I have to say, I was skeptical at this point). I ordered a Cosmo and it was perfect. My husband wasn't as crazy about his drink ( can't remember what he ordered) but it wasn't really their fault. He ordered something too sweet for his tastebuds. They graciously tempered the drink for him by adding some other ingredient.  We ended up ordering beans and greens...delicious! They were well seasoned and had a little acidity. We also shared the ribeye with a gorgonzola sauce. YUMMY!!!  The sauce was incredible and the steak was tender and flavorful. It was perfectly prepared to our liking. We ordered the risotto of the day as well and it was everything a risotto should be...cheesy, creamy, deliciousness. The grilled asparagus were also tasty.  Toward the end of our evening, the chef came out and chatted with us. He was very personable, as was the bartender. They made us feel right at home. They even had us try a dessert on the house. It was like eating a cloud of lemon...very light and fluffy and not overly sweet. It had a few chocolate chips on the top.  I'm not sure what it was called  but it was the  perfect way to end our meal.  This was just good, honest food, prepared well. This place exceeded my expectations and I will definitely go back. Next time I will try one of their pastas."}
{"text":"They spent a lot of money on this place. The lounge / bar area is awesome. Great place for drinks. The folks that work there are very friendly. Now the not so good. They pretend to be upscale Italian. As soon as I see chicken parm on the menu and it's a big ole chicken breast with melted cheese on top, I question the authenticity. I've been twice now and it was empty. 5 to 10 people and the place is huge. They've already raised the prices since they opened in December. The menu on their website has the old prices. The bolognese with linguine was cooked perfectly. I thought it as fresh pasta, but their website pic shows dry?   $18 for plate of pasta with meat sauce? Seriously? Like I said, the food is good, but I can't see this place surviving when it's not high-end."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. I had the paletto to start which contained 3 meatballs, which were very good with a fresh tomatoes sauce and fantastic juicy pork veal and beef meatball. The vegetable cream soup was excellent and fresh from their roof garden. My companions enjoyed their sausage and peppers, and also the salmon rissoto special. My lasagna was well done with the similarly great meat as the meatball and fresh sauce. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended a birthday party at Trapuzzano. We were hungry so we decided to have a go at it. My wife and I are not fans of Italian food, mind you. In the ten years that we've been together, we've never once gone to an Italian restaurant for dinner.   The atmosphere was interesting. There was a live jazz / rock band playing. The crowd was a mixture of Shadyside uppity types and families who were there for tradiitional italian food. The restaurant was clean and the layout is welcoming.   Our service was above average. We didn't feel rushed and all of our requests were fulfilled, although the promptness of our service left a little to be desired.  I ordered an Old Fashioned and my wife ordered a martini. Both drinks were true to form and well made.   Our food was excellent. I ordered chicken parmesean as did my wife; I ordered red sauce, she ordered alfredo. We both commented on our dishes being the best Italian chicken dish we'd ever had.   Prices are reasonable for Pittsburgh dining.   All in all, we had a good experince here. With all of the great new diverse restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, it's good to see someone doing \"tradition\" and doing it well."}
{"text":"WORST NIGHTMARE EVER.   We went here the first week in January. A dirty martini was $16.00 - no blue cheese olives (bring me the kit, and I will stuff them myself.)  The space was tasteful and the live music was a nice touch. I would give it the only star for that. The food was absolutely awful. Meatballs were ordinary and dry. Two people got the scallops- which were not only not fresh, but overcooked, rubbery, NOT EDIBLE. I got the \"Ahi Tuna\" and it came out looking like salmon, and served with Tartar sauce. The steak was the WORST thing we have ever tasted. Our server was CLUELESS, we actually felt bad for him. They ended up taking two entrees off of our bill.  I NEVER complain about a restaurant, but this low class dining is a terrible addition to Walnut street. I literally had nightmares about the comedy of errors in this place. There is nothing authentic about it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."}
{"text":"Delectable Italian food in a great location.   We sat in the front of the restaurant in the lounge area near the windows on a stormy night enjoying a great bottle of wine and some good eats. We had the arugula salad, Wedge salad, some of their fresh Italian bread with their homemade olive oil and herbs mixture to start; for dinner, the Abruzzo Chicken really stole the show (waitress recommendation) and the rib eye with marsala cream sauce was good as well.  Great spot for Italian food and their happy hour is a good deal as well. I'd still say Girasole takes the cake as far as Italian food goes in Shadyside but Trapuzzano is a close second; their beef options add a nice touch to a well planned out menu."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, the Meatball appetizer is to die for. Veal Chop was perfectly done. Marinara sauce was full of flavor. Great atmosphere. Plus, they sell Leaf and Bean Cigars.."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with colleagues during the week.  It was empty.  For the entire 2 hours we were there, no one else came in.  The venue is very nicely done--a big upgrade from Max and Erma's. It was a very relaxing atmosphere.  The waiter was wonderful and very knowledgeable--which was a big help.  The lunch menu was very small.  One of my lunch mates asked about a few other items he had seen on their website (that were not on the menu) and the waiter brought the dinner menu out.  We ordered several appetizers from the dinner menu and were happy with everything.  The calamari was my favorite--it was nicely done--light and very tasteful. The bruchetta was flavorful as well but the slices are bread were so thickly cut that they were a little too filling (not a bad thing for most people, I just prefer less bread...).  My companions enjoyed their lunches (cheese soup, Roman burger, beef and mushroom risotto, chicken flatbread, house burger).  I had the arugula salad with pine nuts and shaved parm with a balsamic glaze.  It was light and fresh.  The lunch prices were reasonable and the servings were a nice size.  The only complaint I heard was that the zucchini chips (breaded and fried) were very mushy.  Yes, I would go back....maybe for dinner next time."}
{"text":"There's no arguing the label \"old school\" applies to this restaurant. But there are much worse headings to fall under. In fact in my view this restaurant's passé qualities are its charm.  The atmosphere is dark in a warm and cozy and dignified way. The walls are clad with a simple paneling and there are sections of stonework which is attractively simple as well. The lighting is a bit low, but this contributes to a relaxed and cozy mood.  The service is impeccably conscientious...ie you won't hear \"no problem\" which serves as today's surrogate for \"thank you.\" That's right, the service is polite, deferential and friendly without overstepping.  The food in our experience, (been in for 1 lunch and 1 dinner), is pretty good with some excellent highlights.  The bread -- which I suspect is homemade, -- (I neglected to ask) -- is outstanding. It's moist and dense and is served with olive oil and Parmesan. The entrees are pretty good. I had the Chicken Marsala which was tender and flavorful. From a price standpoint, while the entree prices are not cheap,  there is  a half-order option for most of the entrees, which was a pleasant surprise. Dessert choices are paraded around on a traditional dessert tray. We had the chocolate \"Gob,\" which was great!     They have live music on weekend evenings in their lounge and we were able to hear the music, (good night clubby stuff),  pretty well in the adjacent dining room. -- A large Sinatra poster, (his mug shot), greets you upon entry, as you glance into the lounge area.      What can I say, this place has sort of a Vegas, Miami Beach, possibly NYC timelessness about it. You'll be treated with utmost respect, your patronage unquestionably appreciated and not be rushed -- You've gotta ask for your check. (See how old school is worthy of appreciation in certain respects?) And the food will not disappoint.     Unless you're a trendy hound -- if you appreciate a \"real' place and a classic dining experience, you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday evening and it was surprisingly empty. My friend and I decided on Trappuzano after seeing the wait at Girasole. I'm glad we ended up here instead! We got the bruschetta appetizer and the homemade lasagna. The bruschetta was great, but nothing new. However, the lasagna was delicious and well portioned! The bread with dipping oil was fantastic as well - perfectly baked, warm and fresh. There was also live music which was nice but a little loud so it was hard to keep a conversation at times. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the restaurant considering the reviews on here. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"A 1950's old school menu and decor...a great concept for 1970. Why not more authentic northern and southern cooking. Want to experience Italian American Pittsburgh circa 1970? It's missing the fried zucchini ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner and the food was really good. I got the cheese ravoli with chicken. The pasta was bigger that i expected and i couldnt finish it all.   The resturant itsself was very nice looking and clean. But they are very expensive be be prepared to spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and someone recommended this restaurant. We had the filet, risotto, rigatoni, Caesar salad, bruschetta and tiramisu. All of the food was excellent but the filet and risotto were the best. We added the balsamic reduction with goat cheese to the filet and it was amazing. The meat was also cooked perfectly. The cocktails were delicious and unique.   The service and ambiance were also excellent. The chef and owner both stopped by our table which was a nice touch. We would recommend this to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to give this place a try for Sunday brunch. BIG MISTAKE. We got here around 11:30 and there were only a few other people. We ordered and then we waited and waited and waited and waited. It took over 45 minutes for us to get French toast and eggs Benedict. When my fiancé did get his eggs Benedict they were cold. The entire time we were waiting we were trying to figure out what was taking so long since there were only about 2 other tables in the whole place. At one point the waitress asked if we wanted bread while we waited. We declined. We just wanted our food. It's ridiculous that it took so long to get breakfast only for it to be cold. Stick with Pamela's."}
{"text":"This place is closed, permanently. My sister just bought a $100 gift card in February, and now we can't spend it. They disconnected the phone number, and the website reads \"We are no longer operational\"."}
{"text":"I'm use to the poor service in Pittsburgh but this was by far one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had since I moved here. We went on a Saturday for the end of restaurant week. We were seated at a table and we waited for almost 15 min for someone to acknowledge our table( it was early and pretty empty). Some man delivered water but never made eye contact. In fact he  slammed the glasses so hard on the table it almost knocked the candle over. When the waitress finally came to our table she delivered menus and silverware and said she would be back to take our orders. So there we are waiting another 10 minutes for her to return and to make matters worse, my napkin is covered in hair and dust (almost like it had been on the ground)!!! The salad and entree were mediocre at best. The dessert was god awful. I ordered a cheesecake option that tasted like rubber. It appeared like it was pre-plated hours ago and left out uncovered. I had one bite and left the rest. Would never go back to this place.....not even for a restaurant week discount lol"}
{"text":"We actually give a 3.5.  Food was good.  I particularly liked my mushroom asparagus pasta dish - very flavorful.  My partner was not as crazy about his sun dried tomato pasta dish - not as flavorful.  Very good bruschetta.  Excellent salad options, and dessert options.  Very nice wait staff.  Our only complaint is that the wine selection did not have any good $25 - $35 bottle options.  The ambiance is very nice and we plan to go again."}
{"text":"To be honest the food here is slightly below 4 stars - presented well and tastes good but simply not dazzling or crave-worthy.  The 4 stars are mainly for the service and atmosphere, which was wonderful. The staff was exceedingly pleasant and attentive from the moment we walked in to the moment we stepped out. Though our main course took much longer than usual to arrive, the waitresses (we had two at all times - I guess one must have been training?) kept us informed and were apologetic.  The carpaccio was tender and perfectly textured but had too much lemon in it - it was bitter and took away from the flavor of the meat. I ordered chicken parmesan which was average - I feel like I could have ordered it from a pizza place and had a similar experience - not bad but not great.  The inside decor, however, is gorgeous and very romantic - makes it worth going to. There is a seating area with comfy couches to lounge where there is sometimes live musicians which is pretty cool.   I would probably only return here only for lunch or appetizers because it is a little pricey for the quality of food but if you like Italian and want a classy atmosphere in Shadyside it is not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Went here for valentines day and the atmosphere was great.  Drinks were amazing.  Great craft beer selection.  Food was very good.  Cooked to temperature and portion sizes were very good.  Definitely didn't leave feeling hungry and didn't have any leftovers.  Amazing deserts as well. Will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"Trapuzzano is the newest of restaurants nestled above my second home of Walnut Street on the corner of Ivy. While I was sad to see the last business leave I have not been disappointed what took it's place.  Walking up to the second floor entrance we were greeted by the hostess and asked where which side we would like. We were opting for the Bar before one of the Lounge tables were cleared just to realize there was an abundant and cozy lounge immediately free so we stayed there instead. They waitress came promptly and I was happy to see a familiar face. [She is also my Salsa instructor so I knew it was going to be a nice evening]. My friend and I both had a glass of the house wine and gazed upon our menus. The have a narrowed down lounge menu which is just great.  We ordered the daily special of the Basil Bruchetta and the Calamari. I separately also had a half of the Arugula salad. The Bruchetta was spicy! This was a surprise for me and not in a bad way. Within Pittsburgh I have seen Bruchetta in all forms it seems from full tomatoes to diced tomatoes to a seasoned mixed sauce. This was on the diced end but was not lacking of any of the Bruchetta garlic kick! which I am so familiar from my dad's way of making it. If you like garlic get it, however for many I could see this being too powerful. The calamari came and large bits with a medium amount of breading. It was served with marinara. Unfortunately there was nothing special to say about this. Then the Salad. I am SO happy for this salad I immediately went out the next day and bought all the ingredient to make in house. Arugula, pinenuts, parmesan cheese shredded on top and sauced up with a Balsamic glaze! [I forgot how I loved balsamic]  - at home I make it slightly tuned up but that's just me. Absolutely delightful. I do love my salad. This will be even better in the Summer with fresh local herbs.  The ambiance is quiet and sophisticated and the lighting is chandelier dim. hmm... dimly lit. Definitely a new fav on Walnut for me."}
{"text":"Ate here in April with my husband and another couple.  The food was just okay, but the service was horrible.  Our waitress was not educated on the menu.  Our order was messed up.  On several occasions, our waitress walked past our table and threw in her thoughts on our conversation.  If this restaurant is trying to be a little upscale, there needs to be a lot of time spent training the waitstaff.  I guess, it's \"top down\".  The general manager, Michael, reached out to me and offered gift certificate to give their restaurant another try.  He wanted \"\"to personally make sure\" we had a good experience.  That was in April.  It is now June and I've received nothing.  I did follow up once to no avail.  If this is the type of management running this restaurant, I guess it is unfair to expect more from the staff.  There are so many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, don't waste your time and money on this one!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks, excited to try out a new place. Unfortunately, this spot did not delivery on their promises.  The martinis and wine were pretty good and not terribly priced. However, this \"Italian chop House\" is not a good place to get food. The appetizer bruschetta was fresh, but not very good. Just tasted like diced tomatoes on toast. Salads were pretty good, but way overpriced. We got the asparagus truffle pasta, which was lukewarm and the noodles weren't cooked right. We also got the steak, ordered as rare. When it came out, it was way over cooked and had no pink at all. Sent it back and got a black and blue raw steak. Sent it back again and they got it wrong a third time.  Desserts that were brought out were significantly smaller portions and lower quality than the tray of samples.  Would not come back except maybe for a half price martini. Many better spots for Italian food or steaks in the city."}
{"text":"So meatballs made atonement for the unfortunate seafood.  So, as it stands now, AWESOME SERVICE, MEATBALLS, AND DRINKS!  (The rest is yet to be proven)"}
{"text":"It was very good the 1st time we were here, we decided to bring the family with us this trip... We tried some different dishes & we were not disappointed... Service was great... Food was phenomenal... Atmosphere couldn't be better... One of our new favorites..."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant and I was very pleasantly surprised  It is a very upscale environment and the service was great  The fact that is in walnut street is a plus and I often to there for shopping and now there is a real restaurant to eat in! Wait still more pleasant surprises; it has LIVE music !! This was a double perk for me. They play in the bar where you can also have dinner and it is just the kind of thing we need in a city like Pittsburgh ! Good food, variety, good service, good music, good ambiance... What else can you ask! So glad to have another option in the burgh!!"}
{"text":"Checked out Trapuzzano's during their soft opening.  Note that this review reflects accordingly.  Overall, the service was very good and the experience was welcoming.  The Assistant Manager welcomed up as the hostess stand and have us our option of seating. Lounge, dining room, bar area - all had guests - and we opted for the dining room.  The food was decent (as expected for soft launch) - they fully acknowledge that there will still need to be some kinks worked out and asked for our feedback before and after the meal (++)  We started with the bruschetta as an appetizer.  Fantastic portion size, loaded with toppings and sauce - very tasty.  The bread just needed to be toasted a bit longer.  I ordered the salmon special with pasta and asparagus.  All very flavorful, however, a small portion of fish and pasta for the price.  She ordered the penne pasta with mushroom sauce.  While the pasta was cooked to perfection, the sauce needs some work. It was rather salty and tasted like cream of mushroom soup with some added veggies.  Overall, this is a welcomed addition to the Walnut Street food scene.  Great ambience and great live music - we really enjoyed the live music from Jason Kendall - so much so that we stayed for a drink in the lounge area after dinner!  I give this a 3.5* considering soft launch timing  and potential for success.  We will definitely return during the grand opening and adjust appropriately. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because steel cactus seated someone ahead of us. The staff was friendly good atmosphere, quaint music. Got the Kalamari which was very good. And fresh pasta rigatoni bolonegese , and an affordable bottle of wine. My lady got a veal house  burger that was amazing on the flavor."}
{"text":"It wasn't the worst, but wasn't the best. Portions were small for the price. Service was great. Food was ok, nothing amazing to make me want to go back. I had a salad with grilled shrimp...came with 4. My husband had chicken parm. The sauce wasn't marinara...it seemed like it was more on the vodka side?"}
{"text":"I love lasagna, it's one of my favorite foods. The lasagna here is top 5 I've had in my life. Very good atmosphere, attentive servers. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time we dined here. The experience was terrible. The food took over and hour and a half to begin. Medium steaks were thoroughly cooked to brown throughout. The bald owner walked around and viewed the area but never came to apologize or offer anything. The waitress offered a free dessert but had to be reminded. After 2 hours we got the dessert tray. Will never return. Do yourself the favor and don't try."}
{"text":"It is like restaurants like these that make me wish there was a 3.5 star option. I had a really lovely time with my date on my birthday here, it was also mother's day. The place was kind of empty for it being mother's day, which made me a little nervous at first. I like the decor, but I am not sure the white table clothes were necessary, it made me feel like the whole experience was going to be top notch and fancy. However, it was quite relaxing and not fancy, our server looked our age and was joking around with us about drinking until 4 in the morning..  The drinks we pretty good, I ordered the moonshine martini and my date ordered the blackened old fashioned. We then ordered the Trapuzzano which was my favorite.   Food-wise, we ordered chicken parm and gnocchi with pesto cream sauce, which was recommended by the server when I asked what he would pick. I would say they were both delicious plates. The chicken with the parm started getting cold quickly though. The bread and olive oil for starters was also another plus, the bread came out warm both times and the seasonings in the olive oil made it pretty tasty.   Overall, I would say it was a very nice experience, however, I don't know if I was 100% sold on the complete idea and if I would come back anytime soon. WAY too many amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came here for cocktails during their Thursday happy hour, and right off the bat I was impressed with the venue and atmosphere.  I was greeted with a large, elegant dining room and relaxed lounge area adjacent to it, with a very skilled guitarist playing.  It was not crowded, due to the wonderful 10 degree Pittsburgh weather, but that allowed us to get a feel for the staff and general vibe of the place. The bartender and waiters/waitresses were welcoming and helpful, their special drink prices were extremely fair, and the cocktails were delicious. Looking forward to trying the food. Would recommend for anyone looking for happy hour drinks or a place to enjoy quality live music in Pittsburgh (Thursday through Saturday evening)."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for Saturday night, and after seeing advertisements in various magazines I was anxious to try it.  Our reservations were for 7:00 PM and we got there right on time. We were seated out in the front private room, although there were empty tables in the main restaurant.  We asked to be moved, as it was cold and empty out there.   We were moved no problem.  We were greeted by a very nice server, and she told us the specials and took our drink and appetizer order.  When she returned with our drinks, we ordered salads and our entrees.   We ordered the mussles and they came out quickly with hot bread and dipping oil. Our salads came at the same time. While we were eating our salads and appetizer, our dinners came out. The waitress was standing there  holding the entrees as my husband was trying to finish his salad. Why the rush?   It was shocking and the waitress was embarrassed. The waitress apologized, but we were in and out of there on a Saturday night in exactly one hour!!!!  And we had dessert!  The tiramisu was good!   What a strange experience. So much a leisurely dinner for Valentines Day !   We paid the bill left at 8 PM! The waitress gave us a card for a free appetizer should we ever return, which I doubt.   The manager or gentleman at the front, never welcomed us, never asked how the dinner was or offered any reason for us to come back. I can see why  restaurant was half empty on Valentine's Day weekend. You would think the manager would welcome new customers and encourage them to return. With so many restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, you would think customer service would be at the top of the list.  It clearly isn't here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner.  Nice setting.  We started with some apps.  The Polpette were good, really liked the fried calamari and Bruschetta.  I had the special of Prime Rib, delicious, cooked perfectly.  For dessert we shared a couple of wonderful treats including a chocolate cake, unfortunately do not remember the name.  Others with us all enjoyed their dinner.  Service was very good too."}
{"text":"I've been to Trapuzzano twice: once for apps and cocktails, and once for dinner. They get one star for having live music. The staff and manager were nice enough. The food was terrible. The beans and greens (which was delivered instead of the mussels we ordered) was sour and dry - a more accurate description of the dish would have been \"week-old ham and bean soup.\"  For some reason the dish was served with deli ham - not sausage, not pancetta. The entrees were equally unique. The shrimp arrabiata which was $29 resembled and tasted like Chef Boyardee canned pasta. The Chicken Abruzzo consisted of a recently thawed pre-breaded, deep fried chicken-patty-hockey-puck that \"died weeks ago (quote from the person who served it).\" The protein was served on a room temperature bed of canned spinach.   Save yourself some time. Go to Girasole."}
{"text":"I am not surprised that this place has closed. Management was atrocious and often inappropriate. The prices were well above average for a below average restaurant. I think the staff was doing their best with a very limited set of tools. The managers were not as exceptional as the staff and the chefs were not incredibly consistent with the food quality. The ambiance was good. The place was not well managed though."}
{"text":"My man and I have officially become our parents. Why eat out when what we make at home is better?  Disappointment after disappointment and waste of money trying local restaurants.... (sad).  Last night friends invited us to happy hour/dinner at Trappuzzano's. Our experience was outstanding. The staff was very friendly and professional.  The wine selection was quite nice. The food was exceptional. We shared an flatbread appetizer(enough for 4) and then ordered dinner. The ribeye was perfect but the star of the show was the risotto of the day selection - salmon, sausage and arugula. The chef actually asked us our opinion and of course received the \"four thumbs up\" from us.   Looking forward to our next experience at Trappuzzano's. We will most certainly go again soon  Thanks to all of the staff for a wonderful and relaxing experience."}
{"text":"I was at both their test nights and the grand opening. Both experiences were extremely positive. Both food and beverage and service were above average and the staff went above and beyond to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. The interior is nicely redone and a beautiful contrast to what it was.  I've had such good experiences I typically have lunch here once a week. The pizzas are very good. The sandwiches are good. The appetizers are very good. The zucchini chips instead of fries are different and good. I am looking forward to having dinner here on a busy weekend night moving forward.  As with any new restaurant there can be growing pains however this is a restaurant, both in quality and service, that is needed in the East End of Pittsburgh. Unlike some of the other posts I am looking forward to continuing to patronize this restaurant.   Good luck to the owners and entire staff!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a recent Sunday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. The decor is really nice and upscale. The service was ok. They give you pretty tasty dipping oil and bread to start, but we were a little disappointed that the pasta dishes did not come with a salad to start. The chicken parm was pretty good and the half portion was more than enough for one person. It could have used more spice/flavor though.  I think we may stick to Girasole in the future when we want Italian.  I'd like to come back to try their reverse martini happy hour sometime."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, great portion sizes and the waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the pasta with meatsauce and meatball (I approve of their meatballs). My fiance had the sausage and peppers with pasta, which was also very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Well, round two the other night, and although it was better overall than the last time, I will still not be returning because it is still overpriced and very uneven.   I had the Frutti di Mare this time, which came out looking good, but most of the shellfish were just over cooked enough to make them somewhat shriveled and tough.  One fairly large and definitely stunning scallop topping it all was just about perfect, though.   The pasta was nice, but beyond al dente.  The marinera sauce, however, while edible, was very bland and literally tasted like it came from a jar with zero effort made by the kitchen.    Utterly and completely unforgivable at $29 - and especially in a restaurant with an Italian name.    It wasn't quite Chef Boy-ar-dee, but that name did cross my mind at the time.    My friend had the same reaction to the sauce on his pasta and eggplant Parmesan; the whole dish was very forgettable.   Frankly, the spaghetti and meat sauce at Eat 'n' Park is much better, although it lacks the seafood.  You also don't expect as much at $12, but it's still more flavorful.   I did have a pretty nice glass of wine, though, which wasn't listed by the glass.  I didn't ask why they just happened to already have an open bottle, although the question certainly crossed my mind.   The tiramisu was quite good as well.  The fried calamari was absolute perfection, with a lovely sauce, and the arugula salad was as well.  Those I'd go back for.   The real killer was when someone used what smelled like full strength bleach to clean a serving station as we were having our dessert, the stench of which permeated the whole room.  The hostess claimed it was Windex, but it could not possibly have been.   And then the toilets in the ladies' room needed to be cleaned - and we were seated at 5:30!  There was also not a drop of hot water.  Freezing cold water is not only uncomfortable, but just the thought of the employees not having hot water to wash with their own hands - OMG!!!  When I drop over $100 on dinner for two, which only included one glass of wine, one soda, one desert, one salad, one appetizer and two entrees, I expect a whole heck of a lot more out of the entrees, and of the environs.  I would have dropped another star, but left the third one because the good parts balanced out the bad ones just  enough to deserve the extra one."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much.  I used to think that Girosole was one of the better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Now, I think Trapuzzano is much better."}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for more yummy food and wine after the Yelp event at UP&C. We drove around looking for a parking spot near Noodle Head but that didn't happen so next in line was Walnut St. We found this lovely Italian Chophouse.  The decor and overall ambiance was very nice and classy!  I could relax in their lounge, sip wine, and watch the snowfall, while listening to live music and be one happy lady.  They didn't have live music on the night I went but they had a piano and the dates listed when someone would be performing.    First we were greeted by the friendly bartender and offered some fresh Italian bread with oil for dipping.  We wanted to order the 12oz Asiago filled meatball as an app but they were out so went with the traditional meatballs instead. They were pretty good.  Then for our entrees we ordered the Abruzzo Chicken.  It was delightful.  It's fried chicken with Gorgonzola cheese served on some mushrooms and spinach with a side of linguini.  It was awesome!   They had a great wine menu with plenty by the glass to offer and their cocktails looked delicious as well.  Can't wait to go back and try their olive oil cake!"}
