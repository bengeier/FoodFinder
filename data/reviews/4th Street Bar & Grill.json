{"text":"It was ok due to reviews for this place my wife and I only got appetizers which were pretty good. We only went here because the group we were with chose it. Service was terrible we received our water which was disgusting, I know maybe it's because we were down town but they could filter it! We order our first round of drink they came out pretty quick but then we had to wait for the waitress for a while they when she did show up for our second round we waited twenty minutes! Probably not bad if you are boing here but with all the other choices for a sit down meal why go here?"}
{"text":"I went to 4th Street Bar & Grill tonight with my fiance, my future mother-in-law and her new BF who were in town for a concert.  The food was decent and the service was okay.  I never like having to flag down a server to request some flatware.  It's got a good atmosphere, as it's located on the busy E. 4th Street, and we sat at a nice table on the patio, which was great for people watching and kept us away from the loudness of the bowling alley inside.  But if you want a fun night out, with great food and great drinks, I would look elsewhere on E. 4th."}
{"text":"Decent food here.  They have a lot of hdtv's and comfortable booths/tables.  The main attraction is you can bowl a game at this location which is very unquiet for the location."}
{"text":"It's your standard bar & grill food. Nothing really impressive about the food or the service. It is nice to sit on the patio and chill out, watch some weird people walk by, make judgmental comments about people's clothes and hair. It's not bad. 

Had to ask for silverware, I think. Plus our server was looking down the street while taking our orders. Kinda weird. It grew on me."}
{"text":"I encountered this place accidentally and found a 15% off coupon on yelp check in discount. We ordered steak, and it came out great as we ordered medium rare, but the surface edge part of the meat was bitter because it burnt little bit. Service was good and normal, nothing impressive. There was also a bowling playground next to the dining tables. The best thing for tonight was the discount, oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Going to the Q or Progressive Field? Stop in for a drink at the bar or get a full meal in the dinning room.  Bar tenders are always helpful.  The wait staff for dinner will get you out quickly if you need to get to the game or concert."}
{"text":"All glitz with horrible food.  My salad was loaded with rotten tomatoes.  My salad was the $14 blackened steak over romaine and it was more like a side salad.  Server brought the wrong meals to most of the table.  Server was upset to take them back and said my friends made a mistake.  Place Is also overpriced, my bill came to $18 for the side salad and a coke.  So not a good choice.  It does have a bowling alley, and more of a bar atmosphere.  It's really a bar that is trying to have food but hasn't  taken the step of hiring a real chef, making a real menu or training the staff."}
{"text":"Having never experienced the Cleveland Cuisine, my father picked 4th street bar and grill solely on the reason that they had a sign advertising homemade perogies in the window.

We were taken to a table out on their makeshift of a patio, which was part of this cool alley scene located right off of Euclid, I bet this place would be pretty cool to come to at night with all the bars, restaurants, and did I see a comedy club??

The food at 4th street was ok. It wasn't anything over the top. I think their cuisine was mainly German inspired? I ordered the wurst platter, which came with some decent bratwurst and knockwurst with a side of mashed potatoes, saurkraut, and warm apple sauce. 

The perogies we had for an appetizer were really good. These little deep fried dough balls filled with smoked cheddar cheese were actually the only delight of the whole meal. 

Service was average, nothing special. Oh, I do have to say one thing. 

For the love of god, if your going to have a patio seating area, PUT AN UMBRELLA ON EVERY TABLE. 
Why have a few tables with umbrellas and a few tables without them when the sun is beading down on the whole patio making it easily over 90 degrees. You know full well that every customer is going to want an umbrella table just for the re-assurance of if it getting to hot, they can put their umbrella up and enjoy their meal under the shade. But when it gets too hot, what are the people without umbrellas supposed to do?? Duck under the table? Start taking clothes off? Dunk their head in their beverage?

Just something I noticed."}
{"text":"Service was a bit choppy. The Pizza was nothing to write home about. The fried pickles are too sweet. Nothing is bad but then nothing is outstanding either. The location is excellent and the feel of the place is fun. The beer selection is pretty good."}
{"text":"This review only covers the restaurant. I went on a slow Saturday afternoon and the wait staff seemed stressed and miserable. There was no attention to detail, plus the food was sub par to average at best. My parents were in town for the day, and I hate that i chose this place. Maybe the bowling experience is better, but  i doubt that I'll ever go back to find out."}
{"text":"Good food / good beer / good bowling. Great place to grab an outside table and watch the Browns players pull up their cars across the street and hop out for quick autographs before hitting the team hotel before home games."}
{"text":"Bad fries and food took nearly an hour - two sins for any establishment that calls itself a bar and grill. Good location but there are lots of great places in the area."}
{"text":"Probably should have looked up the reviews for this place first.  4th Street Bar and Grill seems like a pretty cool place to hang out.  There is a medium-sized bowling alley in addition to the restaurant and it looks like they have pretty good happy hour specials.  The food and service, however, is lacking.

We walked over here on a Friday night looking for some food after a 6+ hour drive into Cleveland.  We were promptly seated, but then waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came over to take our orders.  It was like that for the rest of our meal too - despite the place being mostly empty, our waiter was not around much to refill waters either.

If you do end up eating here I would recommend avoiding the pizza.  I don't remember the name of one I ordered, but it came with spinach, olives, onions and (I think) mushrooms.  The toppings were fresh, but the crust was pretty terrible.  It was thin and soggy, and predictably fell apart when you tried to pick it up.  Or maybe it had holes in it to begin with, it was kind of hard to tell.  

My girlfriend ordered the \"Terminal Tower\" sandwich, which was decent.  It was a pork burger, with a perogie, bacon and cheese, served on a pretzel bun and accompanied by passable dinner fries.  The bottom bun kind of got lost in the mass of fillings, but interesting combination of ingredients and overall a pretty good taste."}
{"text":"4th Street is a bar which seems to be having an identity crisis. here's what it has:

- upscale yuppie bar look
- lounge-style lighting
- pool tables
- sit-down dinner area
- bowling alley lanes

while it did have an extensive drink and food menu going for it, the wait time on a Friday night (when it was BARELY packed) for our drinks was uncalled for.

seriously, I could've gotten my fat ass over to the bar, poured myself a beer, finished it, and poured/finished at least two more before our serving wench got me my second drink.

perhaps it was the heat causing the malaise."}
{"text":"Located right on the corner, we had a nice patio spot on a sunny Friday evening. They had a happy hour going with $5 appetizers and $5 specialty drinks and a few domestic bottle and draft specials. 

Our waitress admitted she was in a bad mood which was quite funny, but perhaps not the best opening line. 

My mai tai was good, food was pretty good. Had a few drinks and a few appetizers. Pizza was good, southwestern chicken rolls were bland. 

Overall it is a good pre-game spot for a few drinks and eats, wouldn't recommend actually having a full meal there though."}
{"text":"Didn't even get in the door. One of the two police officers said one of the 15 people with us stumbled (carrousel door) in so we weren't allowed to have dinner. The door had mechanical problems making it difficult to enter the bar. I stood outside and watched as two other patrons attempted to enter the bar through the carrousel doors. They too were greeted with a broken door and some stumbling. They were younger girls so of course the chubby officer overlooked the fact that they had stumbled in the door as one person from our group did. Cleveland PD. should be proud. This officer saved the Bar owner several hundred dollars because in his opinion someone \"stumbled\" in the door. It was snowing, but I guess the icy conditions, the wet floor or the broken door had nothing to do with the fact that everyone was stumbling into this place. On the other hand the host and the police officer in training obviously were accepting and understanding. Unfortunately they couldn't overcome Mr. \"out of Shape Cleveland Police Officer.\" Congrats to 4th Street for allowing CLEVELAND police officers to dictate their business. Might as well close your doors now.

MANAGER RESPONSE: Mike, thank you for taking the time to tell me about your experience.  At the Corner alley we take safety very seriously both for our staff and our guests.  And unfortunately sometimes this means protecting a guest from themselves when they may have been over served on a fun night out.  This is why we employ a Cleveland police office to help us card and check guests at the door.  We also took great precautions to get a professional who knows what they are doing, which is why the officer in question is a 20 year veteran of the force and decorated office in the city of Cleveland.  
We never want to alienate a guest but we do have to be a responsible vendor, I apologize that you were not able to join us that night but we stand by the decisions of the officer.  I hope you will understand and join us again.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to answer your concerns.

Let's talk about what happened after I saw the other 2 patrons enter and stumble without any problems.  I asked him why the other patrons were allowed into the building after knocking the door off the hinges and stumbling in. Of course that pissed him off.  He followed me out the door looking for and chasing an argument. I am a retired veteran and this guy thought he was talking to a drunk chump.  Typical of a guy with a BIG HEAD in uniform. He threatened to arrest me for public intoxication after carding me and allowing me into your restaurant. He truly did not believe I was a hazard to myself because I wasn't the one who stumbled in. But yet he made his threats. It is guys like him that should be placed under the radar for covering up their short comings. Most police officers do their job and do it well, This guy was the stereotypical butthole. I have met many police officers in Cleveland, this guy is not anywhere near the top and that is a fact.  


MY RESPONSE: I find your comments to be appalling Michael G. Who in the hell would allow a guy like you to manage anything associated with their business. First, you claim to take safety \"very seriously.\" With a broken door and wet floors? Don't worry OSHA has been notified of this violation. Second, \"protecting guests who have been over served\" nice assumption jackass. Third, and I will only address this because you stated  \"the officer in question is a 20 year veteran of the force.\" So what, this officer is not exactly a poster child for the Cleveland PD. He is a fat guy who can't even do his job properly. Why have a host if you are going to employ a fat, out of shape police officer who is a safety hazard to himself?  As far as this guys service to Cleveland, He is lucky to have a job, he should have been fired for being overweight. He isn't highly decorated as you might suggest (his rank is a joke for 20 years) and should spend more time at the local gym instead of your restaurant. Have fun closing that place down Michael G"}
{"text":"Well, if you haven't bowled in a modern atmosphere yet, then I suppose it's worthing trying it at least once. But the youngins are there (shouldn't they be in bed?) and the food isn't worth writing home about. You'd be better off catching a show at the HOB or spending your hard-earned dime eating or drinking at Lola's, both across the street."}
{"text":"Eh, not too bad. Fairly extensive menu of standards like sandwiches, pastas, burgers & appetizers. Unfortunately, it's astronomically priced, nothing we ordered was under $10. The portions are at least large. Indifferent staff and expensive drinks, with a limited selection.
Attached to the restaurant, however, is a bammer bowling alley! The Corner Alley it's called."}
{"text":"We sat our selves after going to the bar to get our own drinks.  A server never came over to us to ask us if we need anthing else, which we did.  We complained and the manager came out and very loudly told us that it is assumed if we got our own drinks we are taken care of and his servers are not that concerned with any additional drink orders.  He chose to convey this message in a heavy handed manner that could be heard by several tables on both sides.  Sadly because of this public scolding I cannot ever return."}
{"text":"Two stars for cool location and atmosphere, zero for food. My partner and I shared wings, balsamic waffle fries and beer cheese fondue. One of these has made us sick with serious stomach issues. Leaning towards the wings as they tasted old and gristly. Not cool! I did read the reviews before we went so I was prepared to possibly be disappointed.....but I truly didn't think we were going to get sick. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"STEER CLEAR!!! Got violently ill after eating here, the water tastes like mold, and the service is lackluster at best. The food was awful, the crab in the crab&artichoke dip tasted really old, but their pizza crust was halfway decent. Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"This place is essentially a cooler version of Applebees, or any other boring restaurant that suburban people love to eat at. The happy hour specials and their mixed drinks are great, but for food? I'd go anywhere else in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"On tour this happened to be my day to write a column for a magazine on what we're eating on tour, and I stumble across this gem.  Huge space, sports TV everywhere, large bar area, great staff.  Oh and they make their own kettle chips!
My bacon burger was great, microbrews on tap, a great meal!
Near the HOB in Cleveland walk down a block and grab a bite before a show!"}
{"text":"This place is a bowling alley with food--not a restaurant with a bowling alley.  Menus were sticky.  The booths were corny-looking.  The food (a burger and fries) was mediocre at best.  My colleague also commented that the water tasted weird.  

There are many excellent food options on 4th street, so I will definitely never ever be back."}
{"text":"Why is it that anytime work people want to 'bond' they come up with bowling???  Can't we do something more fun?  I don't know, like have dinner at a NICE restaurant or go white water rafting or something?  I work with a bunch of old people, so that's probably out.  

I digress.  We came here looking for a good time, and I have to admit, we actually found one.  I organized an event here for work for about 25 people.  They catered for us and gave us drink tickets for a pretty reasonable price.  The staff was friendly and prompt and the food, tough greasy, wasn't half bad (for bowling alley food).  They were ready for us as soon as we arrived with piping hot food, shoes and booze.  

The place itself is nice.  It's not your normal grimy, yucky bowling alley.  It looks fairly new, though small, with only about 12 lanes for bowling.  They do however; have a large bar area (very important!) and a few pool tables.  The vibe that night was very high energy as a lot of Cleveland baseball fans gathered pre-game, definitely not your normal teenager hangout (though there were a few here and there).  The music was good too.  The first thing I heard walking in was Blink 182.  I think I heard some Incubus and other fun stuff throughout the evening. 

Apparently there is a restaurant hidden somewhere there too.

I would definitely bring work people here again."}
