{"text":"The food was great. The service was great. Wish there was more drink options and better ambiance I guess...so OK!"}
{"text":"A real treat on a hot summer day (and not just for the a/c)! The ceviche was refreshing and packed with flavor.  Both the tamarind and passion fruit were big hits. The fish was cut to a nice size and stayed firm, and the shrimp was the perfect texture. While we loved the picante hot sauce, we would have enjoyed it even more with heat (jalapeños?) in the ceviche itself. 
We also really enjoyed the fish empanadas (nicely flaky crust) with the chipotle hot sauce. 
We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh and delicious tasting dishes served by friendly and knowledgeable waiters. They have quite a large, maybe a little overwhelming menu - but I think everything is worth giving a taste. 

We were a group of 5 people and ordered fish empanadas and cheese sticks (tequenos) as entrées. Although the cheese stick wasn't mind-blowing in any way, it was still great. Definite recommend for the very tasty and crispy empanadas.

For the meal, I had shrimp tacos and the others ordered chicken sticks (that come with excellent, freshly made plantain chips - \"tostones\"), the paella and deep fried calamari. The tacos were very small and came in 3, but were piled high with fresh vegetables and shrimp. I had a hard time finishing the plate. Paella was very flavourful. I wasn't a fan of the batter used for the calamari, but that's really my only disappointment throughout the whole night. 

They also have a very large selection of fruit drinks/smoothies. We had a lemonade and sugar cane drink that were both good. 

For dessert (I don't know how the others could still keep eating at this point), we had the tres leches, flan and brownie. The tres leches in particular was so good, I'm still craving for it now. 

Overall, definite recommend for fresh, authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing prices, great portions, chef is wonderful. Talked to him about how his ingredients are prepared and how fresh it all is. If your date loves this place as much as you do, you have a keeper! Will be back within the week for sure."}
{"text":"Luis and Patricia are terrific!  The cod croquettes and fish tacos were delicious.  Great experience, we'll be sure to go back soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful, small, family run little restaurant. I went in the middle of a Friday afternoon. No one else there. I had a delightful conversation with the young Venezuelan owner as he prepared my medium sized plate of ceviche. I selected the \"melange;\" a mix of octopus, fish, and shrimp. Perfectly done. Wonderful favors, and just enough spice. I asked for something on the spicy side, so there is clearly room for individual tastes here. 

The corner location is located in a nice little neighborhood that straddles St. Laurent. Very homey little place. It seats perhaps 30 people, max. Very reasonably priced too. I thinkable they don't have alcohol, though I'm not sure. 

A great spot, though. If you love ceviche, as I do, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Amazing paella!!!! The entries are good portion, prices are good and nice variety of ceviches."}
{"text":"Excellent choice. The actual ceviche is a hit! Empanadas are great too. Service was impeccable, We were actually served by the owner. Cozy place, amazing food with a twist of Venezuelan flavours. 
Deserts!!!!! Man-o-man..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Thank goodness for yelp.

The ceviche was unreal. I had shrimp, fish and octopus with mango and avocado. I also ordered the chicken empanadas.

Luis is an amazing guy- so friendly! The location itself is quaint and beautiful!!

Awesome experience. I'll definitely be going every few weeks to get my ceviche fix."}
{"text":"Wonderful hidden gem from the busy streets. Family restaurant with excellent service and food. If you are craving ceviche, this is the place to go. They're fish tacos are melt-in-your-mouth excellent."}
{"text":"Resto très sympathique. Nourriture délicieuse et très abordable. Personnel chaleureux, je recommande!"}
{"text":"Très très bonne paella pour 2 personnes, vous serrez bourrez de bon aliment. Petit restaurant très tranquille."}
{"text":"Best Ceviche in Montreal. Fabulous Tacos. Wonderful Service

If you are not eating ceviche here, you are doing it wrong. There is nothing like their ceviche in town. There are 4 choices of fish/seafood to choose from, and you can then select 3 of (I think) 6 potential flavors (including mango). 

That makes for something like 864 possible combinations of ceviche. This means you can eat ceviche everyday for over two years without repeating the same ceviche twice. These people are inspired. I've eaten there twice in the last 24 hours, and I still want more.

The tacos are also wonderful. The fish, chicken, and shrimp are all delicious. I haven't had such fresh, and exquisite, an unpretentious tacos anywhere in Montreal.

Then there's the service. These people are warm, and happy, and seem to truly care that you have a great experience and meal. I want to hug them when I see them now -- which is going to be make for some really awkward moments since I live across the street."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious especially the cod fish cakes, simple place, nice service and the price is very suitable. I loved the restaurant"}
{"text":"The decoration was very cute, i'm feeling that i'm on a vacation

The service was impeccable and friendly.

OMG the ceviches were so delicious. It is a build your own ceviches. I had mix seafood with mango flavor.

Next time i will keep it for myself with a large size."}
{"text":"We've loved this place since it first opened and keep coming back both for takeout and for dining in. Of course the ceviches are perfect and made-to-order. We tend to like traditional fish with lemon or tamarind, with hearts of palm or avocado, but you can certainly branch out and go wild if you want!

The fried dishes are great too: we've tried tequeños, fish croquettes, fish & chips, fried shrimp, fish tacos -- all good!

Also love the sugar cane & lemon drink.

Plus the host-ceviche-chef is always friendly and helpful. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. First, everything you read is true. The ceviches are a must. I didn't even really like ceviche until I came here. But one thing I want to add that no one seemed to mention is the TRES LECHE cake!!! I definitely recommend leaving some room for their awesome dessert.

No alcohol which is a bummer :( our waitress was super friendly and welcoming. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Cevichés is a quaint local eatery that delivered in every way. The decor is fun and fresh,  the staff is friendly and smart,  and the food was all of those things and more. It's rare that a restaurant feels so cohesive, the atmosphere is reflected in the food and vis versa. Clean modern cuisine that doesn't lack character or taste, everything was simple, authentic, and delicious. The lentil soup was comforting,  the fish tacos were beautiful,  and the tres leches cake was sumptuous. Really a fantastic meal. 

I also must mention that the staff went above and beyond for my wife and I.  You can tell,  and taste,  that everybody there cares deeply."}
{"text":"Ever heard of the story of the east german worker who gets sent a labor camp in the ussr? Beforehand, he tells his friends that the letters he'll write in blue ink will be his real experience while the letters in red ink will be false partisan propaganda in case the guards read his letters. Let's procede the same way for this review

blue ink : the empanadas were amazing! The texture was great and the meat was tender. The mango juice is also refreshing and tasty. The place is also really affordable. You can grab a good bite for less than 15 bucks.

red ink : I absolutely loved the tacos! It's not like the chicken tasted bland or anything... the service was also top notch! It definitely didn't take too long and the waitress totally didn't have a bitchy attitude! I recommend this place for anyone! 

okay so you get the gist. It's a decent place that has its flaws but overall it's alright."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, made with tons of love; family owned... Need I say more? Go! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Fish taco and the fried cheese appetizer is amazing! Their hone made sauces are delicious. Ambience is so warm and cozy. Love this place."}
{"text":"I love their decorations! staff are very friendly. for the food, they are great and we almost ordered everything."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a cute and cozy little restaurant, I think it is owned by Venezuelans. I've been there a couple times now, it's a solid, inexpensive, sit-down restaurant (which is something I think that area needs more of). The food is delicious.

Number one thing I recommend is the paella ($24), containing lots of seafood goodness, though it is very oily once you reach the bottom of the pan. Their ceviches are great, you can choose one flavor and as many toppings as you like, I really enjoyed the avocado and cactus combo with mango flavor. 

I would also highly recommend the calamari ($10), yuca fries ($5), and tres leches cake ($3). The only things I have found to be disappointing are the chorizo sandwich ($7) and the salad with chicken ($12), neither of which were particularly bad but just very... average and unexciting.

The service is super great too! And they have helpful picture menus and big windows to let in the sun. Great place to check out, even if you're not in the plateau."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, fresh, tasty. The service is also very good. People who want to try the Spanish rice should notice that the price is 24$, not 18$ shown on one of the photos in Yelp... However, if you like paella, you will still like the one here."}
{"text":"The best ceviche I've had in Montreal. Reminiscent of my trips to Peru. Great prices, great ambience!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal and this food is delicious! Visited on a Friday evening at around 5:30 PM. The staff were very friendly and provided quick service. They brought our plates and sauce immediately after we ordered. We ordered 3 items for 3 people (a light dinner for us) - mixed ceviche with all the veggies, cod fish cakes, and Paella/Spanish rice. Highly recommend the cod fish cakes, but both the other items are brilliant as well. Not cheap but very worth it. The restaurant is also tastefully decorated (with a bar) and very clean."}
{"text":"Excellent and tasty ceviches with a lot of options, fish, shrimp and octopus with many variations on sauce.  Our favourite is the wildly addictive passion fruit with avocado.  Fish empanadas are lovely and flaky and keep the kids who are less keen on raw fish very happy.  Great for picnics or a protein filled lunch.  Everyone who goes wants to go back. Thoughtful and attentive service."}
{"text":"Delicious ceviche. Yuca fries are beyond belief as is the saffron rice. Friendly and quick  service. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"We visited this little restaurant today and we were overjoyed with the spectacular meal and friendly attentive service. Highly recommend a visit to this lovely place."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Montréal, I come here for dinner. It is a small couple owned restaurant and they are very friendly!

There are very limited amount of seating in the restaurant, only around 3-4 tables that could site a group of 4, and that was it. When we were there they had to reject a couple walking in! They take the time to perfect every dish for the customers.

The quality of their food is amazing, the seafood was very fresh, and it took some time to get our food (30 minutes for the paella). It was definitely worth the wait. I highly recommend the seafood paella (~$24) and the fish tacos ($10)."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the quiet part of the Plateau. The fish dishes are a must-try especially the ceviche. My fish taco was good too and we had the empanada sampler to start which was great. The fish sandwich was okay - too bread-y! Overall, the decor is nice and the staff are incredibly friendly and nice."}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about this place was their fish tacos (served on corn made soft shells), very flavourful. However, I did find some hard sand like particles in my tacos... It wasn't super pleasant. 

Their ceviches are in the other hand, in my opinion, way too drenched with sauce. We got the passion fruit flavoured mixed ceviches and i felt like I was almost eating passion fruit sauce with a side of ceviche... The sauce was way too overpowering."}
{"text":"Nice service. The waiter is so nice and explain us everything with passion. The ceviche is good but paella is amazing. It's a bistro like place. The ambiance is casual but comfortable."}
{"text":"Very hard to find place that's worth your time!

First time having ceviche, it's simply delicious. You can ask for the chef to improvise and have a mixed sea food ceviche. Writing about it is making me salivate again!

Sampled also the fish tacos, very tasty with a simple presentation. The soft tacos were meh. 

The tostones (banana chips) are very filling as an appetizer, best to share. The empanadas (stuffed pastry) are also good. The ceviche is really the dish you should ordered, however.

The prices are low so you can sample multiple dishes. 

About the decor, you can feel it's a family-owned business that puts their work more into their food than the look of the place. We went for dinner on a weekday and it was very, very quiet, although we were not the only patrons of the place.

It is also a small store that sells 'exotic' groceries. I also bought their home-made donuts, which were in a bag next to the cash registry. Bad mistake, they were so hard that I could have chipped my tooth on one of them. Aside from this, overall great good, definitely go there for the ceviche."}
{"text":"Four of us were their for our usual dinner party. I like that all if their menu items have photos. 
We got the biggest mixed ceviches, with octopus, fish shrimps with passion fruit base and all dressed. We were very disappointed the taste. It was quite sour. 
The grilled octopus was good,it was lightly seasoned, which is exactly the way I wanted. 
The pork bun was bad, it had a disgusting smell to it and have no flavour. 
The tacked were ok. 
He paella was exceptional well done, so fresh and flavourful. 
All over very friendly service but everything but the paella was average"}
{"text":"So happy to have found this TOP NOTCH gem in Montreal!! Thank youuuu YELP! 

The food...phenomenal! The service....SUPERB! Honestly, terrific experience! We had such a fun time...Luis and his wife were so patient with my friends, who were there for their first ceviche-experience (they loved it!!!!)....THANK YOU!

I would give an extra star if I could --- 6star spot!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible neighborhood restaurant.   Very friendly and food is out of this world.  Best ceviche I have ever had- and you can design your own-  octopus/shrimp with a slight mango flavor and incredible heat- like nothing I've ever seen.   Great paella, authentic South American drinks, and lots of fun."}
{"text":"Delicious empanadas! I was able to order a mix of the cheese, fish and chicken. Perfect crispy texture on the outside and tender on the inside. Impeccable flavor. Incredible customer service!"}
{"text":"Psssst... hey... you. You like ceviche? Good, good. Then let me tell you about this place, Ceviches. They've got some of the best ceviche in town. And you're not gonna believe this... you build it yourself. Pick your seafood, pick your sauce then pick your ingredients. It's unbelievable. 

You like empanadas and calamari? They've got those too. Yuca fries and paella? Better damn well believe it. I'm telling you, this place is not to be missed. Get there, eat well and thank me later. 

Oh, I almost forgot. No matter what happens, you've gotta try the flan. Don't leave without trying the flan."}
{"text":"Petit resto/cantine latino sympa, sans aucune prétention. N'attendez pas le grand luxe....Avons adorés le ceviche mélangé (18$) + la paella pour 2 personnes (24$), étaient savoureuses et goûtus. Si vous comme moi, vous aimez les fruits de mer dans une ambiance latino, vous allez aimer. Le service du proprio était courtois et souriant. Prix abordables (prix 2 p = 75,37$). Seul bémol, pas d'alcool, dû à leur licence. 

4/5 visité en novembre 2015."}
{"text":"Went with 3 friends for dinner.
1- staff was extremely friendly and always smiling
2- service was fast
3- food was perfect. We ordered mostly everything cevishe paella tacos etc they were all succulent.

I recommend that place"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this place! We were feeling something fresh for dinner and decided a ceviche was just the thing. The place is small but cozy and the owner was very welcoming. He took time to explain the menu and chat a bit with us. We ordered a mixed seafood ceviche and fish tacos. The ceviche was delicious, very nicely seasoned and we enjoyed that we could customize toppings. The seafood was cooked perfectly and same goes for the fish tacos! I've had a lot of fish tacos all over the world and these were up there, very nicely seasoned. It was also affordable! Too bad we were only on holiday if we lived in Montreal this would be a place we visit regularly."}
{"text":"It's a small, casual restaurant with very nice staff.  We ordered a small shrimp ceviche, fish tacos, a side order of saffron rice, deep fried calamari and a sugar cane juice for two people.  The shrimp ceviche was unique as you are allowed to choose your own flavors and toppings.  I chose strawberry but did not taste any.  We ordered a small for $14 and it had 12 shrimps: great value.  The fish tacos were great, best dish for the both of us.  The saffron rice was decent, nothing special.  The deep fried calamari was disappointing as the batter was not crispy enough and was falling off of the calamari.  At the bottom of the dish, there paper it served with had a puddle of water and oil.  We didn't really like the sugar cane juice very much.  Overall, the restaurant is decent, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"What a great dining spot. Cozy and delicious food. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! I absolutely love this place. I just had dinner here with a few friends and I will definitely be back again. The restaraunt is small, the decor is simple, but the friendly service  really fills the room and makes you feel like you've been invited into their home. 

For the five of us, we shared two small mixed ceviches (one flavored with mango and the other with passion fruit and came with all dressed toppings). Now I understand why everyone raves about the ceviches, they were phenomenal as appetizers and really woke up our taste buds. 

The ceviches were followed by some tostones (fried plantain), yucca fries (really good!) and tequenos (fried cheese).  They have really nicely flavored sauces to dip all the fried goodies in. All the baskets were pretty big and I am happy I got to try it all. Had I been there alone or with one other person, I would've really loved a mixed basket that had all three of the items in one basket. 

Afterwards, we shared 3 plates of fish, shrimp and vegetable tacos. They had very generous fillings and tasted really fresh. 

Finally, we finished our meal with their famouse tres leche cake.  This is a must have! You must not leave the restaurant without having it! It is a big piece and I suggest sharing it. 

As for drinks, they do have an alcohol license now, but the juices are probably the best, as the waiter had suggested. The tamarind juice was a little sour and tart, whereas  the lulo juice was much sweeter. At the end of the meal,  a few of us had rose tea and they were kind enough to provide extra hot water that was also infused with rose buds.How thoughtful! 

If the great food is not enough to convince you to try this place out, then the price must be. We had a really satisfying meal for a very decent price and it makes it a very easy choice to return for a nice lunch or casual dinner with either family or friends. I definitely recommend this place!!

Just as a reminder, it is a small restaurant that could accommodate max 10 people at their biggest table and you will want to reserve it as I am sure it can get pretty full really fast."}
{"text":"Solid ceviche, cute place. Yelp says the review needs to be longer, but really, if you want a ceviche in Montreal just go here."}
{"text":"Honestly the best ceviche I've had. Every mouthful was like a burst of flavour on the palate. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love, love loved the ceviches. Making my own was actually really fun. The atmosphere was amazing and so was the decor.
Gladly will comeback again and again."}
