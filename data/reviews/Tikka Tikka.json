{"text":"Visited the area on business and used Qype to find a curry house and ended up at Tikka-Tikka. We had 2 starters, 3 mains and 2 rice with popadoms and nanbread with drinks, all for £40. Was it worth it though? Generally yes, the staff looked after us and the portion size was good and the food tasty. I'm not sure the ostrich curry was anything special but the novelty value got us to buy it ;o) This is an average curry house but was fairly busy for a Wednesday night and we felt it was value for money. I'd go back if i were in the area again. Side note: Toilets were clean and tidy, this is always a good thing to know about a restaurant. X = You've gotta be kidding me XX = trying but not reaching the standard expected or advertised XXX = achieving the standards expected/advertised however high that might be XXXX = they're doing something special here, above expected standards of service XXXXX = WOW! you gotta go here!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about this place is it's changed it's name to 'tikka tikka'. I could never bring myself to go when it had the awful name ' spice lobster '. Very cheap prices and busy ,so busy in fact that they forgot about us and gave our table to someone else then remembered us long enough to try and Charge us for extra drinks. All in all pretty good if you remove questionable service"}
{"text":"I believe this place used to be managed under a different name, anyway, we found ourselves in Scarborough on a Sunday night and there wasn't a great deal of choice. However, we were pleasantly surprised by this place. I am not sure about the decor being nice though, well, unless you like dark blue walls and violet strip fluorescent lights (almost like the sort you have in some public loos..), but the staff were very polite, the service swift and the food good. The bill was very reasonable and it came with a complimentary drink, which on its own deserves a mention and another half star, if I could possibly do so."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced with good quality indian food and a nice ambience. We went in mid-week and it was nearly full. Nicely layed out, and staff more than helpful. Nothing was to much trouble. Very attentive too. Would definately recommend you try Tikka Tikka as we found no faults there what so ever. We would definately go back for seconds."}
{"text":"Nice decor, well lit, very comfy seats and friendly staff. Three of us enjoyed three mains with rice and breads for £28. I had the duck tawa which was served on a sizzling platter. It looked very impressive but unfortunately it was very light on spice and seasoning and was subsequently bland. We also had a butter chicken and chicken korma which were remarkably similar. Naan breads nice but they serve them quartered which is not to my liking. Nothing startling but nothing bad either."}
{"text":"10 of us went for a meal a couple of weeks ago, wasn't sure what to expect as hadn't been beforebut was pleasantly surprised. It was a saturday night and the place was full, there were people also waiting to collect take aways. We all had a starter and a main and several drinks (some had more than others lol) We were there for approximately 3 hourswe weren't rushed along like in some places. After the meal we each got a complimentary drink. We worked the food out to be £15 each which for what we had was brilliant..it was gorgeous, if a little slow to come out..but it was worth the wait though! The staff were very pleasant and the hot towels and minty chocolates after were very welcome indeed. A really pleasant experience and will definately be returning. I did hear the toliets were a little scary? but as I didn't venture downstairs myself I can't really comment."}
{"text":"Major points for being perhaps the only place in Scarborough open til MIDNIGHT!  PLUS: * delicious food-- we recommend the lamb with chickpeas (or okra), the chicken tikka (dry), the spinach-potatoe side. * nice atmosphere, Indian (not pop/disco) music on the sound system * clean bathrooms (as mentioned by another reviewer) * complimentary mini after-dinner drinks served with the bill(!) * if you are REALLY hungry, the meals for 2 are a good value-- 2 entrees, 2 starters, a side, naan & rice for only 23. Would have been too much food for us; we had same but no starters and total was under 18 before drinks! * very friendly service; felt very welcome and never rushed, despite arriving around 11pm and being the last diners to leave.   SUGGESTIONS: * lose the green food coloring included in some dishes (the garlic naan & the yogurt lassi dressing served with salad garnish) * indicate which dishes are spicy, or that you could request some dishes more spicy."}
