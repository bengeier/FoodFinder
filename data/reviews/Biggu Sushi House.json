{"text":"2nd review. 

I've been to this place several times (it is now my default in the neighborhood). Tried the sushi burrito and it was very good! I had the full portion (tuna/salmon specialty). It was 15cad so a bit on high side but had big chunks of fish. I also like that they have a the half-size option (8.95 I think) which in retrospect would probably have been enough. 

I've had sushi burrito in other places (that specialty food truck) and this blew that out of the water. Biggu's version did not have blobs of rice - but seems \"well-mixed\".

Overall, a great place. Staff's still very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is a welcome entry to the neighborhood which needs a good lil sushi spot south of Sheppard and Yonge.

The sushi lives up to the name BIG! Large rolls, huge portions and generally a solid takeout sushi option, will def be coming back.  Nothing overly fancy but good staple items from what I tried

Order the house roll but beware its as big as a 6 inch subway sandwich!! Its huuge!"}
{"text":"Delicious and great portions at a good price! Tried the Burrito Bomb....Had a full one to share and this was more than enough. Not packed full of rice, rather it was fresh with all the sushi roll ingredients, nicely flavored (don't need to add soy sauce) and generous. 
Also ordered salmon poke because we didn't know how big the portions would be. Another pleasant surprise as it was flavorful, but not overpowered. Another great order."}
{"text":"Small place, big size! Rolls are massive and are very tasty. Rice portion was just adequate so you can actually taste whats inside the sushi rolls. Family owned restaurant with excellent service.
We had the party tray D which at first we thought will not be enough for group of 6 but we ended up with some take home. Will come back again."}
{"text":"We passed by Yonge and Sheppard area and noticed Biggu, a recently opened restaurant which serves up Japanese style sushi roll, sashimi, sushi and bento box. We ordered a few different rolls to share, here we have the Alaska Roll ($4.95 for 5) consists of crabmeat, salmon, cucumber, avacado and tobiko. The roll size is big similar to Sushi Bong but the rice lacks the sweetness and rice vinegar flavour. We have to also agreed with another yelper review, the ratio of the rice in the roll is not balanced. We hope to see improvement in the very near future."}
{"text":"We ordered a party tray B to go 2 hours in advance to take advantage of 5% off. Haha

It was our first time ordering from here and we didn't know what to expect. Overall everything tasted pretty good. I've had better tuna but it wasn't bad. Not an abundance of rice in the rolls which is a plus. 

This tray was more than enough for 2. The rolls (especially the house roll) was huge! I looked up the pricing for it alone ($8.50) and I think for the next time I'll just order that and it can be my meal. 

They also give you a huge wad of wasabi/ginger. Definitely didn't skimp out on those!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, not the greatest, but acceptable. Also it is the only place that delivered within our area. We got a party tray plus two rolls which fed 4 people. Strangely the rolls are muchhhhh fishier tasting than any other sushi place, which was not pleasant. Not sure id order again, does not compare to VIP sushi."}
{"text":"Clean. Price is great. Qualify is good. Love their house roll and chopped scallops sushi. Size is big. I go there often for take out. You call in to order and fifteen minutes the food is ready. Their party tray is also great."}
{"text":"My second time there and the level of service is great. The sushi was delicious and at a really affordable price.  You have to try this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The rolls are delicious and well portioned. The filling is fresh and savoury. You must try the SSSR!"}
{"text":"I got the Spider Roll ($10.75), House Roll ($10.50), Spicy Scallop ($4.95) and Tuna & Salmon Combo ($8.20). I recommend sticking to the fancy rolls like Spider and House because the rice is very bland so having the fancy rolls with its toppings covers that fact. I had the basic salmon roll (as part of the combo) and it was very bland. The fish is good but because the rice is bland, it basically took the fish taste away with it. Mind you, it is cheap sushi so it's ok for the price at $2.95 for 6 pcs.

The fancy rolls are biggu, similar to VIPs. For the $10.5 House Roll, you get 5 pcs which if you stack them up feels like you're eating a slightly smaller sushi burrito but with more fish."}
{"text":"Decent Sushi restaurant in an area that desperately needed one. No more walking north of Sheppard to grab my sushi fix. The prices are reasonable and the portions are decent. 

I ordered the daily special (Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box) and a Salmon Don. The chicken teriyaki is not your typical bentobox. I liked that it included a shrimp tempura and a couple crab roll pieces on the side. The only cons would be the bland color presentation (see pic) and the chicken teriyaki to rice ratio was a little off. The teriyaki was breaded which I thought I would not enjoy but the breading was crispy and was a nice change.  For the price I think it was a great deal and a good overall portion. 

The salmon don was fresh and tasty with no cons. The portion was great. Lots of nicely sliced salmon pieces over a bed of rice with radish, seaweed,ginger and wasabi.  

The owner is very friendly and the dining area is clean. I will be getting a few roll dishes to see how they are on my next visit."}
{"text":"I ordered through Ubereats and firstly they forgot the miso soup I ordered.  I called the restaurant and they confirmed they forgot the soup.  I asked them if they can get it delivered they said no but they were willing to do an e-transfer to return the money. I opened the assorted tempura I ordered and lo and behold they claimed the order includes 4 yams and 2 shrimp, I only got 3 yams and 2 shrimp.  It seems that they can't get their orders right so this will be the last time I order through them."}
{"text":"Be wary of when you get food from here.  I ordered take-out on a Sunday evening and the tuna and crab did not smell or taste good.  I've never had crab meat that wanted me to throw up and lose my appetite like that.  I had to throw out the entire \"House Roll\".  The salmon rolls seemed okay so I ate those.  
I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Came here to eat in the afternoon. Ordered the Biggu Special roll. Fod came out fast and workers were friendly decent portions. On par with sushi Bong (slightly better taste) Would recommend for lunch/takeout dinner"}
{"text":"Great price. Decent sushi. They have massive rolls for around 5 to 6 bucks, so its a good place for fast takeout. Not the best sushi I have ever had. They use lots of rice but the price balances it out. I would stay away from their spicy salmon roll though. They use a weird spicy sauce on top that you don't typically expect. The family that provides great service and are very friendly."}
{"text":"very fresh, great value and enormous portions.  similar to samurai sushi in Vancouver. would highly recommend the chopped scallop sushi. definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Rolls are massive! I love the alaska roll ! Sashimi is mediocre . Location is great!! 

Their prices just went up :("}
{"text":"After listening to some coworkers rave about this place, I finally decided to check it out.

I stopped by for lunch on a Friday afternoon around 1pm, with a coworker.  The place wasn't busy so we sat down right away.  The server provided us with take out menus to order from.  How classy ;)

We were both on a strict time line so I ordered a chicken bento box and my coworker ordered the sashimi box.  Miso soup came first which had a decent broth however it was missing seaweed.

Shortly after, the box arrived.  The tempura was blah.  The shrimp was tiny and the batter was too thick and over cooked.  It tasted like the oil had not been changed in days.  The salad had a peanut dressing, which wasnt the best.  Although the california rolls were huge, they were actually TOO big.  I enjoy a piece i can fit it my mouth nicely.  It was my first experience with shredded crab salad in a roll, and it will be my last.  Last but not least, the chicken was deep fried and covered in the same batter.

Why did I give this place two stars?!!  The free underground parking.  That's a definite perk in the Yonge/401/Sheppard corridor!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new neighborhood restaurants and this was our first visit. The staff were super friendly. Very generous amount of food for the price. 

We had ordered Salmon Sushi Bento Box, SSSR and Chicken Teriyaki. The three big pieces of  salmon sashimi came with the Sushi Bento Box was very fresh and delicious. Decent interior with window seating arrangements. Now we don't have to walk that far north to Sheppard for Sushi."}
{"text":"Maybe this is one of those hit-and-miss type sushi places because I have no idea why customer after customer came in to get their take-out orders when I was there. My husband and I both got the bento boxes (beef and salmon) and were completely underwhelmed: - The beef was tough and the salmon was really, really dry
- The side tempura had really thick batter covering a very small shrimp/veggie (maybe ratio was 3:1 in terms of amount of batter)
- The side California sushi, while big and a good amount of rice, had shredded imitation crab meat (versus a full portion)
- The side salad was average, though it was good they gave avocado

To top it off, the service was slowed down because they ran out of rice! The server offered to bring the side stuff out first, which I guess is a way of managing the situation. But that was only after we had been waiting for around 20 mins and, I mean, how can a sushi place mistime cooking rice?

The only reason I don't give this a 1 star is it's relatively cheap compared to other sushi spots. So I guess if you're just looking for something to fill you up, this will work. But if you're going for taste and value for money, there are a number of much better sushi options nearby."}
{"text":"This place just opened recently and it failed to make a good impression. The first thing you notice is a complete lack of decor and atmosphere and worn out furniture. The tea came in disposable cups, which I've never seen before.

The food was unacceptable: giant unwieldy rolls stuffed with mostly cucumber and sushi with fish so smelly I had to leave most of it. My friends couldn't finish their food either, so we got takeout containers, but on the way home gave up and tossed everything into the garbage.

The service was nice, but I don't see myself coming back or recommending this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"For the price that you pay, their Korean style sushi is quite tasty. I really enjoyed their scallop roll.. though I wasn't a big fan of their beef teriyaki roll. Their sushiWill definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I was excited for a sushi place in this location. I tried the house special - it is just alright. I didn't really like so much crab meat to be honest, and I don't think the sauce with the meat was very good. Like the other reviewers said, it is too much meat for the rice (it falls apart after one bite). It was not really worth the price but I think I will try the other sushi next time if I were to go again. I can tell that the owner is trying hard to make this store work as they have added many new options - ubereats, just eat, for convenience."}
{"text":"My friend had a 10% off coupon to this restaurant so we decided to try it out. It's located about 5 minute walk from Yonge-Sheppard which makes it very convenient to go for lunch during weekdays. There was only 1 other customer in there so I guess it's still too new to be that popular during lunchtime. 

I ordered the spider roll (5 pieces, $7.95). The rolls were huge but there was a bit too much rice for my liking. The food was not bad overall. You can tell the waitresses are very new as they don't really know what they're doing and have to consult with each other when you ask a question. Overall, the food was alright and I would probably come back if I was really craving sushi. Lost 2 stars for the service and not great price."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Uber eats. The uber eats prices seem to be more expensive than the prices posted here. The sushi was pretty \"meh\", a lot of the shredded crab salad (they don't use the typical crab sticks - just the shredded crab you find in those grocery store rolls). I also tried the crab salad and it was weird - the shredded crab on top of green salad with a sort of peanut dressing (not the typical orange ginger dressing you get at sushi restaurants). I didn't find it very good tbh and I don't think I'll over again."}
{"text":"Biggu Sushi is a new a la carte sushi restaurant that opened up a few months ago. And the sushi they make is really BIG-gu - you won't go hungry.

I think some of the finer details are missing - if you're ordering in, you order from a takeout menu. And if you want to see pictures of what you're ordering, they have a board on the wall that shows some of the recommend rolls and party trays by the cashier. I would've liked to see a full size menu that included all these things professionally done.

Let's go back to the rolls. If you pick up Party Tray B like we did ($29.99), the rolls are BIG. So big that I had trouble lifting it with chopsticks. Much of the roll is filled with mayo crab salad, which I view as cheap filling but it beats feeling hungry after leaving. The sushi pieces that were part of our sushi tray tasted good too.

They also have sushirittos which I haven't gotten a chance to try, as well as what appears to be daily specials on the board. More things to try for next time.

Service was great. The staff did a good job keeping our water glasses full, though I get the impression (on a weekday lunch) that they weren't as busy as they probably need to be.

They do have some curious discounts, for ordering an hour in advance or a day in advance."}
{"text":"Biggu serves huge portions...it's awesome. The sushi rice is a little different. Everything tasted great! Service was friendly and fast. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great to have a little sushi place so close to home! The employees were really friendly and helpful. I got take out, and it was super quick. They even offered tea and water while we waited. 

The rolls are quite big! They are packed with fillings, and also quite a lot of rice which is a good balance. 

Price was great for take out! I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Review for take out experience:

This place opened about a month ago and is operated by a very friendly and lovely family. The service is excellent and staff are very warm. 

Unfortunately, the food suffers a bit. The sushi is giant and the balance from rice to topping ratio is off. On the contrary, their soon to be released item is very tasty. 

Hopefully with some adjustments they will top up as a go-to-sushi stop on Yonge street. I really want them to do well."}
{"text":"This place is really good value. 

It's definitely a small and unassuming restaurant but this place is probably now my go-to for quick and inexpensive sushi.

This place seems to be family owned, I see the same people in there every time I go in. It's definitely not the nicest looking place but it's inviting enough, there's a sushi counter at the front, also where you order and pay for takeout. There's also an option to dine in. 

I've tried a couple of the daily specials, which is either a beef or chicken bento box and a sushi combo special which comes with a few different rolls. I've also ordered some rolls a-la-carte. The first and most notable thing is the size of their rolls, I ordered the Alaska roll and it was too big to fit into my mouth in one bite. Really generously filled and not heavy on the rice, I was really impressed by these and I think a whole roll is only about $5-6. The bento boxes are also value intensive. They come with a nice portion of meat, rice, green salad, a couple of crab meat rolls, soup, and then one shrimp and some veggie tempura. At under $10 this is just ridiculous value and the quality is good, I really can't complain. 

I've only ever taken food out so I can't speak much to the dine-in experience but while waiting for my food, I've always been offered water or tea and am invited to have a seat. The service is very kind and I always feel welcomed which is something that will keep me coming back. 

Will definitely be going back, I actually already have plans to go back this weekend!"}
{"text":"On my way to work this morning I drove past Biggu Sushi and their logo/sign immediately caught my eye. That was it, tonight I was going to pick-up sushi on my way back. First impression, the parking situation isn't very convenient. There's a very small lot behind the strip plaza (maybe five parking spots) and street parking along Florence Avenue which is usually pay-to-park however it is free in the evenings. When I reached the restaurant I was surprised to see not a single person in the small dining room. For a Friday night at 7pm this was not a good sign. I had a look at the take-out options while the hostess stood over me. Upon enquiring, I learned their sushi combos do not include salad/miso soup as usual with sushi take-outs I've been to in the past. Only their bento boxes included it. The hostess suggested the sushi burrito (available with spicy salmon, spicy tuna, or the Biggu special which includes various fillings). The thought of a sushi burrito (a pretty simple concept I've never seen elsewhere) was enticing and I settled on the half-size spicy salmon for $7.50 plus tax. Thinking back, I should have taken the full-sized one as I'm feeling hungry as I write this about 2.5 hours later. For those who can't picture it, just imagine a burrito using sushi ingredients and nori (seaweed) instead of a tortilla. Upon sitting down to my burrito I was surprised to see the spicy salmon is not the standard pre-made chopped salmon with spicy mayo but rather actual pieces of sashimi salmon. Very good so far! Also in the burrito were crab salad (thin pieces in a creamy sauce), cucumber, avocado, crispy tempura flakes, tobiko caviar, and lettuce (?!). While the execution was good, the lettuce was brownish and lettuce shouldn't have been part of any type of sushi in my opinion. Tasty-wise, it was average. While the spicy salmon was there, I much prefer the chopped version mixed with the spicy mayo. Overall, for the money I paid I feel I got what I was expecting however in future I think I'll stick to traditional sushi options. My only suggestion is that the sushi combos come with salad and miso soup. Even if they raise the price another $1 it'll be worth it as it's something most people expect when they order sushi."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. Ordered delivery twice. First time it was delicious. Second time it was as if I ordered from a different restaurant. Everything seemed to be prepared differently. Age Dashi tofu was a gooey, chewy mess. Rolls were kinda tasteless. Tempura over fried in thick batter. Sashimi was bland. Felt like my tastebuds weren't working. Nothing tasted good. Wasn't satisfying."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, and generous portions. However, the rice in the sushi I had was on the mushy side/overcooked. Another thing is, if you eat in, they serve everything in disposable cups and plates. When I asked why, the waitress responded because they are more like a take-out restaurant. But I was being served in a sit-down style restaurant. Either way, this excuse is a real turn-off for me as it shows a lack of social responsibility towards the environment. Even if you are a take out restaurant, why not go the extra mile and charge a deposit for reusable take out containers that customers have to bring back? The majority of your customers probably either work in the area or live around the area, so I don't see why we need to create all this excess garbage to eat a few pieces of sushi. I would go back to try it again, but since everything is served in disposable cups and plates, it makes me so upset and I probably won't go back, sorry."}
{"text":"Biggu Sushi looks nondescript from the outside, on the 2nd floor of an easily overlooked plaza on Yonge and Florence Ave. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the food does not match its appearance!

The portion sizes here are BIG and overall the food is tasty. Some highlights were their Fire Mountain Roll and Dynamite King Rolls, which were both amazing. Their Chirashi Don, however, was lackluster.

The owner (I'm assuming) was very friendly and halfway through our meal, offered us seafood based Miso Soup on the house. While the seafood itself wasn't necessarily fresh, the broth itself was delicious and a satisfying combination of savoury and fishy.

I'm so glad to have found this place as I'll likely be coming back on the regular!"}
{"text":"A nice stairway climb in a busy intersection plaza at Yonge and the 401 leads to a great friendly staff always welcoming me into the restaurant. The sushi quality is amazing, the prices are reasonable and definitely worth it for the quality and serving sizes that you get. If you haven't tried their sushi burrito, it is massive and filled with flavour. The best part is that they have different types of sushi burritos in case you want a spicy type of sushi burrito or not. The full size of a sushi burrito is massive, you have to be very hungry in order to finish a whole burrito, it is safe to order 1/2 a sushi burrito as I'm sure there is enough rice, fish, and complimentary sushi ingredient combinations within the sushi burrito. I have also tried their specialty maki rolls (Ex. Futomaki, spicy salmon, etc.) which are all made with high quality ingredients bringing out a delicious enjoyable bite of the sushi piece. I want to try other types of maki that their sushi chef can prepare in the near future. Also, to make my experience very convenient, I called in advance and put in my order for a 3:30 PM pick up and it was ready for pick up immediately as I walked in for the pick up.

The only thing that some people may find surprising is the location of the bathroom which is near their kitchen, as their staff members walk you through the kitchen to use their bathroom. It is not a bad thing as the bathroom is very clean and the staff is friendly, so it is nothing to worry about.

I highly recommend this place as their food has impressed me, free parking can be found in the underground of the plaza. (Please be careful as you are driving your car into the underground public parking because if you are entering too quickly you may hit the bottom of your car/front bumper).

Enjoy the sushi."}
{"text":"New place that opened a week or so, pretty nice looking inside with many places to sit. Everyone there were extremely friendly and helpful giving me recommendations. Menu had lots of variety and prices were low. I ordered a soft shell crab roll $7.95, Alaska roll (salmon, crab meat, cucumber and avocado) $4.95, and deluxe chirashi $15.95 for take out. The rolls were 5 pieces each, however very big.. Took me 3 bites average to eat each piece. Taste was pretty good, although I do prefer to have less rice within each roll.. Tastes somewhat similar to Sushi Bong. The chirashi had okay variety, however the rice they used was from the rice cooker that was warm, so by the time
I got to eat it, the sashimi was quite warm as well...not too pleasant to eat. Overall, I think this place is pretty good in terms of quality and seeing their prices are very low can be a good hit in North York!"}
{"text":"The sashimi is not very fresh and the dynamite is full of cucumber with a tiny piece of shrimp tempera in it. The sushi pieces are big, and waitress are nice . Overall, will not go again."}
