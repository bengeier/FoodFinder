{"text":"I. love. Eden.   Why?   - Great service; they are always knowledgeable and don't look at you like you have 3 heads when you ask them about their ingredients or mention your food allergy.   - It's small, intimate, clean & simple.   - The food is DELICIOUS. Even my husband who is the farthest thing from GF or vegan absolutely loved everything we ordered from the raw menu. In my opinion, their chef is one of the most skilled I've ever encountered because they are making delicious dishes that you don't at all feel like you're missing out on stuff from (as you sometimes do with GF/vegan dishes).   - Everything is fairly priced for what you are getting.   - Their raw desserts are AMAZING and have no added sugar!   I love love love Eden- I only wish they had more hours & more locations :)"}
{"text":"Super fresh food.  Fun, bohemian atmosphere with waitrons with colored hair and piercings.  Very friendly and welcoming.  Healthy meals that use fresh local ingredients and are made to order.  Innovative food couplings.  If you at all like to eat for health, then this is in the top three restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have gone here many times and it's my go-to place for sure!  Pros:  The only raw place in Pittsburgh The owner/chef is such a nice person Some dishes are phenomenal, like the nachos, mouse, cheesecakes, etc The waitress, Barbie, is very knowledgeble and friendly The location's great, with a nice little European outdoor seating area Everything possible is local and organic  Cons: Some dishes are really pricey for the portions, like strawberries with honey and watermelon ice Some dishes are bleh, like the spouted lentil salad and bruschetta  Overall, I love it!! I haven't made it to the brunch yet, but that's next."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant in trendy Shadyside, good for a first date. I liked the art and conversation cards on the table. I'm vegetarian, and this was actually my first time trying cashew cheese. I had the ((fall menu))  beet ravioli, pierogis, and roasted veggies with brown rice. Everything tasted fantastic!!!! Truly pleasantly surprised to try the coconut sour cream!! We also got a french press, they only had medium roast, but it was roasted specially for Eden by a local Pgh company and it was delicious. The entree  portion sizes were good, but the appetizer was a little expensive IMO. For dessert I had the pear sorbet, and my husband had a brownie parfait. Pricy, but worth the experience if you don't normally make food like this. Our deserts were sweetened with dates and honey. You definitely don't leave Eden feeling weighed down or sleepy!!  For $55 we got a french press, two smoothies, an appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts, all vegan all delicious. I'm  happy :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Really enjoyed the complexity of these dishes.  Very unique and the service was fantastic.  I'll definitely return here again!"}
{"text":"This place is very quirky and reminded of a place I would find in Los Angeles. The service was great and the menu diverse. Even though it's a raw, vegan restaurant, cooked food and meat were available. My only qualm was that everything was too salty, as though to compensate for lack of cooking. The desserts were delicious, although the crusts of the pies too salty. I think I drank six glasses of water, which was way too much."}
{"text":"I read about the long wait times but I was in no rush so I went to check it out. Vegan food isn't really difficult to find in Pittsburgh but finding a new one is welcome.  I was in at noon on a Saturday (and, as previously commented, it's a little less obvious than other places on the street) and the server noticed me right away. The artwork apparently changes: I saw some great spooky photos in equally awesome frames.  I went with the black bean burger; there was no vegan cheese left because they had used it all for the soup of day: broccoli cheddar. Well, that's a great excuse if I ever heard one so I'll also have that. Oh, it comes with it? Sold, sir, sold..."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh and high quality. The portions are somewhat small, however.  The vegan waffles taste amazing, but they don't give you enough for it be filling. For close to $10 for one waffle, you can't help but feel that it isn't a good value. The raw ice cream cake is a must try. I can't remember the name of it--it must have been seasonal because I don't see it on the menu.  Experiencing raw foods is fun and exciting. It's rare to find raw restaurants, especially in the Pittsburgh area. I like that I can leave this restaurant feeling healthy, but it isn't filling enough for it to be 100% satisfying.  95% of the items are vegan--just ask. Some desserts contain honey."}
{"text":"As a vegan transplant to Pittsburgh, I've been constantly disappointed by my options. I can only eat mediocre tofu dishes at so many Garfield (Spak excepted) and South Side restaurants before I just give up and never eat out.  Until Eden.  What they do with food is incredible.  Everything I've had there has been mind-blowing-- if you're afraid of raw food, never fear. Most of the dishes I've tried I can't believe are made from the ingredients they are (spectacular beet carpaccio, a delightful avocado-based chocolate mousse, creamy cashew cheese, etc.). I've tried the tasting menus for the last three seasons, and my dining companions and I always spend the entire meal just repeating \"oh my god this is amazing\" over and over again.  I know Pittsburgh's food scene is evolving quickly, but Eden's commitment to fresh, local ingredients is admirable even among the \"foodie\" set. They change their menu seasonally to highlight what is available, and they do some of the most creative things with food I've seen in a long time. And they don't charge an arm and a leg for it-- the tasting menu is only $15 (a splurge for me, but always worth it), and if you bring a cheapish bottle of wine (they are BYOB), you can have a fantastic, fancy meal for less than $25 a person.  (Their non-raw brunch is also great, though I've only been once. The vegan breakfast burrito blows other restaurants' out of the water. They are accommodating to dietary restrictions and substitution requests, which I appreciate. Plus their juices are awesome- bring some prosecco and make mimosas with their pink juice. Trust me.)"}
{"text":"Fantastic real food. Juices, smoothies, raw options, vegan offerings, non vegan as well. Everything super yummy. Coffee was delicious with that sweetness you usually get from cold brew (it wasn't cold though and I don't know if it was cold brew). My family and I had brunch, even the most carnivorous were very pleasantly surprised and happy!"}
{"text":"Love the zucchini ravioli! Smoothies and their dessert are always good and very healthy.  Clean great food!  So glad there is a restaurant like Eden in Pittsburgh!!! It's a must try !"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious. I always take my out-of-town visitors here, even when they are not vegetarian, and everyone has loved it. It's a great addition to Pittsburgh's vegetarian dining scene. Also great for people who are gluten-free."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place.  Shadyside needs a healthy, delicious lunch spot.... so I was hoping this would be it.  It's not.  First of all, Eden is a re-do of the previous restaurant, The Juice Box Cafe.   Which in my opinion, missed the boat.  I was hesitant to order once I figured that out because the service at The Juice Box was SO SLOW.  Anyhow, I have it a try and an HOUR later my lunch was brought to me (which at this point was in take out form because I couldn't wait a minute longer).  My grilled cheese panini (wasn't even put on the panini press for more than 10 seconds- it was like eating bread straight out of the bag).    I don't really get how they could screw up a second restaurant.  Hire more people, get people in and out during the lunch hours. I mean, come on... they are making smoothies and turkey sandwiches.  The food is OK, but not worth waiting an hour for.   Bummer.   Side note: I heard several other people complaining about the exact same thing.  Two people walked out while I was there."}
{"text":"Delicious introduction to raw vegan food - their 3 course sampler for $15 is a steal and always the way to go in my opinion!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had delicious raw fudge and great sea \" pizza\". But I got the cashew cheese plate dish along with the sea pizza and crumbled the leftover cashew cheese over the pizza and it tasted a lot like cheese pizza! But overall it's a great place to go to if you want a great meal and have healthy food."}
{"text":"Excellent. I can't believe how reasonable the prices are for such sophisticated flavors and interesting dishes. I'm not even a vegetarian! I've heard the menu changes with the seasons, so I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Eden is definitely the best vegan/GF restaurant in Pittsburgh! I've been there twice and loved my entree both times. Their apple pancake was a huge portion and went really great with the spreads they served with it. The jackfruit crab salad sandwich was confusing until I asked, and once our server explained that it was fruit somehow made the exact taste and consistency as crab, I had to try it. That was an experience for sure. Not my favorite of the two, but definitely what was advertised and good for what it was!"}
{"text":"Food: Eden specializes in raw gluten-free vegan food, setting in apart from almost all restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The menu consists of raw vegan appetizers, raw vegan entrees, prepared vegan entrees, and raw vegan desserts.  When they say raw vegan, they mean it.  These are uncooked vegetables with no dairy or animal products whatsoever.  However, upon request, they will accommodate carnivores with free range organic chicken added to a meal.  We ordered a soup, one entree, (the tempeh mole) and the sampler.  The soup was carrot based, cold, and was a special item for that evening.  Although the waiter warned us that it was 'mild,' it was loaded with flavor and delicious.  The mole was from the prepared menu and comes with the option of tortillas on the side, which we recommend.  It was flavorful but not too spicy.  The sampler comes with small portions of all three appetizers, all three raw unprepared entrees, and all three desserts.  Everything we were served was delicious and loaded with flavor.  Despite being vegetarians for years, there were items on the sampler that we had never tried at a restaurant, like 'steak and potatoes' that was actually dehydrated mushrooms and creamed cauliflower, and 'french fries' which were uncooked dehydrated cabbage.  The best items we tried were the beet ravioli, the marinated veggie pizza, the zucchini pasta, and the banana pie dessert.  The menu changes seasonally and there are daily specials.  This is one of the most unique menus in Pittsburgh.  Vegetarians and vegans will be in paradise, and their adventurous carnivore friends will too (and there is chicken if they aren't keen on veggies).  Price: Appetizers are $5-6, entrees are $8-13, and desserts are $5-7.  Their extensive drink menu ranges from $2-7 depending on whether you are getting a shot, juice, or smoothie.  As mentioned above, two of us shared the sampler and a regular entree.  We were still a bit hungry after dinner.  If you plan to order the sampler to try everything (which I recommend), I would also order one entree per person because the samples are very small (1-2 bites).  The entrees aren't huge, so you will be able to finish one per person and the sampler, and you will be glad you ordered it.  The prices are fair.  The portion sizes aren't huge, but the quality and variety of the ingredients is impressive.  Drinks: Eden is BYOB with no corkage fee.  They also have a crazy-huge list of homemade juices, smoothies, and other healthy cocktails.  Most drinks come with some type of super-food in them, and they are all delicious.  They're a bit pricey, but loaded with combinations of ingredients you would never put together at home.  Atmosphere: There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  We did not make a reservation and got a table on a Friday night, but by the time we left, it was very busy and there was a wait for a table.  The outdoor patio is separated by a fence from the Girasole patio.  There are large and small tables.  Service: Both the manager and our waiter stopped at our table many times throughout the course of our meal.  Our waiter explained every menu item extensively and thoroughly so that we not only knew what was in each plate, but exactly what combinations of flavors to anticipate tasting.  They refilled our water often, answered all of our questions, and brought the check quickly.  The service was excellent.  They both explained that they are always trying to develop new menu items and appreciate customer feedback.  (+): delicious and healthy food, exotic foods and drinks, helpful and friendly staff, great concept  (-): a bit pricey relative to the serving sizes at other restaurants (likely due to quality of ingredients)  Would I go back again? Without question, both for food and juices/smoothies, to get more of what we have already tasted, and to taste the new menu each season."}
{"text":"I went to Eden last night with my girlfriend, and we had an amazing time! The ambiance was little date-like, but considering my company, it was fine. It's a pretty small, but cozy little space, the kind where the person eating next to you might ask what you're eating, but I personally like that.   So, the food: Since it was our first time there and being sort of unfamiliar with raw food, we decided to order the sampler plate that let's you try all 9 raw items on the menu (3 apps, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts) and one hot dish.   The sampler plate was simply amazing! There wasn't one thing I didn't like. Of the appetizers, my favorite was the curry salad. The curry flavor was just perfect, not too overpowering. And since there were apples in the salad, the sweetness really complemented the savory curry flavor. The beet ravioli was delicious as well. Of the entrees, my favorite was the vegetable \"pizza.\" It was so crunchy and flavorful. My girlfriend really like the zucchini spaghetti. The sauce was delicious and the cashews really did taste like parmesan cheese. Now, the desserts. The desserts were OUT of this world! I could not get enough! I thought the raspberry cheesecake was the most delicious thing I'd ever tasted, but the coconut crumble and the mint chocolate were literally almost as delicious. We were both so so happy with the food. Definitely worth the $15 we spent on it.  We ordered the joloff rice as our hot dish, and it was really good as well. We ate every last bit. Often times peanut dishes are really dry, and after eating a bit, you just can't handle anymore. That was not the case with this dish. It was the perfect moisture and the flavor was oh so good.  On top of that, our server was just so super friendly and knowledgeable. Overall, we really just loved our dinner, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in trying something different!"}
{"text":"The food was insanely good, the waitress was super nice, and the atmosphere ruled. Also they have cute little cards on all the tables with icebreaker questions which is really fun. It's BYOB, also.   Go here if you want vegan food that doesn't feel like it's missing anything! I'm not even vegan and I loved this place so much."}
{"text":"This place offers exceptional vegan food, providing some really unique dishes. The prices are a bit more than usual, but your meal will be a large portion so you do get your money's worth! You can also bring your own wine :-).   The restaraunt is on the tiny side, but the atmosphere is very welcoming and relaxed. I would recommend calling to make reservations on an evening, this helps avoid a 30 minute wait.   I would definitely recommend this lovely restaraunt (if you are not claustrophobic)!"}
{"text":"Eden is hit or miss- while it's always worked out for me, some of the things my friends have gotten haven't been quite as tasty. I recently got their Cajun stew which was healthy, flavorful, and of a reasonable portion size. (What I have found is that typically Eden excels with their hot entrees; their cold/raw options might be better suited for getting during the summer or when the weather improves.) Ambiance is kitschy/gunning for zen-vibes and service is pretty efficient."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great dinner here.  She is gluten intolerant and the waiter (Theo) was  very knowledgeable and helpful.  You have to try the 3 chili stew. Spicy, delicious, and filling.  Their \"goat cheese\"  is made from nuts and is fantastic.  It  was a great meal and we are going back today for brunch.  Definitely put  Eden on your must try list."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh food, and a new way of looking at dining. I've recently gotten interested in vegan and raw food, and this was a great place to \"research\"! Friendly staff and the tasting menu is simply amazing."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with the food I can get during brunch here. The Brie stuffed French toast is great and the coconut butter that comes with it is out of this world. I've also tried the falafel wraps, however, mistakenly ordered them with a side salad rather than fruit or soup. There was too much lettuce on my plate. Everything is always fairly fresh though and the service is decent. The decor changes frequently, as it is local art on display for sale, which keeps the experience interesting. Only big complaint is occasionally receiving a dirty glass or silverware. Most utensils and plates are from ikea and not great quality; it adds a little \"cheapness\" to the experience that doesn't match the quality or freshness of the food. The smoothies are a little sugary but most of them are very tasty too! Highly recommend for people looking for a light, healthy meal that is uniquely refreshing."}
{"text":"Funky Sunday brunch. Reservations a must. Eclectic menu for vegan and non-vegan alike. Reasonable prices. Great service. Will be back when we visit our daughter at Pitt again."}
{"text":"Ate here only once (so far), for brunch, but it was great! And the price was great too. We got (vegan? tasted normal) waffles with fresh fruit, and a curry omelet which was interesting and delish, and came with carrot soup. Satisfying meal, and not at all greasy or heavy like so much brunch food. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"So fun! We split the tasting menu and the pickled vegetable tacos between two people, and we each got a smoothie. The waitress told us that we wouldn't have enough food (as in we should order the tasting menu and two entrees) but with the smoothies we were both stuffed by the end of our meal. The food was fun and creative, they did some really nice things with the textures of the different dishes. I felt like some things were misnomers (are slices of cucumber with pesto in between really comparable to ravioli?) so don't order off the menu blindly...try the tasting menu the first time you go! My blueberry and coconut smoothy was amazing, and the tacos were really good. Everything was fresh and service was good, it's nice to have something different to try when you want to go out but also want to be healthy! Can't wait to try the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, and my mother does the gluten-free thing. As we share a birthday, this often leaves my brother scratching his head on where to take us for our birthday. This year he suggested Eden, and I have to admit that I was skeptical.  I know that vegetarian food can be amazeballs, but I haven't had great luck in Pittsburgh, and the promise of no gluten, processed sugar, etc, etc, left me skeptical. Luckily, I was so burned out on unhealthy holiday food that I agreed to Eden, if only because I appreciated the concept of a healthy dinner.  Boy howdy, I'm glad that I did.  My party of four bought out most of the menu and shared because everything was so unique that we all couldn't make up our minds.  Drinks  Everyone else got a smoothie. They all loved theirs, though I didn't try them. I admit that at this point of the meal, my skepticism kept me from being comfortable with a $5 fruit/vegetable drink. I did get the french press of coffee, and it was very good.  Appetizers  The stuffed avocado wasn't stuffed so much as topped, but it was good besides. The tanginess of the dressing and the crunch of the cabbage paired well with the avocado. It didn't blow me away, but it was more than good enough for me to go back for seconds ... and thirds.  The beet ravioli was perhaps everyone's favorite appetizer: thinly shaved beets cut into squares and sandwiched around some sort of creamy-nut filling. While far from a traditional ravioli, it totally worked.  The pumpkin hummus was hummus made from pumpkin seeds, not your traditional pumpkin-spice flavor, and it was polarizing. It had a smoky flavor, a bit of a tang (kind of like miso) and it came with marinated carrot chips and raw crackers. I rather liked it, but I think I was the only one.  Entrees  I decided to opt for the truly raw side of the entree menu,, and thus decided on a pizza with tomato slices, tons of basil, a garlic-cream topping, and some other stuff. The \"crust\" was spongey and didn't hold up to its responsibilities well; I had to eat the pizza with a fork. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't unique or delicious enough for me to order it again.  My mother ordered the mac n' cheese. It was deliciously creamy, chock full of vegetables, and the pasta tasted like pasta should. I think it lacked the tang of real cheese, but it was still a big ole pile of delicious comfort-food. I'd order it in a heartbeat.  My brother decided on the butternut squash pierogies, which I so foolishly didn't order because I couldn't comprehend how a vegan, gluten-free restaurant could do anything but ruin the wonder of the pierogie. They were amazing. They weren't just \"good for a gluten-free, vegan pierogie,\" they were good even when stacked against real pierogies. I will be going back for those pierogies.  My sister-in-law ordered a salad that, alas, I did not try. She said it was good, but wished she had ordered something more interesting.  Dessert  I grew up in a health-food house, and few things bring back bad memories quite like desserts made out of fruits and honey and carob when all I wanted was a piece of real cake. As such, even with the amazing meal, I was a little nervous about dessert. Again, I was wrong.  I ordered the pear sorbet, and it was so full of pear flavor and had this blissful vanilla finish. It was good. It was really good. I would order it again, and again, and again.  My other favorite was the chocolate sundae-thingy. With no processed sugar, I assumed it would be an abomination, but it was creamy and perfectly sweet. I was shocked by how much I liked it, really.  The other two desserts, an apple tart and a slice of pumpkin pie, were good. If we had ordered those and nothing else, I'm fairly sure I would have thought they were great, but compared to the pear sorbet and the chocolate sundae, there was no comparison.  Service  Our server was friendly, prompt, and personable. She was great with water refills, and pleasant. You can't really ask for more than that.  Overall  Honestly, it's rare for me to experience a new restaurant and want to return, but Eden is going to be shuffled into the rotation."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of eating on the healthier side, so I thought Eden seemed like a great place to go for Sunday Brunch.  It's located in a lower level shop in-between other shops, the outside is very timid and cute.  Walking in, you could see the entire eating area which holds roughly about 30 people.  Pieces of art hung on the walls for sale, and very eclectic style decor.  The waitstaff were all very polite and knowledgeable.  Service was a bit on the slower side, but there were only 3 girls working the floor.  I ordered the vegan and gluten free waffles that came with vegan butter and local maple syrup.  It was absolutely outstanding for waffles and being gluten free.  I also ordered the Energizer smoothie which was also perfect!  A smooth blend of kale, spirolina, raspberry, blueberry, and apple.  If you're intimidated by having kale in a smoothie, just try it, you don't even taste it! I will, without a doubt, be returning to try the winter menu and more brunch menu items!"}
{"text":"We went there with a group of eleven, only two of which are vegetarian. It's safe to say the majority of us weren't exactly excited about going here. That quickly changed. Our server was warm, very attentive, knowledgeable, and patient. Some of the best service I've had in awhile and the fact that we were a large group made it all the more impressive. The food was excellent. Creative, delicious, and well prepared. I would love to give Eden four stars, but there was one rather significant problem. It was so humid in the restaurant that it became unbearable. Really, it was like a rainforest. I hope they get that worked out because it really detracted from an otherwise wonderful meal. BYOB was a plus!"}
{"text":"Only been there once but the enchiladas were phenomenal. Seems a little pricey but raw, vegan enchiladas that taste amazing? I'll pay"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, good ambiance, attentive waitstaff. What's not to love? Go for the tasting menu (small portions of all of their appetizers, entrees, and desserts). It's a hard call, otherwise, to pick the best dish, and the tasting menu's ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant!!! One of the best vegan meals I have had! The service was amazing and answered all my questions thoroughly. I ate the pirogies and they were delicious!!! Plus their coconut sour cream was outstanding!! An amazing place and I would recommend it even for non-vegans!"}
{"text":"Had an incredible dinner here on Friday.  Great attention to detail and a wonderful server. The beet ravioli were to die for -- raw beets, sliced thin with an almond-lemon mixture inside, drizzled with the freshest basil pesto made an incredibly savory treat.  We also split the veggie \"fries\" (mostly dehydrated root vegetables) with an amazing homemade ketchup that was sweetened by dates (amazing).  As an entree, I had the raw zucchini spiraled into a fettuccine tossed in a tomato basil sauce with some nut garnish.  Also amazing.  Definitely worth a visit.  BYOB and a great value overall."}
{"text":"Delicious food, personable service, calming atmosphere, reasonable prices.  This is the healthiest and most delicious food I've ever eaten in Pittsburgh.  Go there.  Try the zucchini spaghetti and the beet ravioli and the recently added joloff."}
{"text":"Wow, I might consider becoming vegan after eating at Eden. The food was delicious. Lots of interesting flavors & textures. The macaroni and cheese was creamy slightly nutty from the coconut milk. Full of fresh vegetables. Don't pass up the dessert, chocolate & raspberry, so good!"}
{"text":"You know when you're watching a really good film with subtitles and you forget, maybe not even notice that you're reading. That's what it's like to eat at Eden. You are eating something so fantastic, you don't even realize it's raw. Or gluten free. Or without processed sugar. Or soy. You just feel great! I'm hooked!!! - signed a carnivore."}
{"text":"I am in no stretch of the imagination a vegan or a vegetarian so naturally, I wasnt too excited about a meal that didnt contain meat but I went to Eden to satisfy my dining buddys need to eat healthy. This was the second time I had been to Eden so I knew what it was all about; the first time I was in for brunch and it was great. This time I got the Cheesy Penne and it was seriously amazing. I would have never known there wasnt real cheese in it! Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place at first and even more so once I arrived but was pleasantly surprised once the food arrived.  It is small inside so try to make a reservation. Also BYOB and they do have a cute little patio out front. It was very busy on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and the service was extremely slow.  Took a very long time for us to order, the food to come out and had to ask multiple times for the check.  Luckily we enjoyed the food and good company.  A great place to go  if you are a vegetarian or vegan.  They have a lot of nice options on the menu and very big portions. I went with the omelet of the day which came with 2 kinds of cheese, spinach and zucchini.  It was one of the biggest omelets I have even eaten and had great flavor.  It also comes with a side of your choice and I went with the special that day of the green bean salad. All very fresh and flavorful and shows that you do not need meat to have flavor!  Others in my party tried the crab cake sandwich and pancakes and enjoyed there entrees as well. We even tried veggie bacon which was pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Had the raw pizza from the $15 menu. Really unique and flavorful! Definitely a gem, though I recommend ordering takeout, as their service isn't nearly as good"}
{"text":"Never again. Waited almost 90 minutes for our food with 2 waitresses and few customers there.  The place looked as if it was closing up.  No art on the walls, empty frames, bathroom overlooking with trash.  What a pity that we spent an evening in such a dingy place.  We asked for a table outside and no attempt was even made to help us get outside."}
{"text":"A friend from out of town was visiting (he's vegetarian) and my other friend and I decided to take him here since it's close to us and has good reviews. It ended up being a little pricey because it's too hard to pass up the appetizers and dessert, but it was well worth it. We got the beet ravioli as an appetizer. For entrees, two of us got mac and cheese and our friend got the pierogies. All were very tasty. The mac and cheese had a unique (but delicious!) flavor since it's obviously not made with dairy. It was a little on the saltier side but I didn't mind. We got three different desserts - the apple tart, the chocolate brownie parfait, and the pumpkin pie. They were all fantastic and presented very well. I had the pumpkin pie and it was amazing. It had the perfect texture and the perfect amount of spice and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I'd come here just for dessert! The service was good and it was a cozy atmosphere. Their website lists the local vendors where some of their ingredients come from. Even though I'm not vegan, I still appreciate fresh, local, organic food. I'll definitely come back. I'd like to try their brunch sometime."}
{"text":"Yum. Loved the food. Very creative very healthy. The avocado maki was fantastic. The mung bean noodles were really interesting and tasty- I liked the addition of the bowls to the menu. My only request is to bring back some of the cooked items!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little hole in the wall! And Eden is definitely the definition of \"hole in the wall\" - if I hadn't been given the address to look for, I never would have found it. It's on a lower level and tucked away between two other businesses in Shadyside. But clearly the word's gotten out about this place, if it's managed to stay around for three years already.  Disclaimer: I'm not vegan, vegetarian, ect., nor do I need to eat a gluten free diet. I know a lot of people who are, though, and they consider Eden a little piece of heaven in a city that otherwise doesn't always offer the best options for them.   As for me? I have to say, Eden's food is pretty darn yummy. I ordered a delicious penne dish with the expected noodles, plus tomatoes, squash and zucchini - all of it slavered in a coconut Alfredo. I ordered chicken to top it off and couldn't have been happier with my choice. It was amazingly fresh (it had multiple organic ingredients) and very tasty! My only complaint: I would have loved for there to be more tomatoes and squash in the mix. I love me some pasta, but you can never overdo the veggies and fruit, either.   While waiting for your food I recommend getting a cup of tea while here. I ordered the red berry tea and fell in love with it pretty quickly. I'd come back just for a pot of that! But also because I'm dying to try their salads and maybe their banana bread with walnut and Cinnamon butter. Yum!  So, why only 4 stars? One, the place is very small, so if it ever gets busy the cozy little cafe space I enjoyed tonight could quickly become a very uncomfortable sardine can. Two, they have a very tiny, seasonal menu. Honestly, I can easily see people having trouble ordering something here if there's too many obscure ingredients in all of their dishes. Never good! But neither of those two things happened during my first excursion here, so maybe my concerns are silly ones.  Now, when do I get to go back and try some more of their current menu before it vanishes? This is a must!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at Eden on a Saturday night, with my husband and a friend visiting from out of town. My friend has some dietary restrictions, so we thought this would be a good place to try. She seemed disappointed with her Spicy Kohlrabi Noodles, which were less flavorful than she'd hoped for. My husband and I started by sharing the Cheese & Pate, which was good but not great. Then he had the raw Ravioli, and seemed content but not full. I was the happiest with my entree - Truffle Mac & Cheese - though it's also probably one of the less healthy items on the menu. For dessert we all shared the Pumpkin Cheesecake and Double Chocolate Pecan Torte, both of which were delicious. Keep in mind that the restaurant is BYOB, and they charge $1 per glass. I may try Eden again, but it probably won't become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Nice to have a raw vegan friendly place in Pittsburgh.   The food tasted good but was very expensive for the amount of food you get. I ate an entire meal and dessert and left feeling like I was ready to eat another whole meal."}
{"text":"Great options for vegetarians. I take my brother here evry time he's in town! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"My recent experience at Eden was excellent.  Our server could not have been any nicer, or more helpful, and the food was outstanding, even as a non-vegan.  This is a great, somewhat-hidden gem in Shadyside.  Try the lasagna; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Eden tonight, and it was amazing! I travel every week for week, so I eat at a lot of restaurants, and this was some of the best food I have ever eaten. I recommend the pumpkin curry with chicken; I couldn't put my fork down long enough to take a picture, but trust me, it was delicious looking. I ate so much of it and was so sad I could not take the rest with me (hotel living has some drawbacks...). I will definitely visit Eden again when I am back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A great spot for brunch! I wanted to try something unique so I got the curry eggs and it was a great choice. My friend got the tofu scramble, which was also delicious. I also thought that the serving sizes were plentiful.  My only complaint would be that I wish the brunch menu included selections from the dinner menu. I  definitely want to come back during dinner hours to try their pastas and burgers.   Eden definitely knows how to make healthy food taste good and is a great option if you want to eat clean."}
{"text":"So my girlfriends and I wanted to try something different and I stumbled upon Eden. Food looked good and got great reviews. Upon arriving we were seated at a larger table for our party and the waitress asked us to move to another table after she realized another reservation needed the one we were seated at. She offered another smaller table and an appetizer or dessert on the house for the trouble of us moving...totally cool, BUT it would help if she actually came around to wait on us...  While she was very friendly it took awhile for her to come over to bring us wine glasses and take our order. That is my ONLY complaint. Other than that, I very much enjoyed my night here.  My friend got the cheesy penne and I got the mushroom noodle bowl which was fantastic! No complaints from either one of us. And at the end of our night the waitress took some $$ off for the trouble of us moving seats. All in all this place was pretty great and I would definitely come back. Maybe go raw next time!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at Eden but unfortunately I haven't had any good food here. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Everyone LOVES Eden, but I just think it's alright. If Eden was a person, I'd probably be cool hanging out with them in a group, but I wouldn't want to spend any extra time with them.  Eden has a lot of things I really enjoy, such as fresh, healthy food with vegan and vegetarian options everywhere you look. The juice they serve is delightful and always refreshing, and the service is usually pretty polite and professional.   For me, the most important thing about Eden is that I'm not always super happy with my food. It's always unique and feels somewhat healthy, but sometimes I'm left feeling disappointed. Everything has always been edible, but I don't always enjoy my entree. Sometimes I try my table mates entrees and they're good, but then I regret ordering what is sitting in front of me. I've had dinner there on multiple occasions and tried brunch last week, and every other time I go there I'm not 100% happy. Like, last week, my waffle was okay and the veggie sausage was incredibly unique and flavorful, but I regretted ordering my food when I tried my friends tofu scramble. This really sucks for me because I feel like Eden should be a go-to place for me, but it's just not. I can't guarantee I will like what I order, and I don't usually feel like I'm that wishy-washy and hard to please."}
{"text":"Really delicious, tasty, vegan food. It's the perfect spot for a date night, with its location on Walnut Street, quiet and mood-lighted ambiance, and quality of the meals. I love that their menu is seasonal as well, I've loved everything I've ever tried there. The plates are prepared beautifully, and heartily! I was hesitant to visit at first looking at the price range, but you get a HUGE plate of food for 11-15 bucks, and it's almost guaranteed you'll be taking half home with you. I'm excited to try going back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. Good for vegans, vegetarians, gluten intolerants, and carnivores alike. We had a couple juices, the ravioli-- really smartly done with thinly sliced cucumber instead of pasta-- the chili with tofu, the kale salad, and the watermelon cucumber soup. The dressing on the salad was addictive, the raviolis were light and delicious, and the chili was very hearty and super filling. The watermelon soup was a bit salty. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and helpful.   If I lived in the area I'd be here once a week but unfortunately I'm in NYC where good vegan eats are $$$$."}
{"text":"Eden offers a great selection of vegan, vegan raw, and even carnivorous options! My fiance and I have been there twice already in 2 weeks... We were so in love the first time -- the second time was just as good!   The winter menu is just that -- winter vegetables, so I was incredibly impressed by the selection. We've ordered the sampler as well as the marinated pizza and tempeh tacos. ALL OF IT was amazing.   The sampler is a great deal ($15 for a sample of the whole raw menu), but we were still hungry so we split an entree. I want to take the tempeh tacos home with me. Seriously. Not raw, but soooo good.   GO to Eden. Seriously. If you are a vegan or vegi-sometimes, It's a great experience."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good. Smoothie, raw burger, and chickpea pancakes were so so good!! Even my non-vegan bf was happy!!  A little pricey (he had to order two entrees to be full-omelette and pancake and smoothie) but yummy! Juicer was down :("}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new ownership. Went there today and the food was not good at all. Got the garlic spinach noodles the noodles were chewy, artichoke was out of a can. Just all over not good. They were playing music from the waitresses phone, we could see her texting the whole time and every time she got a text her phone would chime loudly. She couldn't even get our drinks right and there was only two of us.   Now we know why were the only people there. At least change the name, nothing like it was.  By the way restaurant right beside it is awesome, I suggest you go there instead."}
{"text":"I've been eager to try Eden since...at least last week.  The menu is incredible! However, my party of 5 waited forEVER for brunch service a couple of Sundays ago.  I love what they're doing and I'd like to go back without having to commit multiple hours to a meal.  If/when I do return, I probably won't get the Jack Fruit Crab Salad again since it wasn't anything too special. However, each of my companion's meals looked amazing, so I'll think twice before suffering a nasty case of food envy again. Next up on my list to try is the Mushroom Burger, which they had sadly run out of by noon that day.  Fingers crossed for a great experience all around next time!"}
{"text":"The change in ownership seems to have taken the restaurant in the wrong direction. Why would you take something so unique and amazing and make it so...meh? Why would you put meat on the menu at a vegan restaurant? A place where I was once able to order every single meal on the menu w my family has now just become another...place.   Missing that raw vegan margarita pizza...won't be returning."}
{"text":"Eden is a wonderful vegan and raw food restaurant that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is. The menu is small and changes seasonally, which is lovely because you get a whole new host of choices every time you come back. The staff are always friendly and knowledgeable, no snobbery here! My friends and I love to come to Eden when we're aching for something a little more high-quality, and it always delivers."}
{"text":"I was at Eden twice this week, once for Saturday brunch and again for dinner. The food is outstanding and the juices are are delicious.  I would say our dinner was even more enjoyable than the brunch, although they were both excellent. We experienced great service, and healthy delicious food at a reasonable price.   We started with a pumpkin hummus platter, which we loved. I got the pierogi and my friend got the Mac and cheese.  Portions were generous, we had no room for dessert. The dining room is fairly quiet, we enjoyed a quiet conversation.  My pick for the best vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"In general, I've really come to love the vegan scene that seems to be making its way quickly onto the Pittsburgh metro scene. So many great vegan options to choose from and although I'm not a vegan myself, I've come to appreciate the cuisine for simplicity and health conscious reasons. I've tried the pumpkin curry, brie-stuffed strawberry French toast, mushroom & almond sausage, and vanilla chia seed pudding and all of them were pretty darn delicious. All of these choices are good, although I will say that the mushroom & almond sausage tasted a bit dry and could use a bit more moisture. Though it seems that since I've went, they've changed it into a dinner only venue with private brunches/parties, which is a bit of a shame considering that their brunch menu is definitely pretty dope. I really do hope that's not a permanent change. It's also noteworthy that the place changes their menu seasonally so there's always something new to try. Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"As you probably know by now if you follow my reviews, I have quite a few food allergies.  These eliminate my enjoyment of many of the most delicious and savory breakfasts foods out there. So, I was delighted to discover Eden, which offers numerous vegan and gluten free options!! And, they are actually tasty options. My carnivore fiancé who is not allergic to anything even loves eating here with me. And, it is BYOB, so who doesn't love that.   I have been here for brunch a few times, and I always order their waffles. Served with cashew butter, maple syrup and your choice of toppings, they are simply delicious!!! They are crispy on the outside and just soft enough on the inside. It is a generous helping, so I usually share with my fiancé. The last time we were there he ordered the Indian Spiced Eggs, which included chickpeas, spinach, and goat cheese. Everything is made fresh to order. They have numerous tea options as well as French press or drip coffee. This is a great brunch location, and a good compromise for a variety of tastes. Check it out next time you are in Shady Side! We will be hitting it up for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing- literally perfect. It's in the heart of shady side, so it's in an adorable little neighborhood to begin with. The restaurant itself is very small and easy to drive past and not notice. I went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend. I am new to eating vegan items and vegetarian items as well (and Since discovering them I am now in love) and my boyfriend is a total meat eater. The ambiance of eden is very modern and artsy. There is art on the walls and most of it is for sale- which is pretty awesome. When we were seated, I noticed these awesome little business card sized cards with a bunch of conversation starters on them, like: \"have you ever been in love?\" And \"when you were ten, what did you want to be when you grew up?\" Those were such a cute idea and my boyfriend and I had fun answering the questions with each other. The brunch menu wasn't very long, but it had plenty of options. I first ordered the emperor which is a home made smoothie. It was a green smoothie and tasted like bananas- it was awesome. I ordered potato and kale tacos... Soo amazing. The order came with three tacos- fresh tortillas, potatoes with taco seasoning, sautéed kale, cashew cheese, sundried tomato sauce and picked red onions. They fell apart but they were incredible. Writing about them is making my mouth water. I also had a house salad on the side- nothing crazy but delicious none the less. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito and a house salad. He really enjoyed the burrito and I had a bite and really loved it too. I can't wait to come back here for dinner sometime! It's byob !"}
{"text":"AWESOME GF Vegetarian/Vegan food tucked away in the Walnut shopping block in Shadyside. Friendly staff, generous portions, casual atmosphere. Fantastic brunch! A must try for all."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the quality of the food, the menu and service. Used to be my favorite spot in Pitt and it was always packed. Now it is empty."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious. Creative. Kind. Beyond Satisfying. Cool. I will come back every time I am in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've been to Eden a few times, each one has been a little different. The first dinner was a couple of years ago, everything was delicious. Even my non vegetarian parents loved their dishes. I think we had the Mac and cheese and some Asian noodles. I returned with my boyfriend about a year ago, he had the Mac and cheese and I think I had the pumpkin curry. I have yet to try the desserts but they all sound great!  A few friends and I went for brunch one weekend and that was amazing, everyone loved their dishes.   The most recent visit for dinner was a bit of a let down however. The raw lasagna was really tasty, as was the cheese board, but the rest of us got rice and veg bowls and to be honest they were pretty tasteless. The Thai peanut sauce was delicious, but we were expecting it to be more of a stirfry dish than a salad. It seems that they have taken most of the cooked dishes off of the menu, so most things are raw (not cooked or only slightly cooked).  Despite the most recent let down I still like this place, I hope to return for brunch soon!   It's always really hot inside, almost humid, if you can sit outside I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Despite its reputation, Eden's is an unassuming presence.  Its facade is recessed and the sign bearing its name hangs meekly in the window.  Once inside, the interior is warmly if a bit dimly lit and bears a selection of local artwork on the walls with a larger three-part piece of some Gaia-esque figure near the entrance.  It exudes the sort of subdued cool typical of a trendy eatery of some notoriety, which is why the comfortable intimacy of its quietude on a Sunday afternoon was a little surprising.  Compared to Girasole next door, Eden was pretty much dead.  But upon entering, our party of three was greeted instantly by a warm server/hostess/everything else FOH.  We were dropped off near the back with three tumbler-esque glasses and a swingtop bottle of water to peruse their Spring dinner menu in peace.  We opted for three entrees: the raw manicotti, the cooked jackfruit mole, and the zongzi.  All three arrived pretty promptly, and the server-host-thing gets full marks for being pleasant and slightly sardonic, lacking the oft-putting listlessness I've come to expect but empathize with.  The breakdown of the meal is as follows:  Zongzi: The zongzi, in traditional fashion, is wrapped in a bamboo leaf though it was cooked with nontraditional red rice and a medley of vegetables.  It was also served with a side of garlic peanut sauce, cucumbers, and avocado.  The rice was spiced well, with a flavor reminiscent of some Indian cuisine.  Perhaps prominent notes of tumeric.  The peanut was nutty and tasty, a little tangy as well.  The avocado eaten with the rice was a spark of inspiration, the richness filling out the spices perfectly.  The combination of the two made for a wonderfully balanced bite.  However, I found the yummy peanut sauce to be overpowering when taken in the context of the other components of the dish, and the cucumbers added little.  Overall though, this was a tasty dish with pretty well balanced flavors and a respectable portion size.  Manicotti: This was a busy bite of food.  A lot of flavors, a lot of textures, a lot going on overall.  The manicotti was a little sweet from the ricotta, a little tart from the marinara, a little mushy from the raw coconut noodles, a little crunchy from the cashew parmesan, and a whole lot of salty, probably from the parmesan and the liberal application of Himalayan sea salt.  The predominant flavor in all of this was the basil of all things, which asserted itself above the cacophony.  Overall, I thought this dish was unremarkable.  A little too salty, a little too much going on.  There were some very nice contrasting textures and flavors but overall it could have benefited from less salt and a little more done to balance out the basil.  Jackfruit Mole: First off, let me just say this: holy crap that coconut sour cream.  Holy mother of crappity damn that is tasty.  I'd drink a gallon of that coconut sour cream.  I'd swim in a vat of it and drown happily.  That sour cream is probably the best thing I've tasted in a while.  The mole itself was sweet and aromatic, with very prominent notes of cumin.  The cocoa flavor itself was a little lost, but overall it was still very deep and complex.  Very tasty.  The onions provided a nice textural contrast as they were still a little crunchy.  I thought the chunks of tomato were actually a bit much, overpowering the bites in which they were present but overall not too egregious.  The salsa verde also was tart and bright.  I had two complaints about this dish though, one minor and one major.  The minor one is that the slices of avocado added little to the dish as a whole.  The major complaint however was a noticeable lack of jackfruit flavor.  Perhaps the jackfruit lended some sweetness to the mole, but its distinctive aroma was absent.  All in all, Eden was a restaurant that did well in living up to the hype.  The dishes were, on the whole, well-considered and well-constructed with bright and complex combinations of flavors.  My main complaint holistically would be a little too much salt in everything (which might just be a matter of personal preference) and some minor tweaks in the balancing of the more prominent flavors.  However, I do regret not having saved room for their sumptuous sounding deserts and will make sure to sample them the next time I go back.  TL;DR 4/5"}
{"text":"So I'll preface this by saying that I am not a vegan, or a vegetarian, or gluten free.  I eat pretty much anything...except maybe the stuff that this place serves.   Having been pleasantly surprised by a really awesome 100% vegan restaurant in Raleigh, I was excited to try this place and have a little something healthy and different.  Ordering was sort of a dart throwing process, since most everything looked good/interesting on paper and I really couldn't picture any of the dishes.  The end result though, was more of a dry, bland, oddly-textured mess.  The parsnip fritters and sauce and part of the banana split were good, but the rest really didn't do anything for me at all.  Perhaps we didn't order right, but as I said, it was sort of a guessing game since I really couldn't picture many of the dishes.     All in all, perhaps I'd feel differently if I actually had dietary restrictions (self-imposed or otherwise); but as it is, this place just didn't do it for me at all.  And I'd venture a guess that the vast majority of my friends would agree - just not a really wide appeal if you don't have that very specific diet as a preference.       The other thing was that the service was terrible.   The server seemed really offended that we only ate 1/4 of one of the dishes and offered no remedy (not that we would have taken it).  The carafe of water was empty about halfway through.  It took him a while to notice and then he picked it up and never brought it back.  So we had no beverage at all for half of our very dry, bland meal."}
{"text":"If I'm on my best-of-the-best, healthiest behavior, I generally find navigating a restaurant menu to be a chore. Usually lamenting my choice to even 'go out' for a meal instead of preparing a healthier option myself.   The amazing thing about Eden is that it entirely eliminates that first scenario.   I'm not suggesting that everything on the menu is going to conform to each and every person's ideal of a healthy meal, but I would venture to guess that most people would find the majority of Eden's offerings to fit well in their individual ranges.  The second great thing about Eden is that once you've gotten over your giddiness at your new freedom of choice, the options available are tasty and creative.   I've been here for brunch and dinner on multiple occasions and I've yet to find a dish with which I wasn't pleased. I tend to shy away from 'faked' items like cheese and sauces, but someone here must spend a lot of time perfecting these because I'm consistently wowed by either the accuracy or the superiority said ingredients. It could also be that I love cashews [a common ingredient in the faked cheeses].   Nevertheless, should you be of sound mind and similar conscience toward living a 'mostly' healthy, plant-based lifestyle, you'll find a tons to love and few complaints about Eden.   Sadly, you can't really make a chocolate torte 'good for you,' but their desserts are damned delicious too. Sorry. Maybe opt for a juice or smoothie!"}
{"text":"Yes, you can BYOB, but it's an extra $2 charge. The service and atmosphere were nice, and the 3 star rating is for the food. Unfortunately, what you select can be hit or miss. I wouldn't put this place in the top five vegan places I've been to. Came here with a group of five. I ordered the Brussels sprouts salad, the pumpkin curry, and the ice cream sandwich. I had people sample my dishes. They all liked the Brussels sprouts salad and the pumpkin curry.   My other friends ordered the truffle Mac n cheese (hit), the ravioli (I didn't taste it but two others did and they weren't crazy about it), and the falafel--big miss here. My friend had to send this away, that's how much she didn't like it. I sampled it. This was not your usual falafel from all the usual Mediterranean places, and it was just so unfamiliar, and for some reason it didn't taste good.   And now for my ice cream sandwich. The cookies were \"raw\" and they weren't sweet enough (maybe some coconut would've helped??) and the ice cream part was mostly ice and didn't have that creamy butternut squash taste I was expecting. All in all, this place was a disappointment and we wouldn't be returning because how can we know which dishes would be good and others unpleasant?? I've been to so many vegan places that there's no reason that everything on the menu can't be good."}
{"text":"Great service, really good food, and they have chicken for those who aren't vegans/vegetarians. Try the raw platter, 3 courses of food for only $10! Will come again."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to try this place! The vegan lifestyle has its allure, but I haven't been able to give up cheese yet. Eden really has me considering it, though.  My major concern was that I would still be hungry afterwards, so I asked the waitress how big the mushroom flatbread is. The size estimate she gave me was decent, so I ordered only that. When it came, it was significantly smaller than she'd indicated....  Luckily, it's very dense, and I was actually super full at the end. The pesto is excellent and I really enjoyed the mushrooms. Not sure I love the texture of the crust, but the taste was there. $16 is a little pricey but at least I was full!  Regarding the rest of their menu, there are some things that intrigue me, but a lot of it (the bowls in particular) seems like stuff I make at home anyway.  Just a note: they can only split checks 4 ways. Not sure what the deal is with that. I feel like splitting checks should be a solved problem by now, but oh well."}
{"text":"Feel bad giving this review. Server was very nice but not trained well - we were rushed out (waterglasses taken away before finished eating, coffee taken away without completion the pot we ordered)... She was very sweet but I think training did not happen. Also, give a girl a tray for cups etc. now onto the food. Big fail here. We ordered a smoothie that came in a very small glass, I thought it was sample but we were charged $6 for it. Add to that, our \"green smoothie\" actually came out warm! They did not use ice in it and I think everything was warm... Probably the worst smoothie I have had... Wondering if they don't sample the food before putting it on the menu. Also zero quality control. Waffle was good and omelet but these are hard to mess up. The serving sizes were comical... If trying to do portion control for health reasons then include that on the menu and as a selling point. Most people left hungry/ unsatisfied. Lastly, the ingredients were not clear. As a place trying to balance vegan options with other options there needs to be more transparency in every item. From the flour in the bread to the type of ham (was it lunch meat?/ cured in anyway? Hormone injected, Etc) more details need to be given. Can't trust the food at Eden anymore, less of a garden and more of a bob evans... But significantly more expensive. Save your time, pick somewhere else"}
{"text":"Went to Eden to celebrate an occasion based on the great reviews on yelp. Unfortunately, the service and food were not stellar. The server looked really disinterested and the food was unflavorful and over-salted. We could only have few mouthfuls of our entrees. Really disappointed!!"}
{"text":"***Update, Eden no longer offers lunch, which I think is for the best, given the previous mediocre options - though had they offered choices akin to their dinner menu, I'd vote hellz yes to raw lunch.   This past week, I tried the spring raw tasting menu. The portions seemed smaller this time and I preferred the fall flavors in general, but I am still a total fan and I think that $15 is a fair price. The raw \"mac and cheese\" was pretty impressive, as was the vanilla ice cream cake. We also tried a hot dish this time, the tempeh mole. I did not care for it because it did not have ANY vegetables, just tempeh and sauce with rice. But my partner really liked it.   I will be interested to taste how Eden treats the bounty of summer."}
{"text":"Wow!! If your taste buds are ready you have to try the winter 3 course Sampler. I travel a lot throughout Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania and it is very hard to find good raw vegan restaurants. I am so glad that I found Eden on this trip to Pittsburgh. The food was so good I had to eat there twice on the same business trip. The staff is very friendly and the food came out quite fast. I asked them to make my favorite smoothie and the chef was glad to oblige. I call it the Monkey Shine - Spinach, Banana and Lemon. You gotta try it especially if you are in need of a jolt of energy."}
{"text":"I went there with my fiance and some out-of-town friends (all are vegans/vegetarians to varying degrees) and everyone thought there was just something lacking about the food. One of us ordered the sampler - the portions were so tiny that it was a very unsatisfying  meal for the price. Two people ordered the BBQ Tempeh and both were disappointed with the flavor - the sauce tasted more like tomato paste than any bbq I'd ever had. Another person ordered the Seed Crusted Oyster mushrooms which ended up being the most flavorful dish although the mushrooms themselves were tough and chewy.  I love the idea of raw food so I'll give this place another chance. Let's hope they work out some of the kinks in the menu by then!"}
{"text":"Love it! Cute little space with optional outdoor seating. The mushroom chorizo tacos on the Summer 2015 brunch menu are awesome! Coffee's good, too."}
{"text":"Just went here last night with friends. We started with appetizers. We ordered and split all four appetizers for Summer 2015 - watermelon tartare, bruschetta, cashew brie cheese, and the spicy cucumber rolls. Of the four, the watermelon tartare and the spicy cucumber rolls were the best. The bruschetta and cashew brie cheese came with a flax and vegetable toast that was a little thick for my liking and a little too chewy. However, it was still altogether delicious.  Afterwards, we ordered a variety of entrees, but the Basil Noodles were my favorite. I hope that Eden keeps them on the Fall/Winter 2015 menu. Actually, I hope Eden keeps them forever! They were nothing more than delicious mung bean noodles tossed with crimini and oyster mushrooms, spinach, kale, and watercress in a basil-infused coconut broth. It reminded me of a curry, except the broth was thinner and lighter. I asked for some hot pepper flakes (I'm super into spicy food) and I was delighted. It was like Light Thai Food.  We also ordered desserts, though I am on a restrictive diet. I asked for a fruit cup (not on the menu) and was charged only $4.50 for a delightful dish of peaches, concord grapes, berries, and figs. It was amazing.  Overall, a really healthy, filling meal. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I am NOT a vegan or a vegetarian, but trying a new place in the burgh is always exciting.  My bf (vegetarian) and I shared the sampler tasting which consisted of all the raw vegan dishes on the menu and Eden mole with tempeh.  the raw dishes were delicious (beet ravioli with almond cheese topped with a basil pesto and raspberry lemon \"cheesecake\" were our favorite), but if you plan to order the sampler for dinner, prepare to order more dishes since the overall size is quite dainty.  it's definitely fresh and creative.   The Eden Mole on the other hand was eh.  it was ordinary and tasted more like an OK Indian dish spiced with too much garam masala.  It's an interesting concept and maybe just not my cup of tea.  Their raw foods are definitely their strong part of the menu and I would say it's definitely worth it to try it at least once.  BYOB with $2 cork fee/person."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Some of the best raw/vegan food I've had anywhere, and I've been to most of the big name restaurants in NYC, SF and Chicago. I had the 15 course raw tasting, the tacos and the stew. All were phenomenal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I recently came here for brunch on Sunday.  Not really many other options in the immediate Walnut Street vicinity, so this seemed like a good one.  I ordered the Fried Egg Sandwich, which comes with cream cheese, a fried egg that came with the yolk a bit runny, some lettuce and tomato.  The tomato was very tasty and fresh.  The lettuce was ... well lettuce.  The egg... was well an egg and the cream cheese was kind of just.... well there.    It was OK, mind you, but just nothing special.  I totally could have made this at home, and probably made it taste a lot better.  The flavor was pretty much non-existent, it definitely could have used some salt.   Nonetheless, I ate most of it b/c I was starving.  I definitely plan on coming back here though, b/c I feel this place has a lot of potential and I haven't tried their raw menu."}
{"text":"Although I am neither a vegan nor a raw foodist, I do enjoy expanding my culinary horizon. For this reason, I dined at Eden Bistro several months ago when I visited Pittsburgh and I remember my experience quite fondly.   Among the dishes I have tried, the Nut Cheese Sampler was really memorable. It was served with three different nut \"cheeses,\" ranging from Cashew Brie, Smoked Pecan Asiago, and Walnut Cheddar, and raw/dehydrated crackers and crudités. Although I admit that it doesn't sound all that appetizing, I really loved it. It was a great way to start the meal.  The Avocado Maki Rolls are also worth mentioning. When I read the description of the dish, I viewed the dish with skepticism. Avocado roll served with coconut, cashew, and cauliflower rice? It's as if all the health/hipster food trends combined forces. I couldn't imagine how these flavor profiles would pair. However, I'm really glad I took a chance; the rolls were absolutely delicious. The dipping sauce that accompanied the rolls was excellent.  The service was attentive and friendly. I really appreciated how our waitress took the time to explain each dish, as I would have been completely clueless otherwise. As some reviews mentioned, the restaurant is below ground-level, so it is a bit difficult to locate. But do not let that deter you. If you are looking to try something unique and different, I would recommend giving Eden Bistro a try."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday night for dinner with my girlfriend and three other dining companions.  Before heading here I had looked at the menu online and was excited to see that it was BYOB (no corkage fee) and also loved that there was a dinner entree that was a small sized tasting of everything on the raw menu.  Whenever we queried the server about the raw menu tasting, she explained that it would not be enough food as a dinner for any of us but would make a good appetizer for a few people.  With that in mind we decided to order two portions of it to share with the table.  In the mean time I also ordered the Pickled Vegetable Tacos with tempeh while my girlfriend ordered the lentil cake lettuce wraps.  The tasting started off with the appetizers which consisted of a shot of cucumber and watermelon soup, coconut crusted fried onions and something else that eludes me at the moment.  I found the soup to be refreshing while everyone else at my table disliked it.  The onions I think that I would have enjoyed but the pieces were so small that I was barely able to pick up on any flavor.  Next out was the entree portion of the sampler which contained a zucchini ravioli, nacho bowl and stuffed tomatoes.  These all had some interesting flavors to them and while I did not really think that they were good, they were not bad either.  Since we had all ordered entrees, the waitress thoughtfully brought those out next saving the dessert portion of the tasting for the end of the meal.  My entree looked good whenever it came out and ended up being satisfactory.  I think that it lacked some flavor but at that point was the best thing that I had tasted.  My girlfriends lettuce wraps were also decent but not great.  Finally after we had all finished off our entrees the dessert portion came.  It had on it a chocolate avocado and banana mousse, lemon and raspberry tart and coconut zucchini spice cake.  This was easily the best part of the meal as all of the desserts were good in there own ways.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably not head back here again.  With that being said I am glad that I tried it and enjoyed a few of the items that I tried, however, it just isn't the place for me."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I discovered this gem on a visit to Pittsburgh in July.  We ate here twice then and once more on a visit over labor day weekend.  The food is delicious.  We love the green burger and kale chips and the chocolate cheesecake was rich but not overpowering. Healthy and delicious - doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Eden, and it was everything I expected, and then some!  We had a reservation for Friday night at 7, and we had a small table near the kitchen.  I don't remember what the corkage fee was, but there was a corkage fee.  The service started off great and lasted through the entire meal.  We started with the beet carpaccio (tasty sauce, strange texture, still delicious), and shiitake ceviche, which was amazing with the vegetable chips. The ceviche was a bit on the small side, so I'm glad we ordered 2 appetizers.  For our main dishes, the fiancee had the spicy cauliflower with tofu and I had the peanut lentil curry with tofu.  My only reason for taking off 1 star is because I specifically asked how spicy and peanut curry was, and my waitress assured me it was not spicy at all.  I know I can't handle that much spice, but wow, it was a bit too spicy for my taste!  On the other hand, my fiancee thought the spicy cauliflower could have tripled in spice.    We ended with the cardamom and strawberry cake, which worked out well because i loved the strawberries while the fiancee inhaled the brazil nut cream.    I loved the atmosphere and the service was great.  Not overly attentive, but fast on the water refills and service."}
{"text":"As I pulled up to another vegetarian place ( Randitas) it was closed and now I'm so glad because it brought me to this place.  I love this part of town with all the shops.  Eden blew my mind and jump started my senses in every way as it was breakfast time on Mother's Day I was not surprised by the 30 min wait.  I had the apple stuffed chick pea pancakes and it opened my eyes that I could eat pancakes again as I'm grain free.    This place changed my life forever! Thank you for being a delicious, organic,clean eating hub!  The green juice I had was fresh and amazing  love this place.   Make sure you check times of operation and make reservations"}
{"text":"There aren't too many places in town for gluten-free-me and vegan-former-roomie to grab brunch together. We always feel well cared-for at Eden and leave full and happy.   The egg dishes are all tasty, the side salad they come with is fresh and nicely dressed, and I like being able to have a piece of gluten-free toast on the side. The vegan, gluten-free waffles loaded up with everything and anything are delicious as well, especially if you get a fried egg on the side and stick it on top.  Juices and smoothies are very generously portioned, and I'm partial to the Blue Moon. Vegan-former-roomie is more of a Green Juice girl, which is way too healthy for me but she seems to like it.   Coffee is hot and good, service is always friendly, and there's very rarely a wait for a table. Extra special bonus points for being very conscientious about cross-contamination, neither of us has ever had a problem after eating here."}
{"text":"Not bad. Chocolate cake. I have been told that it is vegan...probably, but too sugary and too sweet.  Tastes like Ferrero Roche. Not bad, but not fantastic. Poor serving. Could be better.  Wish they could have newer utensils as it is claimed that the place is pretty new but dessert forks look old and used."}
{"text":"As a newly minted most-of-the-time pescatarian, when a couple of my friends suggested heading to this new restaurant, I was pretty excited. Sufficed to say, based on the 2 star review, that's about where the excitement ended. First, to my friends, don't feel bad, I love trying new places and will always be happy to do so...irrespective of the outcome.  So why the low rating. Well, the atmosphere was interesting...in that it smelled like industrial cleaning products. The waitstaff consisted of one male waiter who was actually great. No complaints there at all. But the clincher was the food. For a starter my wife and I shared the walnut pate which was great, but nothing more than the walnut raisin cream cheese you can find at a bagel shop...minus the raisins. For entrees, we got the pumpkin curry and the pad thai, both of which were pretty bland (the curry was a bit spicy, but nothing else). They left a very blah taste in our mouths. Finally, for dessert, we had the pumpkin pie, which looked and tasted like stale baklava, and the pear \"ice cream\" (it's in quotes because it's not real ice cream, just sorbet that was food processed), which didn't taste like much at all.  In all, I think the chef went a bit too far with the raw + vegan idea. It's nice to have this type of restaurant in town, but the current menu is not going to leave a lot of smiles on their customers."}
{"text":"I found this place just stumbling the web in search of a wholesome and different dinner.  I went with my girlfriend on a Friday evening at 6:15 to find the place not very busy.  The server sat us immediately and was very good about taking our order and being attentive at the table.  Each table has conversation starters which was very fun.  The place has a very nice atmosphere and makes it great place for a date. So many things to talk about.  This is the first time I tried a vegan, raw restaurant and I absolutely loved it.  We started off by splitting lettuce wraps with an coconut almond paste that was very tasty.  For our entrees, my girlfriend had the raw squash noodles with beet and walnut \"meat\" balls and I had the Cajun stew (I added chicken to mine and it was worth it).  Both of these dinners were incredibly flavorful and a pleasure to eat.  Well seasoned and creative dishes  This place filled up by 7:00 and now I know why.  I will definitely be returning since the menu changes by seasons!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical about raw food - only hippies eat that weird stuff. Then Eden convinced me otherwise.   The food was genuinely good with creative spins on how to incorporate different ingredients.  I had the veggie burger which was presented on some square cardboard looking \"bread\".  I was amazed by how interesting it tasted.  I've never had anything like it and would definitely go again to try out their other things. Surprisingly, the food had a lot of flavor for something that looked so...raw.   The place was a bit expensive but I believe that it was worth the price. The food was healthy as well as filling (surprisingly)"}
{"text":"Not many vegetarian options in Pittsburgh so this place has been an absolute delight! Dishes are really neat and creative, too. They change the menu seasonally so it's fun to come back every few months. Portions can be quite good depending on what you order. Appetizers are a little small for the price. Would give the food tastiness an A-/A; value (for food) B+; ambiance A (inside they have little conversation starter cards on the tables!), staff A-."}
{"text":"This was the strangest dining experience. It was open for brunch but empty, which should've been a sign. The service was also weird...seemed very disorganized and scattered and very very slow, despite all the empty tables.  And the food?!?!? Zero flavor, our \"side salad\" was literally a pinch l of plain greens, no dressing. The cashew cheese chickpea wraps were just a spoonful of chickpeas with flavorless spread and the cheapest tortillas money can buy.  We had to ask repeatedly for refills and our check. The whole staff seemed completely untrained and incapable of cooking or serving. Will not return."}
{"text":"I'm torn. 5 stars for the food and innovative menu. 5 stars for the charming front patio seating (I wanted to roll up the blue and white straw rug and take it home with me). Menu recommendations: Pad Thai zucchini noodles (very filling and flavor-packed) and Mushroom dumplings (said the girl who doesn't even like mushrooms) - think of it as a coconut curry style soup with zucchini, carrots, etc.   3 stars for the sloppy execution of service - chasing down our check, the waitress never checked on us and it appeared that they were easily overwhelmed with a waitlist on a Friday night. To be clear, the staff was very nice. Once we were seated they seemed to disappear.  Two stars for the green Emperor smoothie - I make better smoothies at home. It tasted watered down and like several \"somethings\" were missing. Especially for the price point.  If service were much better next time I would easily give this place a four or five."}
{"text":"Quirky place for brunch. Arrived at noon on a Sunday; the place was decently full but did not have a wait. The menu was well-rounded but not overwhelming, and didn't feel as though it was \"missing\" anything despite being vegetarian. I ordered the waffles with everything except peanut butter (had almond butter instead), which are now tied for my favorite breakfast waffles in Pittsburgh (with the eggs benny from waffles Inc). The fruit was fresh, the waffles weren't too sweet, and the pumpkin seeds added nice crunch. I thought their vegan butter would just be coconut oil or cream, but it was so much better- had a more toasted, nutty taste. A good meal size if you're really hungry, or meal-plus-afternoon-snack size in my case. My friend ordered the burger and was equally pleased- I wouldn't say it's a substitute if you actually want meat (maybe try the eggs in that case), but it was a fresh take on the usual veggie burger. Waitress was friendly but didn't hover. There were little conversation starter cards at the table, which was a nice touch. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Delicious & refreshing sunday brunch. The juices & smoothies were fresh. I got the red fox juice & my friend got the blue moon smoothie. Her smoothie was giant & both were delicious. We got the avocado toast with an egg and the scrambled egg tartine. Again both amazing & fresh. Great spot, super duper cute patio. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, beautiful, incredibly creative raw vegan food. I can't say enough about this gem of Shadyside. I've been to many a vegan restaurant that does terrible, greasy vegan food the way a diner does omnivorous food. Eden offers \"General Tso's Chicken\" and \"Mac n'Cheese\" and still manages to not be anything like that at all.  Split the raw tasting platter with your dining partner ($15 for all 9 dishes - they're all worth it), and a hot entree if you're feeling less adventurous (we did the tempeh & kale -- magnificent).  The raw cheesecake is a standout, as are the mac n'cheese and last night's soup of the day (fresh gazpacho with melon and mint)."}
{"text":"A nice idea but brunch was at best, meh. The omelets are $10 and miniscule. I got the \"roasted vegetables\" as a side, potatoes. They were tasteless and slightly undercooked. The vegetable and goat cheese omelet was super super bland.    My fiancé had waffles, again $10 and they were tiny and tasteless. They were served in a very well plated way with a shot glass of syrup and a pat of frozen butter on a tiny plate. It was all very pretty but the butter was useless as it was too cold to ever melt on the waffles. And for $10 they could have put more than the few bites on the plate.   The breakfast burrito our friend had went virtually uneaten. Our other friend had the mushroom burger, $15, which was a raw concoction. She seemed to really like it but it too was bland, it had a lot of different textures but no flavor.   You can go to Point/Park Brugge and for the same amount get a fresh waffle or gigantic omelet that is enough to share. I know it can be tough to be gluten free or dairy free but that doesn't mean being hosed at this below average bistro.   The décor and location are great. They just need to get a decent chef in the kitchen and maybe give a little bit more value for the cost. If they have to charge a buck or so more to give portions that won't leave someone hungry then so be it."}
{"text":"Brunch at Eden is a real treat.  I went on a Saturday and must say I was impressed.  They have these drinks with stivia sweetener.  Get all of them.  I had an Omelet and it was  well made.  I can see what people see in this place.  The food sounds more comlex then it is and really what you get is just tastey non pretentious vegetarian meal.   Prices and service were both good.  Not the best ever but more then fine.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Must try whether vegan or not. Good was excellent and I generally just felt healthy being there. I would recommend the health nut salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place gets lots of stars just for being what it is... the rarest of the rare (literally).  A raw restaurant is such an amazing thing to find, and in Pittsburgh no less!    Though Eden isn't 100% raw, a good portion of the menu is.  And, it is all vegan.  I actually ordered from the \"hot\" portion of the menu.  I don't eat raw as a rule, and I'm not insane.  Unfortunately, my Mom was insane and, never having before tried raw, she ordered the \"pierogi\" special.  Even my friend who goes back and forth between raw and strict vegan ordered from the \"hot\" menu.  Oops.  Well luckily, my Mom isn't reviewing Eden.  Raw food is for people who eat raw.  And, considering how small the raw foodie population is, the \"hot\" menu is great for everyone else!  My two friends and I ordered the \"Creamy Green Bean Noodles\".  MMMmmmmm!  So good!  The noodles tasted just like rice vermicelli to me (but they aren't and they're healthier - score!).  The broth was SO GOOD!  We followed up with a dessert - the strawberry shortcake.  It was super tasty.  Eden would get 5 stars, but they were out of a good portion of the menu (3 regular items and 2 of the 4 desserts), and my party felt really rushed at the end.  For the price we paid for veggies, and I know they are gourmet veggies but it is still pricey, I would have loved to not watch the kitchen clean up and cooks leave out the front as we were trying to enjoy our desserts."}
{"text":"Oh how I love thee, Eden!  I am a huge fan of raw and vegetarian places but unfortunately they are few and far between in Pittsburgh. I adore the surprising twists they place on transforming food.   I have been here for both brunch and dinner multiple times. Not once have I been disappointed. On my latest visit we ordered the raw perigies and oyster scallop salad. Both were great but the oyster mushroom 'scallops' was by far my favorite. Even though we were both quite full, we managed to follow it up with the raw carrot cake - simply delicious. Unexpectedly flavorful and so so creamy. If you do find yourself here for brunch, I highly recommend the Coconut, Oat and Almond Raw Cakes. They are just ridiculously good! I get cravings. Enough said.  Overall, prices are great, it's BYOB, atmosphere is fairly intimate in the evening and service is generally pretty good. Definitely worth a visits if you are up for something refreshing and different."}
{"text":"Quite the brunch surprise for this omnivore! I was a little disappointed that when I called at opening they wouldn't let me make a same-day reservation, but I was assured that there were not many reservations for that time and we should be able to secure a table as a walk-in party (we did).  The restaurant is pretty small, and probably not well-suited to groups, but this gives the servers ample opportunity to connect with their tables. I ordered the vegan chorizo tacos, and my companion had the tempeh bacon and Indian-spiced eggs.  The tempeh bacon was tasty, with a nice smoke factor, but not really reminiscent of bacon--more like smoky french toast sticks. The vegan chorizo tacos were really tasty. The chorizo was closer to falafel, but the tacos were layered with a variety of textures that made them really interesting to eat. I tried a bite of the Indian-spiced eggs and they were good as well.  I can't speak to the other menu items, but I was impressed with the quality of the food as well as the service. I'd happily come back for brunch--it's a nice alternative to the sweet- and grease-laden brunches elsewhere in the city!"}
{"text":"While I loved in Pittsburgh this was one of my favorite brunch places. The menu is small but there is something for everyone.  The seating is a bit limited and can get cramped.  Food is fresh but a bit on the pricey side. A definite stop for those looking for some relatively healthy brunch options."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian meal. Had pineapple curry and green burger. Very fresh and flavorful. Portions were perfect. Service was great, with good suggestions. Atmosphere was casual and comfortable. We will come back."}
{"text":"They defs made the veggies as good as veggies possibly can be! Waitress was really nice and it had a cute interior."}
{"text":"Every dish that my husband and I tried was EXCELLENT.  We ordered from the raw menu, which I was skeptical of, but it was delish- I ordered the \"ravioli\" zucchini w/ cashew cheese and the coconut-onions.  My husband ordered the \"chili.\" We will definitely return shortly."}
{"text":"Went here the first day it opened. We actually were their first table! Woo! I actually was going to do the first review for Eden on yelp... but somehow hit the \"back\" button and lost everything. :(   Our server was super sweet and charming, and the food was healthy, fresh, and delicious. Our smoothies and the food took awhile to come out, but we were very happy with our dishes by the time they arrived. It was the first day, so I figured they were probably figuring out the kinks.   My husband got the black-bean burger with a side salad with a fantastic, creamy raspberry vinaigrette that was made in-house. It had just the right amount of seasoning and the garlic mayo added a nice savory bite to it. I had a simple garden salad that came with tomato, avocado, cucumbers, broccoli, and feta cheese. The balsamic vinaigrette was delightfully creamy and made in-house as well. The salad wasn't quite impressive, since it could easily be made at home... but I still loved it, and it was only like $5 or $6.   I don't think either of us were blown away by our dishes, but we left feeling very satisfied with our food.   Can't wait to try out the dinner menu! Too bad I don't make it out to Shadyside very often..."}
{"text":"It is by far my favorite place! I normally go for Saturday breakfast, but I recently discovered their dinner menu is also lovely! Great taste and healthy."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience with the dark curly haired waitress. When I arrived, there was no greeter or server in sight and no sign at the door that asked to wait to be seated. With plenty of open tables, I decided to seat myself towards the back of the restaurant. I didn't think this would be a big deal but soon discovered it was a problem. The waitress came out of the kitchen - no hello or anything to me - and TOLD me that I needed to get up and wait by the door. It was embarrassing and rude. I understand she may have been feeling overwhelmed or not having a good evening but, as the waitress and essentially the face of the restaurant to newcomers, please try to be pleasant. I would have appreciated at the very least a smile. I left the restaurant at that point as I did not feel welcomed. Needless to say, I do not anticipate trying again."}
{"text":"Allright!  Raw vegan food in Pittsburgh!  I'm a Pittsburgh native who's lived on the West Coast for the past decade.  So it's a pretty wonderful discovery to find raw food here in my hometown!  This place uses plant-based, local, organic ingredients and sources it from local small farms according to the waitress.  They also have cooked vegetarian and meat options available as well, for parties that aren't so daring to try something new like raw food.  I had a really wonderful cashew cream curry, nicely spiced with nutmeg, slightly spicy.  This was all topped with awesome pickled shallots.  It left a really great, vibrant taste in my mouth after I was done.  The \"rice\" was made with beets, ginger, and maybe coconut?    They had a local apple cider on special when I was there.  After moving to the west I really missed apple cider, so this was a great surprise.  I finished up with a fig, cacao, chia seed pudding, which was really tasty, but took me a looooonnng time to chew.  The serving sizes were a bit misproportioned in my opinion.  The entree serving was a bit small.  I would have liked a bit more \"rice\" to eat with the rest of my curry sauce.  The rice went super fast and I was left with lots of extra sauce to eat by itself, which I gladly did.  The desert on the other hand was huge coming with 3 separate pieces of pudding, almost as large as the entree itself.  I love that they change the food here seasonally.  When I came they were about to unveil their autumn menu along with samples and an art show for $10.  If you go, be sure to look down the stairs at the address.  It's a bit hidden.  I saw a couple of other restaurants around and almost missed it tucked away down there."}
{"text":"Great customer service, fantastically eclectic food selection. Very unique menu selection and all really well prepared."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, WOW. I've been to a lot of the big name raw vegan food restaurants in NYC, and I think this place is my favorite (ok, it's technically not all raw vegan but good enough). After a day of eating sugar on a road trip, I was craving something more healthful so I came here for dinner with my mom. We split the watermelon tartare appetizer as a result of a recommendation from our waitress. WOW! The watermelon tartare was creamy and seasoned perfectly. I could eat bowlfuls of it with a spoon, and I hope I can recreate it at home. The tartare came with raw crackers and endive boats, a perfect accompaniment. For my entree, I ordered a raw vegan dosa, and my mom got the cooked dish basil coconut noodles with organic chicken (ok my nit picky complaint about this place is that they randomly serve chicken). OMG my dosa was such a creative raw vegan dish! I loved all the flavor and the textures. It was served with two dipping sauces and pickled onions. My mom really liked her dish, but it was too large for her to finish and served so hot she had to wait forever for it to cool down. My only complaint is that I wish they had a larger non alcoholic beverage selection - maybe they do, I should've asked. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Eden has been on my list to try for quite a while! I was finally able to check it out recently with a friend. If it's your first time, it's an easy restaurant to miss on Copeland because it's below ground level, so be sure to look out for it.   I chose to have the coconut and chickpea burger (which included avocado) because it was such an interesting combination and really caught my eye. (Also, anything with chickpeas is delicious.) The burger is topped with lettuce and tomato. You also get a side of either salad or pineapple; they had watermelon that day and that's what I got. The burger didn't seem too exciting from the way it was presented, but it was actually delicious! You'd never think that coconut would taste so good with chickpeas and avocado. It was such a pleasant surprise and I would definitely recommend it. Portion is definitely on the smaller side, at least for the burger, but it was enough for me that day.  My friend got the Eden's waffle and enjoyed it. You can get any or all of the awesome toppings listed, including chocolate chips, fruit, almond butter, etc.  Great experience with vegan food!  Taste | 4.5 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4.5"}
{"text":"This place was great! Really cozy and a nice attentive server. The food was delicious, well seasoned and fresh but it would have been nice if it was actually warm. I'm new to the raw/vegan style but ice cold veggies on a winter night wasn't my fav.   I got one of the juices that was really yummy and just he right mix of ingredients.  A great spot for those trying to eat clean!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I don't care if my food is cooked under a certain temperature, the gluten free fad is a bunch of BS, I enjoy eating things that had a mom, and I am pro GMO crops and agrochemicals, but I did really enjoy my meal from Eden on a recent Friday evening.  This was a stop during a visit to the Pittsburgh area, and I'm as glad that we found it as much for the area of town it is in as I did for the restaurant itself. Parking is left up to streets only as far as I could tell, and a lot of them have restrictions on time limits during certain parts of the day. It is a busy area, so you may need to do a couple laps around the block or just park farther away and walk. We went to go put our name in and got a surprised look when we said we didn't make reservations, so doing that may be a good idea. We ended up getting put on a list after she said they couldn't take us at all, and told it would be about 45 minutes, so we took a stroll around the neighborhood. If I'm remembering correctly, the area this is located in is called Shadyside, and I would describe it as rich-hippy. It is a neat area with a lot of cool old houses, and plenty of restaurants and shops. There is definitely a college, hipster vibe to it but it is also full of pricier store selections.   After our expected wait time came and went, we decided to go back to check on our place in line and were seated immediately. I am guessing the fact that we never got a call, that we were told it was booked solid when there were a lot of empty tables the whole time we were there, and the reason we spent way more time at the restaurant than we wanted was because they were understaffed. It isn't a big place, but it's much larger than what the 2 girls who were working should be covering as far as being the hostess, servers, bussing tables, and brining out food. They were super nice and were working hard, but they just needed at least an extra person working. This was really the only negative for the evening, but if you are on a time limit, this may not be your best option.  What made up for the service was the food. It appears that they change their menu quite a bit because a lot of the items that I had made a note of while looking through Yelp pictures weren't on the menu. The menu was fairly small, with less than 10 entrée options and a few appetizers, and all of the entrées were pretty much in the $13-$16 range. If it is on the menu when you visit, I would highly recommend the mushroom dumplings. They were great, and the sauce that they were served in was amazing. The veggies that were in the bowl were a little softer than I would have preferred with the already soft dumplings, but it all tasted delicious.  I heard good things from the rest of my table (aside from the smoothie), and the entrée orders were large portions at a price that was on par with what I would have expected for this specialty diet food. The orders did take quite a while to come out after we put our order in, which could probably be attributed to the style of food that this place serves.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for gluten free, raw, vegan options, but don't be scared off if you aren't into that. The food is all delicious, and it is a nice quiet and intimate setting to enjoy a meal with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything on the menu is artistically crafted and delicious. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you receive. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here once for the lunch menu and once for the dinner menu.    From the lunch menu I had the grilled cheese which was delightful.  The bread, tomato, and feta cheese mixed so well together that my tongue felt like it was in heaven.  The balsamic vinaigrette that came on the side salad was SUPERB!  From the dinner menu I tried the special where you get to try everything on the menu for $15/person.  Please note: the dinner menu is purely raw vegan food.  I am not a vegan nor have I ever experienced raw food.  I was a little nervous by the menu since it was stuff I typically wouldn't order.  Once the food started coming WOW!  I am a believer!  If you're new to raw food or vegan food I would suggest the same route I did with trying everything on the menu.  It was ALL so delicious and bold (didn't need the salt).  Surprisingly the BEST absolutely TO DIE FOR item on the menu was the pumpkin pie.  I do normally hate pumpkin pie but WOW do I wish I had the whole pie rather than just a slice of it.  Just order it, even if you don't like pumpkin pie and you will be in shock over how happy your stomach is!    If you came here when it was the Juice Box Cafe this place is a little more grown up.  Even if the menu item looks similar to Juice Box Cafe the flavors are MUCH better.  If you decide to venture out for the dinner menu I recommend you go in with an open mind and an empty belly.  Don't even look at the menu just trust that it all somehow magically works together (because it does).  GREAT change of pace from the regular options around Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Awesome.  I loved it.  Friendly staff.  They take the time to prepare your food lovingly and to get to know you.  Perfect place for fussy nuts like me.  Though I am not a vegan, I do try to avoid dairy, so eating at a predominently vegan restaurant allowed me to order without worrying about getting a \"dairy stomach.\"  I had the peanut tempeh dish.  My vegetarian friend was worried I wouldn't like it.  Yeah, right.  It was amazing!!  Menu is seasonal.  Whole thing changes every 12 weeks or so.  So go and enjoy, enjoy it now!  P.S. Small restaurant, relaxed, nice but casual."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! So glad we found this place while visiting Pittsburgh. Great selections / options. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It is becoming a Sunday tradition to wander in to Eden for brunch.  They have a small outdoor seating area that is fun, if you can get it.  Eden offers vegetarian and vegan choices galore.  Today I had a blueberry smoothie and an asparagus and mushroom omelet, cooked to perfection.  For those of you who miss quiet storm, and even those who don't, this is a great addition to PITTSBURGH conscious eating scene."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved my tofu scramble, tempeh bacon, and cucumber mint icy. Service was quick, and this place makes me wish it wasn't an hour away."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've had dinner there, and brunch, and thoroughly enjoyed both. I'm not vegan -- I'd describe myself as vegetarian-ish (bacon is  a vegetable, right?). I loved everything I had at Eden, and I could have real eggs and butter with my brunch. When I ordered tea, she said \"I'll bring you our list,\" and I knew I was in good hands. It arrived in a pot, brewing from loose tea leaves, too. The fennel-apple salad is particularly wonderful."}
{"text":"Wow, this was seriously the best brunch I have had in a LONG time. A bit bummed they don't open until 10 AM on Sundays, but so worth it. The jackfruit crab sandwich with avocado and tomato was the best vegan sandwich I have ever had -- a beautiful replacement for tuna salad that really replicates the texture and chew of chicken/tuna with the jackfruit. We also ordered the raw coconut, almond, wheat cakes and they were phenomenal. It is hard to not get raw food to taste dry, but these cakes were paired beautifully with fruit and dips that really brought the textures together. The smoothies are really tasty, but a bit pricey. Great artwork on the walls. I wish I lived closer to Eden to go there every weekend!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant several times when frolicking around Walnut Street but hadn't been until recently. I was prompted by a vegetarian friend and will admit I was a bit hesitant because of the limited menu.   I usually go for savory items for brunch, but picked a sweet dish this time. I got the gluten free waffles. Word to the wise - you get unlimited toppings! I got almond butter, bananas and strawberries. It was delicious. I got a fried egg on the side for some protein/savory-ness. My friend got the tempeh dish, which she said was a little bland, but was fixed with ketchup and some salt & pepper. I was also impressed by the budget-friendly nature of the menu.  They have conversation question cards at the tables, which we want to try out next time we come. Would be good for a new date hehe."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for forever! Every time I tried to go they were closed though. Shame on me for not checking the hours, but they aren't open for lunch on the weekdays when I find myself in Shadyside for meetings.  The menu looked tantalizing. I love veggies and absolutely don't mind the restaurant's approach to gluten-free and vegetarian food. I zeroed in on the Vegetable Scramble which had assorted veggies, back eyed peas and avocados scrambled with organic eggs. I was hesitant about the gluten-free toast, I usually don't feel like gluten-free toast is any good, but that may have been the best part of the meal!  Unfortunately, the scramble was very bland. It had everything going for it, all the right ingredients, but lacked any flavor. I doctored it up with pepper and salt, but it still didn't do much. I also got the red pepper soup, which tasted bland as well. The only difference was when I added salt and pepper to this, it tasted a little better.   The highlights were local Gryphon's Tea (love the Chai!) and incredibly friendly service. Other than that, I was disappointed. Especially with all the glowing reviews! Hope it was just an off day..."}
{"text":"My biggest gripe about Eden is that they just took away LUNCH!!!  Being a former fan of the JBC (Juice Box Cafe), to me, this was THE PLACE to be guaranteed a fresh, wonderfully tasting, super fresh lunch that's free of all the stuff that I hate (GMOs, soy, dairy, etc.).  But due to seasonal ingredients, they will be stopping lunch hours over the winter.  ( I will miss you Turkey & Avocado Sandwich... ).  However, this place is still awesome for dinner if your palate is adventurous and you love seasonal food!  Since I have tried the Mushroom Kale pizza, I really don't want any other kind of \"pizza\" out there.  This is not your traditional pizza (thank God) as it comes on a dehydrated spinach and sunflower seed \"cracker\" that has cashew spread, barbecued mushrooms, fresh-sliced tomato, kale leaves, and fresh oregano.  I've had this TWICE now because I absolutely crave it!  This pizza just screams FLAVOR in every bite - and every flavor just works with the next.    The pumpkin pie that is currently on their menu also?  THE PUMPKIN PIE OF ALL PUMPKIN PIES!!!  Again - THANK YOU to whomever created that masterpiece!  My Mom was appalled that I refused to eat hers this Thanksgiving after having a piece of what Eden serves.    But even if you're not \"thrilled\" with creative, fresh, veggie meals - they do have dinners that contain fowl.  My boyfriend got the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was very delicious.  However, our one gripe about that dish was that the \"non-bread\" served with it was just warmed-up pitas, not real \"non-bread\".  Besides that, the dish was full of flavor!!!  One of our favorite spots in ShadySide!!!"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here a few nights back! I've been wanting to come here for dinner for quite some time, and I guess I chose the right night. They just started offering their new summer menu, and it is fantastic. I choose the 3-course Raw Menu sampler, which lets you try everything on the raw menu for only $15! And I will add - it was awesome! I will note that if you are very hungry or have a big appetite, you probably want to order something in addition to the sampler.  The starters included the Coconut Crusted \"Fried\" Onions which are dehydrated onions with a coconut breading and it is as satisfying as eating real onion rings, except much healthier. The first course also had the Cucomber and Watermelon soup (which to me sounded unappetizing but was surprisingly good) and Fresh Fruit with \"Goat Cheese\" (which is not actually goat cheese, but rather a cheese made from buts, fruit, and seeds).  The 2nd course was my favorite. If I were to pick one of these entrees to order, it would be a tough choice. The Zucchini Ravioli is probably my favorite, but the Nacho Bowl and Stuffed Tomatoes where also surprisingly delicious. I don't typically eat vegan food, so when I am eating nachos and don't even realize they are vegetarian (there is a beet and pumpkin seed filling that you could mistake for beef), it means it is a pretty good meal.  Lastly were the desserts. This was my least favorite course, but only because I have a major sweet tooth but also LOVE dairy and so it is really hard to thoroughly enjoy a vegan dessert. That being said, they were still good.  Service was also good - both the hostess and waitress were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Our brunch party was running 10-15 minutes late for a reservation today--totally our fault, but we tried to minimize the harm by calling ahead. Not ok, according to the staff at Eden. They spoke to us rudely, stood 3 feet away and spoke ABOUT us rudely, didn't offer us any coffee until we asked, and generally behaved in a way that made me decide to never eat at Eden again. The food was ok, but definitely nothing special. And (for punishment, I suppose) we all only got a single cup of \"bottomless\" coffee apiece.   Sorry, Eden, I won't insult you by spending my money at you anymore."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. I was a bit scared of the prices (but really it was nothing for how amazing the food was) and the \"everything raw\" but it didn't disappoint. It was everything and more.  We got the stuffed avocado appetizer. So yummy. My friend didn't like it had so much vinegar but I thought it was perfect. Then the white pizza. It was ok. I guess I needed to change my expectations of what a raw gluten free pizza would be like. We were told it was really good but ... Eh. It was a neat concept, and the 'cheese' was good. Pumpkin curry. Woo my tastebuds were going crazy. Get it if you go in the fall. Lastly what finished us off was the deserts.  The apple tart was simply amazing. The paste was so good I didn't want to share it!...  the vanilla ice cream just everything tasted so natural and fresh. and the pear sorbet was decent but totally overwhelmed by the apple tart."}
