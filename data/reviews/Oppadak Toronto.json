{"text":"AMAZING fresh chicken that's baked instead of fried! Makes a huge difference. Great company, really friendly staff and owner. I suggest the garlic wings with an ice cold beer, pork belly and the best shave ice I've ever had in the city. Such a great place that I will be coming back to very soon!"}
{"text":"I've found my favorite wings joint! I've never craved chicken wings til now. Although I live in scarbrough, I mission out here for their roasted wings. The dips that come along with each order is fantastic. My friends and I always have such a great time here drinks, karaoke and great food. Service and food is consistent. I'm giving 4 (actually 4.5) stars only because it takes quite a bit of time. So if you're in a rush, don't get the roasted wings but sooo worth it."}
{"text":"This place has deeeelicious chicken. They have various options, including boneless chicken! I've been twice now and definitely found the boned chicken to be juicier and just overall tastier. The garlic flavour is so good... Just don't plan on kissing anyone. They have GRAPE soju and it's dangerously easy going down. Bring a bunch of people because a whole chicken is shareable. They also have huge karaoke rooms if you're so inclined. And c'mon, it's baked... Soooo it's pretty guilt-free. I think they've changed their name to Chicken Day... Just look for the Staples plaza!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant did not give me a complementary salad or popcorn. They only give Korean people complementary snacks and only some waiters will give it to you. They definitely treat Korean people better and will treat you worse if you or not. They will roll their eyes at you and not give you starters if you are of another race."}
{"text":"This is another KFC that just opened in Vaughan and they're  known for their oven baked chicken.  I didn't try their oven baked chicken but we had their fried chicken covered with in honey and peanuts. It was delicious and fresh as it came right out of the fryer! Will have to come back next time."}
{"text":"They recently changed their name to Chicken day, but the menu remains the same.  Oven baked chicken but tastes just like fried, so delicious!! Love their honey garlic chicken and green scallion chicken that comes with special wasabi dipping sauce.  Their spicy Korean rice cake is also very delish.  Spacious seating but their music is a bit loud (as they also do Kareoke in the back rooms) and no change table for babies in the ladies washroom.  They make their chicken per order so you can expect there is a wait for approx 20 min after you placed an order.  We usually go on Friday nights and that place is never fully seated. Highly recommend this place for those who love fried chickens and don't want to be waiting in line for their chickens."}
{"text":"I love their garlicky chicken wings !  They are so good with marinated white radishes ( Korean style ) These chicken wings are perfect for picnics or potluck ! My mom just bought a box for dinner !  Have some mints after these wings !"}
{"text":"It's very good! Clean, friendly, food are delicious. I love their garlic and peanut sauce chickens. Also their spicy rice cakes are yummmms. If u like spicy I recommend it. So funny to say this. They are chicken specialty store however their spicy seafood noodle soup is excellent!! I would never think to order that there but I did and it was one of the best. Abundant of ingredients and tasty. I hope they do well since it's so close to me! Take out is good too but I ate in store, yup it's better when it's out fresh!! I'm gonna def go back. Shaved ice was good too. I feel like I tried most of every thing in their menu"}
{"text":"Overpriced. No flavour. Small portion. Poor service.   We ordered the large boneless chicken  original roast and boneless crispy baked chicken. I found both of them to be lacking in seasoning and flavour.   The large portions are also very small. Close to $30 for a large and I feel that I can finish the large by myself. That's too pricy.   Service was slow and poor. We finished all the water at the start of the meal and it was never refilled. Then we asked for the bill and we sat 10 minutes waiting for her to bring the bill to us.   One novelty is the popcorn that they serve as snacks. Kinda cool and different.   But if I want fried chicken, I think I will go to Popeye's. Cheaper and better."}
