{"text":"Arhova has its strengths: it's huge and open long hours, so it scores well on convenience. It also has its weaknesses. You can get pitchers of beer, but sadly it will be Rickards Red and the like. I play it safe and order classics like gyros and fries, and I'm usually satisfied---meets expectations but doesn't exceed them."}
{"text":"Vraiment un bon souvlaki Pita au porc (celui d'agneau me semble aussi bon mais plus cher). Je prends toujours l'assiete salade et souvlaki. Les prix sont justes et les goût est parfait."}
{"text":"Unclear why this \"souvlaki\" place doesn't sell iPod. Also can you order pizza from both sides of the joint? Fivestars"}
{"text":"Ce fut aujourd'hui une expérience décevante. Je fréquente les Resto Arahova depuis près de 35 ans et je sens que la fin approche pour cette succursale à moins de donner un coup de barre rapidement. J'avais ressenti la même chose il y a quelques années avec la succursale sur la rue Sherbrooke est quand la qualité avais diminuée, il a fermé peu après.
Les calmars étaient mous, peu ou pas égoutés, et la sauce était dans un plat de plastique pour emporter. Le fromage fêta est sec et manque de saveur et la salade grecque devient par le fait même bien insignifiante. Le seul point positif est notre serveur, Claude, qui est gentil et efficace. En ce dimanche midi, alors que le St-Hubert voisin est plein, nous étions durant tout notre repas les seules personnes dans le Resto. Quand les clients désertent, le message est clair .
C'est triste mais pour moi, Arahova, c'est terminé."}
{"text":"First off the bat, let me tell you that the only reason there is one star here is that I didnt throw-up the food.

 A few months back, I ordered a very expensive meal there, a 20$ lamb dish. The lady on the phone didnt speak french, so I diligently switched to english, which as you can see I have no problem with. Unfortunately, the lady did. I repeated and spelled my address for 5 minutes, and asked her to repeat it for me too. Then, same thing for my order, and same thing for my phone number. After 10 minutes on the phone trying to make sure she got it right, I hung-up, satisfied that all was in order. I then proceeded to wait patiently for my order, knowing that was not fast food, its lamb and its delicate. So, I waited. And waited. And waited. After about and hour and 15 minutes, realising that they were near closing, I called back to make sure it was normal that it was taking this long. It was not. I was informed that the lady had not taken my phone number or my address correctly, and that they were unable to deliver my food. I asked them how long it would take for them to get my food to me, and they simply said that they were closed and I would not get my order. I asked to speak with the manager, and explained to him that it was not my fault if their staff were unable to take orders properly because of a language incapacity, and I didnt see why I should pay the price for it. The guy was extremely irrate and started arguing with me in a very arrogant maner, never even appologising or hinting at the possibility that they would man-up and take responsibility. I would have been satisfied had he just said something like we're sorry, I understand your frustration... ANYTHING. Instead, he gave me the worst attitude. I finally told him, \"ok. look, I'm not going to argue all night with you, what are you going to do about this?\" He said, VERY reluctantly, that he would give me a 5$ discount on my next order.  

 Well, I should have left it at that and stayed away from that place. But I'm a food lover and a greek food lover and a lamb lover. So I did call again to order the same thing a few days after. I came on the phone saying it was for a delivery. The girl asked for my phone number. As soon as I gave it to her, her tone changed and she said that  they were not delivering anymore in my area that night.... 

 so I called in REALLY early the day after, and said right off the bat I was calling for a delivery in Verdun... THEN she asked for my phone number, and again her tone changed, but she couldnt possibly tell me they were'nt delivering in my area, right?... So I did place my order, and specified that I wanted my lamb rare. 

Got the order all right... With the discount.... But the lamb was dry, and was way passed well done. The rice that came with it was probably the best part of the dish. I'll never order from that place again. They are rude, and the food really isnt worth it."}
{"text":"Rhonda J here. Just to start off....hell yeah...let me tell you. Many a late night eat here with me and my buddies Crawford, Tatyana, sometimes Gabriel and Lillian right on. I used to get the chicken gyro poutine every time but after one time when Gabriel ordered the 'old fashioned' poutine with pork and lamb there is no going back. Super sweet lady answers the phone sometimes, other people are ok. Poutine is very hefty and usually about half meat. Sometimes the food is not as good as others. Souvlakis nothing special...oversauced!!! Poutine every time is the rule, tell them Rhonda told you"}
{"text":"has been one of my go to places.for.delivery for quite.sometime. the prices are a bit high. but its.good food. thr only reason i did not give 5 stars. when you used.to order a meal plate you.could ask for garlic bread which is free when you at at the resto. with your delivery meal. i was informed on my order tonight. the big boss has asked.to charge clients 1.50.now...if.your.going to charge the prices.you.do. why are you being cheap.on 2 pieces.of toast?

will you now start charging clients inside when you sit down?

i have ordered.from.you guys prob 10 times a yea for the last 3-4 years. tonights.order will be my last. its the small things that matter. tell that boss not.to be such a cheap skate."}
{"text":"This is by far the best arahova in town. All types of brochettes are juicy, tender the ognions in the greek salad are nice and sweet, practically every thing on the menu is just right for Greek food. The staff is all loud, happy and probably Greek too. Hence the quality the food wink wink. To top it all off I assume the reason for so many chefs is because of their take out menu.

I have been to other Arahova's but the original is still the cream of the crop and will  always have place in my tummy for."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of souvlaki, but this Lasalle Arahova is not bad, had some good experiences and some little bad, needs to be more consistant. I prefer Marathon"}
{"text":"Ate here a few time this week for lunch. Wow! Fantastic Greek food, fresh tasting and served quickly and politely!"}
{"text":"Good for take out. Original gyros lacks the spices and flavor of theirs I've had. Lamb souvlaki however is fantastic. Tzisiki is also outstanding"}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy ordering from here, however this particular evening, it took an hour and a half to deliver, my food was cold, and parts of it burned, and they forgot my salads, which is where they put the little dish of tzatziki in, so I had to eat dry, burned chicken. 
On top of that, it took an hour for them to deliver the salads again. 
After paying $35.00 for 2 meals, and a good tip to the idiot delivery guy, not impressed.
And on top of all that, no one at the restaurant apologized, neither did the delivery guy. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"'Twas decent, menu changes and concept changed last I went years ago downtown but it was okay, the food was okay too, the prices were great! And got extra tzatziki sauce to go!! Better to me than Casa Grecque!"}
{"text":"I much prefer this than Casa Grecque hands down! I have to come back again , very enjoyable and the food is good :)"}
{"text":"One of the few good takeout options in the city. The food is good and reasonably priced, but I don't recommend using their delivery service, as it's very slow. Go eat there (BYOB) or pick it up on your way home."}
{"text":"Decent price, good food, open late."}
{"text":"I've eaten a few times, but that was a few years ago when I took advantage of a promotional offer.

I've never had a problem with their food, as I've always found it to be freshly made and tasty. A bit pricey, though. Which is why I only went when they gave out those flyers by mail offering discount coupons.

The customer service was another thing, as one of the waitresses was kind of rude and abrupt, but the manager overheard her and admittedly took disciplinary action. He only mentioned this after I came back a day or so later.

That being said, I guess this place has mixed reviews because of inconsistent customer service and food quality. That's too bad.

Hopefully in the newly renovated place, the improvements aren't just cosmetic. Time will tell."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Gross.  No taste. Waiting forever.  Got sick.   Tastes like old meat.  Not Greek at all!!!!!  Should never t be open."}
{"text":"Restaurant familial sans prétention. Les portions sont généreuses et le rapport qualité-prix est bon. Le poulet est délicieux, surtout en pita. Le service est rapide, parfait pour take-out ou manger sur place avec les enfants."}
{"text":"Dreadful quality. Tried a gyro (lamb) at the St-Viateur location and was terribly disappointed. It seems these people have no interest in quality anymore as they are riding on the coat tails of their established name. The meat was fatty, chewy and overall unpleasant. I had an Elatos Gyro the same day to compare and it was remarkably better and cheaper. Time for places like this to step up or just close down. Montreal needs to weed out all the mediocre and overrated restaurants. We need quality not quantity."}
{"text":"Arahova used to be a solid souvlaki joint but once they decided to expand aggressively and become Montreal's premiere Greek resto-franchise, they've gone down in quality almost as quickly as their prices have gone up. This one is the original so it looks less like a fast food place than their other locations (and I think the food is better too) but for the same price you can eat at a real restaurant."}
{"text":"La même succulente cuisine grecque depuis 1970. Les meilleurs souvlakis en ville ! J'ai connu Arahova Souvlaki en 1974 alors qu'il avait un seul emplacement qui d'ailleurs existe encore aujourd'hui sur la rue Saint-Viateur. Mais à l'époque, il y avait au plus trois tables dans ce minuscule espace avant que le restaurant s'agrandisse et que les emplacements se multiplient partout à Montréal. Même après 40 ans c'est toujours aussi bon. Essayez la salade à la tomate et feta ! Même les dieux grecs n'en reviendraient pas."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the oldest Greek restaurants in the city, and I've been a fan since I was a kid. I always get a chicken souvlaki pita and the rice pudding. They have the best tzatziki, it's so thick, creamy, and of course, garlicky. But to be honest here, my favorite item is their rice pudding - what makes it so darn good? I have no idea, but it reminds me of my childhood and is incredibly comforting. I get my food to go, and pick up a few bagels while I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad for a hole in the wall Greek fast food spot next to a Starbucks in Old Montreal.

Lot's of food if you tell them you are Greek. They will know if you are lying.

Opa Opa"}
{"text":"Dimanche soir on était à la recherche d'un petit resto de dernière minute. On s'est retrouvé un peu par hasard sur St-Viateur et on a décidé de tenter Arahova. La carte offre un large choix de plat, il y en a pour tous les goûts! J'ai opté pour une assiette végétarienne à 10 $, les portions sont tellement généreuses que je suis repartie avec des restes. Mon pita était super bon et le service très efficace. Très bon rapport qualité/prix, j'y retournerai sans hésiter !"}
{"text":"The one and only. After many years of eating around the menu, I now pretty much get the same thing every time: old-fashioned gyro burger, no onions, and fries. I hadn't been to Arahova in at least a year, but it was exactly as I remembered.

I'm not sure what other reviewers could possibly complain about. The menu is varied, the food is great, the service is good in English and French, the prices are reasonable, and the fries are excellent. If I lived in the neighbourhood (or indeed, in this city) I would eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Arahova recently moved up the street from a location they were seen as a local Laval heritage since I was a small child. The old place was very traditional but the years didn't compliment well. That Greek ruin is now gone and they have installed themselves in a nifty new location with a beautiful decor that is traditional yet very sleek and modern. I was pretty impressed.

The service was friendly and our food didn't take long to be served. I went with the \"gyro a l'ancienne\" \"old style gyro and a side salad. It was very tasty. The cost for the meal was pretty cheap.

I like the new place thus far, will be back!"}
{"text":"The tzatziki is potent and garlicky as hell, and the pita sandwiches are good - my only complaint is with how little chicken was in the sandwich.  It was an incredibly anemic portion hidden under a river of tzatziki and veggies..

3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Restaurent extrêmement sale. J'ai dut quitter avant de commander. Les toilettes de mc donald sont plus propres! À éviter!!"}
{"text":"Felt like eating greek food tonight,  there's a few choices in that neighborhood.  I ended up at Arahova, the food here is very basic nothing fancy, the usual souvlakis and salad. Was there with friends and we tried a few appetizers. We got tsatziki dolmades(stuffed wine leaves) spanakopita and tiropita they were very good. For the main course we tried the Moussaka , chicken stick plate and a douvlaki pita,  it was very average. If you are in the mood for greek food its worth trying it."}
{"text":"Gyro meat was dry, souvlaki was great though."}
{"text":"The lady on the phone was really rude. After waiting 1.5 hours for my food to be delivered I received greasy, cold, calamari which were not edible and burnt /dry/cold  gyros and cold fries. 
Will stay away"}
{"text":"This was always my favorite Souvlaki place in the city. It was just ok today.  Pita was only sorta fresh and not warm as was typical.  The service was awful.  Waiting and waiting for our cutlery until my wife got up and grabbed some.  Waiting and waiting for our menus then waiting after being served to order another drink.  We were so frustrated that we walked up to the cash, paid and left."}
{"text":"We love Greek food, and live in NDG, and love frequenting our local places Villa Du Souvlaki / Nikas, and others. However, today we were hungover and wanted Greek without having to go anywhere, and Arahova was the only place that offered Interac option before 5pm. So we went for it, but were skeptical.

Anyway, we ordered the 2 Chicken Souvlaki Platter, and it was super yummy. The sandwich was great, and fries and the greek salad were all yummy. The tatziki also. And it was all for $25 which wasn't so bad.  Very yummy, filling and tasty meal. :)

Naturally, it isn't exquisite, given the chain-ey nature of this place, but it exceeded our expectations for sure. Loved it. But would always lean towards a local family place. However, given same circumstances, I'd without a doubt order again.

Also, delivery came in 30min. Another plus."}
{"text":"I broke my souvlaki cherry at this restaurant decades ago and still go at least 2x per month. Back in the day I used to get doner plates with extra tzatziki and it was pure ecstasy. As time passed I moved on to chicken souvlakis - Fan-friggen-tastic!

Now that I'm a veggie boy, I eat the veggie souvs here and I must admit, Best in the city. Marathon Souvlaki (Chomedey, Laval) comes in second but Arahova wins best veggie souvlaki in Montreal. If you disagree, please message me and we can schedule a duel (at dusk) somewhere.

The Tzatziki is killer good and can sit down at any tzatziki poker table on planet earth and play all-in-tzatziki holdem. Unless you are some freak that is allergic to garlic, or your tastebuds were annihilated in some tragic nuclear accident, the tzatziki will rock your world and leave you with spasms of joy.

Why does it get 4 stars? Industrial noise. Their machines (bread toasting, cake turning, refrigeration) make way too much noise. Sometimes they squeak so loud, you could murder someone. I'm a regular - or at least I was a regular sit down eater. I was so regular, they knew my name and my order by heart - I was 'Norm' for goodness sake. As a regular you want to complain gently if something isn't right which I did too many times and nothing was done about it....so they lose money on my orders. (I always had a pint of beer, sometimes an appetizer)

So I do go there regularly but only for takeout. Mmmm Tzatziki."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in town we always make it a point to dine at Arahova's at least once. This restaurant was close to our hotel so we came here for dinner. We were seated right away. Our server was really nice. 

The free garlic toast is the best. I've never had anything like it. I ordered the chicken souvlaki in a pita plus a side of fries. The fries came in a huge bowl. You can absolutely share it with others. My souvlaki was as good as I remembered it. 

Prices are reasonable. Restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"DH took me to Arahova's when we were in town.  He really likes the souvlakis here.  I have to say that it's better than what the City has to offer.  The chicken souvlaki was well seasoned without being overly dry (for some reason, places in the City makes really dry chicken souvlaki).

The Kid loved the fries that came with the meal.  This is a casual family place.  Service was ok (not really attentive but they get the job done)."}
{"text":"Unbelievably, we took the bus all the way here to get gyros!  This was DH's go to place for greek food so we left downtown and traveled here for dinner.  We came in early so we got a seat right away.  I ordered the chicken pita plate.  DH had the basic gyro.  Kids meals were generous and it included ice cream.  

Service was fast.  We enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Really nice food stand-style place. On top of stellar food and prompt service, a lot about it isn't what you'd expect from a hole-in-the-wall eatery. The food is made-to-order and served with actual presentation (as in just-as-photogenic or better than the signs) on real plates with metal cutlery, no paper or plastic. They don't just shovel reheated stuff in a pile on cheap plates. The selection is good, standard things, not much innovation but as mentioned above the quality is great. 

If you're looking for cheap tasty eats and you're tired of French or Italian, this is the place."}
{"text":"Good place to get cheap Greek food. Get  gyro a l ancienne old fashion - amazing. Cheap draft beer as well. Good spot open windows nice breeze coming in"}
{"text":"Typical fast food Greek restaurant. Chicken pita is all too delicious! Especially at 4am. Fries are way too dry so I never order em. However,the chicken poutine is very good! Reasonable price for above average fast food."}
{"text":"The worst döner I've ever had in my life. The meat was incredibly dry, the tzatziki sauce was super thick probably to compensate for the dry meat. Oh and even though it's tomato season, the tomatoes used were conventional. Go to any other restaurant and they use real garden tomatoes."}
{"text":"Average food. Terrible service in the restaurant : unpleasant older lady. They charged us for freaking bread before our meal that took 1hour to get here. Never going back :("}
{"text":"This Arahova is closed, and for good reason I ate here a few months back and the quality of the food was just right down terrible, cold burnt pita bread, charred meat almost tastes like ash. Tatyki sauce was almost non existant over filled with onions. Service was just a no care attitude. Was also dirty lets hope if this place decides to make a come back under new management it will see better times."}
{"text":"More like 3 1/2 stars. Good basic food at reasonable prices. The desserts and cakes looked amazing. We had the calamari platter and the half grilled chicken along with the spanakopita. Everything was tasty and reasonably priced. Recommended. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a montreal institution.i have been eating at arahova for about 30 years.i basically grew up with their tzaziki.it has changed a lot over the years,i remember the restaurant being packed on the weekends.nowadays it is more of a casual family oriented and late night eats spot(it is open till 2am most nights).the quality of the food is not always consistent but that is because the kitchen staff appears to have changed so much.the wait staff as well but i think Angie is one of the friendliest lady,i dont think she knows it but she has been serving me since i was a wee toddler. I rarely eat in house anymore but i pick up my orders of gyros and pitas combo almost every week. Because of the history and the place it keeps in my heart,it is the only place i can pick up my gyros from. #arahovalove"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this place last night. The whole process was an uphill battle. From ordering on the phone to picking up the food and yuk the food.
Took a while to get our order ready, and the staff was just yelling at each other. We ordered 2 plates of gyro. There were pieces of meat that were not chewable. It's as if it was burnt and had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Doesn't anyone check the quality of what is being served ? The salad and tzatziki were fine, although we thought the portion was a bit small. 
I would not recommend this Arahova location."}
{"text":"Have not been here in years and it sure was not like the good ole days. The food tasted corporate now as they have become. The greek Salad was bland but thank god they had real greek olive oil which saved the day and gave it some taste. The yero was just OK. No where near as good as village grecqe."}
{"text":"Arahova's is my favourite place to indulge in Greek food. Every time we go, it's always so good. We always order the same thing, chicken gyro pita with rice (or half rice/half fries) and a drink. TIP: this isn't on the menu, so you have to ask for it. It's the chicken gyro pita trio. It comes to like 10$ and is perfectly filling for me. Out of all the Arahova's locations (that I have been to), this is my favourite one. It rivals Souvlaki George and Marathon's, but it's still my #1 Greek place!"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall Greek place.  Had the first chicken gyros plate in the morning and it was very flavorful and plentiful.   Very good fresh food at an a reasonable price."}
