{"text":"Great place! Haven't been here in years when they had different owners. Delicious food, friendly staff, clean and cool in the hot summer.   Super fluffy pancakes  Crispy bacon  Fresh Greek salad"}
{"text":"Everything you could want in a small family diner-resto-cafe - quality meat, simple dishes, service with a smile. Did I mention bottomless coffee?  We went to hike the Cheltenham Badlands in Caledon, a unique landform for Ontario. Red sandy gulleys and mounds ranging from little hills to deeper 12 foot crevasses like a desert, not Canadian Shield territory with rocks and trees and trees and rocks and...waterrrrrrrr. (Didn't get the reference? Arrogant Worms, people, you're welcome) On the way back we a) needed to use the washroom and b) were hungry so voila.   Squint and the Coffee Bean looks like a gas station, but don't let that fool you, come right in.  ATMOSPHERE  Mom and Pops classic diner style - sturdy plastic and metal tables and chairs, an all day breakfast menu and handwritten signs and specials. Our group of four was seated right away, no problem.  FOOD  All day breakfast for your sweet sweet lovin. Eggs benedict to pulled pork gyros to salads, everything the body needs. The meat, our server informed us, is from local farmers and the desserts made in-house.  For such a small place, the menu was surprisingly large. I ordered grilled chicken and salad and bottomless coffee, my pals ordered a burger and fries and a beef brisket gyro.   My chicken was very acceptable, not grilled with char marks but grilled on a flat grill. The salad was head lettuce but a good amount with nice feta and olives and cucumbers. Nothing I hate worse than a shabby salad.  My friend's burger was monstrous and apparently delicious - the fries were also very crisp.   The gyro - now there was the money maker! Nice tasty thinly shaved beef in a soft slightly toasted pita-thing - yum! I don't eat carbs unless they are extremely delicious and the pita made the grade.    Prices were reasonable especially given the generous portions, for the frugal people in all of us.   SERVICE  Extremely happy service, even though we definitely looked like tourists. Because we were. I'm cool with it. I'm a tourist in Toronto too. What? I still take pictures of the ROM. That's because I love the big ugly Crystal. And I'll keep loving it forever. Or at least until some ice slides off the side of it and pins me to the pavement.  LOCATION  Right off highway 410, on the corner of Old Base Line, right along your route to the Badlands a few clicks away. Just over an hour away from Markham.   OVERALL  Do yourself a favour and check out those Badlands! My photos look like we went to Mars, not Caledon. While you're on your way or coming back, stop off at the Coffee Bean for some good food and casual hometown lovin.   Please note you can't just show up and use the washroom - don't be That Tourist. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent stop north of the city.  Was just out for a drive and came across this place.  Its a mom and pop run joint with the side or the road diner feel to it.  Food is economically priced and generous portions, but best of all its very tasty!!  Service was attentive and friendly.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to give this place a try one weekend morning, while in the area, and have been coming back ever since. I am not the type to want to go out for breakfast but when this place is suggested I am up for it.  What do I like? Hmmm good coffee, good service, I like the square frozen potatoes and their crispy bacon. It is a small diner but I like that country family feel.   From the outside it doesn't look really appealing. Inside is ok. I have never used their washrooms so I can comment on them.   IMPORTANT: it is a small location so be sure to arrive early because they are always busy and don't be in a rush to quickly get your meal because they can only go so fast.  I will get some pictures next time I go."}
{"text":"A nice retro outdoor sign.  For a place called COFFEE BEAN, be nice if they actually had lattes, espresso, etc... Coffee type stuff.  Food is decent, diner style. Place was cold (winter), need some heat."}
{"text":"Came here again after they sold this place to new owners, and well let's just say it's not the same.  They claim to serve the same stuff but clearly they don't. Too bad, it was a great spot to enjoy breakfast after a morning mountain bike run!"}
{"text":"Service and food has gone downhill since new owners took over. The food is ok but the homefries are now cheap frozen crap. Cost cutting on the food and the slow service has me going elsewhere now."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast, very large portions, reasonable prices.  It's quite busy on Saturday and Sunday.  The toasted western sandwich is amazing."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu at very reasonable prices. Excellent refillable coffee.  Monique goes out of her way to make sure all your requests are fulfilled and the food is served in good time and piping hot.  We have been there numerous times and would go back again, and again for a simple but delicious breakfast."}
