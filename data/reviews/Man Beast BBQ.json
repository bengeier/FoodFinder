{"text":"I could eat this brisket for days. It's like butter, but it's meat, which means it's even better. I love the griddled kale and mac n cheese... basically you can't go wrong! I've gotten their food downtown, randomly saw them at East End a few weeks ago, and I think I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I am usually NOT a lover of brisket (There is often the problem with tasteless meat or selections heavily seasoned on the outside with little to no taste in the body of the meat) but these guys know the drill and their brisket is a fine example of what it should taste like. Beautiful preparation and the taste is literally to die for. Well done gentlemen, well done!!!"}
{"text":"Downloaded the mobile nom app to keep up with the upcoming food truck season and literally five minutes later I had my first notification that Man Beast was parked outside of my office. I had the Havana club and mac. The meat was tender and generously portioned. The mac left a little to be desired since it wasn't very cheesy. It is skillet mac so it has crispy cheese on top and bottom."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in the South, I've been particularly hesitant about giving BBQ in Pittsburgh a try. However, when this food truck showed up right outside my office today for a Make-A-Wish Charity Event, I figured it was time. 

I regret nothing about that decision. I had the Brisket Sandwich (without the bun, as I am Keto) and it was absolutely delicious. The brisket was moist, tender, and the sauce didn't overpower the taste of the meat. I'd personally hoped for a little more bark, but I know a lot of sandwiches don't include it.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised and hope to try other sandwiches on the menu."}
{"text":"Brisket should be good. If at the start of eating a piece of brisket, even from the initial viewing, you don't have an animal feeling of satisfaction - the brisket is not good. This brisket is good. This truck is a good place where good things happen."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a recent work trip. The owner is a stud. He has a fine dining background and brings it with his BBQ game. His equipment on board is enviable and I look forward to eating again with Man Beast BBQ. 

Thanks for the brisket!"}
{"text":"Damn this food is good!
Brisket the way it's meant to be; melt in your mouth delicious and scrumptious.
The pork nachos are insane! So flavorful with tender meat and spices."}
