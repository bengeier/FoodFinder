{"text":"Another new place for rice noodle roll in Scarborough!  Price: $6 combo with your choice of a rice noodle roll and a congee which is a good deal. Regular price for a beef rice noodle roll is $3.5.  Quality: thick and soft texture. I prefer rice roll with thinner layers. Congee is the same as other places."}
{"text":"So we came back today and ordered pork rice noodle rolls and congee with pork liver.   Congee was great as usual. No issue.  Rice rolls was clearly not as good as last time. Average at best. I did not enjoy the texture of the rolls and it tasted quite plain. Even the soy sauce did not help much.  If you live nearby it's still a good place to grab breakfast. However, I will probably go back only for their congee next time."}
{"text":"In the history of the world there has always been a life alternating revolution..the French revolution, the Cultural revolution and the Rock and Roll revolution just to name a few...  However there is a new foodie revolution coming and that is Rice Roll Revolution!  There's been a serious uptake in the number of rice roll spots in the GTA the last little while and seriously how can there not be?  Who doesn't love rice rolls?  There are soft, versatile, and most of all delicious!!  Canton Noodle is the sister kiosk of its sister store Canton Kitchen in this plaza and specializes in rice rolls, congee, noodles and other similar fare.  The rice rolls here are really good, soft chewy and flavourful.  Ordered the beef which was nicely velveted and the shrimp one had some decent sized shrimps.  Price wise it was great as most things are under $5 and includes taxes. I still prefer the ones at Yin Ji Cheng Fen but this is a pretty solid place to get your rice roll fix when you are in the area.  3.5/5!  Now who's willing to join me in the battle of the great Rice Roll Revolution!  Hahaha!!"}
{"text":"I came here looking for a simple bowl of congee and that's exactly what I got! For plain congee, you really get just that. I don't like garnishes or too much flavour, and this place definitely surpassed my expectations. No garnishes, not too salty, and the portion size was HUGE in a cute reusable bowl for just $2.75.   BONUS: The prices include tax!!!"}
{"text":"Brought here by a old family friend. Good price, and love their rice rolls, softer than the usual ones from dim sum restaurant. Good service for a good court vendor too. Would come back :)"}
{"text":"Ok... but have you seen the chunky helping of beef in their lettuce and beef rice noodle? For breakfast, arrived at the Chartwell centre at Brimley and Huntingwood with no idea where to find this haven of glorious rice noodles. Found it inside the main plaza, where we were the only guests sitting-in at the food court aside from a group of early birds doing Tai Chi. Gawked at our food and like starving hyenas preyed on our order:  Lettuce and beef rice noodle ($3.75) - good, rice noodle was soft. Just decent, best part was the addition of lettuce for some greens where there usually is none. Nothing outstanding about this dish. 3/5  Shrimp congee ($6.75) - good and bad. Lots of big yummy shrimp for the cost. The congee itself was watery and toppings (soya, sesame seed) could not salvage it. It was like a soup you prepare for someone sick. Hopefully just caught them on an off-day. 2/5  Would explore other rice noodle places before returning. Overall 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Canton Rice Noodle is the newest Rice Roll and Congee Place that opens up in Scarborough area. Located inside the food court of Chartwell Shopping Centre right next to it's sister business Canton Kitchen.  The menu is simple with Congee and Rice Roll. I tried the Plain Rice Roll ($2.50) and love the texture and the taste! And at this price, it is quite a deal as it is perfect for an afternoon snack! The Plain Congee ($2.75) is good portion wise. But it is not seasoned at all, so make sure you add salt or order one of the other congee in the menu.  Opens at 8 am daily and as a rice roll lover, I think I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite place for rice noodle rolls in the GTA. It's delicious and cheap! I love that their rolls are thin and soft - sooooo much better than the thick ones you get at dim sum places. It's prepared fresh so do eat it as soon as it's ready!  I've had a majority of their rice rolls, plain, shrimp, veggie, beef, etc. All in all, I will always order one with a filling and one plain. The plain rice noodle roll really shows you how nicely it's made!   Other menu items are cheap and yummy too, including congee (gigantic bowl for such a cheap price!  Its enough for 2-3 people to share) and other small dishes.   If I lived closer to this place I'd always come here to have breakfast to start my day off!"}
