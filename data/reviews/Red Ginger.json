{"text":"Came here for lunch while at a conference. Food was absolutely delicious and good service was provided throughout. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  We sat at the hibachi table the first time, it was fun, service is swift and concise.  Today, we had sushi, and as usual, they service was just impeccable!  I work right down the block, so it's also convenient. I'm pretty funny about raw fish (as we should be!), I had the chef's choice and it was fabulously fresh and full of flavor.  My friend had the bento box, also good.  We had two others that got the rolls.  Once again, spot on with service, efficiency, cleanliness and freshness.   Bravo!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great, attentive service! Only problem on this particular Friday night it was like an unruly, obnoxious day care! Cannot believe the small kids running around, making noise while parents totally ignored them! At least fifteen kids having a great loud time!"}
{"text":"Staying in a hotel downtown...Walked in by myself and asked to be seated at a hibachi table...i travel alot and usually you get seated and other people fill in the empty seats at a hibachi restaurant...they told me they  wouldn't seat single diners at the hibachi table so I left..."}
{"text":"I called a few days in advance to make a reservation to sit in front of the hibachi to only get there for them to tell me they could not fulfill my reservation because all the hibachi's were full. Of course I was upset but I got over it and sat at a table. I order hibachi shrimp which was not good maybe it was because it was cold. Being that I don't like returning food I once again let it go. This was an over all horrible experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, and great specials depending on what day of the week you come in. Great Experience!"}
{"text":"I went two weeks ago and sat outside. Glass of wine, the \"Angry Bird\" sushi and the tamago.   The tamago came out in a martini glass - gorgeous presentation - two pieces of triangled egg, with two tempura wrapped shrimp. Absolutely wonderful. The Angry Bird was also delicious. The problem that night was that there were 100's of tiny flies swarming about. After my first sip of wine, the first fly decided to sip it as well. Then a second, third and forth.   The waitress explained there was nothing she could do. \"The management will not allow us to take charges off of the bill. If we do, it comes out of our pay.\" I paid $12 for a glass of wine that I never drank.  Last night I returned and sat inside. My guest ordered the hibachi shrimp ($7.) Not sure exactly what we were expecting, but it wasn't 6 pieces of grilled shrimp on a lettuce leaf. I ordered the Tamago again, but this time I received plain, ol' tamago. When I asked what I received two weeks prior, the waitress (the same one I had two weeks ago) had no idea what I was talking about. I described it, drew a photo, but nothing - no idea what I was talking about.   The Lemon Drop was strong - perhaps too strong. My guest couldn't get past the first 2 sips.   $40 for a cocktail that was too strong, 6 pieces of shrimp, 3 pieces of plain tamago, and some good Angry Bird sushi.  I wish them luck, but all early signs point to being closed within a year."}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 12 for 2 people's birthdays. They gave us a free bottle of champagne and because they weren't able to fill all of the glasses with the bottle, they poured us two extra glasses. We also got free sake from the hibachi chef who squirted the sake (that is typically used for the stove) into our mouths. Sake bombs were inexpensive but the food was on the pricier side and just typical hibachi style food. The hibachi chef messed up his tricks a few times but we were very forgiving after a few sake bombs. Not sure I'll come again but good for a party."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this restaurant on more the one occasion. I love the atmosphere here. And the food is soooooo good..Soooooo GOOD"}
{"text":"Avoid this place....if you're less than 10 min late, you can expect to wait approximately 1hr 45 min until you are seated.   Food was average and service was mediocre. The old asian host was seen rolling her eyes a few times at patrons which is extremely rude. I would not recommend this place. The service and quality of food has gone downhill from a few years ago.  There are several other Japanese restaurants in the surrounding area that has better service and food."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this place. The atmosphere is trendy, and of course the location is great for uptown. The chef wasn't as engaged with our table as they are in other places, he seemed a little rushed, and it wasn't even that busy...granted there was 7 girls talking so he probably figured what we were talking about was much more interesting than a volcano made from onions! ;-)  I had the Hibachi steak and shrimp. The shrimp was really under seasoned, and over cooked. I also split a sushi roll which was OK, it was no CowFish but not terrible either. The prices are pretty average for a Japanese restaurant, but the food lacked in flavor.  We got a complimentary tempura banana dessert, and it was odd...the texture of tempura doesn't go well with bananas.  I'd stick with Nakato for Hiabachi and hands down The Cowfish for sushi...best sushi in Charlotte. Its not that I would never go back to Red Ginger but I wouldn't put this at the top of my list for great uptown restaurants. I've also seen Groupons for Red Ginger but don't really think it's worth it, don't feel it's that great of a deal for the prices."}
{"text":"This is probably the best tasting Japanese food I've ever had! Everything was so flavorful and rich! The service was amazing and attentive! I enjoyed every single bite!"}
{"text":"The sushi selection is great, it's the best Japanese restaurant I've been at with hibachi grills instead of regular dine-in tables. There is a variety of hibachi and kitchen entrees I would like to try. The service is great and I definitely plan on coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I went here during Restaurant Week. The place is nice and inviting, but the food is just okay. I've had better appetizers, sushi & hibachi elsewhere. The chicken avocado wrap was about the only thing that was worth trying here. Go here only if you are in uptown and want Asian food, but there is no need to make a special trip!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service for large groups at lunch time. We waited 55 mins the other day. And surprisingly other guests came in later than us got their food before us. Plus the female manager never apologized to us."}
{"text":"I have been to Red Ginger three times now, once for lunch and twice for drinks.  The lunch food was fine, but the restaurant struggles with operational efficiency.  The first plate that arrived was not the one I ordered.  The one I ordered had been given to an adjacent table, so I had to wait for another to be prepared.  Overall the experience was bearable.  Drinks, however, are another story.  There is no real bartender here, so you have to hope that your waiter is versed in the art of pouring beers.  This is a long shot.  The guy behind the bar poured us three full-foam pints before someone came out of the back and managed to pour a decent glass.  If you are ordering a cocktail then welcome to the roulette table!  I saw the bartender's bible come to aid in the creation of a Jack and Coke...not what you want to see.  Ordering a glass of wine was equally as disheartening.  The real problem, in my opinion, is that there isn't a manager to make sure things are running smoothly.  Most of the waiters stand in the corner and look back and forth between the impatient clients and the other waiters.  If Red Ginger makes it to 2014 I will be surprised."}
{"text":"This by far was the worst experience we had in a new restaurant. The worst waitress service even though she only had one other table to tend to. She got our order wrong so many times and when our food finally came out, it was poor quality to say the least. I can't not believe they just opened and this it's what they have to offer, I will never go back and will tell everyone I know not to go."}
{"text":"The first disclaimer I need to make is that I lived in Japan for five years and married a Japanese woman. So I know Japanese food, and I'm fully aware that the \"Japanese Grill \" type restaurant is usually not at all Japanese. I'm okay with that, I have sat at such grills in the US and had a chef entertain me while he cooked up something that has no resemblance to Japanese food, and it's tasty. And fun. So, if you like that experience and either understand or don't care that it has very little resemblance to Japanese food, this place is probably okay. I found it interesting that one of the reviewers who gave it very high marks said he didn't care for sushi. That's like going to McDonald's when you don't care for fast food. Anyway, I just sat at the sushi bar and had some appetizers and sushi. Oh, I had the daily special drinks, and they were very watered down but what do you expect for the daily special cocktail? The sushi was okay, the presentation of it was quite good and when I was there late on a Saturday night, the sushi chefs were friendly and very polite. The sushi selection is limited, and as at most \"Japanese \" restaurants in the US, the chefs were not Japanese, there were some a very common Japanese sushi items that they didn't even know about. Again, I know that's very common so I can't knock them too much for that, but it's one clear mark of a very good sushi bar when they have those special Japanese items. The appetizers were a mix of some truly Japanese items and some fusion creations. Some of them were pretty good, such as the chicken cheese roll. Nothing Japanese about it except the look, but it was tasty. So, overall nothing bad and if I was uptown with some people who for some reason wanted to have the Japanese Grill experience, I would go there I guess, but I would never choose to go there to have a good dining experience otherwise."}
{"text":"As usual the food was great, the service was not on the level we've experienced in the past however. Definitely got an eye roll from the hostess a couple of times after I approached her to explain the status of my party, and one of our two servers was extremely rushed and impolite. I have serving experience and I understand being busy but you still have to make your guest feel welcomed. I understand the stress of a large party, and may not try to do it again here, but my wife and I will be back."}
{"text":"Seafood soup is very good. Filet mignon was also very good. Quality of food excellent and very fresh. Final product could use some improvement in refining taste. Service was polite, efficient and thoughtful. Overall, definitely above average. The hibachi bar area is the place to be if you are in a party mood. Otherwise the regular table are great for quiet conversations with friends. Love the option of the mood for seating."}
{"text":"I had Saturday evening reservations for 4 for hibachi (3 adults/1 child).  Unfortunately it was St Patrick's Day and I regret taking my visiting family members anywhere Uptown that day or evening.  Totally not a family-friendly environment on the streets.  The interior of this new restaurant is very nice and a place I would like to go to often.  We were seated quickly with a bunch of younger strangers ready to party the rest of the night.  The cook/chef worked a full other table service while we waited a long time at our table for him to arrive.  I am a fan of hibachi grills and the food was good.  Not a bad serving size but a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Attention sushi lovers: The Red Ginger is guaranteed to leave you satisfied! You'll enjoy unique rolls, great service, and a peaceful ambience. I'll definitely return on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've only tried the hibachi here but it was excellent.  Well flavored and seasoned and the shrimp sauce, which in my opinion can make or break a hibachi experience, was very good.  One of my favorites places for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here for Charlotte restaurant week. For $30, you get an appetizer, a salad, soup, 2 proteins, and a dessert, which seemed like a pretty solid deal. Tried the sushi appetizer which was pretty average, and also tried the calamari appetizer which was pretty average as well.  The soup and salad got the job done, but nothing really stuck out. Salad had a ginger dressing on it.   From my experience with the 2 proteins, I had the steak and the salmon. Both were cooked fine, and they provide you with 2 sauces to dip in as well as a couple of complimentary shrimp. You get to choose fried or white rice, and also get hibachi vegetables.   The deep fried cheesecake was basically a slice of cheesecake dipped in tempura batter, and was it was quite tasty.   The place looks very modern and the ambience definitely fits it. Service was average.   Overall, this is a solid, no-frills hibachi restaurant. The food is cooked well, they put on a show, and at least from my restaurant week experience, I was very full. Although it is difficult for a hibachi restaurant to be crappy, they did a good job. I would probably go back if I was ever craving hibachi. It's not outstanding, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews, but I feel like I should warn people before coming here.   The only reason I gave this place two stars instead of one is because I came during restaurant week (unknowingly), and I know that can be hectic time for restaurants.   I had the chicken avocado for an appetizer, chicken and shrimp hibachi as an entree, and the green tea ice cream for dessert. The hibachi came with your traditional miso soup and ginger salad. It was weird because even though my fiancé and I ordered the same salad, we had different kinds if lettuce.   All the food was bland. Even the sauces with the food was bland. I feel like everything I tried I felt like it \"needed something\".   The service was awful. It took forever to get water refills and I had to ask for sauces for the hibachi twice. The only time the service picked up was when we asked for the check and dessert to go.  It was definitely not worth the money. I probably won't go back nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"I love their \"tuna pizza\" as well as several of their rolls. I have not sampled their hibachi yet. Always had fairly decent service and it is a comfortable place to dine. Prices are on par with Enso, perhaps a bit less."}
{"text":"I work in the same building and visited with my office group.  Good ambiance really good food.  Tried Hibachi grill with Chicken and Shrimp.. it was really good, a bit pricy though. I would recommended this for office parties."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other night.  Ordered a few rolls and they were delicious!  The coconut shrimp was so good too!  It's a great place if you're looking for a regular sushi spot.  They also have hibachi, which I plan on trying soon!"}
{"text":"My annoyance at being forced away from my desk to shuffle down a stairway on a sunny day for a firedrill while trying to run a meeting quickly disappeared when my coworker suggested I drop into Red Ginger to pick up some carryout on my way back into the office, solving both my need for lunch and my hatred of waiting at the elevator bank with 200 of my closest friends also returning from the firedrill.  I've never tried Red Ginger before because it always seemed too sit down/fancy. Half the restaurant is dedicated to hibachi tables Benihana style, another quarter of it is a proper sushi bar, and then there's a regular bar and table seating.  Placed my order for the shrimp hibachi combo, which at $11 included a drink, choice of soup or salad, and the usual veg and rice choices one gets with a hibachi combo. The wait was about ten minutes which passed quickly as a friend was waiting for another mutual friend in the restaurant, so she waved me over to come sit with her at her table while we both waited.  The restaurant was fairly empty at 11:15, but my order came out promptly and as soon as I saw the guy walking from the kitchen with my carryout bag, I started the brief goodbyes with my friends. By the time I'd gotten to the front door, the hostess had my bag and soda in her hands ready to give to me. Highly efficient! As a bonus, the elevator banks had cleared out too.  On to the food: There are two other places in Charlotte that I've mentioned on Yelp doing hibachi style food. The first (and least appealing) is TinTin up north by the Bank of America buildings. The second is Hasaki Grill, a little further south of my office building on the way to the BB&T ballpark. I've written them up on Yelp, their food is good.  So with those for comparison, Red Ginger is in the top 2, nearly tied with, perhaps slightly edging out Hasaki grill for ambiance in the restaurant, and flavorful food. My order came with six shrimp, a slew of rice, \"Yum Yum\" sauce and a brown ginger-based sauce. The salad came with the traditional bright-orange ginger dressing you tend to get at a hibachi restaurant. (I should know, I worked in one for a year in college.)  For me, the real edge here has to be given to the restaurant that's most convenient, which is Red Ginger. It's located right in the base of my office building and I pass that corner every day on my way home from work.  So, while I'm frustrated that I had to quickly cancel my meeting and disrupt my routine for a fire drill, I'm pleasantly full and surely headed for a mild food coma in an hour or so. I'll be keeping Red Ginger on my list for quick, nearby carry-out lunch options."}
{"text":"Looked like a nice place but not that friendly when you check in with host, our waiter was amazing but wow 14 dollars for a house wine glass???? That is abuse, never again will go back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour tonight, which is one of the best deals in Charlotte. All apps (even sushi bar apps) are 1/2 off, and Sapporo is $3.   The space is sexy but not intimate. However, it was early so the tall windows made it quite bright.    We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly. One star off because it took her a long time to make my drink, and she poured it out twice while making it. She eventually called over the manager. It was good once I got it though.   We ordered the shrimp appetizer, which is assorted nigiri. It was pretty good. We got the rock shrimp which was fried lightly with a spicy sauce. It was awesome. We also got the tuna pizza and crispy duck roll. The duck roll was wrapped in a rice wrapper and chilled. It was unexpected, but very good.   Overall, we will definitely return. The sushi was fresh and beautiful, plus we want to try the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"I visited Red Ginger for the first time after hearing a couple of good reviews. It was a complete disappointment. I ordered the lobster and \"filet mignon\" hibachi. The lobster was over-cooked and tasted like rubber tire particles. The \"filet mignon\" tasted like regular well done sirloin. The noodles were absolutely horrible and bland. And the broccoli was so little, dehydrated and pitiful. I will never return here. I ordered a chocolate martini that tasted like chlorine. Definitely not happy with this food and it doesn't deserve to be in uptown Charlotte. And then!!! There was so much smoke In the restaurant that my eyes started to burn! They don't have proper ventilation for the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"The customer service was terrible! Our waiter walked out on us and quit and we had no knowledge of that until the end of the night where our table was served water at the very beginning and that's it! the cook was great but they had no direct manager and they left all the food from the first servings on the table never came back to clean. It was just terrible"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Such friendly staff and chefs very fun and entertaining good  sushi and place for date night! Good place to come eat great for parties and groups, celebrate your birthday here and get a fried cheesecake and happy birthday song"}
{"text":"On March 18th we celebrated my mom 70th birthday and Red Ginger gave the BEST SERVICE! We we're running behind time and they Exceeded our Expectations!!! Our Cook was Brad and he made my mom feel so special! Again Thank You so Much Brad and Red Ginger Staff!!1   Caldwell Family"}
{"text":"I went with my family to enjoy dinner.  We sat at the Hibachi table looking to be entertained by the chef and watch our food be cooked while we watched. Deeply disappointed.  The Chef did not meet the expectations of entertaining with the onion volcano or flipping shrimp.  He flipped his spatula at the beginning but that was about it.  The quality of the food was just OK.  I didn't event want a togo box to take my leftovers.  No one in my family was impressed and no one will be returning.   The cocktails weren't impressive either.  All around I suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"No no no no no. The carpet floor is STICKY. the food was bland. There was a bubble in the paint on the wall that burst as we were eating and then water started pouring down the wall behind us. Two stars for the chef and the great waitress but the facilities are gross."}
{"text":"It's a absolute fun place to have yummy dinner which chef prepare just infront of you."}
{"text":"Great new lunch place for people who work uptown. Prices were reasonable. $8 for hibachi vegetable plate with rice and soup/salad. $9 for chicken hibachi. $9 for 2 sushi rolls or $11 for 3.   Ginger sauce was very good. Nothing about the meal was extraordinary for a Japanese place, but what you'd expect for a decent price.   Service is very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the cook was very entertaining. It took a long time for us to get our food and the bathrooms were not upkept. Paper towels were all over the floor and we resorted to using tissue to dry our hands. I am happy to say we didn't wait long for a table."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, great atmosphere!  I will def not be returning to this location unless they bring up their sanitation score of a 90. Thats not a score for an establishment that I will patronize."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the ambience was nice as well. The only complaint was how long it took for a cook to come over. For the night they only had 2 cooks available which slowed down service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good food, happy, friendly hibachi chefs, not very good greeters or waiters/waitresses for sushi.  We arrived with only 4 of our group. The restaurant was pretty empty, but they wouldn't seat us until \"all members of the party were present\".  So we went down the street and spent our money on drinks at another place. Once everyone arrived we went back and had dinner. The waitress didn't know the menu very well. The sushi chef was gracious and accommodated a special request to swap soy wrap for nori. Food was very good. At about 9:30 they gave us the check and said they were closing soon. Didn't even ask if we wanted dessert or anything else."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation maybe should have picked another night.  Ordered a rainbow roll and spicy tuna hand roll. The spicy tuna hand roll looked funky with some type of dry rub or something it was alright might pay for it later.  The bartender was nice to me but was rude to some other patrons, all they asked was for water and the response was it will be awhile.  Then o witnessed one of the waitresses clean a saki cup with her bare fingers and take it some customers. I should have gotten up and left.   Had my meal and it just ok, but I will never ever come here again."}
{"text":"If I were rating Japanese steakhouses i give this one a 5/5 because, unlike a typical dining experience at one of these places, the jean-short/mullet volume was extremely low.  You're not going to walk away from here dissatisfied, but you're also not going to walk away singing its praises.  I enjoyed my sushi, but I would go to Ru San's if I could only go to one sushi place in Charlotte.  Moral of the story- if you want walkable higher end hibachi in uptown Charlotte, go for it.  Otherwise- don't seek it out."}
{"text":"Hibachi in uptown Charlotte. Valet parking on MLK Blvd. Old UNO location. Your regular hibachi food - in a really cool (and redesigned) space. Waitress not good on service (no refills, generally slow) - otherwise good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Excellent experience from start to finish. The lady that made our reservation was super helpful and accommodating with our party of 10. Beautiful atmosphere, very clean, and the service and food were top notch. We had such a wonderful experience. My husband is a chef so I tend to be a bit picky, but I was beyond impressed with our Hibachi chef, Glenn. He kept us laughing the entire time and of course fed us some amazing food. We also ordered sushi and it exceeded our expectations as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"New to the Charlotte area we were looking for a place on New Years Eve for a family with two teenage girls. Watching your food prepared in front of you on a hibachi by a gimmicky chef is entertaining at their age and we wanted to start the evening off with a fun vibe. We were seated right away at the hibachi and collectively ordered the chicken, shrimp and scallop dishes. Our chef arrived and performed the same tableside shtick we have seen dozens of times before. Can these places come up with a new routine by now? Food was good, service was good, prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"We took a chance in this place and we were so glad we did! Best hibachi we've had! Chef Mario did a fantastic job of cooking steaks to perfection, adding extra touches of garlic and butter to make them over the top. Service was excellent and we look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Waitress seemed clueless, pace of meal was very rushed and groupon situation was terrible. Wouldnt bring new bill with groupon takin off and was still charged the tax of original bill and chef had no personality. Waited 30 min to get water.Ill still to driving a hr to columbia sc for Miyabi."}
{"text":"My birthday is coming up soon so I reserved my table online with my credit card as the website requested. I wanted to make sure the reservation went through so I called the restaurant. I was placed on hold when I called and then another lady picked up the phone. I asked nicely if my reservation was showing ? so I could confirm with my guest. The lady on the phone rudely said I'm busy right now and I'll call you back later. The phone was slammed down in my ear. She didn't get my name or phone number or the date of my reservation.I waited until the restaurant closed before deciding to write this review. I waited patiently to see if someone would call me back . No one reached out and I doubt I eat there for my special day. I ate at this restaurant before-but this experience ,it was very unprofessional!! Now I'm looking for a more professional restaurant to spend my money and birthday."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the first thing I notice is how trendy everything looks inside.  After being seated near the sushi bar area, I ordered from the lunch menu and got the Hibachi Steak with soup.  Had to make a change with the vegetables that came with it because I'm no fan of broccoli; no problem, I got zucchini and onion for vegetables instead.  The wait time was reasonable and my sweat tea was slightly strong, but fine.  The soup that I was served before the meal had a odd spice yet bland taste.  The Hibachi Steak was served with a good portion of surprisingly tender steak, a good serving of zucchini and onion and a very measured amount of fried rice.  The dish came with two small dishes of dipping sauces (the usual shrimp sauce and brown sauce).  The taste of the dish was good, it was what I would expect for Hibachi style and I eventually cleaned the plate.  I give it four stars.  The service was friendly and was able to make substitutions without issue; the prices were a little higher, but you do get a choice of soup or salad with the meal; and taste was good... not amazing, but it is much better than other Japanese restaurants in Charlotte that focus more on the sake and sushi while the grill suffers.  Overall, worth additional visits."}
{"text":"New restaurant in uptown Charlotte, located within the vicinity of The Green and the Bechtler museum. Upon entering the restaurant,  I'm approached with a sweet rendition of minimalistic meets modern. Half of the restaurant is plastered with earthly toned stones, complemented by applewood tables and gray chairs embellished with silver embroidery. Very simple yet so chic and classy.. just my style! I noticed a projector beside the bar so I assume Red Ginger is planning on upholding the trend of many new restaurants-restaurant by day, bar/lounge by night. There are also designated hibachi grills, if you're looking for dinner and a show.   We ordered their specialty dish, the \"Red Ginger,\" which comes with 4oz. filet mignon (cooked to your liking of course), lobster tail, shrimp, spinach and a truffle mushroom sauce. If you're aiming to please a date, this is a must order! The presentation is enough to make you drool. Close your eyes and now, imagine a castle made of a piece of filet mignon that sits over a bed of veggies. A moat of light mushroom sauce surrounds this castle with several shrimps swimming around the mignon. The lobster meat sits on top, completing the castle structure. The casting of the lobster tail acts as the turret as it hovers behind the entire plate. Mmmm.. well, now you can check out the photo I posted!   We also ordered the Wasabi Shrimp. To be honest, we were deciding between the Black Cod and the Wasabi Shrimp, but just wanted the bragging rights of ordering WASABI Shrimp! Luckily, the dish turned out to be delicious. About 8 pieces of prawn sits on a bed of string carrots. A sweet and sour wasabi sauce is drizzled over the shrimp, while maintaining the shrimp's crunchy/flaky texture. I took small bites, hoping to savor every moment. My only complaint is that I was expecting the shrimp to come with rice, veggies, etc since it was under the main entrees section. This seems more like an appetizer than an entree to me, but nonetheless I enjoyed it.   Overall, I had a great experience at Red Ginger (I'm guessing they can never serve white ginger though?). The ambiance is modern, yet simple. The staff is friendly and the food delicious. Prices range from about $12-$27, depending on what you get. It's a good place for a nice date or a special occasion. Besides, $27 is not bad at all for a castle made of filet mignon and lobster (or, you know, whatever you imagine it to be)."}
{"text":"We went to Red Ginger for a friends birthday, and it was a great experience! The cook entertained us while cooking our foods and got all of our orders correct even though everyone around the semi circle ordered different things. The servers were very attentive and fun to be around. Our party only got the cooked steakhouse side of foods, so I cannot speak about their sushi options."}
{"text":"I'll begin at the beginning... We arrived long before the rest of the party so I made sure to put our name down and found a seat at the bar. Where was the bartender? It seems he was also waiting tables? Needless to say, we waited at least 20 minutes before being asked what we wanted and by then, my order was reduced to a wine because I didn't want to chance ordering something that required actually mixing liquids together...that would've just taken longer.  Once the rest of the party arrived we were able to get seats at the hibachi tables...YEAH! PLEASE MAKE A RESERVATION IF YOU WANT TO SIT AT THE HIBACHI TABLE!   Again, we waited. Waited to be asked what we wanted. Waited to be given our soup and salads. Waited for our chef to come over. In the meantime, we watched a nearby table and the chef was so much fun! The people were having a great time. However, the chef behind him was boring. The people were just eating. There were no tricks or squirts of saki, nothing! We prayed to get the other guy. Unfortunately, he went to another table. Fortunately, we did get a fun chef. So it's a crap shoot when it comes to the chefs and how much fun you may or, may not, have. The food was ok. The lobster didn't taste fresh at all though. The filet and shrimp were fine.   In addition to our hibachi, we also ordered specialty rolls, which they forgot to bring us. We ate those for lunch the next day. Overall, I'm not running back to this place. I see why people like it, but again, the chefs make it fun and if you don't get a fun chef, it's just hibachi. Might as well sit at one of the other tables."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. I had 3 different rolls all tested the same.  Service was  very slow . Not happy ."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a review on the actual food but never even got to the point of having a server.   We got there at 7:40 and asked for seating in the general area (not at the hibachi). We were led to our table across carpet that was so sticky and dirty that it was pulling the shoes off our feet.   There were only two other tables seated at the time so it was far from busy. After 15 minutes of no acknowledgement and watching the other two tables being served by the same server, we were becoming frustrated. This was clearly our server and we didn't get as much as a glance in our direction. So I went back to the hostess and asked for a server to at least take a beverage order.   Five minutes later (20 minutes after arriving) we are still sitting with no acknowledgement and another table has been seated behind us. Within two minutes of arriving, this table was greeted with waters by a server. At this point we stood up and left. The hostess just looked and I let her know that it was because we had not been approached yet to which her response was \"oh\".   No table should have to sit for 20 minutes before even being acknowledged. I can understand being short staffed but the restaurant was not busy and watching tables be helped that arrived 20 minutes after us, in our section, was frustrating.   I would love to give the food a chance but couldn't imagine going back to have to walk across that disgusting carpet and not be served."}
{"text":"I spent my Bday dinner here. I made reservation for 4, one person was not able to attend no problem. We were seated right away. While waiting for our hibachi chef, I ordered sushi, just the way I like. Menu simple and easy to follow. The drinks were ok, nothing to rave about. I have a shellfish allergy, I informed waiter several times just to be sure. Hibachi chef hilarious, very  entertaining. He also made sure to switch utensils when cooking my chicken. Lots of laughter, fun and Sake! Free parking with validation across the street, unfortunately we didn't know until we parked on the street. Food was great, will be back."}
{"text":"It's ok, nothing bad, but it was only my first time and I unfortunately could not order every item in the menu this visit. What I do know: limited sake menu, Vivian is a great hostess, very cute bartender named Amanda, sashimi is cut weird but basic in sushi quality, the toro did not impress, the yellowtail jalapeño app was on point, the rock shrimp was worth the order, the location downtown is perfect for a pre going out meal or drink, the chicken fried rice was ok but chicken was a little tough, soft shell crab app was as it should be, and that's it. Will I go back, sure, will I be a regular, no. Enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"A group of went to celebrate family milestone. The hibachi was bland.  It took approximately 20 minutes after we ordered for our hibachi grill to start. The sushi was awesome. I think the hibachi was over priced for the quality and the portion."}
{"text":"Great location close to the office for lunch and the food was good. I would say it could use a little more flavor (salt too).  Service seemed very rushed, but I guess during lunch, many people want to get in and out. It's a little distracting when you are having a business meeting."}
{"text":"Went here for birthday dinner with my girlfriends. Maggie, the owner, was awesome. When she overheard it was my birthday, she immediately offered me a free drink! Service was attentive but not overbearing. Food was great! We had a mix of sushi and hibachi. I will definitely be back and recommend it to friends. Head to Red Ginger - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Red Ginger is close to my work and easy for a quick lunch. However after today I will NEVER be back. The manager was rude to us, we only had a table of 5. The waitress was fine, not great but not awful. But then....halfway thru our meal, a HUGE COCKROACH crawled across my co workers plate. She screamed and jumped up. No one came over to check on us. Finally a bus boy killed it with a napkin. They put her food in a box and the waitress comped her meal. Still, no sign of manager coming over to apologize. I get it, restaurants have bugs it's almost impossible to get rid of them all. But the way they handled it was terrible. Still no sign of manager or an apology. When we were about to leave the manager finally came over and snatched the to go box out off table and said \"if you don't pay you can't have food\" she wasn't planning on taking the food with her anyway, and it was extremely rude. It wasn't her fault a roach crawled across her plate."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery with Postmates for dinner. I've never been to the restaurant and it was my first time ordering. I got the filet and chicken habachi dinner. I ordered the steak rare, in anticipation it would be over cooked, but I never thought it would come well done! The chicken was also very over cooked and inedible. Such a bummer. The soup, vegetables and noodles were good. The fried rice was also good but not traditional fried rice. It looked like brown rice with a piece of cooked egg. Overall disappointing."}
{"text":"This was truly an awesome experience. This restaurant treated me like family, checking periodically on my wife and I as we awaited our seating. Once seated we were greeted with a friendly hibachi chef who had us both entertained and well fed in no time. Prices were surprisibgly affordable, especially given that Uptown Charlotte can get pricey. Portions were more than adequate with many having to take food home unable to finish the generous helpings. I was and continue to be thoroughly impressed by this establishment and will be returning frequently. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants great company, generous superbly prepared portions, at affordable rates."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food and is in a great location. The only bad thing is they seem very understaffed.  It has good seating and the noise level is not bad and yes I will say great food again.  Come and be ready to wait and wait but it is worth it"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago simply because we wanted hibachi but wanted something different rather than going to the typical Nakatos or Kabutos(helped me realize Charlotte may need more of these kind of places). I will say overall I love the set up of this restaurant because you can choose between a more intimate setting or family style in front of the grill. The pro to this place is that they give you plenty of food. However, this place wasn't my favorite and after trying the food here i wouldn't mind going back to Nakatos. First, we asked the server to recommend a good sake because the list was confusing. She recommended one based on the smell and not the actually taste but did say it was popular so we gave it a try and it was awfulllllll! It took everything in us to actually try and finish it and let's just say we were unsuccessful. Next, it was clear the chef was bored with his typical routine as he rushed through it and was ready to move on to the next table. I also ordered a sushi roll thinking it would come as an appetizer like most places do just for it not to come at all, the server never even asked if I still wanted it you could tell she was completely clueless. Luckily, my expectations weren't too high to begin with because we simply wanted a quick nice dinner but I will say there was nothing that persuaded me to return outside of maybe the cute set up but I'm sure I can find that elsewhere."}
{"text":"Crappy service. When they are busy, expect to be ignored. When they are not as busy, expect to be ignored."}
{"text":"This is one of my husband's favorite spots for lunch since he works right across the street from this place.  I really don't know why this place only got 3 stars. I almost didn't want to come because of only being a 3 stars restaurant but since my husband guaranteed the was really good I accepted the challenge. We got there around 1:15, place was not that busy and were sat right away.  They have a pretty decent menu and also some specials for the day.  The prices are regular prices, I thought it would be expensive but I was wrong.  I got a steak hibachi that comes with an option of soup or salad, however since I couldn't decide I had both.  Ginger dressing for the salad was overwhelming. Miso soup was good but I was not impressed. My steak hibachi was delicious even tho it my steak was a little bit overcooked. The fried rice was good and the veggies very flavorful.  My husband had a chicken hibachi bento box, I tried it and was pretty good.  My mother in law had the same thing as I did and her thoughts about her dish were same as mine.  Service was good, food did not take long to be served and overall the experience was good. Sometimes even when the place has not that many starts you still have to go and check it yourself and and I am glad I did."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi restaurant I have ever been to. The manager (or whoever she was) is super rude and condescending. The place has no ventilation and is very dirty. This is a health issue waiting to happen"}
{"text":"This rating is stricly for their Hibachi food. I had the Scallop and Chicken Combo. It was a pretty good deal for $14, which included a soup/salad of your choice. The ginger dressing on the salad was great! But it was Iceberg lettuce.....  The Scallops were overcooked and the chicken tough. Rice was average. Was it bad? No. But compared to Hasaki Grill or Enso, this was merely average.   I stick with my 5 Star Rating for their SUSHI. But I can't recommend them for their grill selection based upon what I just had."}
{"text":"I must say I was disappointed. I will start with what I liked about the place. The atmosphere was nice and the hostess was very friendly. They have complimentary valet parking which is a plus uptown. Our service was horrible. It took our waitress 10 minutes before she came to take our drink order (however she was very attentive to the table next to us while we just sat that) once she got out drink orders it took another 5 minutes to fill those (again lots of attention was given to the other table). After about 20 minutes we were finally able to order our food. When I finished with my soup and salad I put the plates at the end of the table to indicate I was finished. When our sushi came out the waitress just left the dirty dishes on the table. When our food came out she just pushed the empty plates to the side in order to make room for our food. I had to ask her to remove the plates we were finished with. After our food came out she never came back, my husband and I were both low on tea and I was in need of extra shrimp sauce. We had to get her attention (while she was once again at the other table) in order to get our check. Needless to say we will not be going back. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have to follow a gluten free diet and they are very accommodating. I usually get the hibachi lunch and it is always delicious."}
{"text":"Drinks were awesome, the chef could have been a little more excited to do his job though also he kept missing and breaking eggs. The shrimp, steak and chicken were over cooked.....otherwise it was good just not the best. For $100+ it should have been on point..."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for hibachi. It is always a hit with my family and out of town colleagues. Today I decided to take three of my friends to eat for lunch and we were very disappointed in the quality of service that we received. The service was so so so slow. Being on a lunch break I only had so much time. One of the sushi rolls ordered (as an app) didn't even come out till the end of the hibachi. The whole restaurant was literally moving in slow motion. We will not be back for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is one of two Asian style restaurants near the Convention Center.  Went here for lunch with co-workers.  We ordered different lunch box sets.  My eel avocado roll, smoke salmon roll  and Boston Roll were all fine.  The chicken teriyaki dish and hibachi shrimp looked ok."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the service, and the wait staff all great. The food is ok just ok, nothing to jump up and down about. The rice was burnt, along with the eggs. Our chef wasn't entertaining."}
{"text":"We came to Red Ginger with a group of 6 this past Saturday. I haven't had hibachi in Charlotte since I've lived here (in 3 years!) so I was excited to try it.  We were seated at an open hibachi grill and waited about 15 minutes for the rest of the table to fill up, but the waitress was around for drinks which was good. I got a lemon drop martini.  Very delicious and strong.   Everyone at or table ordered the hibachi, but our friends started with sushi which is buy 1 get 1 half off on Saturday. For the hibachi, all the hibachi meals come with mushroom soup, salad, rice, noodles, veggies (carrot, mushroom, broccoli, onion and zucchini and a two piece shrimp appetizer. I loved that we got both options of rice and noodles. You could even opt to get double rice or noodles if you didn't want both. For my meal I got the chicken ($16). It was flavorful and I loved the \"red\" ginger sauce they served with it. Very unique!   Overall, we had a great night at Red Ginger. It's nothing to rave about, but if I'm in the mood for hibachi and the experience I would return."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! Easy reservation system, greeted by friendly hostesses and immediately taken to our table. As a party of 6 celebrating a teenager Birthday there was never a moment where we doubted our choice. Food and service were excellent, the hibachi chef was entertaining yet efficient and birthday celebration  was short but fun. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've lived two blocks from here for the last year and finally came for dinner....I've been to all the top rated sushi places in Charlotte and this place was one of the best. I'm really surprised it only has 3 stars. Anyway, we had the Angry Bird, Amazing and American Dream rolls along with blue fun and yellowtail tuna sashimi. It was all really, really good. We used to go to Ginbu, Pisces, Room 112 and Ru San all the time...now we will definitely add Red Ginger to the rotation :)"}
{"text":"I found this place just average among comparable sushi/hibachi places, but they had a good groupon deal out there. The portions are not as big as you would expect. Also, the option to not sit around the hibachi is cool if you want your intimacy, but I recommend doing so anyway as we did not sit around the hibachi and my bf's food came out cold while mine was piping out as they brought it all at once instead of as its done. Thought the sushi was just average. Nikko is a better alternative, a bit more expensive but worth the extra dollars."}
{"text":"An upscale trendy hibachi grill located right in the middle of uptown Charlotte. The chefs are over the top and very skilled.   Great for groups, birthday parties or any special occasion. Prices aren't too high either.  If you like hibachi you'll be glad you visited Red Ginger."}
{"text":"great sushi!!!!! i didn't like sushi until i came here. get the angry bird deep fried sushi. omg so delicious"}
{"text":"Got take out and it took more than twice as long as they said it would and forgot a soup I ordered.  It was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Went here for prom dinner with my friends. The little hibachi show was kind of a flop. The waiter didn't do much and did much ~cooler~ things with other tables which I didn't understand. The sushi was equal to Harris Teeter sushi. Everything else isn't what you'd expect for the price of it. I wouldn't say to waste your time and money here when there's much more better places. The environment and seating was very nice and appealing however."}
{"text":"What a delightful find!  Delicious food, attentive and knowledgable staff, and a nice atmosphere.  The only thing keeping this place from five stars is the loud dance music playing through the restaurant.  We were visiting on business and one of our party wanted sashimi.  We ran the gamut from experienced sushi eater to novice.  The server had great suggestions for all of us.  I highly recommend the Red Ginger special if you want a cooked option.  The sushi/sashimi platter was beautifully presented and tasted great.  Highly recommend this restaurant!  But turn the music down...."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great drinks...just an all around amazing experience. I not only plan to eat there again, but would recommend it to anyone. The sushi was absolutely delectable and was only outdone by the wait staff and their never ending supply of positivity and smiles. Red Ginger is not just dinner....it's an experience unto itself."}
{"text":"I have been to the Red Ginger twice for dinner.  The second occasion I brought a client of mine.  We did not sit at the grill, but grabbed seats at the bar.  The food and service for both of us was outstanding.  Personally, I am not a sushi fan, but I loved both the chicken and steak combo dinners that I ordered.  My buddy, who IS A SUSHI FAN, loved it, and put a hell of dent in my expense account.... all good I assure you.  They have just opened, and the location seems to depend on day traffic rather than night, but I would certainly go there again and recommend it.   One small thing I liked?   As a business traveler, I liked having CNN, with close captioned, broadcast by a huge projector in the bar area.  I can just imagine how cool that will be when there are sporting events going on!     They do take out as well and have an excellent 3-fold menu.  If you are in the area, take advantage of it.  Phone:  980-819-8837  Enjoy."}
{"text":"The food was great. However, the wait was awkward due in part to some large parties which is understandable. However, once seated, it took 15 minutes for a server to come to our table even though 2 near us were just standing around. After 10 minutes we asked the hostess about it, but it still took another 5 to get a server. That was kind of frustrating as it was later in the evening and the restaurant wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Nestled away, yet prominently affixed on the corner of S. College St is this intimate spot that I, for years, had  driven past and disregarded called Red Ginger. Perhaps my basis for disregard is the fact of not really being a sushi lover, and thinking that smelly,raw fish \"delicacy, as some call it\" was all to be had there, but boy was I wrong. I had a seat near the sushi bar, and was entertained, as well as educated by the sushi chef as to the various types of sushi, both the raw fish varieties and the multitude of non fish types that could please the palate. I was introduced to several types, spicy blends that tickled my fancy to more \"traditional\" types containing favorites of mine such as multiple types of tuna, to include yellow tail tuna, etc. I was delighted with my experience here and loved this intimate setting that could definitely serve as a great date spot with that someone special (hint, hint fellows). Upon your trying this spot, take the adventurous route and not hide in the shadows, but align your self to the sushi bar and allow yourself the chance to experience the ever changing world of sushi  Save my seat Red Ginger, I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service from top to bottom. Host refused to sit us in a timely manner. She never offered an alternative to waiting longer ( I.e. Change from hibachi to dining). Management was of no help. I suggest a staff evaluation. Food was terribly disgusting. Save your time and money and do not eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Tough luck if you have a problem. The management could care less that they dropped the ball and if you complain expect to be talked over and told how it is. The waitress was fine the food was good but the management is horrible and negates the first two. My friends bento box took and hour to come out because the fryer needed to be cleaned during lunch and when he got his food the rest of us were done. When we asked for discount the manager acted like they had done nothing wrong and over talked us. Will not be going back and will be recommended to all of my coworkers to not go as well."}
{"text":"Went early on a Friday night (6:30), and it was slow but not empty. Free valet parking is always a good thing when going to dinner downtown. Interior was very nice, with a hip, urban Asian feel. Hostess was uninterested but not quite rude. My wife and I love sushi, and enjoy an occasional cheesy-but-fun hibachi night, so we decided to sit at a hibachi table, split an entree, and get some sushi as well. There were 2 other couples at our table, both were drinking and smily but not obnoxious, so it was a good social setting for date night. Got asked for drink orders immediately, and they came out quickly. I was happy to see that they had Sapporo on draft, which was icy and delicious. The server didn't offer any suggestions and seemed limited in English, but was smiley and quick so no real complaints there.  The entree we split came with soup and salad, both of which were good, and both came out together and very quickly. I had the house salad with ginger dressing, and it was one of the better ginger dressings I've had in Charlotte. Probably 5 minutes later our sushi came out. My wife's pregnant, so we couldn't get anything raw, but we got 2 rolls centered around tempura shrimp and eel, both of which were above average in quality. No complaints on the sushi.  Our hibachi chef came out within about 10 minutes of ordering our entree, and was a good performer, full of smiles and lame-but-enjoyable hibachi jokes. Did the standard \"egg roll\" and flaming onion volcano, etc. 2 things he did that you don't always find at Hibachi - he tossed pieces of partially cooked zucchini in everyone's mouths, which was a lot of fun (even though my wife was the only one who didn't catch hers. We'll need to work on that before we come back); and best of all, he went around the table squirting saki in everyone's mouths! Never seen that before, and it got a lot of laughs and appreciation at the table.  Food from hibachi was good but not particularly outstanding (except for the shrimp sauce, which would make a leather shoe taste delicious). We got steak and shrimp, both of which were cooked well. They also give you soba noodles with your entree, which you don't often get in hibachi restaurants. Between 1 entree and 2 sushi rolls, my wife and I left STUFFED. In hindsight, 1 roll would have been enough, but hey, when in Rome right?  All in all, I didn't have any complaints, had a good, fun meal for a reasonable price, and we'll most definitely be back. Would be a GREAT place to go with 6 or 8 friends for a birthday party, especially considering it's the only hibachi restaurant I know of in Charlotte between University and Tyvola. Because it wasn't particularly busy on a Friday night, I do worry that they won't stay in business, but hope that they are just going through a combination of new restaurant meets winter weather, and that their business will warm up with the weather."}
{"text":"Friendly staff , nice aroma . Perfect place for a celebration . They play upbeat music when your cake or etc comes out with a sparkler. Would love to give them the last star if I had more food . I felt the portion sizes were a bit skimp for the chicken and shrimp combo being $22 .. also It wasn't the best tasting hibachi .. didn't seem very well seasoned . Other than that it's a very nice place !   Update 3/18: this was my second time coming . The food was much better and our cook was very friendly . The host at the front that seated us was not that friendly , upon leaving I came and asked did we need to have the parking ticket to get a free validation AFTER seeing the sign . She hesitantly gave me the card . I'm like uhh thanks smh . Kindof came off as rude . Girl that was serving us , took my change without bringing it back to see if we even wanted to leave her that as tip smh ."}
{"text":"I have gone to a couple of hibachi places before but I think this place is one of the best I've been to.   STAFF When I came here, the staff were friendly. Waitress was very friendly came in frequently and checked in with us from time to time. Throughout my time there, waters were refilled without having to asked (which I highly appreciated as I was busy inhaling my entrée) However, I think the most enjoyable aspect of the night was our hibachi chef. Very sociable, cracked many jokes, very entertaining as he showed off his skills. Not one dull moment as he cooked, which is different than other hibachi chefs as I have had many experiences where they just showed off their skills but haven't talked to the group and just simply cooked.  THE MEAL What I ordered was the Steak and Salmon. Portion size is respectable. Plate is filled. The taste is amazing. Would come back for their salmon. There was leftover shrimp (he brought too much so he distributed shrimp to all of us) and the shrimp was really fresh. Hibachi entree came with rice, noodles, vegetables, and two protein of choice."}
{"text":"I visited Red Ginger with my family over the wknd, and unfortunately the experience was less than satisfactory. My salad had some sort of grainy substance in it. The rest if the food was equally as disappointing. I should have got the hint when the hotel concierge thought the place had closed down when we asked about it. The one positive experience we had was our server; he was very accommodating, and pleasant- thank you for making this experience tolerable."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our dinner this evening. Went with a group of 20 people for a surprise Birthday! 1) we could not be seated until the whole party was there- understandable- but, not much a surprise. Also, after being in the the restaurant business 15 years I understand the struggle of serving that many people. However, our party was divided in two by two servers. One side of the party was completely taken care of deserves 5 stars. Our side of the party unfortunately had a new server that could not handle it and her other responsibilities. I actually do not blame a server, I blame the management. In addition, management did not get involved until I made a scene by the hostess stand. After her involvement, we did receive a discount but, they still could not figure out all the checks for 10 ppl. Again!!!! POOR MANAGEMENT! Please know of the issues before you go!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, the service of the cook (hibachi) was not good, food was \"okay\".  Hibachi chicken and shrimp with brown rice....mushroom soup. = mediocre   Sushi = not fresh   Our cook couldn't get the orders right and that's okay however, arguing about what you wrote down is not, some jokes were uncomfortable! Telling someone fried rice is better anyway when they ordered brown is awful, and scraping food off someone's plate to put it on another's is dreadful...   If you're just looking for a quick fix you've found your place."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a million times while driving uptown and finally decided to come here.   Came here during Charlotte's Restaurant week in July and it was really good overall. You can either come here with the family/co-workers for hibachi or come here solo with a date for dinner. Inside looks really nice too. Another good thing about it, it that it seemed pretty low key and not overly crowded for a saturday night.    The food was great. I had the Red Ginger meal. Service could have been better but it was good enough.  Overall, I had a good time and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere feels pretty comfortable. Service is great, the food is decent, but this place could really need a better ventilation system. We sat pretty far away from the hibachi grill, but my clothes still stink."}
{"text":"Did not go to the hibachi table instead  sat at the sushi bar. Service was immediate and great. We Settle in and order cocktails.  Then the sushi chef presented us with a dish he had been working on. WOW! That was the way it was for the rest of the evening.  I am a sashimi fan vs shusi my friend order shusi rolls and we both could not have been more satisfied , all and all a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices . Will definitely be my go to spot when I want hibachi. Love that the parking deck is so close to everything and epicenter is walking distance. Perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"Terrible experience from start to finish.  Will not be back!  Every plate at our table was dirty.  The new \"clean\" plates than arrived with hair on them.  Glasses were dirty.  Water looked like there was slime in it.  The cook was rude and racist.  The grill vents were so dirty grease was dripping all over the table.  Vegetables tasted like lighter fluid.  Smoke was flowing straight on us to the point we couldn't breathe.  It was two people - one person did NOT eat as the situation was so bad.  The other person did eat some but when speaking to the manager she didn't listen, cut us off and only discounted the bill slightly.  We should've walked out with the dirty plates, our fault.  And the health department really needs to visit them."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and food was great! Wait staff a little hard to understand but take your time and sound things out and it all works. They made good on their offer for a free appetizer bu chking in on yelp. Definitely 4 out of 5 stars. Would have been 5 if my steak was hot."}
{"text":"Red ginger is definitely a run for your money if you want good quality food and entertainment. Definitely will be back. (Better than all other hibachi restaurants in the area)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed last visit to Red Ginger. The hostess, bar staff, and waitstaff treated my guests and I very well, as we celebrated someone's birthday. We had a party of 15 and took up two grill spaces. The chef's had a lot of energy and were very entertaining. The team also brought out the birthday cake and serving utensils.   I got to sample some sushi prior to my hibachi and it was very good. Red Ginger does the traditional Miso Soup, Salad with Ginger Dressing or Ranch, Hibaci vegetables, noodles, rice, and meat of your choosing.  The rice was okay, I enjoyed the noodles and the meat the most.  Overall the atmosphere was nice, and the location was very convenient."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite sushi spot ever! I always get the fancy salmon roll and it's just soo good!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are overpriced and not that great for the price. Very small and not at all filling. Their service is lacking and inhospitable. It's a decent spot if you are in the uptown area, but if you have the option, skip it and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite place for hibachi in uptown!  I work right across the street, but that doesn't change the fact that it's my favorite hibachi place. I call my orders in for the most part, as I know they are always busy. The staff is very nice and they always take care of me.   When I have colleagues in from other cities, we normally end up here for lunch. They always love the food too. My office caters from them on occasion as well. I've never heard any complaints or anything negative.   It's funny, I use to live near Fuji, which is their sister location and I was highly upset that I was no longer close to there, so when I found out Red Ginger is a sister location, my excitement could not be contained.  The food is so good. When I get my order, I always know I'm going to be satisfied and full. The amount of food you get is always more than enough. The sushi is great too. Just be mindful that they get busy around lunch, even with to go orders."}
{"text":"To start on a positive note, the food was very good. I ordered Hibachi Chicken and Salmon and was thoroughly satisfied. The soup and salad that was served before the meal was also up to par.    My chief complaint about this place is the poor service. Drink orders took twenty minutes to arrive, multiple servers had to come to the table to confirm orders, and the worst part was that the tip was tacked on at the end of the bill. Whether you're satisfied with the service or not, you're not going to escape that mandatory 20% tip.     This was a decent place to eat while I was in the area, but I don't think that I'll come here next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am really impressed by the lunch menu. The hibachi steak and scallop combo was delightful! I hate when hibachi places load the food with soy sauce and crappy fillers (like sugar carrots). This place had just the right amount of salt and even added fresh garlic when I asked. Great fries rice and delicious proteins. Great pricing on the sushi too!! Very nice. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Good food, good service... Nothing to really brag about. The decor was pretty cool, slick, and modern. They did validate our parking. I did set an reservations but I could get the time I wanted, but when we should up they weren't busy at all. More than half of there tables were empty. They did seat us as soon as we got there though, but the restaurant was pretty slow."}
{"text":"Pretty good hibachi. Nice people inside. Meat quality was standard. Nicely priced. Ok sushi"}
{"text":"honestly the worst service i have ever had. we were there for over 2 hours and never got our appetizer. the restaurant was not even that busy. I was extremely displeased and they showed no remorse."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  This place is fantastic...the food is great and the guys at the hibachi are courteous and highly entertaining.  Great stop for lunch too if you're in the mood for Asian or sushi.  Great drinks, great atmosphere.  Fantastic for large dinner groups too.  It's not so tough on the wallet either, considering all that you are getting...the soups are delicious and the portion sizes are very generous.  This is about as good as it gets as far as hibachi places go."}
{"text":"New sushi and hibachi spot uptown here and the biggest take away I had was the space itself.  Very sleek and sexy interiors and I liked the expansive layout of the place.  Just feels like you have plenty of elbow room, etc.  The food was on par with any other place I've been to in the same vein as this.  The sushi (wasabi roll) in particular was impressive.  One of the best rolls I've had in a while.  The hibachi chef was really friendly and the entire wait staff was great.  The biggest challenge facing this place is how to attract weekend business.  I'd guess to say the lunch crowd is solide but we ended up there on a Saturday night and it was not even half full.  I hope it picks up because I'd like to see this place stick around."}
{"text":"We frequently dine at Fuji the sister restaurant to Red Ginger however for New Years Eve we decided to head up town and check out the new location. The ambiance was great, it is very simple, chic and clean. The hibachi looked great although we are sushi junkies so we sat at a table next to the sushi bar. We ordered the sushi appetiser and the crispy duck roll to begin along with an Asahi beer each and large saki all were great and the service was wonderful. The manager came over and said hello and so did one of the chefs from the Fuji location we received a complimentary champagne cocktail which was super nice. Well then we ordered dinner , 4 rolls, the specialty Monster roll, The Empire roll ( my fav), The West Ashley roll and the American Dream roll... They were all fabulous and presented awesomely .... We tipped our sushi chef well and they sent over a spicy tuna kani pocket complimentary. For desert we had the fried cheese cake. We were over all extremely pleased with our dinner and glad we picked such a great place for a New Years meal."}
{"text":"Completely blew restaurant week. Took 2 hours for our food to come out!!!!! Would not go back.   ...despite what I said earlier I did go back for a friends birthday and the hibachi experience was great. Be warned they give a way lots of free saki. Great food and very sensitive to those with food alergies. Solid bar service too."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a conference. Since I was still recovering from jet lag, I wanted to go to a restaurant that was walkable from my hotel. I ordered take out since I planned to go to bed after dinner. My order was ready when I arrived. The hostess was very pleasant and talkative. The ambience in the restaurant was great. It was fairly empty, but I was there at 6pm. I ordered the eel and avocado roll, as well as, the Angry Bird roll. Both were amazingly delicious! I would definitely visit again if I am back in the area."}
{"text":"This review is based on the lack of service that I received just now.  I travel to Charlotte frequently on business so that means dining solo sometimes.  I hadn't eaten since noon and it was 8pm on a Monday and they were packed which hey that's fantastic and a great sign.  What wasn't great is the fact that it took ten minutes to be told I could sit down but be patient with the waiter.   I understand having to wait for service but they were badly understaffed and there were empty tables that I could have sat at.  The waiter that I was supposed to be \"patient\" with has a half empty bar and a table with three other women.  He had time to talk to them, clear dishes, and even wipe the table but he couldn't look in my direction?  I got up and left and am now eating at their competitor.  It's a shame, I wanted to try their sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent. Prices weren't great. Service was awful. There are better sushi places in uptown Charlotte. I'd check those out first."}
{"text":"I was displeased with Red Ginger.   The decor is cool and the hostess was great. She set the tone for what became a less than par experience.  My sushi roll was ok at best, but was not at all filling. I felt as if I had ordered an appetizer. I had to add an order of hibachi, which was ok at best to feel as though I had eaten. $30 dollars later (at lunch) I was full.  The waitress sucked. She was slow moving, not friendly, didn't check on us, and didn't ask how I wanted the steak cooked for the Hibachi. I was under the impression that she wasn't working for tips, because her service was that bad.  Lastly I sat at the sushi bar and was not really able to observe the sushi being created. The sushi chef's were not friendly or inviting. They need to travel to some better restaurants and take note of how to treat customers.  That will more than likely be my last visit to Red Ginger."}
{"text":"Traveling solo, I chose a seat at the bar to have a glass of wine and some sushi. The service at the bar was really good and the wine list was acceptable. I will have to say that I was not overly impressed with the sushi menu. It's limited compared to other sushi bars I've been to in Charlotte. When I asked to make a substitution in one of the rolls, they were happy to accommodate. I then ordered chicken teriyaki which was somewhat disappointing although the accompanying salad with ginger dressing was very fresh, crisp and flavorful.   Red Ginger: best part was service, food was OK but not exceptional, sushi menu limited."}
{"text":"THE WORST! A group of us came for my friends birthday and we ended up very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, our hibachi cook was amazing and made us laugh while we watched our food cook. By the time he left and we just started eating, the waiters were already rushing us by giving us our to-go boxes and checks. On top of that, my waitress messed up our checks more than twice which was very unprofessional even though we told her beforehand how our checks were separated and her comment was \"Yes, this is gonna help me later on. Thank you.\"  Help? I think it made it worse for you sweetheart. The food was average and I'm not saying that because we had a bad experience, overall we weren't as satisfied as I thought. Also, before we were seated we handed them an expensive ice cream cake and by the time they gave it back to us it was melted. They said it was kept in a \"cooler\" but the box was no where near cold. I'm a little confused? I wouldn't recommend coming back again. Neither my friends."}
{"text":"After arriving at 7:20 for our 7:30 reservation, we were asked to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Then, again and again and again we were told the table was almost ready. Finally, we were seated at 8:35. Then another 15 minutes without a single visit from a server or a drop of water. We departed. Busy day, St Pattys, I get it, but not an excuse for wasting 90 minutes of 4 persons' lives."}
{"text":"I will not be coming back here! A whole lot of energy spent on making the food look good instead of tasting good! Nasty, watered down sushi!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The kids and I love it. This was one of the Charlotte Restaurant week participating restaurant. Kids ordered the sushi entree the amazing rolls was awesome and the duck rolls for appetizer was good also. The only thing bad was the waiter that we had was a little slow, his co worker was helping us most of the time instead."}
{"text":"Came back for meeting after new year, the resturant is still awesome like the last time I had it few months ago. The staffs are fast with their food, wine selection is still great. They had no problem getting my orders. I love the sports bar and of course the HOT asian receptionist who helped me with my table."}
{"text":"We came here for Restaurant Week and we're really excited about the menu. However, from the moment we arrived, we felt completely rushed by the server. He kept trying to take our drink and meal orders before our party could even sit down. The restaurant week menu was supposed to include an appetizer, main course and dessert. We did not receive our appetizers until after we had all finished our meals. Our server then got some of our orders wrong.    The hibachi chef had a serious attitude and did not do very much of the entertainment that you would expect at a hibachi restaurant. We thought it was just him, but we watched him put on a fabulous show for the next party at another table. He even had balloon animals for the little girl at that table while my young daughter did not.   When we gave feedback to the manager, just like our server, she kept interrupting and rushing us too!  By the time we got to speak with her, no one even wanted dessert, especially when we were then told that they were out of some of the options. We had to go back and forth with the manager to get any type of remedy.   All in all, the food was really good, but the service was horrible and it seemed they were not prepared for the volume of orders during Restaurant Week. They could also use some training for their staff in customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in while traveling to Charlotte to grab some takeout.  The restaurant is typical Japanese Steakhouse, I ordered the M16 roll and the Tom Yum soup.  The roll was tasty and well prepared.  The soup was less than amazing.  It had no flavor and was very bland.  I would probably go again for more sushi or some Hibachi."}
{"text":"The reason I like this place is the mere fact that there is someone cooking for me, in front of me, and I get to watch the show and enjoy some good hibachi. It's hard to compare these to the various hibachi places around town, because this is a favorite category of mine anyway.  The group atmosphere is a must with friends, and the Saki waterfall is a competition among good friends.  If the other grill spots were closer, I'm not sure I would still stop coming to Red Ginger, however the others would get a fair share of my presence.  This one is the closest to me, but I'll still drive for the others away from uptown."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time on lunch yesterday (9/22/15).  Overall, it was just \"OK\".  The ambiance inside was very very nice, but the food didn't really impress me, especially for the cost.  I had the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento box, Served with Miso Soup, Fried Shumai, California Roll, Fried Rice and Seasonal Fruit.  The Shumai was ok.  It didn't have any great flavor to write home about, just basically a fried dumpling.  The Miso soup was fine, but let's be honest, it would be hard to screw up Miso soup.  The California roll was 4 pieces and pretty weak.  I would say the California Rolls you get at Harris teeter are better.  The Fried rice had a good flavor and good chunks of fried egg, so no complaint there.  The Chicken Teriyaki came with snow pea pods.  Overall, it was just \"ok.\"  I know it's not the best description, but I guess that is my point, the flavor was like any other bland Teriyaki chicken you have had a 1,000 times before.  The seasonal fruit was 2 slices or orange.   My wife went with the 3 sushi roll combo.  6 pieces in each roll.  Again, the rolls were not better than what I can find in the grocery store and honestly, one was loaded up with way too much cream cheese, to the point my wife had to take some out.    I ate there because I had a coupon.  But I would say, I doubt I will try it again (not without a much better coupon)."}
{"text":"Came here for sushi on my first night in Charlotte. The price was a bit high. The best sushi was West Ashley.  I've been here for the Teppan a long time ago and it was ok. I also like the beef and asparagus for appetizer."}
{"text":"Food was good and chef was amazingly entertaining.  Very nice atmosphere. The only issues we had was the shrimp appetizer was forgotten, my fiancé had veggies in his rice and noodles after asking for no veggies, and parking validation is only a $5 comp. We were there for about an hour and a half which is average timing for dinner. The charge for parking was $8 and once we used our validation card we were charged $3."}
{"text":"I found this place to be friendly, clean, and the sushi was pretty good. The waitress was engaging and made a solid recommendation as I wasn't sure what I wanted but explained something that I had in the past. It wasn't too busy so the service was fine.  I was surprised at some of the negative posts and it is possible some people have a bad day. This is far better than the other 2 sushi places I are in uptown charlotte."}
{"text":"Best hibachi I've ever had. The filet and fried rice were melt in your mouth delicious!"}
{"text":"Red Ginger Charlotte, NC __   Service was entertaining.    Food quality and presentation was great.    Ambience was great.   I'll be back but not at the top of my list.   Being from southwest Louisiana, it is hard for me to rate restaurants as everyone back home cooks so well.  I take that in mind when I rate restaurants.   I give each star a meaning: The first is for service... The second is for food quality and presentation... The third is for ambience... The fourth and fifth are for any exceptional qualities of the other three..."}
{"text":"So amazingly enough I've been here two separate times - but for the same occasion:  a friend's birthday dinner.  Since my visits were literally separated by a year, it's good to see that this place has staying power.  Located in Uptown, it is definitely an experience to go eat here.  Both birthday dinner times were with a large crowd 8-10 and we had reservations.  Once everyone arrived, we were promptly sat at our table and the servers got our drink orders and food orders.  The chef/entertainer comes out and confirms all our orders and then starts cooking right in front of us.  I'm a sucker for showmanship, but the chefs pull out all the tricks:  flaming onion volcano, fake ketchup bottle squirting, etc.  Probably the funnest thing is when the chef offers everyone some sake and proceeds to squirt the sake in peoples mouths until they had enough.  This latest visit was the entire table catching broccoli in their mouths...  Good times -  The staff are really good here keeping your drinks flowing and catering to your needs.  I'd say its a solid \"birthday dinner place.\""}
{"text":"Red Ginger is a trendy Japanese restaurant in Uptown Charlotte.  There is a sushi bar, hibachi grills and regular menu featuring bento options and other Japanese specialties.  My party sat in the bar area which is right inside the door.  I didn't understand the 3 seater bar tables.  Isn't 3 considered a crowd?  You'd think 4 would be more acceptable.  Also the music was way too loud.    For food, I started out with the Rock Shrimp which was actually quite good.  The sauce was a combo of sweet and spicy and it came with several shrimp.   For a meal I went with the Maki B sushi combo which came with spicy tuna, salmon and eel.  It also came with miso soup and a salad.   The soup and salad were quite Meh.  The soup was so salty and it wasn't even a soup, it was more of a broth with 2 pieces of miso and tiny slices of scallion.  The salad wasn't much better - iceberg lettuce, a grape tomato, slice of cucumber and a ginger dressing that tasted more like thousand island.    The sushi was decent but I thought it was overpriced.  For bar selections, they do have a few craft beer draft selections but nothing local.  Too bad.    Service wise, we were served by the bartender who we had to call over each time we needed something.  Other than that, food came out quickly.     I don't know if this is worth my time for a repeat visit.  I think there are better sushi places in Charlotte.  But perhaps, I'll try them sometime for the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, delicious food, great price.  Will come back for sure. Our chef wasn't that creative on the hibachi table, but that was fine.   Child friendly."}
{"text":"Great place.  Wonderful Valentine's Day special.  Great choice of hibashi style seating, individual tables, and nice bar area."}
{"text":"Where do I start about this place? Their food is to die for and the service is great. I sit at the hibachi table every single time I come because the hibachi chefs are really entertaining and nice. They cook the food perfectly and the fried rice is some of the best I've ever had. It gets a little busy around lunch during the week so be prepared for a little bit of a wait. But it's also great during lunch because the prices are substantially lower and the food is just as good. Definitely recommend coming here. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for lunch.  Nice Decor and they have patio seating.  The bartender was a very nice lady.  Unfortunately her soda taps needed to be changed out as my soda was flat & another one was out completely, so she had to keep going to the waiter station for refills.  Hallelujah - they have Pepsi products!    Sweetie got the Shrimp with Fried Rice and Veggies.  The Shrimp weren't fresh & were over cooked.  The rice was o.k.  The veggies was mostly zucchini strips. Meh.  I got the Sashimi Lunch.  It was supposed to have 9 pieces, but came out with only 5 (which is the number on the Sushi Lunch).  They quickly brought the rest of the pieces.  Not a big variety, though.  Only 3 different ones...Tuna, Salmon & a whitefish.  I requested that I not get the Eel or Octopus, so thankfully, I didn't get those.  It was a pretty presentation & it was fresh.  Once you've got fresh down on sashimi, you usually can't go wrong.  They played an odd muzak mix of lounge-type tunes.  At least it wasn't '80's music.  It was convenient, and I'd go again for the sashimi, but probably not the other plates."}
{"text":"I must say that I was disappointed not in the food, but in the service I received while attending Red Ginger with my girlfriend for a belated Valentines Day celebration. Our waitress was very much not about making our experience enjoyable or special but more so concerned with bringing food out and getting us in and out. Not once did she check on us during our time in the restaurant and when we thought we wanted to have dessert, she never actually asked and instead brought us the check. This was before we even finished our wine and actually had time to digest our entree. This was not how I remembered Red Ginger, given my first experience and I hope that I don't have this experience again-- given the premium we pay for the food."}
{"text":"i hate this place and they are a complete rip off. i ordered lunch here . i got the bento box and requested a california roll with my order as it states on the menu the lady who took my order charged me for an additional cali roll my total came out to be $16+ for lunch when it should've been like $10ish . my food was sub par and my sushi roll was terrible fishy and not fresh !!!!  my chicken i was trash and tough . i called and asked for a manager to request a refund . the manager took my card info and said they would refund she ended up charging me again so in total i paid them $26+ for horrible food."}
{"text":"We have been back to Red Ginger twice now, and have had outstanding sushi. The tuna hamachi appetizer is super fresh and light with just a hint of heat from the jalapeño. We also tried the tuna tataki that bursts with flavor.  Most of the rolls are a good size and have a nice fresh flavor, not overly seasoned with spicy mayo or heavily breaded. Be sure to sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chef is very knowledgeable and made some great recommendations!  We haven't had a chance to try anything on the hibachi side, but look forward to going back again! Staff is super friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I wish the owner would take a moment to read the reviews and get rid of the rude woman answering the phone. I literally cancelled my reservation because I could not get over the treatment I got when I called to reserve a table, she acted like she was doing me a huge favor by accommodating a table for us.  I've been here before and the food is not that great so I can find better hibachi at any other Japanese restaurant where they have more appreciation for clients. I would not spend a penny in this place."}
{"text":"I have been traveling to Charlotte for extended period time for work, this has become my go to place for dinner. Great selection for both sushi and hot dishes. I have been here for lunch as well, very reasonable price for the quality of food. Be sure to ask the owner for recommendations!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a nice covered outdoor patio. You can opt to have your food prepared at live hibachi tables or standard tables.  Our party of 8 were seated promptly and our chef appeared after we placed our order. There were no kids menus that were presented but we made do with ordering hibachi sides. I decided to just order specialty sushi rolls. After the live cooking show and everyone had almost finished eating, my rolls still never showed up. After we asked the waitress where they were, she said they were backed up and they were getting ready to make them. I declined and canceled the order. I think our waitress forgot to put the order in. She still received 20% of our check even though her service was less than stellar."}
{"text":"Horrible seevice! Haven't seen our server in over an hour. Had to get our own drinks. Food was super bland.  Manager was struggling,  wouldn't deliver a beer. Said we should see are server soon. Never happened.  Thought we were being punked. Order sushi and never saw it. Appetizers never came out. We have worked in the industry and can be very understanding and forgiving. This was a waste of time and money.    Oooh  wait here she no apologies, but free drinks from a table that walked out. Act surprised!"}
{"text":"They stole my sunglasses!  Left them on the table on accident and called back the next morning.... \"sorry.... we didn't find any sunglasses\"..... will not come back!!!"}
{"text":"There's just something about a onion volcano on fire that brings out the kid in all of us.   I've been here a few times now for birthday celebration type dinners. Rule #1 at Red Ginger: make sure you get everyone in your party here at the same time. They won't sit a partial party at the hibachi tables. And do you blame them? How fair is it to sit you down when half your group is late? So, don't be a dick and complain about that.  Get your phone ready to video: the chef has a squirt bottle of sake and goes around the table to anyone who will take it. He won't stop until you wave your hand when you've had enough (I've tried every way to write this sentence and make it sound as least dirty as possible). I always get hibachi shrimp. I like that they give you both rice and noodles here. For birthdays, they blast music and the lights start flashing when they are bringing out the dessert (complete with a sparkler).   Different specials throughout the week- Wednesday is half price bottles of wine, Friday and Saturday special sushi rolls are BOGO. Gratuity is added to larger parties, so just make sure to pay attention to your tab. They offer free parking in the Two Wells Fargo deck across the street on the weekends and also on week days after 5pm."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fantastic experience we had celebrating a friends birthday! The food was amazing on the habachi and I will try the sushi next! They make birthdays lots of fun with sake shots and firecracker fried cheese cake! I will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"The food is the best part about his place. The service and the hibachi chefs are okay at best. Our server was nice but didn't understand English well enough for her position. My wife and I have run across this challenge in the past here as well. Also, the hibachi chefs are inconsistent. Some of them simply are sick of the same old same old. Hopefully management can inspire them to make every performance great! Lastly the hostess sat my wife and I at a hibachi table but after we ordered they said they wouldn't cook for us unless others showed up, this is after they already took and served us our drink order. We ended up trying to communicate with the server on how much we needed to order to have someone  cook for us. After 10 minutes of back and fourth other guests showed up to dine with us. Lastly, the food is really good and for this reason I'll be back. Hopefully management can correct the rest of the clear issues."}
{"text":"The food is good. I got D.15, which was an order of pork dumplings. It was just okay, nothing special. Seemed overpriced for being $8, nothing mind-blowing. The menu is very simplified and \"Americanized,\" so I can understand the appeal. But personally, there is better, more authentic Chinese food for cheaper than here."}
{"text":"red ginger pros: looks amazing the interior work and design of the place to dine is on point.  the bar looks great for a sports enthusiast and the staff is friendly.  red ginger cons: the food was ok at best we order for an app chicken avocado. that's all it was for $7 I'll pass. Next we ordered the bento box I order chicken teriyaki with brown rice. the chicken was over cooked and more flavor could have been put into the meal.  The music selection while your eating is way too loud it sounds like a club for what you can hear on the radio.  this place has great potential just hire a kitchen staff who can bring more to the table."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night for a friends birthday. The owner flagged  my boyfriend and I down while walking Uptown, and told us all about her restaurant. One great thing is that there is free valet on the weekends, which was an automatic plus.  They have hibachi seating and regular table seating. For a Friday night it was empty, very empty. The prices are pretty low, dinner hibachi starts about $17 which is cheap for an Uptown dinner. Their drinks weren't good but that can depend on the bartender. The food was very good. I got the lobster and steak hibachi, it starts off with a salad and miso soup.   I would like to visit and try out their sushi. Monday and Thursdays are buy one roll get on free."}
{"text":"This place is great! Melanie was our waitress, she is awesome. On Saturday and Sunday they have buy one sushi roll, get one half off. The M16 and the out of control rolls are the BEST. We tried going to room 112 ( a sushi place down the road)and they were SO snobby. Red ginger sat us right away and the food was amazing! Get the spicy mayo on the side :) it's delicious!"}
{"text":"We came for restaurant week to try it out. Overall was good but not really a better deal for restaurant week. I'd stick to the more expensive places for that. We sat at the hibachi table and overall the waitress was pretty good and attentive. I got the pork goyza and my husband got sashimi. He said it was very fresh and the goyza was good but nothing better than of changs. We both got hibachi which is a large portion. I'm allergic to shell fish so the chef was super careful and cooked my meat first which was nice of them. The hibachi was pretty good and cooked well. The deal included dessert too and he got fried bananas and I got fried ice cream... Definitely their downfall it was horrible. The bananas had zero taste other than oil. The fried part of the ice cream was not done and the ice cream was gritty like it was in the freezer for a year. Don't ever get dessert there!!! It was gross we left it there after one bite. Overall ok but wasn't impressed for the cost."}
{"text":"My rating is 4.5 stars.   After taking in The Most Incredible Thing, a ballet at Knight Theater, it was just past 16:00. My friends and I were hungry, as we hadn't had lunch.  I did a search on my Yelp app. We headed over to Red Ginger, which is right across from the venue. It specializes in both sushi, sashimi, and teppanyaki (Americans refer to it as hibachi).  I ordered the scallops and chicken teppanyaki. It comes with fried noodles and fried rice. Wow! Normally, you are asked whether you want one or the other. My order also came with shrimp. I thought that it was a mistake that I was given shrimp. Again, it was completely unexpected.  What was expected? I got mushroom and onion soup, and miso ginger salad with my meal. I also ordered a Diet Coke. You do get refills.  I first sat in-between both my friends. However, my left-handed friend was to my right. Bumping into each other while eating would have  been annoying, as I am right-handed. I moved to her right. I lucked out. Whenever our chef had an abundance of food cooked on the teppanyaki grill, I would get it. Yay, me!  Our chef was entertaining. As expected, he created a flaming onion volcano. Naturally, I captured it on my phone, because that's who I am.  The food was tasty. This place is exceptionally generous with portions. I loved all of it.   My friends and I were hungry. We were quiet having our soup and salad. Both were delicious and immediately stopped our hunger pangs.  The chicken was tender and perfectly done. The scallops were juicy and perfect, as were the shrimp. I loved the fried noodles and rice. I was also glad that the veggies did not have zucchini. I ate everything!  The only point that prevents me from giving this place a perfect rating is service. When we first walked in, the restaurant wasn't busy. Two women were standing there. It took one of them nearly a minute to come over and seat us. Weird.  I paid for all of us and asked for the bill. The bill didn't take much time. However, it took just under ten minutes for the server to fetch my credit card to settle the bill.  Other than that detail, I had a good time here. It can run a bit on the expensive side, but you get more food than you expect at a teppanyaki place.  (138)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The little soup and salad you get as a starter is very good, basic but good, and their selection of sushi rolls was more than expected. We started off with the out of control roll and wanted a second. They also had wine specials and we had a great bottle of cab for under $30. The habachi was very good and our chef was hilarious. It ended up being a very nice date night although completely unexpected, I had just read a book mentioning a Japanese steakhouse and wanted to try and I am so glad we did."}
{"text":"In from out of town and sat at the bar to eat sushi. I had the recommended Green Devil Roll and it was amazing. Good flavor with a kick. I will come here again next time I am staying in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week and overall it was really good. We made a reservation and did get seated after walk ins arrived after us, which was frustrating. They also forgot to deliver our soups and salads. The sushi was very good and they have really good happy hour deals on Fridays as well. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for a bachelorette party, I had the pleasure of dining at Red Ginger one night! We were there for sushi, so we didn't go for the large hibachi table on the far side of the restaurant. The hibachi side was poppin' though, which made our table service a bit slow. Our server was friendly and smiled at us though and the food MORE than made up for any service delay, which is something I'm usually hard pressed to say. I had two rolls, both with spicy tuna (my fave of all faves). It was excellent. Like, really really excellent. I am from Florida and live in Alaska, two places known for their epic fish dishes, and I have eaten sushi since I was 8 years old (my dad would give me salmon sashimi saying \"it tastes like butter\"). I have had a lot of great sushi on both coasts, but Red Ginger is definitely on the short list. I am considering driving the 2 hrs from Asheville to go to Red Ginger again on this trip to the lower 48, though, because it was THAT good."}
{"text":"Service - Straightforward but not amazing.  Reservations- Taken but definitely not needed.  Dead for a Sunday night.  Food - Satisfies the craving but no wow factor. 1. Yaki Udon - Good dish to fill up on. 2. Crispy Duck Roll - Small portions and skimpy on the ingredients.  Wouldn't order again. 3.  Rolls - We ordered several different rolls.  Fish was okay."}
{"text":"you can go hibachi style where you will done with other guest or you can have a intimate dinner between you and your friends. the menu is on line the drinks are good. My friends birthday was the day we checked in the music changed to techno and they came out with a desert that none of us told them to do. they were very considerate when we made the reservation they noted it was a birthday party."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time. I was invited by a friend to celebrate her birthday. For the prices you would expect a welcoming experience, and excellent customer service. However, this restaurant offered neither. To begin, our reservation was for 7 pm. We arrived at 6:15. I went to the bathroom, & when I returned I asked the people in my party did they tell the hostess about the reservation, the hostess then said (as I wasn't talking to her) the reservation is at 7, like it was a problem that we arrived early. That may have been the case, but I am used to a nicer tone. We then get to the table, the waitress did not take her time, argued with one person in our party that I said that I was allergic to shrimp only, when I clearly said that I had a shrimp  and mushroom allergy, of which she wrote down in her note pad before she left the table. In addition, The food was just ok. It was not like what I've experienced in the Winston Salem area (cheaper & better)?.  To top off the rudeness, and the ok food, the prices were steep, and any party over 6 has an automatic gratuity of 20% added to the total...meaning after taxes. 20% gratuity added to a bill should be because of beyond excellent service. The service did not match the amount paid at all. Let's not talk about the other waitress that rolled her eyes as she turned around from the other table, as they appeared, judging by her gestures, to be getting on her nerves. Finally, As we were leaving, I asked the hostess where to write a review, and she said \"yelp, why were we bad\" I wonder why that was the first thing she said, instead of thinking positive about the restaurant. This is a privately owned restaurant. I no because I asked the waitress was this restaurant a franchise, she said no, it has a private owner. To sum it all up. I felt this restaurant was very ghetto, rude, not worth the money, and not worth returning too. The most positive thing here was that this restaurant has free parking."}
{"text":"They accommodated 30 People for us on a short notice. They service was very good and we enjoyed ourselves. The food was fresh cooked to perfection and very good. We plan to return as a group in the near future. Thanks Red Ginger for you service and accommodation."}
{"text":"I had the seafood deluxe , it was good but the garlic is too heavy. Over all it was good. I like their ginger sauce. Our chef was nice."}
{"text":"Well done! We had a group of 8 and 1 person had some food allergies. The chef came out and explained how the food will be cooked in the back for her. Most places don't understand the situation and still cook things on the same grill or in the same pan. Her meal was cooked exactly how she wanted it, separately to avoid any contamination. This was exactly what we were looking for and we will be back.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"So lets talk about this \"NASTY UNSANITARY RESTAURANT\"! On Saturday 11/11/17. I went with a group to eat here.  Less than 60 seconds after sitting down, another group member screams only to see a a roach just running across the table, manager comes over asking \"where is it, wheres the roach\".  Finally finds it hiding under a plate and proceed to take the menu- with both hands slams the roach with it, wipes table with a dry-cloth and walks away, never said sorry not one damn thing!.  Some choose to stay, but I had to leave.  That was gross.  They don't even deserve a star! Hey management! if you happen to have a random health inspection, don't worry its because I CALLED THEM!  You don't appreciate your patrons you shouldn't stay OPEN!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I been to this place yet?!?  No really, what a shame because it's so much fun!!  We had to take two cabs to get everyone there and we were the first arrive.  They wouldn't seat us until we had everyone in our party...makes sense.  Our chef was the highlight of the evening!  He had fun jokes, cool tricks and the sake in the squirt bottle...OMG! We all took a turn and sadly...one of our friends took one too many turns.  LOL!  I ordered the steak and chicken and as expected it was delicious.  My friend ordered the steak and lobster and let me try it...that is what I'll be ordering next time!  As far as the atmosphere, it was clean, appropriately lit and everyone was very friendly. I'll be making my second visit very soon! Thanks Red Ginger for a great night out with the friends."}
{"text":"I had so many high hopes for this place. However, our chef apparently was not feeling it today. This was reflected in the fact every time he had extra servings, he gave it to the young blonde on the other side, and he overcooked the shrimp, lobster, and scallops. Even my filet was over cooked. Then the real deal breaker was the fact that he forgot my husband's side of chicken. When pointing it out to the chef, he was like what...with an attitude. We asked for a manager, we got the hostess. She offered to have it cooked in the back, but at this point I don't want them to cook nothing else for me. Even the miso soup was watered-down. The real manager came over and asked if he could treat us to a dessert. After telling him that our Father's day experience was ruined and that I'm a yelper, he took the ticket and gave us a 20% discount and a $10 gift card (with an expiration date & limited to dinner only). Um yeah dude, if that's your version of customer service...you could have kept that card. Our server was good...cleared dishes promptly & kept the drinks filled. He's the only reason I left any part of a tip. I don't see myself coming back. Hard to support a place that doesn't seem like appreciate my money. If you can't get decent service when you order the most expensive thing on the menu, why would I come back to use this card? Good luck with this place, but I'd rather go to Kabutos where at least the portions are larger and cooked better."}
{"text":"We lived two blocks from Red Ginger for two years and moving away has been quite a bummer! We usually ate here once every week or two and now we only make it in once every month or two. The food is delicious. Some of the chefs are better than others, and our favorite moved and is no longer there. It is a bit pricey, but honestly, worth it. Definitely make a reservation online because you may not get a seat at the grill if you do not have a reservation. Also, you can park right across the street and get your parking validated! Don't forget your ticket when you go inside. Amelie's is right across the street and only a few blocks to the Epicenter or TWC Arena! Perfect date night."}
{"text":"Where do I even began with this place. For starters we had a party of 14 for my daughters birthday. This reservation was placwd a month in advance. We arrived 30 minutes early to be told there's a party who isn't ready to leave. At one point the hostess with the disfigured hand told us to have thw kids share a seat until the other party leaves...I was baffled by this suggestion of discomfort and absurdity. We wasn't seated until about an hour later. No apology or even speed with service to make up for lost time. We them waited another 30 for drinks orders. Long story short to have spent over 700 dollars in one seating we was displeased. To only leave the restaurant on my daughters birthday to our entire party with good poisoning.. What a f×××ing night. Could you just imagine having family from out of town sick and an emergency room full of kids crying. That following day I managed to call the restaurant and tried to explain what had happened they rudely rusjed me off the phone. Bit luckily the hospital cared enough to send a report to health department since it was a large bumber of us sick that night. ... Never again will I eat here"}
{"text":"Very limited selection of not so fresh sushi. Maybe I broke the rule of no fish on Mondays. Asked chef for recommendation and he struggled to suggest, \"Umm, salmon maybe\". I won't be back."}
{"text":"The location is fantastic in uptown and they validate parking!!  At first glance you will notice a regular seating area then in the back, there are group tables for the \"cook in front of you\" experience.  While eating there, the staff gave a 16 year old boy a birthday treat to celebrate his birthday.  What a fantastic gesture with nothing to gain from it. The food was amazing and freshly prepared at the table. The chef was full of appropriate humor at all times and have generous portions of food to each guest. The restaurant is very clean and so were the bathrooms.  Although, I would avoid using coupons or even Yelp check-in rewards here.  The waitress took my phone to the kitchen with her to figure out how to use the Yelp Check-in free appetizer reward.  That kind of made me nervous.  All-in-all, great time, great food, and a great staff."}
{"text":"Gave it a second chance but won't go back. We simply ordered takeout and they said 10 minutes. We waited 27 minutes and were never offered an explanation or a even a simple glass of water.   When they finally brought our food they apologized and said the tempura shrimp for one of our sushi rolls delayed the order. We got it home in 5 minutes and it was obvious that everything else was cooked right away and sat waiting for the tempura shrimp. It was cold and the salmon had hardened.   Nice people and the sushi was okay but the execution is extremely lacking."}
{"text":"My friends and I hate here (party of 9) last week during restaurant week.  Most of us just ended up ordering off the menu because the fixed menu included some appetizers choices and dessert choices that didn't seem worth the $30 price tag.  I ordered the teriyaki salmon and shrimp with brown rice.  It was very good.  Everyone liked their food, although a tad pricey (expect to drop $20 per person not including drinks here).  The staff was friendly and the hibachi chefs are always entertaining.  I would eat here again, but didn't give it 5 stars because at this price point for me to give out 5 stars, I would have to be blown away.  I also surveyed my friends and everyone agreed they would rate it 4 out of 5 based on all factors of service, food, and price."}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all to get dinner on a week night.  We ended up sitting outside as the weather was pretty decent and not too hot yet.  The hostess was friendly and we were seated outside without issue.  Our server came to our table and took our drink order promptly.  After our drinks were delivered, our sushi dinner order was taken.  We ordered a Godzilla Roll, a Rock and Roll, and an M16 Roll.  A reasonable time later, our sushi was delivered promptly and friendly.  Food quality-wise, the rolls were fantastic!  I tend to think of myself as a sushi aficionado and the rolls we ordered were as described and tasted even better.  The best part of our experience was our server was not over-bearing.  We drank; we ate; we talked; we were never interrupted or pressured by our server.  Visiting Charlotte was a rare occasion but if I ever find myself near Red Ginger again, I would eat there again without hesitation!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch order To Go recently. I ordered the Sushi & Sashimi Lunch Special which comes with 4 pieces of Sushi (Nigiri), 4 pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll and your choice of Soup or Salad. The sushi was okay, but I have had better. I would say the salmon and halibut were the best. As for the salad, fresh lettuce, but the ginger sauce was definitely not my favorite. Ended up eating it without the dressing because it just had a horrible taste. I also ordered a cup of the Clear Soup, which was pretty bland compared to other Hibachi restaurants. Overall, it was decent but not sure I would choose the Sushi and Sashimi lunch special again, as they do have several lunch options."}
{"text":"I went there on prom night. It was a great experience chef was very nice and friendly and food was good until a roach crawled on the table and the waitress killed it within 5 in. of my plate n just threw it in the trash like it was perfectly fine and normal .. couldnt eat anymore after that and wont be eating there again"}
{"text":"I would say this place is just your average hibachi restaurant. There's nothing that wow'd me, nothing that really stood out. The food is good and the price is reasonable compared to the other hibachi restaurants. The service was okay, no one was really that friendly.. I mean really, I've encountered nicer employees working the Starbucks morning rush! There are far better hibachi places in the Charlotte area. So unless you're immediately Uptown and don't want to venture out, I'd suggest going somewhere that's far more worth your money."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, and the wait staff was pleasant. Would go back if I'm in the Charlotte area again."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi restaurant in Charlotte. The staff members are extremely rude. Their level of professionalism is very low. I am not sure how this establishment is still open. It's dirty, cheap, and disappointing. Such a shame, I did not think you could mess up hibachi this bad."}
{"text":"The service was disappointing.  The waitress took 20 minutes to take our order.  We ordered steamed shumai and she brought fried.  She brought a bowl of edamame that we didn't order. Took me having to flag her down before she refilled water/tea.  No eye contact with us or a 'thank you' when she dropped off the bill.  I think the root cause is having waitresses cover both the hibachi grill area (where there are a good 10+ people) AND the dining tables.  Sushi was just average.  I've had better at a lower cost."}
{"text":"Not bad, but also not great. The atmosphere and vibe are very comfortable. I really appreciated the lounge feel. But it's not a very busy place, I think I know why.  We ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer. Wasn't mind blowing, but was still good. The miso soup was also decent along with the salad. They weren't bad, just didn't leave a memorable impression.  My husband ordered the seafood delight I think was its name. His lobster was very tough and initially unidentifiable. I ordered the fillet and shrimp hibachi dinner combo. The fillet was actually really good. Cooked and seasoned well. Unfortunately, my shrimp was way over cooked and way under seasoned. My noodles were a little bland as were my vegetables and fried rice.   Honestly, the place could be a real uptown sensation with just a few improvements in my opinion. Better seasoning and shorter cook times on the seafood. Other than that, it wasn't bad. Service was pretty decent. I couldn't drink any water because my first glass had this white substance stuck to the inside with stuff floating inside it. I asked for another glass and that one was in the same condition.  They gave us a coupon for our next visit. Not sure if I will return"}
{"text":"I used to work in the WF3 building, but had never experienced dinner here and after visiting over the past weekend (Saturday 11/12), I still did not enjoy the experience of actually eating. (Honestly, I no longer care to do so.)   A friend of mine arrived 4 minutes before us to ask for hibachi seating for a party of 4. The hostess was very blunt (borderline rude) and advised that since there wasn't a reservation, we (myself, plus 1) would need to arrive immediately. As this is being shared, myself and my plus one are opening the door to step in. Therefore, we are all present and the hostess acknowledges this much. Five minutes following our arrival, another party of 2 walks in requesting hibachi seating for a party of 4 but the other 2 were on the way. The hostess informed them of the same information, that they will need to arrive within 2 minutes to be seated. Well, 4 minutes later (we're now at 9 minutes that our party of 4 has been waiting to be seated) the other 2 individuals walk in to complete the second party of 4 without a reservation. The second party of 4 is immediately seated at the hibachi table and the rude hostess then informs me that we will have to wait maybe an hour or more, following those with a reservation.  In the meantime, she informs another party (with reservation) that they will have to wait another 40 minutes...apparently they had already been waiting an hour. Someone else walked in and one phone call led her to inform both parties that the wait was 20-25 and 30 minutes, respectively.   At this point, we have already decided we're not eating at this establishment because no one knows how long they're expected to wait. Did I mention, there were regular non-hibachi tables open that we and another party were denied also?   With my friend being pregnant and myself being \"hangry\"... we left and enjoyed hibachi in South Charlotte. No thanks, they don't deserve a second-first try for me."}
{"text":"The food was too salty to be considered a Hibachi Grill.  The chef did the basics far as cooking tricks.  It was only a few of us having lunch at the grill, we still deserve the same treatment as a full house.  My son liked his Hibachi rice.  My shrimp were ok, the steak was a little tough even though it was prepared medium rare.  I was expecting more from a business that is located in busy downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and efficient, she answered questions about the menu easily. We had rock shrimp, crispy duck rolls, seafood hibachi and a filet Mignon entree. The Rock shrimp was alright, certainly have had better. My seafood hibachi (shrimp, scallops, lobster) was a bit better, but I felt that the shrimp and lobster was a little over cooked.  The complimentary rice served was very good. You also received two kinds of dipping sauce for your meal.  I didn't opt for the grill side hibachi tables, but the crowds there looked to have fun. People were laughing and interacting with the chefs. At some point music was played and a few people stood up to show off a few dance moves. I'm guessing the free sake had a hand in that happening. So if you want to visit, the hibachi section may be worth it.  I wasn't sure I would return, but there are a few sushi rolls I would like to try, but that's about it."}
