{"text":"I went here on a whim and was immediately charmed by the place. The inside was large, welcoming, charming and full of food! Everything on the menu looked appealing and was very reasonably priced. I got the Chipotle-Raspberry Turkey sandwich, which was piled high with turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato and a chipotle-raspberry mayo that was one of the tastiest things I've ever had! I want it on every turkey sandwich from now until eternity! And it was a big sandwich, which I didn't expect given that it was less than $10.  I might go here for lunch again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Salad bar was good, but has taken a turn for the worse. If you want yellow lettuce and yellow vegetables, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We found this little place on yelp when looking for a new place in the \"hood\" to go for lunch.  We are hooked!  They have outdoor tables, indoor tables and an old school counter to sit down at where they cook the food right there.  There is plenty of staff on hand so the service is GREAT!  The food selection is mostly healthy so they have something for everyone:  Soup, salads and sandwiches.  I believe they serve breakfast but we are never up in time on the weekends to try the brunch.  They have hot sandwiches (Panini's) or cold sandwiches and plenty of sides including macaroni salad, pasta salad, potato salad, chips, etc.   They also have quite a selection of soft drinks and the place also doubles as a mini-mart, kind of.  You can stop in and get pre-packaged food and drink.  The only thing I wish they had was a 1/2 sandwich with a 1/2 salad or cup of soup.  My hubby and I sometimes get a sandwich and a salad and split.  Definitely worth trying out.  The prices are normal - $6 - $9 for a salad or sandwich.  The sides are extra.  Try the green tea ice tea.  It is absolutely refreshing on a hot day.  I could drink gallons!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. Came on Saturday 1030am for brunch, the place was almost empty. I didn't want to sit at the bar so we sat at an open table. A worker came up and informed us they don't do \"table service\" and to order at the bar but didn't bring us any menus. Despite us being the only people there they couldn't provide service? I got the 'corner favorite', eggs were cold, came with a tiny slice of pineapple, the whole plate was cold. The juice bar wasn't open and workers were just hanging out rather than offering service. You could get better food at an IHOP and better service too. There are way better place to eat in phoenix than here."}
{"text":"Great staff, so helpful and nice. Food was outstanding and the coffee price cannot be beat... 50 cents!! I would have to say the grilled cheese is one of the best I have had in a long time. This location is just like the Scottsdale Kierland location, but the space is about 3x bigger! Wonderful place to get breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Remember the TV show 'Cheers'? Norm Peterson would walk in and the whole place would yell out \"NORM!\".  I come here so often it wouldn't surprise me if they started yelling, \"MANNY!\" when I enter. They won't, but it would be nice.  I work in CityScape and this is my preferred lunch spot.  They have an extensive menu so it doesn't get boring, the service is very good and the food is delicious. I think I've tried just about everything on the menu.  I usually get a sandwich but the salads are very good as well.   And, it's also a deli/grocery store. Convenient place to pick something up to bring back to the office or home.  A very good choice if you're looking for a quick lunch and want to avoid the standard chain restaurants."}
{"text":"The best chocolate chip cookies in town!  All of the baked muffins, cookies are really fantastic here but the triple chocolate chip cookies are amazing!  Delicious healthy salads and sandwiches, Chloes Corner never disappoints!  Friendly service, clean restaurant and bathroom.  Haven't been for breakfast/brunch yet but the lunch menu is solid and this place is always very popular and busy!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Downtown Phoenix for breakfast, lunch and hanging out while working all afternoon. They have a free wifi, a roomy yet cosy dining room. I ordered the corner chop salad and it was fresh, tasty and plentiful.   all the staff members I interacted with were friendly, and quick in bringing me refills and such.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Gem in the jungle. Coffee is 50 cents and it's actually good. I usually get the egg sandwich. It's a must and the cranberries bread with the Chloe's breakfast"}
{"text":"Chloe's Corner is one of my usual lunch spots, I go at least once or twice a week. To be honest the first time I went here I thought I'd never go back. I had the egg salad sandwich and was really not a fan. It was cheap bread and the egg salad had a bunch of \"stuff\" in it. But then one of my coworkers wanted to hit up the salad bar, and I was hooked. Now at the end there will be a large caveat to everything I am about to write. They have several \"lettuce\" options that are always crisp and many toppings to choose from. There are several protein choices, I personally enjoy tofu. They also have all the staples as well as extras like marinated artichokes. But the best part is their balsamic vinaigrette, it is amazing. Now with all that said, you have to get there before 11:30. When everything is first set out the salad bar is fantastic, but they don't keep up with it throughout the day. By noon there's food everywhere, all the dressings have dripped into each other and they are out of some of the stuff. Lucky for me I'm an early luncher."}
{"text":"The Corner chopped salad blows my mind every time I eat.  The flavors of smoked turkey, grapes, sweet pecans and blue cheese swirl around my taste buds and makes my mouth so happy! Also very tasty iced coffee.  Another great place to sit outside with my pooch."}
{"text":"All their food is amazing.  The milk shakes are my favorite, and you can't beat their coffee!"}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times in 2 months and had great salads the first 2 trips.  This time we were the only ones in line just as breakfast was over.  The last time we ordered one sandwich it was for our kid but just thought she wasnt hungry turns out it tasted bad.  Today ---  what we didnt realize was this place is horrible when you have kids who want a sandwich because it is $46 for the 4 of us for salad and 3 sandwiches.  A My husband got his salad and a tea ( the tea he got tasted like an iced coffee?) .  My younger daughter ordered A white bread with ham it was rang up with no explanation other than \" ya, we can do that.\"  Charged as a turkey sandwich ( $7.85) add ham ($2)!!!!   Second kid ordered water,  toasted  ham, cheese  on ciabatta bread. Again no explanation and  Was charged for classic grilled cheese ($5- not bad) add ham ($2) ok..... She got not sure what the THIN bread was -- too much swiss cheese and Ham. It was not good and no water.   I decided i was not in the mood for a salad i tell you this because i have never ordered a tuna salad... so i ordered a hot tuna sandwich, fountain drink, side of berries and a cookie.  I got a tuna salad - i know i did not order which i was felt to be in the wrong!!  A great side of berries and my fountain drink and no cookie ( i checked i wasnt charged) ...When getting my sandwich back it was burnt and their explanation is it is a \"dark bread\"... It is black burned and tasted as so!!!  Leaving i was getting a refill and a lid so i now know why the looks as i must have been given the water Cup since the lid didnt fit!   We get outside and they asked for the cookie... It was another moment we wished we had gone somewhere else!!!  All 4 of us pretty much lost our appetite and i never complain but really $46 lunch and a frustrating hour!!!"}
{"text":"favorite lunch spot. the staff is super friendly and the food is awesome. i work close by so i am here probably 2 times a week."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for lunch one day. It was fairly busy, we were about 4th in line with 2 cashiers working. I stepped up to the cashier when it was my turn, and was then completely ignored for the next 3 or 4 minutes. When I say ignored, I mean it. The cashier did not even look at me or acknowledge me in any way, shape, or form. She proceeded to do something with the register for that  entire time. So I finally gave up and moved over to the other line. The food was good but for the  lackluster service, it wasn't great enough to make me ever go back."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today at 11am.. the place was pretty much empty, but I had to stand around and wait for my Hot Turkey to-go for a looooong time.  I noticed a LOT of employees, but none of them were really too concerned about getting the food out.  They were all nice, but it was making me nervous how they were all just walking about, almost pacing.  My sandwich is pretty much amazing though.  Perfectly toasted outside with this ridiculously good cranberry walnut bread - my mind is blown right now!  Delish!  Try it, but make sure you intend on sitting a while... the place has excellent ambiance and lots of really cool places to sit and enjoy your leisurely lunch!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Corner is making some changes and all for the good. They still have the same great management and friendly staff. Today I tried one of the many things they have planned for the restaurant. The self serve hot food bar, which is right next to the build your own salad bar, (where I have created mountainous masterpieces of salad)  The cost for the hot food bar is same price as the salad bar and you'll pay by the pound after they weigh your plate of food at the cashier. See the image (number 60 on this page) of my plate which had  roasted veggies, meatballs, penne pasta, garlic bread and cherry cobbler on it. I had it toward the end of the day so I think that is why the pasta was a little dry. Now the meatballs in tomato sauce were just right, the roasted veggies of zucchini, yellow squash, red and green peppers, onions, and more (I love roasted veggies) were delicious and the cherry cobbler was excellent! A friendly staff member told me they plan on having different hot dishes everyday along with expanding the choice of items on the salad bar instead of mirroring it on both sides.   A special extra thumbs up for The Corner having some of the friendliest and helpful staff anywhere, and consistently so!"}
{"text":"Portions are kid/girl-sized and they rush you to turn the table.  When I asked why they did not have wi-fi the waitress said, \"We don't want people sitting here tying up our tables\".  Most of us, check our emails while we are eating and leave.  They are going for the neighborhood feel, but their staff is not too neighborly.  I am out!"}
{"text":"Good simple quality ingredients. I had the Turkey raspberry chipotle sandwich and it was awesome"}
{"text":"So here comes one of my favorite lazy Sunday brunch at Chloe's corner: Grilled Cheese with Cheddar, Swiss, white American, bacon, tomato on white bread, paired with a cup of Tomato Soup, hmmmmmm..that's my comfort food..  This place is spacious and cute; grab a quick meal on the counter? Sunshine and coffee on the patio? Or just want a table by the window for some people watching? They got all covered! And don't forget to take a walk around the Kierland Commons, it helps for your digestion :) Oh, i love my Sundays."}
{"text":"Upgraded 1 star. I think they made the sandwiches a little larger, plus I figured out that you just need to get yourself a side salad since they don't give you a side. Still, sandwich, side salad and drink is $13. Not the greatest bang for your buck. Pretty good food, but not anything to write home about. Good atmosphere though, nice place to have lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"Great downtown lunch spot. The cookies are phenomenal, as are all the other baked goods. Great atmosphere and friendly employes, especially the manager, Lisa, who is always smiling, helping, and interacting with customers. Great background music selection as well."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  However, if you're looking to get a glass of wine of your choosing, this isn't the place. They serve one red and one white wine only. So, if you're not a Chardonnay drinker and the only bottle of white wine they have opened is a Chardonnay, you're out of luck. I personally am not a Chardonnay drinker. Was in there yesterday and asked if they had Pinot Grigio. The answer was no. So, just had water to drink (which was probably a good thing anyway).  Cheap coffee. One of the only places I know where you can get a cup of joe for 50 cents. Great breakfast sandwiches. My husband loves their grilled cheese sandwich. I like their Greek salad.  So, my only beef is the wine or, rather, the lack of it. It wouldn't be much trouble for them  to keep more than two bottles of wine open at the same time ...."}
{"text":"Each time I went to this place , it was perfect ! The patio is small but nice. When there is a wait, it's always really fast. Employees are very nice and here to help you if you need. My favorites are the Asian Chicken Salad with an Orangina!  Perfect combo. And the price are very affordable. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most affordable  places in that area with great  food.   I love the Chinese Chicken Salad,  yummy!  They have the best customer service.  They are always so nice when I go there.  I'm sure they are  packed during lunch hour.  I typically take lunch between 1pm to 1:30pm to miss the rush.  I like to sit and eat there, the patio is nice.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by during happy hour before a baseball game and grabbed a beer and a slice of pizza for $5 which seemed like a great deal. Basically like getting a free slice of pizza with the purchase of a beer. Only problem was that even for free the pizza was disappointing. I think the pizza for the special just sits on the counter for a couple of hours until the happy hour ends, and you can taste it. I like the atmosphere and think it's a good place to grab a drink, but the food I had wasn't worth ever ordering again."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch in City Scape, downtown Phoenix.  Took a friend here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and we both loved it! I was so surprised at how spacious and open the place is and how interesting it is to see the preparation area in front of you. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the chicken salad and a turkey club or sorts, the names escape me. Both were made right in front of us at the bar. They were amazing! My friend said it was the best chicken said she'd had in a very long time and I was gushing about the sauce my sandwich had on it.   I wish I could have tired one of their breakfast items because the danishes and bagels looked great. I cannot say enough good things about this place and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself to be easy to please when it comes to food.  I give a 5 for \"OMG this was amazing, I'm going back tomorrow\" and a 4 for \"absolutely delicious, nothing to complain about, but I'm not writhing and thrashing on the floor in delight either.\"    I just have absolutely nothing to complain about here.  I ordered a BLT (it comes with double-bacon, lettuce, tomato, toasted white bread, with some sort of mayo/mustard spread) and a small chili.  Delicious.  Absolutely delicious, plenty of bacon on that sandwich, and the chili was very hearty.  I also had a divine-smelling cherry/blueberry oatmeal cookie, and it was as soft and delicious as it smelled.  Cashier was kind, service was prompt, space was clean...and while I was standing in line, I spied some pizza pies - I'll be back for those another day.  This was my first time here, and I will be back."}
{"text":"The chipotle raspberry turkey on cranberry walnut is great!!  The service is friendly and atmosphere is fun. It's a great place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"It's confusing who to tip, the food is great, Morayne and Scotty are the best wait-staff."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix last night looking for a place to eat. I used the app on my iphone to search and Chloe's Corner was close by so we decided to try it out. T he place  was pretty cool, very open on the inside and nice patio seating on the out side. I got the pastrami and swiss sandwich. I enjoyed it. The total for 2 sandwiches was close to $16 so a little pricey, but the experience was enjoyable and they had good service."}
{"text":"Excellent.....my new favorite lunch spot in the Kierland area.  Definitely going back.  I got the italian....excellent.  My buddy got the chicken pesto and loved it as well."}
{"text":"The ultimate spot to have a great quality lunch with great taste. The food is fresh, made to order and the employees are fabulous! This is my go to spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and it was busy.Super friendly, eager to serve staff and great food! There was a mishap with food (fell on the floor by another customer) and it was replaced by the staff by anything we wanted. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Yum!  This place is adorable. It's resembles a trendy diner and I loved the concept. It's easy to place your order at the register upon entering the restaurant. There were lots of people bellied up to the counter enjoying their lunch plus there were plenty of tables to sit at.   I had the Classic Grilled Cheese ($4.50) and a cup of tomato soup ($2.50). The grilled cheese had the perfect amount of cheese and was grilled to perfection. The tomato soup was outstanding and my favorite part of the meal. Cannot wait to go back and have it again. I also like the deli pickle slices they give with the meal and the gentleman that served my sandwhich was more than willing to fetch me a side of dijon mustard. Thanks!  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I give these guys 4 stars just for the fact that they still have a .50 cup of coffee, in the days of the 7 dollar 1/2 soy 1/2 caf, no-whip, abominations Chloe's is keeping it real with a straight up black coffee with no training wheels for 4 bits!!! Nice work Chloe's!"}
{"text":"I had the occasion to visit here today with a friend.  After reading some of the reviews, I had pre-decided on the grilled cheese sandwich with the famous tomato soup.  I did peruse the menu posted on the chalkboard on the wall....writing so small  I almost had to get on the counter to read it...but stuck with my original selection.  The sandwich was nothing special, just seemed to be a mixture of cheeses on white bread with 3 small pickle slices.  The tomato soup was a bit watery for my taste and perhaps about 6 oz.  With the addition of a small fountain drink, the bill was just over $10.  Would I try this restaurant again?  Probably not, but it looked like they were doing a pretty good business with local traffic and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Great employees!  Cant beat the $0.50 cup of coffee.  Come here for breakfast often and I can't help but order the fruit parfait each time!  it's delicious!  Have also had the breakfast burrito which is wonderful as well.  The hot/cold sandwiches are good too as well as the pastries."}
{"text":"We've been going since day 1, when it was The Counter.  (liked it better interior-wise then, they had cool retail products).  Food has not changed.   Hot roast beef grilled snadwhich & tomato soup is the best.  Luv the chineese salad.   Tip: grap a bottle of (cheap) wine & they will crack it for you - no charge. (no one seems to know this?) Perfect Lunch spot, but the open for breakfast (oatmeal, eggs).  Coffee is 25 cents, btw."}
{"text":"This is my favorite, go-to lunch spot. The food is fantastic and reasonably priced. Service is quick and friendly, and the people that work there have been there for years, so it's always great to walk in and have people recognize you. The whole experience is even better if you can get a table outside. I even love sitting at the counter.   I always get their soup--tomato is a classic and delicious, but broccoli cheese and clam chowder are fabulous as well. Egg salad sandwich is sooo good (ask them to toast the bread and get a side of mustard), hot smoked turkey sandwich..yummm! And the tuna salad (with an extra hard boiled egg) and the corner chopped salad (with extra turkey) is amazing (I like extra protein I guess). Oh and might I add, their milkshakes are creamy and delicious!  When you're all done, you're in a great place to walk it off :)"}
{"text":"I still love Chloe's! They never disappoint. Eli, Jacob, Nellen, Adam, Cassidy, Paula, and the rest of the crew are fantastic and always take such great care of me and all of their customers! 5 stars for the food and 10 stars for their customer service!"}
{"text":"Place needs to do more for its customers than just turn the lights on. As far as morning outlets downtown, they are one of maybe a dozen in the immediate area. The one thing they have going for them is a large seating area and it is good for a morning meeting. Tried to do that this morning with a couple of people who wanted a cup of hot tea. At 8am, they were out!!! REALLY!! Should have gone to Starbucks across the courtyard, they get what serving beverages is all about. Chloe's seems to be focused on prepping and serving a lunch crowd. Beyond that they are truly \"out to lunch\" - much better places to take your business."}
{"text":"So, I went for lunch at about 12:30 on Good Friday.  After waiting in a very long line for about 15 minutes, I finally placed my order for a lemon salad with chicken only to find out that they had already run out of chicken!  They have about 10 salads on their board and 8 of the 10 have chicken as an ingredient.  So I accept my salad with turkey lunch meat stuff instead.  Then, as I'm waiting for my order, two women walk up and order something with chicken.  Cashier says, no chicken.  Ladies ask \"what do you mean, no chicken?\"  The tall, blond cashier says \"We don't have any chicken, ergo no chicken.\"  Wow, really?  Instead of \"I'm sorry, we ran out...\"?  So, they too accept the turkey lunch meat substitute.  Then I hear a man order a sandwich on sourdough. The guy making sandwiches (next to the salads) turns around and tells the guy that they don't have sourdough and never had.  Well, the sandwich maker should read his menu because the first ingredient on the Club sandwich is \"toasted sourdough.\"  The food is good and deserves 4 stars (-1 for no chicken) The service is 0 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. While other lunch places in Kierland quarters were packed at this hour (Sunday lunch), this place was kind of quiet, so we decided that was our best option. The girl taking our order at the cashier looked bored and sleepy but she did take the order. Then we sat down snd waited. And waited. And waited. We were very hungry and had picked this place bc it wasn't that crowded, so it wasn't like they had to scramble or anything. Finally, I approached one of the other girls and asked whether she could check on our order. She looked as if I was bothering her and simply walked away (apparently to check on the order? Maybe? Nobody knows...). Back at our table, we waited some more. The girl I had asked walked past. I said \"Excuse me, any news on our order?\" She looked startled and replied slightly annoyed \"Oh, yeah, he's making it right now.\" No apology, no thanks for being patient or anything. Mistakes can happen, but there are better ways to deal with it. All the girls working here looked either bored out of their minds, or actually annoyed. Too bad."}
{"text":"You can't find a better place for a quick breakfast or lunch in North Scottsdale...my wife and I love going!"}
{"text":"Chloe's Corner is absolutely amazing! I used to work at Kierland, so I would go there for breakfast/lunch almost every day. Their chorizo, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is to die for! The staff is very welcoming and nice. Chloe's Corner definitely earned 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was very good! I had the cold turkey sandwich and the bread it comes on is amazing. It is a bit crowded at lunch time and is small inside. All in all I would go back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and I always get the Chloe's favorite! I would rate this place a 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor customer service at the registers. There seems to always be the same gal up front who never smiles and is reluctant to answer any questions regarding the menu. I hate to downgrade from a 5-4; owner is extremely nice and is always there to help and my experience great."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Everything I have had from Chloe's has been great.  Great pizza for a great price, and their sandwiches are excellent, too.  Quick service, plenty of seating, nice people... It is one of the better places to grab a bite downtown, and more affordable for the quality, too!"}
{"text":"My last stop at an eatery in Scottsdale during my trip and this was a great way to end it. Went for lunch and was not disappointed. Tons o options for hot and cold sandwiches plus salads and I think some wraps too. I'm not sure simply because I stopped looking when I saw the Tina salad on walnut cranberry bread. And it was awesome.  The sandwiches don't come with chips or anything like that, but they do come with a nice serving of deli pickle slices. Which were fresh and tasty! Tons and tons of beverage options and yummy baked goods which are also quite good. Worth a stop for lunch (which can be quite busy) and I will try to get back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Cloe's was just okay. It markets itself as a much more vintage - type restsurant, but in actuality, there's nothing special about it. The food was good and bad. My friend's roast beef sandwich was good, but my Asian chicken salad was not good. The chicken was so tough, you know...the kind you keep chewing and it never breaks down.   I've been wanting to go to Cloe's for months and it was a disappointment. I'd go back and give it another try, but won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I wandered into Chloe's Corner because it was in a convenient location and I was starving.  Admittedly, I wasn't expecting much.  It's cute but it looks like a standard deli, chalkboard menus and all.  I was pleasantly surprised with my lunch.  I already know the hot smoked turkey sandwich will haunt my dreams...smoked turkey breast, havarti and tomato on cranberry walnut bread.  Pure deliciousness.    The menu had several other items - sandwiches, salads and soups that sound tempting.  This place certainly draws a crowd during the peak lunch hour but they seem to move quickly.  I didn't have to wait long for my meal.  Another plus, the prices were surprisingly reasonable. I do believe I've found a new lunch spot in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Chloe's for several years now. It's our favorite place to spend time together and eat lunch. When we eat here, we typically get the Hot Turkey Sandwich or the Corner Chop Salad. Both are exceptionally delicious! The whole staff at Chloe's are also extremely nice! Eli, thank you for your great service. Every time my family and I come we feel so welcomed. We really appreciate all the time you've taken care of us in assuring that we are satisfied with our meal and service."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a cup of coffee and a morning pastry.  Not sure about their lunch or happy hour but really love the layout of this place.  I tried their chorizo breakfast burrito too and it was very tasty albeit a bit pricey in my opinion.  Check this place out if you're in the area for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great location and great salads, easy call in and pick up. The bar stools and counter, diner style, is refreshing. The coffee can't be beaten for the value (fifty cents for coffee!) and I love the orange + raspberry muffins."}
{"text":"What is it with Scottsdale restaurants?? Lately I have been getting the worse service or lack of service I should say.  I went to CC for a cup of soup and ordering at the register the guys who was telling me what the soups were was interrupted by the other cashier who started talking to him about non-restaurant stuff and they got into a conversation and were laughing while I'm standing there trying to put my order in. Then he never put the order in and I waited 15 min, people coming in after me where getting their food.  I called the manager over and told him about my wait and he went back and couldn't find the ticket for my soup.  This place is a joke! Don't bother with it especially if you want to just grab a quick bite. Very unprofessional and poorly run place."}
{"text":"Chloe's is indy-owned now, bought by Sam Fox's former general manager.  Swung by 10min before a Sur La Table cooking class was due to start.  There was a to-go section of one lonely sandwich at 6pm Sat (so the good news is sales must be brisk), but we took the risk of ordering a hot sandwich = longer serve time (6-7min for a hot, 3-4 min for a cold.. I swear, I quote).  Though I teasingly hinted any expediting would be great (no other in line in front of us), I didn't see that communicated from the cashier to the gal making the hot pastrami and swiss.  Can I really fault them, no probably not.  And really, the cashier guy was uber nice from beginning to end.  I asked them to wrap the 2 halves separately for sharing, and it was a tasty pastrami.  The casual patio atmopshere will definitely have me come back when I have time for a sit down."}
{"text":"This is my go to for a quick lunch near my work. They have salads and sandwiches that are premade if you're in a rush or you can order a fresh one to be made. I always order the corner chop salad without chicken and add some avocado, which is yummy! They also have fresh pastries made every morning that I always eye. They can get a bit busy during lunch, but they are still fairly quick with their service. Excellent food and customer service!"}
{"text":"A little bit of goodness right around the corner, literally. Whenever I am having a bit of a craving for some down home tasty goodness (like my favorite grilled cheese in town), I head to Chloe's Corner. The American Grilled Cheese is ah-mazing and should not be missed. I like to order and sit at the counter for lunch. Partner that grilled cheese with a bowl of their fantastic tomato soup and you have a bit of heaven on your lips. When you walk into Chloe's Counter, you are immediately greeted by a barrage of wines, old time candy jars, and 'small town' restaurant feel. I love this place for so many reasons, but one thing you MUST not pass up (aside from the American Grilled Cheese) is the malt milkshake, trust me chock up the extra 50 cents for the malt, it is so worth it! Dare I say one of the best chocolate milkshakes in town? I think so."}
{"text":"Large salad bar, great pizza, good variety. Sometimes there are long lines but it's worth it. Iced tea selection is decent and they have some delicious desserts. There is a nice outdoor seating area that is wonderful when the weather is nice. The only downfall is the awkward tables and chairs. They are so close to each other that you bump neighbors just trying to sit down. The table legs are poorly placed and make it awkward to sit if you have a dress or skirt on..."}
{"text":"This was a cute find. It's quick, casual, and affordable.  The set up is similar to a market like LGO. When you get in, you go to the left and there are premade salads (and I think cold sandwiches too). Walking closer to the cashier, there are drinks (there's beer and wine!) on one side and snacks on the other.   Anyway, I got the spinach salad - w/o goat cheese, add chicken. It had strawberries, blueberries, and pistachios in it. I thought the pistachios were going to be an unusual ingredient, but it was good. I also like pistachios generally so that may have helped. My friend got a hot sandwich, and he said it was pretty good. I don't think he thought it was anything special.   Overall I'm rounding up a 3.5 star because of the casual atmosphere and affordable menu, especially for Kierland standards. Also, I'd really like to come back to try breakfast.   PS: Lastly, sitting outside wasn't too terrible. It was in the shade, and there are misters."}
{"text":"Very cute and bz cafe...they also have a bakery. If your in a hurry you can grab a drink in their open fridge area and make ur own salad at the salad bar ($6.99/lb). The line is usually long so expect to wait a little whole. I like how their kitchen is open so you can watch them make your food."}
{"text":"Finally checked out Chloes Corner since they opened. it's a great little spot to get a quick lunch while downtown. it as super crowded during lunch, this just means that many other people like the place. It was confusing trying to figure out where to order, do you just pick a seat or wait to be seated and where the menu was. The food was great, i had a hot Pastrami sandwich. The price? Too high for what you get. I got a good, but small, pastrami sandwich for $8 and a drink for $2. My wife got a slice of pizza $3 and a cookie 2$. for $8, i'd expect to at least to get a bag of chips with my sandwich. All in all, neat little spot. Over priced for what you get, but the food is good and the service was VERY quick."}
{"text":"Chloe's corner is a must for a casual breakfast. Quick, delicious, reasonably priced with a varied breakfast menu with healthy options like fresh berries, fruit, yogurt with granola and steel cut oats."}
{"text":"I really like the design and layout of this place. Plenty of seating at a wrap-around counter, some stand up space, and tons of tables of various styles and sizes. And each chair is unique.   I came here two days in a row with coworkers. The first day, I had the pastrami and swiss sandwich. It was okay. The bread was overcooked and had little flavor.   Came back the next day to give it another shot, this time opting for the salad bar. It was a little better but one thing I found here was just a bit odd. When you get done filling your salad bowl with the contents of your heart's desire, your salad is weighed and you're charged by weight.   So far, not odd at all.   But I had also filled one of those small, plastic \"to go\" mini cups with oil and vinegar for the salad. I was holding it in one hand while I handed my salad to the cashier with the other. She immediately reached out for the cup of oil & vinegar, saying \"hey give me that, too.\"  I thought she was joking, and handed it over. She then dutifully placed it on the scale along with my salad and added \"just keeping you honest, sir.\"  LOL  Okay that's fine. Not like it set me back much, but I really thought it was odd to insist on weighing a teaspoon of oil.   Food is okay, service okay. Chocolate chip cookie excellent.  [Hint: pocket the oil next time]"}
{"text":"This quaint little order at the counter restaurant is one of my favorites!  They always give fast service and really great food.  There's usually someplace cozy to sit - indoors or out.    I LOVE their yogurt parfait!!!  They serve up an awesome grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Their salads are great!  They also have great coffee (ICED especially!)  and bev selection.    If you're in Kirland and are looking for someplace to eat that's quick, this is the place.  Has Fox Restaurants ever screwed up with any of their projects?  I love them all!"}
{"text":"I'm really unclear on why this place gets such great reviews.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  Perhaps I came on an off day.  ATMOSPHERE: Reminiscent of a much smaller version of Joan's on Third or Dean & Deluca.  Clean, bright, modernish deli with small tables and a counter, and patio tables outside.  It fits nicely into the Kierland Commons ethos.  The problem is that it was nearly impossible to find a table during lunch.  Our group had to split up to stalk tables.  Meanwhile others were camped out, hovering over tables themselves.  The staff doesn't help you so  you are left awkwardly, on your own.  FOOD: Decent.  The grilled cheese sandwiches and Chinese chicken salad were fine, but unremarkable.  The pre-made salads looked like they had been made several days before.  Our strawberry smoothie was fine but tasted syrupy.  Certainly not better than what you'd find at any other deli/café at the same price point.  SERVICE: Once you order, you get a number and place it on your table.  Given the large crowd, it took a while for our food to come.  When it did, part of the order was wrong and we were missing our smoothie.  When the server came back with the correct sandwich, the smoothie was still missing.  The third time was a charm (or at least correct)."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westin Kierland and went over to Chloe's Corner for breakfast one day.  What a great little spot!    Independently owned, this place has all the character and atmosphere of a sandwich shop in NY or San Francisco.  They have counter seating at the long butcher block counter, lots of indoor tables and a few tables outside as well.  Coffee, sandwiches, snacks, beer, salads, etc.  Perfect spot for breakfast, lunch or take-out.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"awesome staff Great area for leisure time Really nice menu and counter service is an option"}
{"text":"I am genuinely impressed with this place!! The gluten free bread was delicious and TOASTED TO PERFECTION!!!! The tuna salad was fabulous. I truly thank you!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!   -$0.50 Iced/Hot coffee! *** -Fresh Salads/Sandwiches -My favorite: Egg Salad on Wheat or BLT on Chabatta Bread -Apple turnover was flaky and full of big chunks of fruit!  You order at the front and they either give you a number or bring the food to your table."}
{"text":"I went walking around Kierland Commons for lunch and stopped by this great spot. It was busy, and seating was very limited indoors (sitting outdoors in Scottsdale this time of year is just not worth it).   I went right up to the counter and ordered a BLT, and I enjoyed it with a Pellegrino all for just a hair over $10.00. I sat at the counter, and my sandwich arrived quickly (within less than 5-6 minutes which is great). I have to say this is one of the best BLTs that I've eaten (and no I didn't take it apart). The bacon was delicious, thick cut, and most definitely not microwaved sliver bacon like you're prone to get at other places. The sandwich had a healthy helping of lettuce, tomato, and a tasty mayo and the bread was toasted very nicely.   I also like the vibe of the place ... urban chic lunch counter without the pretension? Sounds about right. I definitely have no reservations with rating this place at five stars.   Pros:  Quick service, nice ambiance, tasty food.  Cons: Gets very busy during lunch time, but service doesn't deteriorate (which I think qualifies as a pro too)   Grades:  Overall: A  (no demerit taken on the overall grade)   Food:    A  (The famous chef Gordon Ramsay said that if you're going                     to make a simple common dish, you have to do it                      extremely well, and I think Chloe's stepped up to the plate                      and earned my \"A\" rating for perfect execution on this                      simple lunch dish).   Service:  A  (Excellent, efficient service with personable waitstaff that                      aren't annoying or overbearing.)   Drinks:  N/A  (Drinking on duty is somewhat a faux pas at work, so                        no booze was sampled. However, they did have a very                        good list of wines and some nice bottles of beer available                       for those who are seeking stronger libations for lunch)"}
{"text":"This has been a favorite lunch spot of mine, way back to when it first opened.  A couple of things have made it even better in recent months.  First off, the Kierland Plaza Lofts are completed, which opens up a TON of parking nearby.  So, it's actually possible to zip in and out for lunch.  Second, with the transformation from \"The Counter\" to \"Chloe's Corner,\" the number of tables has more than doubled.   It's now possible to sit down during lunch hour without elbowing an elderly couple for position or hovering above people while they finish their meals.  The best part about Chloe's Corner is what HASN'T changed.  First off, home made pop tarts.  You heard me correctly.  If you haven't had these, grab your keys, get in your car and go.  They are different every day and when they're gone, they're gone, so don't procrastinate.  You can finish reading this review later.  I think the sandwiches are great.  I can never seem to get away from the Hot Smoked Turkey.  My various dining companions have tried a number of the other sandwiches and salads.  The bites I've stolen have all been wonderful.  And, if none of it sounds good, just get the Hot Dog.  Last but not least, the milkshakes......homemade and huge.  If you're looking for a 800 calorie drink/dessert, look no further.  All in all, Chloe's remains one of my weekday lunch favorites."}
{"text":"My friend and I were very disappointed to see that the sister to this spot (C3 Kitchen) had closed down. It was funny, in a way - we made actual, excited plans to meet at C3 only to find it vacant! And it had only been a week or so since we'd visited last.  Pivoting from that surprise, we decided to try out Chloe's Corner since it is \"just across the street\" and has the same owners (to the best of our understanding). Arriving at Chloe's Corner, we had a feeling it would be different than C3, but still hoped otherwise!  THINGS I LOVED ABOUT CHLOE'S CORNER  The place was pretty busy with what appeared to be a number of regulars, which is always great to see. Given its prime location right there in the mall area, I'm not too surprised by that.  There was a man who I'm pretty confident was the owner (based on his actions and snippets of conversation I overheard) zipping around at Mach speed. Seriously - he was everywhere: very interactive and engaged with the room and with his guests.  He wasn't like other owners I've observed. He wasn't directing his team, he was leading by immediate example: clearing tables, greeting customers, checking up on guests, smiling and nodding and making pleasant conversation. I was very impressed by his energy.  THINGS I DIDN'T QUITE LOVE  When my friend and I went to place our order, we were \"helped\" by a very lackadaisical young girl who took our order while literally reclining against the countertop. She wasn't standing - she was reclining-leaning against the counter. Big deal? Not really, but it gave off a careless air of \"whatevs\", which I wasn't a big fan of.  The interior was clean and bright, but still felt bland and somewhat characterless compared to C3 Kitchen. The food, too, was far less interesting that C3's. I ordered the grilled cheese (very dry and flavorless, unfortunately), and my friend ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad (same name as C3's; less flavorful and smaller-portioned).  CONCLUSION  While I will always greatly appreciate a business that is run by dedicated, invested ownership (and Chloe's definitely fits that bill based on my observations), I was disappointed and surprised that, of the two, C3 Kitchen is the concept that closed.  All in all, Chloe's Corner was a disappointment primarily because I had its sister to compare against. Would I go back? Probably not. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it. Would I turn anyone away from it? Most definitely not.  If you haven't been, give it a shot. Everything here was acceptable, just not standout. You may quite enjoy it after a long day of shopping.  :)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing salads and sandwiches. The price is perfect as well. I actually think this is one of the cheapest places to eat in Kierland Commons. The only reason I took away 1 star is because there is not enough seating outside. I know that is something that they cant control, but I love to eat outside when the weather is right. They have about 6 tables (it might actually be less) outside and the place is always hopping. I normally shop around at the stores and keep checking for a table to open... then I eat there. They have seating inside too. I would recommend their chicken salad sandwich and egg salad sandwich. AMAZING!!! I have pretty much ordered and devoured every salad that is on the menu. I also love the fact that they have freshly brewed iced tea. I have yet to have a bad experience at this restaurant. This is my go to restaurant when I am shopping Kierland Commons (which is very often)."}
{"text":"Service is great - such friendly employees and they keep up with clearing tables and serving.  Love Chloe's salad - haven't had anything I haven't liked. Highly recommend - great to be able to sit outside and enjoy their small patio."}
{"text":"The place is nice and they have a great display of to-go food. I ordered the Thai sandwich and Chinese chicken salad. They didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Such a great little place. Signage has \"corner\" large and Chloe's small, so don't miss it! We went during lunch rush so seating was a little hard to find but they flipped tables very quickly. I ordered the cold turkey sandwich, got my drink, and by the time I say down at my table they were walking over with my sandwich -- super speedy! Sandwich was delicious and I loved the cranberry walnut bread. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Used them sight unseen to cater our marriage reception at downtown location. John and his crew were amazing. His pricing was superb. He followed through on every email and costs were perfect. He and his crew came through with the perfect food, beverage and all items were great. His quarter sandwiches were a hit and his cheese plate was outstanding. Thanks John and crew-first impressions are you guys are the best."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of times soon after it opened.  To be fair to them, perhaps they've worked out the kinks in the service since then, because the times I went everyone seemed a little confused about what they were doing.  My main gripe about this place - and get ready, because this is going to sound petty - is they can't/won't cook an egg any other way than \"scrambled\".  Which, I guess, means they don't have any actual eggs on premises.  I'm just picturing someone back in the kitchen pouring my \"egg\" out of the Acme Egg Product container.  Not very appealing.  Maybe it's just me, but is it too much to ask of a restaurant which serves breakfast to cook me a simple egg?  I think not, hence 3 stars."}
{"text":"I must say that I have never been unsatisfied by the taste of the food, everything is good. What bothers me is how they charge you for things that you do not get. The last two times I have ordered from there I ask for extra bacon on my sandwiches. I certainly get charged for the bacon but never get it. I called them and spoke with a girl that said they normally give 4 pieces of bacon. What one mutant sliver of bacon.   Anywho, I don't like being charged for something that I do not receive. Other than that the food is good!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST neighborhood joint that exists in America! I have frequented this old school yet modern day diner for years. The friendly service provided by all the workers makes it feel like home. A special shout out to Kathy who brightens my day each morning my stating my name and adding an extra special welcoming touch is priceless! The basic menu is simple yet delicious and solid all the time. Eggs are yummy, yogurt parfait is to die for, coffee is just 50 cents and great! As well the grilled cheese and pastrami are great lunch choices too. All baked goods are fresh each day- toffee/choc chip cookie is another not to be missed. Ask for Kathy and be taken care of.... you will never be disappointed at this yummy affordable diner."}
{"text":"Went to Chloes for breakfast Sunday Morning.  Ordered the usual egg sandwich to go.  Waited 30 minutes and left with no sandwich.  Had this problem of long wait previously but did not learn.  This is why you pay up front."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  You can sit & order or carry out.  There's a coffee bar, salad bar, grocery store, and juicery with fresh pressed juices & protein drinks.  They offer everything from pizza & salad to raw snacks to wine & cheese.   I work close by & I stop in every time I don't bring a lunch to work.  Really good!!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker there's nothing I love more than pizza and a great sandwich - so I was excited to check out Chloe's Corner after reading some of the great reviews.  Unfortunately I was hugely disappointed by the quality of the sandwiches. I got the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and mustard on cranberry walnut bread and the sandwich was dry... the bread lacked flavor, the turkey tasted gamey instead of having a nice roasted flavor to it and the cranberry sauce was barely on it.  I also got a cup of the tomato soup, which was good but nothing extraordinary.   Personally, I wouldn't bother with this place - a sandwich shop that doesn't make good sandwiches is not worth the money."}
{"text":"I had an excellent lunch here today.  It's a cute little place with excellent food (I had the tuna melt).   Great location in Keirland"}
{"text":"I showed up with my laptop. Bought breakfast and coffee, left a 70% tip and sat down to work. Opened my laptop but couldn't connect...then an employee told me, \"Oh yeah, Macs don't work here.\" ...Really?! Maybe you could put a sign on the door so I don't waste my money here. Too bad--the place has nice ambience. But I have to say the food is fantastically mediocre."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and lunch menu. The egg sandwich and yogurt w/ granola ante awesome."}
{"text":"Shopping in the K Commons and the wife and I were getting hungry. We were both tired of PF's and the Cheese Cake Hut and wanted to try something new. Saw all the good reviews and decided to give this a try on a Saturday for lunch around noonish. Maybe the wrong time to visit?  Inside reminded me of the type of sandwich shops that my mom would take me to when shopping back in the 70's. They offer your simple Breakfast favorites, Hot and Cold Sandwiches, Soups and Salads as well as Dessert items for your sweet tooth.  The place was packed to the rim with hungry shoppers trying to order, eat and get out of there in a hurry. We both ordered a Sandwich and a bag of chips and a glass of water. The food tasted pretty good but was nothing to get excited about. I make better sandwiches at home for a fraction of the price.  Thought the size of the place was rather small with tables placed like a mine field in the center of the eating area. This making it difficult to maneuver of course. Had several people bump into our table trying to escape the madness. They also have stools up at the counter but they were all taken this time.  Place gets really noisy and hard to enjoy your meal. I felt like I was watching both the movie Valley Girl to the left of me and Kindergarten Cop to the right at the same time. Hmmm?  Worlds are colliding as George Costanza would say. Maybe it was just an off day. Enjoy!  3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Nice quick place to grab a salad, sandwich soup for lunch.  Tucked in the back of a shopping center, but is clean, bright and good healthy options. Large grab and go reach in refrigerator of salads, sandwiches and beverages if you are in a hurry or place an order at the front for hot sandwiches or specialties salads. Hot turkey is on wheat with peppers, pickles. Chinese chicken salad fresh greens Asian dressing, La Choy canned noodles on top and mandarin oranges. Once you order, find a table and they bring your food to your table."}
{"text":"This is a great option if you just want to grab a good lunch at Kierland without mortgaging your house. Its essentially the non-chain answer to Paradise Bakery. The restaraunt was clean and inviting. My wife had the Chef's salad which was large and had lots of meats and cheeses. I had the \"American Grilled Cheese.\". The tomatoes were fresh and ripe and the bacon was thick and cooked properly. You can also get an ice cold beer if you want. There are also some great specialty sodas available.  I would go back for lunch and I reccomend this place for anyone who doesn't want to break the bank for lunch at Kierland."}
{"text":"We usually stop in here when out and about running errands in the morning.  I really like the breakfast burrito and my husband gets either the oatmeal or the Chloe's Favorite, eggs, bacon and fruit."}
{"text":"Really cute place with lots of charm. Sandwiches only ok though,"}
{"text":"Ohhh if only I could stop ordering the Corner Chop salad, I can get around to trying some other things on the menu!!   Corner Chop: Mixed greens, red grapes, blue cheese, smoked turkey, candied pecans, poppy seed dressing.   I asked one of the employees about the carrot cake and he said it's some of the best he's ever had. \"No kidding\", he said. Of course I HAD to try it. Verdict: it may not be the multiple layer carrot cake I'm used to, but OMG was it delish!! It was indeed some of the best carrot cake ever. Tip: purchased in the refrigerated case - it's best enjoyed at room temp.   Oh, and don't forget their morning 50 cent cup of Jo.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place, its big near a light rail station and has great prices where else can you get really good coffee for just .50 cents!! pizza slices also only $3 will be studying here definitely!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chloe's Corner since it opened back in the day as \"The Counter.\"  It is probably one of my favorite lunch spots in the area.  It is quick, yet relaxed...and the food is perfect.  They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.    I usually always get the Classic grilled cheese along with a cup of their tomato soup.  I don't know what it is about this grilled cheese, because their really is nothing out of the ordinary about it, but damn they are so good.  Dip it in the tomato soup and it is a bit of heaven (or your childhood...).  When I feel like switching it up, I'll usually get the chinese chicken salad.  The chicken is shredded and the dressing (ginger-soy) is so delish....I usually end up ordering an extra side of the dressing because I like it so much.  If you are in the Kierland/Scottsdale Q area for lunch, do not hesitate one bit to come into Chloe's Corner for lunch.  It's quick, affordable, and tasty."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place, even though i'm not into bland foods like turkey sandwiches and so on, i still liked this place, the american  Grilled cheese (substitute the pork *yuk* with Turkey)  with a side of tomato soup is GREAT!, Just do the \"Dip\" and you'll love it!   A little expensive and the service is so-so, the waiters are young kids that seem like they came out of the \"Dazed & Confused\" movie set! But the cooks are hard workers!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Aside from the fact that its super busy during lunch, which isnt even a huge deal, its nearly perfect! A great variety of food, the sandwiches are great. I had the tuna melt which was beyond incredible. My sister had the grilled cheese with bacon and tomato which I had to try a bite of and it also was excellent. A friend had the soup and slice of pizza which looked great and she said was very tasty!!   Go here for a great variety, quick lunch with coworkers, friends, etc. They even have a bakery area with a blueberry muffin that I must try next time~~  Staff can be kind of rude (I am assuming it was because they are busy?) The guy who took my order could have been a bit nicer, but whatever. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I had grilled cheese and tomato soup. Nice large size sandwich with lots of gooey cheese. Soup was good and it made for a nice American classic lunch.  On the way out had to grab an blueberry/cherry oatmeal cookie - perfect finish.  Service was fast and friendly. Even if there is a line it moves quickly. Like that they had ready to go sandwiches and salads to just grab-and-go.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious. 50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele, all this in the beautiful kierland commons Good morning America"}
{"text":"Good selection of sandwiches, salads,even eggs A DELI CAFE Combination. Owner is very nice everyone is hardworking relatively clean. I came after rush hour so...."}
{"text":"Here for a conference (TPE/NASPA) and was wandering with a friend near the convention center for a place to eat dinner. Asked a gentleman working outside of a hotel if he could recommend any nearby spots. He suggested this place saying it had recently opened and had some good pizza, panini, and salad options. We decided to check it out and walked the few blocks from the convention center. It was worth it. Its kind of a neat ambiance, plenty of room and you can purchase prepackaged to go, order at \"the bar\" or choose a table inside or on the patio. For quicker service we chose the bar (its not an alcohol bar but more of a food bar, its a work conference people). There were a few sandwiches that caught my eye, but with the help of my server I finally decided on the chipotle turkey with raspberry mayo and substituted cranberry walnut bread for the ciabatta it came with. The plate came out and it was a normal loaf of bread sized sandwich stacked high with turkey and fixins with a side of pickles. My oh my was it tasty. I wasn't super hungry but I nearly finished that whole thing just because I didn't want to leave it behind. Our server, I didn't catch his name but on the receipt it says RIGHT AM, was super attentive and very friendly. All in all, a great casual place with tasty options. I only give it 4 stars for price. Almost $8 for a regular sized sandwich with no sides is just a tad steep for me. However, tummy rules all. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"I frequent Chloe's, as I work near here. Not only is it convenient and reasonably priced, the food is really good. Their sandwiches are large and ingredients are always fresh, same for the salads. They have really good breakfast options too, and offer a great cup of coffee for $.50! Their grab-n-go case is convenient if you're pinched for time. They also make one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Update   This is my second visit since my last review   The last visit I thought the less than stellar sandwich was an abnormal occurrence ...... But this visit suggested otherwise.   Ordered two BLTs. both with avocado..... Which is an extra charge.  On my companions sandwich it was literally hunt for the avocado    My sandwich was not really toasted while the other sandwich was perfect. The inconsistencies between the sandwiches led me to lower my rating.   Also I once more strongly suggest the pickles add nothing to the sandwich or the appearance of the plate.    Old review   Three of us all ordered BLT.  Bacon perfectly done and the bread was awesome     My suggestion would be ditch the pickles and add a few chips to go with the sandwich."}
{"text":"Yummmmm, went twice in one day they probably think I'm nuts, day after, went again. I'm sad this place isn't in Tucson."}
{"text":"Why do they hire bartenders that don't know liquor? We asked for Sauvignon Blanc, she proceeded to look at every single bottle label - she didn't even know it was a white wine! Other than that, the salads we had were pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and salads! If I lived closer, I would probably be here every day.  I typically order the hot smoked turkey sandwich and a cup of tomato soup. The cranberry walnut bread is soo delicious! I also loved the corner shop salad, which has poppy seed dressing, candied pecans, and blue cheese (yum!). The iced tea is fabulous and there are great dessert options- cookies, brownies, and rice krispie treats.  This place gets crowded at peak lunch times, but we can usually find a table either inside or on their patio. It's sometimes like navigating a maze to get a refill on your drink.  I keep coming back here for the awesome food, great service, and relaxed atmosphere. It's also one of the few places we can bring our pup. Some of the tables outside are approved for sitting with your dog (they have a permit on the window)."}
{"text":"Chloe's has turned into my go-to restaurant for when I am at work since I work in the Kierland Commons. Its quick and delicious! I recommend trying the chipotle raspberry turkey sandwich.   The environment in the restaurant is very cute, it can get really busy so check your timing! Totally delicious for breakfast and lunch, plus they have candy. Who doesn't love candy.   Definitely a restaurant to try but I'm warning you, its addicting."}
{"text":"A very cute place where you can eat and shop! The shop had trinkets, expensive clothes, and candy. Very random.  The food isn't too bad. I had the Counter Chopped salad ($6.25) with turkey, blue cheese, grapes, candied pecans, and a lemon poppy seed dressing. The salad ingredients were fresh, and I loved the candied pecans.   A friend had the grilled cheese sandwich. omg.. it took like 15 minutes just to get a grilled cheese.. I have no idea why the cooks took so long!! Just place a slice of American cheese in between two breads, melt, and wham! All done!   The menu doesn't have a lot of choices, but the place is crowded. Prepare yourself to fight for seats."}
{"text":"Chloe's Corner is an oasis in the desert of closed shops in downtown Phoenix!  The food was great and so was their coffee.  But what really stood out was the staff.  Each person working had a smile on their face and went out of their way to be helpful.  We sat at the counter and chatted with Malalay (sorry, I know I messed your name up) about all sorts of things.  We had such a good experience, that we returned the next morning to get a cup of coffee before heading off to the airport.  I urge you to visit this place and support a non-chain establishment.  You will no regret it!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday, I got the tuna melt and a cup of tomato soup. The prices are fair and you get a good amount of food. I was so full when I left. I signed up for their rewards program abs will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love Chloe's Corner! It's a great go to for your light lunch cravings. They have a nice spread of soups, sandwiches and salads, all prepared fresh before your eyes. The service is fabulous, this spot is a definite favorite :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good- not great. I saw it highlighted on PBS, Check Please and have wanted to try it. I got the veggie sandwich and it was good but the bread could have been better. My daughter got the chicken lemon salad and enjoyed it. I was really looking forward to our peanut butter cookie but it was practically raw inside! Very disappointed . I will be back to give it another chance next time. Very friendly stuff!"}
{"text":"I love Chloe's Corner. Like it was really good. This charming restaurant located near the Westin was the perfect place to feel like a kid again my getting a grilled cheese. After talking with the friendly staff, I realized that the sandwiches were kinda expensive but I figured, we are on vacation so its ok. Overall, great and clean. When we come back, I'll be sure to stop here again."}
{"text":"The best little secret in Kierland - great food and good prices   Today a Greek chicken pita with a Corner chop salad hit the spot. Lots of good options - even a CHICAGO hotdog - but if you want a burger go to Shake Shack or Five Guys.  Well really Five Guys as they make a better burger."}
{"text":"Corner chopped Salad is wonderful. Friendly staff and quick service. I recommend this place for a casual delicious lunch or breakfast!"}
{"text":"I stop at Chloe's Corner about once a week for a quick bite.  They do a nice business because they're the only sandwich place in Kierland Commons, for those of us who work nearby.  Like Sarah Y, I love their Egg Salad sandwiches.  It's creamy without being slopping with a hint of Coleman's mustard.  Another joy is just sitting at the counter and having a fountain drink (see photo).  Besides the Egg Salad, another one of my favorites is their rare Roast Beef sandwich (photo).  Both are delicious.  Chloe's is very reminiscent of the old days, when you could buy a sandwich at Walgreen's.  That how they started off, as a small drugstore serving sandwiches and fountain drinks back in Chicago.  Clearly they grew well beyond that concept.  For those from the east coast, it's like the old Chock-full-of-nuts coffee shops.  By the way, the soups at Chloe's are amazing.  Most of Chloe's sandwiches are in the $6.50 to $7.50 range and are delicious.  Don't forget that they also offer a freshly brewed cup of their signature coffee for only 50 cents!  A bottomless cup as they say.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax, grab a bite to eat and a drink in downtown Phoenix.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful and there are many options to choose from here."}
{"text":"We need more places like this in Scottsdale. I stopped in for breakfast Saturday morning. Ordered the Lox and Bagel..... Fantastic! And a great Value. Other reviewers have suggested that Chloes is rather pricey but I disagree. The Lox and Bagel with fountain drink came to less than $10. I would have spend $13+ at Lox Stock and Bagel, $11+ at Chompies and around $10 at Einsteins.  Also - I like how all the ingredients are nicely spread out on the plate so I can put together my sandwitch just the way I like it. And the smoked salmon was just perfect. Thicker than most but not so thick that it became flakey.   I would have given them 5 stars but they forgot to include capers even thought I asked for them. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here since it was known as The Counter - it was good then and it was amazing now.   Stopped in for a bite with Mom while visiting AZ and decided to try the Roast Beef sandwich (cold). O.M.G. It was probably the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. I couldn't even save a bite for my Mom (sorry Mom!) - just wolfed it down. I may have left a couple of pounds heavier but I enjoyed every morsel of it."}
{"text":"Cool little hipster spot but honestly not all that great pretty average sandwiches and not worth 15 bucks for a sandwich and chips"}
{"text":"I work downtown and Chloe's is by far my favorite. Every salad is amazing and the food is very fast so it's great when your in a rush! I prefer to make my own salad and enjoy the fresh ingredients. But, when I have ordered from the menu, I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich. I got a sandwich, chips, and a drink combo. It was $10. A little high for lunch, especially since it was at a counter. The price was the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 starts."}
{"text":"Shopping with my daughter and friends today at Kierland and we stopped in for a quick bite at Chloe's Corner, which is a favorite of my daughter and her high school friends. We split a tuna salad which was very fresh, made with spring mix (which I generally don't prefer) but it was very fresh and light.  Balsamic dressing, artichokes,  hearts of palm, tomatoes sliced in small quarters, easy to eat, hard boiled eggs, reminded me of a Salad Nicoise. Large enough to split between 2 for a light lunch. Just a little easy place, snack shop style, but not noisy and servers cleared our plates immediately. Then we were off for more shopping. Really liked this place. Very fair prices for good quality food."}
{"text":"A little expensive for a sandwich place and parking is tough due to the Kierland location but their service is impeccable. The food tastes great and they offer great salads and sandwiches. Their dessert bars are awesome and big enough to share easily with others. Grilled cheese and tomato soup are the mainstays. This place does great with large group orders."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, very large counter, nice service, good iced tea, for lunch I had a scoop of tuna salad on top of a caesar - it was really good.  Walking distance to convention center and the downtown area.  Also had a salad bar and a selection of take-away items, drinks, and beer."}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick and satisfying meal!  Love the loc and bagels. Yummy!  Coffee is fresh and the staff so helpful."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, some of the best sandwiches you can find anywhere. But, really what makes Chloe's are the waitress and waiters. They are all cheerful, helpful and if you become a regular (which I am as I live in Kierland Commons) they remember your name and your usual order. Try Chloe's you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"We were in downtown Phoenix at lunchtime so I searched and found Chloe's on Yelp. Impressed with the accolades, we decided to try it out. We couldn't have been more pleased with the decision.   My wife had the cold roast beef sandwich, I had the BLT, and my daughter had the grilled cheese sandwich. All the portions were large and the food was delicious. The prices were also very reasonable for the quality and the amount of food we received.   Staff was very friendly and helpful and atmosphere was great. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Formerly known as The Counter - this has always been a quick stop in for a great salad, soup or sandwich. Its a neighborhood Diner-style that looks like they would serve old-fashioned milk-shakes.....and guess what...they do! I even bought a sandwich press of my very own because of this place!! Ever since I had one of their hot pressed sandwiches I was hooked. I usually stop in here to load up before shopping at Kierland - its quick, clean and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick bite. There is a little something for everyone: a decent salad bar, coffee bar, sandwich shop, juice bar with vegan/raw treats, and a little mini grocery section with fresh fruits and snacks. I'm so glad I found this spot while I was in town. Affordable prices and a yummy selection!"}
{"text":"A cool lunch spot.  It was busy, but most places that are good are.  Food was great, tons to choose from.  Will def be back."}
{"text":"I work downtown and this is one of my go to places for a quick, fresh and fast lunch. The salad bar is always stocked with fresh ingredients, which makes it super convenient for lunch on the go.   If you've got a sweet tooth I would suggest their 7 Layer Bar or a gelato fresh baked cookie sandwich. You cannot go wrong with either.   If you are looking for a quick and casual environment for a sandwich/salad/slice of pizza, I highly recommend Chloe's."}
{"text":"The pizza was awful. The servers were fine, but the kitchen closed shortly after I arrived at 6:45pm. How is that possible? 7pm kitchen closing on a Friday. No wonder the place was empty. Maybe it's better for lunch. This place has an identity crisis, is it a convenient store, coffee shop, or restaurant? The name of the establishment doesn't help clear up the ambiguity either."}
{"text":"This place is a bit unorganized but the food makes up for it. They have some amazing breakfast sandwiches with moist fresh eggs, cheese and avocado on a lovely bun - Yummo! Lunch - just as good, fresh tuna salad on cranberry walnut bread and coconut butterscotch cookies..... amazing!!"}
{"text":"I eat from the Salad bar at the cityscape location several times a week. Every once in a while the tomatoes they put out are NOT fresh. Last week they were old and I couldn't get a hold of a manager during lunch rush to discuss.  Today 12/17 I go in and again the tomatoes are NOT fresh. They have started to wrinkle and deteriorate. I ask the manager to change them out and all he did was look at the label and say, \" they are dated 12/17, see they were cut this morning\". I WAS NOT disputing when the tomatoes were cut, but the fact that they weren't fresh which he was oblivious to. He said  he would get some more from the kitchen and returned saying I would have to wait, they don't have any more cut. ??????Really. Again he tells me it's dated 12/17, I don't know why anyone would lie about a date.etc.....AGAIN HE WAS IGNORANT TO THE FACT THE TOMATOES WERE OLD.    This is the second time I have written about the food at cityscape. No more.  You just lost a customer"}
{"text":"Five stars is based off of one meal and one meal only: grilled cheese and tomato soup. I'm officially addicted. They offer two kinds of grilled cheese: The American and The Classic. I always get the classic, but my friend, Andrew, insists American is the way to go, so perhaps next visit. The Classic is loaded with various cheeses and grilled to perfection.  Comes with a few slices of pickle. Last week I decided to add a cup of soup to my sandwich and was totally blown away. I venture to say that it's the best tomato soup I've ever had. It's very smooth, has great flavor, not too acidic.   They also have a great grab-and-go selection for those in a hurry. Chloe's offers a wide array of beverages, from freshly brewed iced teas and coffees, fountain drinks, wine and PBR (yay). And for those of you who love old school candies, like NECCO, look no further.   As for the ambiance, Chloe's Corner is always bustling with its lunch crowd and solid take out business. It's very bright inside and original, local art hangs from the walls and is available for purchase.   One day I will brave the rest of the menu. My lunch partner, Leslie, gets the tuna melt. It's her favorite."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff serving fantastic food and you can't beat the 50-cent cup of coffee - hot or iced! Great vibe - lots of regulars making their required pre-work stop or hanging out on the weekends. I love their baked goods - unique flavors for scones, muffins and cookies!"}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap meal? probably not the place to go....but for cheap coffee YES!  Great food, pretty pricey, but good quality.  Staff is excellent.  great place to grab a coffee and relax or a  quick bite as you walk around Kierland!"}
{"text":"Everyone was very friendly, and they carried one of my favorite beers of all time: Oberon! Haven't had any of the food yet, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Maybe there was only one person working at the kitchen this morning and this was the reason I got yesterday's potatoes for breakfast.. Maybe all the employees partied hard last night and they found it too hard to clean the tables, pick up trash from the floor and overall \"make it all work\", maybe the manager was depressed and he had some cruel cartoons (intended for children) running on TV,  in a place with NO children. Maybe... Maybe I will just choose a different place for Sunday breakfast next week."}
{"text":"I am on the fence on this one. One the one hand, the food is good but on the other the prices seem pretty high for just a sandwich and nothing else.This is just not my first place to go for lunch when I do treat myself out. No I am not looking for a 3 course meal but $6+ and up for just a sandwich seems a bit much. There salads are pretty good and just as expensive if not more. The service is GREAT but when you are a baller on a budget, you gotta make sure you dollar goes a long way, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of the most affordable  places in that area with great  food.   I love the Chinese Chicken Salad,  yummy!  They have the best customer service.  They are always so nice when I go there.  I'm sure they are  packed during lunch hour.  I typically take lunch between 1pm to 1:30pm to miss the rush.  I like to sit and eat there, the patio is nice.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Chloe's for years, back to when it was called The  Corner.  Unfortunately this place has really gone down hill in the last year. They seem to have new line cooks every month and that may be the problem. There is no attention to detail as in the past. I ordered a spinach salad to go. Rather than tossing the salad someone took the to go container and threw in the Pistachios and strawberries at the bottom, topped it with spinach and goat cheese then put in a clump of chicken. The BLT has always been as good as it gets. Lately they can't even toast the bread correctly and the portion is inconsistent. I see the owner in there periodically running the place. I think her brother used to manage the place but have not seen him in a while. I will try this place again as it's very convenient but I hope they do something to recapture what hey once had or I will no longer eat there nor recommend to people as I have for years."}
{"text":"So I've been watching a lot of Restaurant Impossible & Restaurant Stakeout.... and Chloe's Corner needs to be on Restaurant Staeout... I think the owner would be very disappointed in what was going on while he/she's not there... or maybe it was just a bad day.....   So my boyfriend & I made the hike up to North Scottsdale to check out this cafe. It had exactly what I was craving - turkey sandwich hot!   So when we got there we went right up to order.. there were 5 employees standing behind the cash register with their backs to us. I made eye contact with one of the employees but he continued to have his conversation with the other 4. They were laughing and joking around... After 5 minutes of standing there debating wheter to leave or not he finally asked us \"what can I get you?\".... we placed our order and sat at the bar.... Which I totally liked! You can watch your sandwich being made! Lovely!   There were about 7-8 people working... But only 2 \"honestly\" working... the other 5 were goofing around hanging out together behind the counter. The 2 that were working was the sandwhich creator and a server.... Normally I wouldn't be paying attention but the 5 that weren't working were so loud talking to each other that you couldn't help but pay attention over listen...   After waiting 10-15 minutes our sandwhiches finally came - but there was some confusion if we were eating here or taking it to go. We were eating it here - and I think that is something that they should asked us when you placing our order... maybe the employee was too distracted when taking our order that he forgot to ask...   The sandwhiches were good.... they tasted fresh! I would definitely go back to Chloe's but maybe I would get it to go or maybe I would sit outside so that I was distracted by the unmotivated wait staff..."}
{"text":"I dig this place. A nice spacious place with plenty of elbow room and a diverse sandwich lunch menu, breakfast and outstanding desserts. They have a small outdoor patio as well.  I had the turkey sandwich and it was good. My son had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I just wish the girl at the counter told me there were two different types of grilled cheese sandwiches. A traditional grilled cheese sandwich for $4.50 and a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomatoes for $6 or $6.50, my son doesn't like tomatoes. Live and learn.  So after lunch, I was checking out all the stuff on the side that was for sale such as the ice cream, candy, brownies and 7 layer dessert. On a whim I snagged the 7 layer dessert for 3 dollars plus tax. This thing was big, make that GINORMOUS. I'm guessing there there about 6 layers of delicious goodness on top of the crumbled gram cracker base. It included nuts, carmel, etc. I eat it so fast I'm going to have to make another trip to more accurately describe this dessert. My son had a GINORMOUS brownie for $3 plus tax."}
{"text":"Chloe's Corner has been my go-to place for a number of years. It allows for a great environment to dine, chat, and/or study while receiving phenomenal service from the staff. I love their array of menu options, as they convey to every type of eater. Their tea and coffee are the most affordable and best tasting beverages I can say I've had from a cafe. I will definitely continue visiting Chloe's Corner for all my cafe needs!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this wide open space and the patio would be great (weather permitting).  I had the Chinese Chicken salad  with ginger-soy dressing and loved every bit of it. The shredded chicken was just enough but probably not a full chicken breast and the salad dressing was good but could use a little punch.   The service was very quick and the staff  very friendly.  I'll be back and may just try some of the delicious looking baked goods."}
{"text":"This place was so misleading.  I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich, which was labeled as a hot sandwich on the menu, however the only thing that was hot was the toasted hamburger bun.  The chicken was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted.  Furthermore, the menu stated that the sandwich came on focaccia bread, but when my sandwich arrived it was on a egg bun, hamburger bun.  Chloe is a liar!  If you aren't going to make the sandwich that is described on the menu, then why do you even have a menu?  I'm still confused why it took 25 minutes to make a cold sandwich on a toasted bun.  You guys suck!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and got a self serve salad from their salad bar....lots of options and reasonable price. Looks like great pizzas and sandwich variety also. Cool baked goods counter that also served as a quick way to check out since the main counter had a line. Nice wide open contemporary and clean atmosphere too."}
{"text":"My mother introduced me to Chloe's Corner after I told her I had never had good tomato soup. This place changed everything!  A simple bowl of soup and a classic grilled cheese are enough to impress me. The food is made fresh in front of your eyes and everything on the menu is tasty.   For the best experience, sit up at the lunch counter. The staff will chat with you and you can see exactly where your order is.   Chloe's also has a great selection of teas, the hibiscus is awesome, and freshly baked cookies that you can take home.   Parking at the Commons can be a headache, so make sure to give yourself plenty of time to get to the cafe."}
{"text":"My wife is always yammering on about how this place is the shit; \"I really don't want to go with you to Lowe's, but as long as you're going to be in the area, can we stop at Chloe's for lunch?\" she asks, with all the countenance of a child begging for candy at a grocer's checkout.   I take my sweet-ass time in Lowe's, knowing full well what lies in store... Sitting in Chloe's for an hour, watching, as a seemingly endless procession of Scottsdale posers saunter by. All this as I sit there in my grubby work clothes, gnawing on some bunny-food salad my wife suggested.   Arrrgh.  I had a Greek salad. It was ok. My wife had the same thing only hers was different than mine. Hers had some secret ingredient that mine didn't. You'd think she'd just had a thirty-minute tantric orgasm the way she carried on.  The woman seated next to us had a laptop the size of a football field. She pretended to be working as she furtively gave everyone in the joint the once-over. Even me, for shit's sakes. (My 'fashion don't' apparel I suppose.)  Little did she know how her sneakiness skills were no match for mine. I've had a lifetime of checking out women's boobs and never getting caught, even without reflective sunglasses for Christ's sakes. What was SHE thinking? I watched as she sat there checking out everyone's shit, feigning interest in her keyboard save for occasionally, whenever anyone sensed she was gawking at them, then she'd begin typing like her life depended on it.  What a douche.  I went home afterward and fixed the smelly-ass garbage disposal, just as my wife had suggested, ahem, instructed, ahem, commanded. She's full of good ideas on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Would not go out of my way for it but considering the price and the location it is good. Reasonably priced place to eat in a very pricey area. More of a fast food restaurant than anything else."}
{"text":"I walked here for lunch from the Kierland Westin. I got the Hot Smoked Turkey. It was delicious!! I came right at 12:30 on a Monday, so it was a little crowded, but did not have to wait more than a minute or two after I ordered to find a table. Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a good sandwich or salad."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches in the area.  It would be nice to have something actually come with the sandwich to keep the plate company or to give me the option of getting a half sandwich soup or salad combo.  The layout could also use some optimization...good luck navigating through a surly line to get your drink refilled.    Those complaints are just nitpicking and won't deter me next from subsequent visits next time I have a sandwich fix."}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood spot, perfect for breakfast. Staff are warm and efficient, and the food is fresh and healthful. Coffee is really great and only $0.50! Chloe's prices are reasonable across the board, especially for Kierland. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is a pretty straight-forward breakfast/lunch place.  There is bar available so you don't have to wait in line or worry about being seated.  It's usually just the right kind of busy but not overly crowded.  Workers are efficient and seem happy.  There are just the right amount of menu items available, mostly sandwiches and salads.  Food comes out quickly is always tasty.  There is no iceberg lettuce used in any of the salads (a good thing).  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. Pretty limited menu, but you come for the cozy atmosphere & friendly people.  Dogs can hang outside.  Not your place for fancy coffee."}
{"text":"Always great with service and special requests. Paula and Kathy are so helpful and good at what they do!  Chipotle turkey sandwich is really good! Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I love Chloe's. I almost make a daily appearance, whether it's for coffee, baked goodies, my favorite smoked turkey sandwich or a quick afternoon snack. A great place for morning coffee meetings with tables in a nice open space and decent patio as far as patios in downtown Phoenix go. SUPER friendly staff and still fairly speedy service even during lunch rush hour. There's a Starbucks a few doors down, but if you choose them over Chloe's, I will be personally offended."}
{"text":"OK, so I had a meeting in the Kirland Corporate center the other morning, with a business associate and while trying to find breakfast  place after our meeting I discovered this place. Unfortunately when we got there we missed breakfast by like 7 minutes. Get there before 10am for breakfast!  So lunch it was. My self and a friend both got the turkey sandwich Mine cold and his hot. We had to trade halves cause we were both going on about how each one was awesomer then the other! These by far are probably two of the best sandwiches that were ever assembled on this planet seriously that good.   This place is worth the drive to the area and the staff was extremely friendly along with Ashly Young/Chef slash Manager or Owner I assume. In any event she was great this place was great and I highly recommend going there."}
{"text":"Tonight we stopped in here for a light dinner, not wanting to spend a fortune on food my teenager wouldn't finish.  We shared an amazing BLT. Really a great sandwich. The young lady at the table next to us had a chopped salad that I will definitely try the next time we come here.  It was very humid tonight, and we sat outside despite the many empty ables inside. Also, they serve wine by the glass, have a wide variety of sodas and waters, and have a retail section (we didn't check it out, we were too hungry.)  I will come here again."}
{"text":"While up in the area for meetings, I was in the need of a relatively quick lunch and wanted to go somewhere where I could relax for a couple minutes and have a nice solo dining experience. I found that at Chloe's Corner.   Chloe's Corner is a great lunchtime option for any of the following lunch goers:  - Solo diners  - Diners with children  - Friends eating lunch while on their lunch break  - Shoppers wanting to take a retail break and revive their systems   The atmosphere at Chloe's is that of a trendy kitchen. You order your food at the counter and can get it brought to your table (seat yourself) or you can get it to go. If you're in a hurry, they have ready-made options in the refrigerator including sandwiches and past salads. They have a large selection of drinks including retro style sodas to regular fountain drinks and even one of my favorites: Sobe diet! Sugarholics watch out because as you wait in line, small packages of candy treats stare at you and tempt you with every step. At least they did for me! But, I made it to the front without a piece of candy in hand so it was a good will power day for me. Plus, they also have a large selection of magic bars and other cookies, brownies and cakes. If I ever need a sugar fix while doing retail therapy, I know where to go!   Moving on to the food options, they have a large selection of cold and warm sandwiches, as well as salads. Plus they sell breakfast until a certain hour as well! I ended up getting the warm turkey sandwich on cranberry walnut bread with Havarti cheese, mustard and held the mayo. The bread was delicious and complimented the items inside. It doesn't come with any sides, but the sandwich was filling enough in itself.   My sandwich and soda ended up being $10 so it's not cheap and not over the top either. The only reason I would say it's a little pricey is for the fact that the sandwich doesn't come with any side, not even a little cup of fruit. However, the sandwich was good and if I am in the area during lunchtime again I would probably stop by."}
{"text":"Co-workers introduced me to this amazing place last summer and now I bring all my family and friends here every chance I get!! Everything is absolutely delicious, from the cookies to lemon squares to turkey sandwiches to the BEST grilled cheese on the planet. Good prices and the staff is always friendly so I would recommend Chloes for a quick lunch or early dinner =)"}
{"text":"Delicious, perfect place for breakfast or lunch. I highly recommend the antipasto salad, .50 iced coffees, chorizo burrito or the egg sandwich.  Mmmmmm mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches(turkey) and salads(chinese chicken).   I'm also a big fan of their tea."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a quick bite after volleyball  The girls working were all sort of \"eh\" and today's service was just not good by any means... Each girl seemed to have an attitude It was odd  I ordered a hot roast beef sandwich with chips and a soda and I kindly asked where the chips were... And the girl was smug and said \"they're around the restaurant and down below\"   Then I was going to get soda and wash my hands so I placed my # by the register and she yelled \"You have to carry that with you\"  Okay....  In case my food were to come out that minute, I could have it delivered to the soda station?   The place was empty enough already  I sat at bar and my plate came, the men in the kitchen were nice....  As I ate, no one cared to check on me or offer my anything else  But whatever I was hungry so I ate my food, drank my soda and cleaned up after myself...  I might go back... Might..."}
{"text":"I started visiting Chloe's Corner years ago because they have 50 cent coffee that they brew fresh all day. I kept going because of the staff that works there. Eli has worked there for years, and he has made it his personal mission to greet every customer with a huge smile and a kind word to brighten their day. He is truly a gem, as is the rest of the staff.  The food is Chloe's is quick casual, with an additional little mini grocery that offers a huge variety of drinks and quick pick up salads , sandwiches, fruit, and desserts.  They offer breakfast and lunch made to order with a ton of great options.  For breakfast, I recommend their chorizo and egg breakfast burrito served in a spinach tortilla with a green sauce on the side. I add Chullula to kick it up a notch. The bacon egg breakfast sandwich is also a hit! For lunch, they make a great variety of salads and sandwiches. My faves are the Greek salad with added chicken, and the Chinese Chicken salad.  If you're wanting comfort food, they make an excellent tuna melt. If it's rainy and you're wishing you were home in bed, and really wanting comfort food , get the grilled cheese sandwich with homemade tomato basil soup. It hits the spot perfectly.  Chloe's is open from 7 a.m. -6 p.m. daily, except on Sundays when they close at 4."}
{"text":"Used to work at the Anthropologie right next to here, so this place was super convenient.   I really wish I liked this place more, but I always leave thinking ehh, that was alright. The restaurant itself is very cute, usually a pretty steady flow of customers. I can't recall everything I have ordered there, but I do remember the veggie sandwich. This place is not at all pricey, but $6.50 for a very simple, boring sandwich I could have just as easily made at home? No thanks.   I would be down to come back, its just not exactly a fave."}
{"text":"Glad to see that something came in when Oakville left.  The salads are all good, the pizza a bit more hit or miss but they do make a really good grilled cheese, and if there is tomato soup that day, all the better.  The good news for those who were at Oakville is that there is still a great bakery counter filled with goodies from all over including Essence Macaroons and Julia Baker chocolates.  Eat healthy at Chloe's and then head over to the bakery counter :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be incredible. It was a throwback deli type cafe that had the best chicken salad. Not sure if it is under new management but it really went down hill.  First, the awesome chicken salad is just OK. Secondly, they totally changed the portions. The sandwich had a tiny layer of salad with huge buns, where all you taste is bread. I ordered lox and a bagel. They first just brought out a bagel, and when I told the girl I ordered lox and a bagel she seemed confused. 5 minutes later she brought out a couple tiny pieces of salmon. What a rip off! I would stay away from this place now."}
{"text":"Like all Fox eateries you can expect the best. Grilled cheese to DIE for! Cheap coffee, great food, great service, great environment. Formerly know as \"the counter,\" Mr Fox renamed it after the birth of his daughter Chloe. You can feel the family vibe when you sit at the counter and order your \"counter chopped\" salad or \"hot roast beef\" sandwich."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant while running errands one day. Their service is top notch and the sandwich I ordered was perfect and filling for the price. A must try if you are looking for a quick bite in the Kierland area!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy that this place moved in to what was Oakville Grocery. They still have the coffee bar so that makes me a happy camper. They also still have the coolers with pre-packaged food and drinks.  They now have a diner-style set-up in the center where you can order breakfast (GREAT SUCCESS) or lunch and dine at the counter. At the far end are some tables and chairs if you don't feel like taking your meal at the counter.   I had an awesome BLT for lunch that left me full and satisfied(the bacon was AWESOME). Additionally they have some other tasty-looking sandwiches and salads and soups which I'm eager to try. Their breakfast looks tasty too (more of that yummy bacon!).......God knows Downtown needs more breakfast options so this is a great addition to Cityscape after Oakville's crash and burn."}
{"text":"This is a great place to sneak in a meal, a meeting, and, of course, a $.50 cup of coffee. It's almost like being transported to NYC with its cozy diner feel and not-so-Scottsdale prices. A meal is easily less than $10, and you can even finagle something less than $5 if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Stopped in this AM for a cup of coffee.  It was only 50 cents and it tasted great!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place! Whenever we are shopping at Kierkland Commons we stop here for lunch.  You order at the counter and your food is brought out to you.  We like to sit outside and people-watch whenever we can.  It's a great location.  My favorite is the Corner Chopped Salad ~ I get it everytime and it is amazing.    My daughter gets the classic grilled cheese and a cup of tomato soup.  Perfection!  Friendly service, delicious good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to sit outside with the dog and have a bite.  The coffee is still the best deal in town."}
{"text":"I ordered a double cheddar cheese grilled sandwich on marbled rye, it was so good and arrived with 3 dill pickled slices. The cup of creamy tomato soup was a perfect compliment. I thoroughly enjoyed lunch and will return again.  Hub liked his cup of chili and pesto chicken panini."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since this place was reviewed... and probably just as long since my last visit.  In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously 'The Counter') and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating.  Future yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloe's Corner a high end restaurant... it's more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  It's the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when it's ready.  It's also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go...  We both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other 'classic' items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc...  Even more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  I'm so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be!  Although I did like this place when it was \"The Counter,\" it looks to me like the change that Fox Restaurant Concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!"}
{"text":"Each visit to Chloe's makes me happy. The space recalls an urban deli yet is spacious, cheery and sun-drenched like all the best of Arizona. I almost always get the grilled cheese and tomato soup even when it's 100 degrees outside, and never regret it. The grilled cheese is comfort food at it's best with lots of gooey cheese on fresh buttered grilled bread, and the tomato soup is the best anywhere - just the right acidity and balance of light and heavy."}
{"text":"Much like their location at Kierland, it's a great spot for lunch. They have a huge salad bar & a refrigerated case for quick options. The Corner Chop salad is a meal in itself, or great to split in addition to a sandwich. My favorite sandwich I've tried so far is the chicken salad.  On the pricey side, but great food & nice ambiance during the day."}
{"text":"Chloe's Corner is a great pit stop when hunger takes over after a day of shopping.  I'd walked past a few times & finally went in for lunch last week. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich for $8 & it was brought out within a couple minutes. I thought it was a good size portion & was really good.  It's a great place for grab & go meals, quick dine-in meals & coffee breaks."}
{"text":"Chloe's is one of the best new restaurants to hit downtown! I've visited several times for lunch and cannot say enough good things about Chloe's. They are just consistently good. And, the nice thing about this restaurant is they are great for a quick grab-and-go as well as a leisurely lunch.  The salad bar has veggies and extras that have always been nice and fresh...nothing that looked like it was sitting out for too long. The sandwich menu has a great variety. I've had the chipotle-raspberry turkey sandwich. It had just the right amount of spice and spread. Also, the ciabatta roll it was served on was not too hard as ciabattas can be sometimes.  As far as desserts, they have a wonderful selection of those too. I've had the chocolate snickerdoodle and triple chocolate chip cookies. The chocolate snickerdoodle is something I've never seen before and is so much more delicious than the traditional snickerdoodle. The triple chocolate chip was not lacking in chips. It was just the right texture as well...not dry, but a firm cookie with a good chew to it.  I really can't praise Chloe's enough...it is certainly worth trying and going back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant to grab lunch or a late afternoon cup of tea. The staff is always super friendly and they have a fantastic salad bar. I will miss hanging out here between classes now that I'm finished with law school."}
{"text":"Very hip new addition to Cityscape! Wide open ware house type space with high ceililngs, concrete floors, big breakfast bar with butcher block counter and low bar stools. Lots of family style table seating and a coffee bar all in the same space. Prices are reasonable ($7-8 for great salads) and thin sliced pizza. The wait staff was extremely attentive and imformative. A winner!"}
{"text":"I love this place and a great location nestled in Kierland. The food is always great and so are the people. I can't say enough about this place. Honestly, I have never had a bad meal here. Try it and you will see what a great place this is to get a quick meal."}
{"text":"My weekly coffee spending has gone from $22  to $3 thanks to the 50 cent 12ounce house deal. The 16oz will cost you $1.90 and every so often I'll go with two 12 oz cups for a buck; more product- better deal. Now that's fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and I think they are on to my little scheme. I hope they don't cut me off."}
{"text":"Love this place the staff and the food...love the ambiance.  You'll never go wrong eating here....the salads and soups are wonderful.  Love that you can eat outside IF you can get a table and the weather is good."}
{"text":"Amazing Tomato Soup and Corner Chop (salad!)  One of my favorite joints in downtown. Service is pleasant. Food is always fresh. There are lots of drink and dessert options."}
{"text":"Good bread and pizza crust.  Seemed a bit spendy."}
{"text":"I walked to Chloe's Corner while on a break from Jury Duty.  I ordered the tuna melt and a bowl of tomato soup.  The sandwich was huge and melty and gooey.  It hit the spot.  The tomato soup was sort of thin, but the flavor was top notch.  The price point was very affordable.  If I worked downtown, I'd be here all the time.  The food was so good, that when I walked back to the courthouse and got released from Jury Duty immediately, I wasn't even angry that they could have released us before lunch."}
{"text":"I will still call it the Counter, because I'm the curmudgeonly type that is sometimes slow to accept change.  (Who is Chloe?  Fox Restaurants need not have changed the name just to eliminate the boutique...)  The food has always been tasty.  The split pea soup is absolutely amazing.  The hot turkey sandwich is delicious, the chopped salad is a spot-hitter.  I don't think the prices are too terribly high, after all, it's in Kierland, which isn't exactly a discount enclave.  The service.  Ah, the service.  First, let me spare the hard workers in my tirade.  The cooks, and those who actually are putting together food and cleaning, do a fabulous job.  The servers - or register-runners, have been incredibly disappointing.  They invoke this kind of back-story imagery:  \"Mom!  My gas card didn't work, I almost didn't make it to Dana's party, I mean, can you imagine if I would have run out of gas, and had to talk to a commoner??  Wtf, Mom!\"  \"Shannon, your father and I decided that you need to pick up a part-time job, we will still pay for your BMW, your insurance, your condo, your cable, your birth control, your health insurance and your part-time college education, but we think it's time you worked about 8 hours a week.\"  \"OMG!  This is soooo ridiculous and unfair, Mom, wtf!\"  And that is how Shannon (name made up) came to work at The Counter.  And that is why she sucks at service.  And that is why she doesn't appreciate how hard the rest of us work to purchase an $8- sandwich, and how a simple smile, some humor, and a \"thanks for coming in\", or \"how is everything tasting today\", could make such an enormous difference in someone's dining (albeit counter style) experience.    Instead, after ordering the Chopped Salad and the Pea Soup from \"Shannon\", the cook brought me my soup, and I enjoyed it.  And I waited.  And waited.  There was no ticket, there was no chopped salad in the works.  (The prep area is fully visable.)  I graciously asked the cook if there was an order in for a chopped salad, and she said, \"oh no, I'm so sorry, let me make one on the fly for you!\".  She did, I ate, it was delicious, and I thanked her.  \"Shannon\" then presented me with my bill a full few minutes after I sat in front of an empty plate, I paid, and as she handed me my change she said, \"bye.\"  I don't think I need to elaborate on that.    So - to the Shannon's of the world - hurry up and get a rich boyfriend and become a trophy wife so the rest of us don't have to deal with your shitty service, bad attitude and hateful unsmiling demeanor.  And to the awesome cooks and service folks out there who manage at least a smile, bless you.  Bless you, every one."}
{"text":"I was in the area and found this place on yelp,  the atmosphere is clean and comfortable, lots of options from salads, hot and cold sandwiches, soups and desserts and all super fresh.  The staff was super friendly.    I ordered the tomato soup and it was excellent, hot and fresh. Chocolate chip cookie was great. My bagel was fresh, lots of cream cheese and lox, capers, tomatoes and onions on the side.   This is one place I'm looking forward to going back to."}
{"text":"For my 1000th review, I decided to choose Chloe's Corner.  I've been here a few times and really enjoy coming here for breakfast on my day off.  Located in Kierland Common,  I love how convenient it is to a large parking lot and garage.....easy in/out access.  I also love the counter seating option.....makes for a very quick meal and comfortable for dining alone.  My two favorite dishes here are the Chorizo and Egg Burrito, $6.00 and the Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Bacon, Mayo, Cheese), $6.50. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=eHfPsCEtTbF1_xC8RoWe4A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=1OXc4iFyfif-X4YZl0O2mw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw?select=fxHDSdlPpvOJXGviWzt1YA  They're both very simple dishes, but done very well.  The Eggs are prepared scrambled in both dishes with the right proportion of Meat.  Their homemade Salsa goes really well with the Burrito....I just wish it was spicier...although my tastes are on the spicier side than most people.  The portion size of these dishes are just right too, not too much and not too small....I don't need to order 2 dishes to feel full and 1 dish doesn't leave me feeling guilty.  As a bonus, the service here is great.  They're always friendly and spot on making sure my Coffee cup stays full or that I'm satisfied before they give me the check.  It's not one of those places that sets your check in front of you while you're eating.....it's one of my Pet Peeves when dining out.  Overall, I really enjoy coming here.  I look forward to my next visit.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I enjoy all of the food here. Chloe\"s has a good selection. I especially like the fresh tasty delicious salads as well as sandwiches.  The prices are very reasonable.  I love the casual atmosphere.  The service is fast and the staff is friendly.  I come here often."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Went for brunch and at 10:32 while in line counter guy said no more breakfast. \"Breakfast ends at 10:30\". We left and so did two other groups in line. Not a great customer service philosophy."}
{"text":"Really great little place! Had the broccoli cheese soup with the hot turkey sandwich and had to eat every scrumptious bite! They have a quick grab and go section with pre-prepared items also if you need something quick. Friendly staff! Will be looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"The food here is tasty enough, but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere. That is literally the only good thing I have to say about Chloe's Corner. I have been here several times and each time I have been here the staff has been incredibly rude and unhelpful.   Their menu is a little pricey for the mediocre quality and limited variety of their menu.   Also, the last time I was at Chloe's corner the roof was leaking on the table. Not cool."}
{"text":"Travelling for work, I stopped into this restaurant for lunch.  Lots of options.  I got the turkey sandwich which was ok.  The bread was a little too greasy.  Wish they had put more things in the sandwich.  Spacious place with lots of seating.    Crazy DJ playing club music in the courtyard at lunchtime was kinda awkward.  He is apparently a regular."}
{"text":"Finally got here for breakfast. Egg sandwich was as good as everyone told me.  Not a coffee drinker but saw all the folks coming in to get the great, low cost cup of joe. Great way to fuel up for some last minute holiday shopping."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant Downtown.  You can eat at the bar, sit on a table or order to go. Service's usually fast. You wait in line (yes, it's that good, they have lines, specially at lunch time), you pay and then you wait for your food :)  Their food is tasty and their selection's good enough that you can find something you will like for sure. They serve breakfast, soups, pizzas, salads, sandwiches... You can also make your own salad and they'll weigh it and charge you accordingly. Nice selection of drinks (wine, too!) and desserts.   If you want a sandwich with chips and a drink you'll spend like $10-$12. It can be overpriced for some but the ambiance at Chloe's corner's so nice so it's worth it! I usually order the chicken pesto sandwich or the chipotle raspberry turkey. Can you spell YUMMYLICIOUS!! I believe their sandwiches are a little bit smaller than they used to be but that's still OK.  They're great with groups too which is a problem when we want to celebrate a birthday (we work Downtown) and you can call in advance and they'll reserve a table for you. Kudos to their staff. Everybody's super nice!!  They used to have coffee for 50c (yes, that's two quarters!!!) but not anymore :( Their coffee's good but for $1,50 it's not a deal anymore since that's what you pay anywhere else Downtown.   Right now they also sell gelato which, let me tell you, I don't eat much ice cream but their gelato's to die for!   And do me a favor, order a toffee chocolate cookie! I like them so much, I've started baking them at home myself because I can't afford buying one cookie a day, ha! (I probably shouldn't either but their cookies are absolutely delicious!!)."}
{"text":"A great place to go after working out at the Gold's Gym. Yummy healthy food and TONS of beverage options. Plus I heard they have a room for yoga tucked in there somewhere."}
{"text":"The place is cute, I'd enjoy eating inside if it weren't so crowded all the time.  My favorite is the hot roast beef sandwich. I love how crispy it is on the outside and when you bite in, you hear the crunch and sink into the hot melted cheese, tomatoes, and roast beef. The coffee is pretty good as well for a the standard cup of coffee, it's only 50 cents.  Everything else I've tried is just okay though. I've tried different sandwiches, salads, breakfast items. Nothing special. The cookies are okay, muffins are a bit above average. They have some interesting muffin flavors (banana blueberry, ginger orange, cranberry, I think it varies each day). I tried their tomato soup, it was okay.   The people who work here are so nice though, A+ on the service."}
{"text":"Had albacore tuna salad two days in a row.  Outstanding food and wonderful workers. This is a gem for both food and price!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 great salads.  the salads here are kinda amaze. the chop has everything in it, but isn't just a kitchen-sink kinda dish - it still works. the cookies are also nom, in case  you are inclined to order one to break over your salad...not that i do that. the only down side is the wait time sometimes, which may be because they remake your order, or they can't find you. maybe they'll rethink some of the last prep station staffing, because it seems there's always a group of staff there, but the food isn't coming out any faster."}
{"text":"Fresh, coffee some of the cheapest in Scottsdale. Don't be fooled by cheap price though very high quality and hot or iced hits the spot everytime.Staff is always nice and professional some times a line early morning but, they get through it fast."}
{"text":"I have worked in the area for a few years and not only do they offer affordable lunch options but they are always kind. I suggest the toffee chocolate chip cookies, my favorite!"}
{"text":"It's a good lunch spot for downtown phx.  I get it, I work a couple of days down by CityScape... but today I wanted to grab lunch with my mom and kids so we decided to drive in park under ground and head up to Chloe's Corner.   The food was fresh and tasty, atmosphere amazing..but no highchairs.. Come on I know you are geared towards the business lunch, but kids do live in the city.  They said they were on order and also no kids menu.  At least a kids size and priced grilled cheese. I would come again and try breakfast once they get a high chair!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are based solely on food. I admit I've never stepped foot into this place. A few sandwiches have been brought back to my office, each time not fulfilling my mid-day hunger attack. The main problem I have is the price. You basically get what seems to be a couple slices of souped-up Wonderbread with some Safeway-quality lunch meats then cooked with a George Foreman Grill. I think the prices are about $8 --- if they offer a 50% off special then go for it."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix yesterday and looking for a basic breakfast place downtown. What I found at Chloe's was so much more than basic! I had Chloe's favorite, which was amazing in presentation and taste. If you are looking for a groovy, tasty place to eat, go to chloes.... It's wonderful! Right on, man!!"}
{"text":"We came by for brunch. This place was a lot bigger than I had expected. I love the open floor plan.   There wasn't much of a crowd but we decided to sit at the counter. I ordered a raspberry iced tea and a chipotle-raspberry turkey sandwich. I really enjoyed my sandwich! It was perfectly proportioned and the spread was very tasty.   A surprising factor, I'm not big on anything spicy but when my coworker had asked for Sriracha, she told me it was rather sweet. I didn't believe her so I tried it myself. I think it was their own special version. It was on the slightly sweeter side with a kick. Yum. Definitely ask for this sauce!"}
{"text":"Yearly trip to Scottsdale for he 4th and promised this was the year i grab a sandwich at this allegedly 4 star yelp stop. Popped in with my daughter and we both wanted the smoked turkey and cranbury on cranburry. Off the hook.  Great sandiwch, fresh ingredients, superb bread...ALL good.. New yearly stop. If you wanta top notch sandwich this the place."}
{"text":"Not bad! Just stopped by for a lunch. Grabbed a caesar salad with a side of bacon. High quality food, but at a bit of a high price! My sister's sandwich, side of bacon (just 2 strips :(, but very good), my caesar salad, and 2 small drinks came to 21 bucks! I felt around 15 would be more appropriate.  Overall though, I felt the food was of high quality and it was a relaxing atmosphere! Felt like the La Grande Orange of North Scottsdale. I'll definitely be back, I want to try one of their shakes!   P.S: Service was friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I like the place but be careful what you order. I had the hot smoked turkey sandwich with melted havarti cheese. It was delicious. Wife had cold smoked turkey sandwich and it wasn't very good. The cranberry walnut bread was dry and tasteless. For dessert we shared a scone and a cookie. Both were excellent. We each had a cup of coffee which was better than Starbucks coffee. The staff are helpful and very pleasant. We sat outside and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"No wifi?  I'm not even sure what to say to that!  Food is fairly good, staff is somewhat friendly.  But, I would pick Wildflower over this 1000 times based on food & WiFi alone.   The funny thing about the WiFi is that I can almost pick up the signal from Anthropogy...a clothing shop. :/"}
{"text":"We've been here three times now and two times I've ordered the hot roast beef sandwich. To me, it's a comfort food. There's roast beef, cheese, mustard, and tomatoes. Nothing fancy (except I do request Havarti), but it is so good. The husband has had the Greek salad, both with and without chicken. It's good - the dressing isn't over powering (as some places can be). We've also tried their triple chocolate cookies - which are delicious.  There's seating both inside and out, both being crowded at the lunch time rush. The line can be long, but the service is quick and everyone is real nice. Parking for this place can be tricky, since it is in the Kierland shopping area, but it's really about timing.   If you are ever in the area, definitely check it out. It's cute and the food is great. This is one of our favorite lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Highly recommended.  Plus you can walk from the Kierland for a decent priced breakfast."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time today and unfortunately, I will not be back. The food was delicious (hence the 2 stars) but the service was awful, and that is saying something when it is not even a full service restaurant. The manager does not seem to know how to handle mistakes when they are made and is not good at dealing with the customers. I am really sad because there were so many interesting things on their menu that I wanted to try."}
{"text":"I work downtown just across from City Scape. This is generally my go-to place for lunch. Walking long distances in high heels is not my forte. Anyway, the Chinese Chicken Salad is the best. I normally receive excellent service here, but the last few times I have gone in the service hasn't been up to par, and the last time I went in I ordered my salad in advance so I can just pay and leave, and the girl said my order was never placed. She never said sorry, just said it would be a few. They were not busy at the moment, so that's whatever.  Love the space, though. Nice and big!"}
{"text":"You had me at the 50 cent coffee. Fast and friendly service for breakfast. Perfectly crisp bacon and scrambled eggs done to perfection."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!  We order fro mwork all the time!! everyone is friendly  and and the food is just ..uhm PHENOMENAL!!!  Great people watching location as well as perfect pit stop for shopping fuel.   Off to pick up my order now!!!"}
{"text":"In a place like Kierland Commons, where the lower end eateries are PF Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory, it's nice to have a quick and cheap option to grab a quality lunch.  Chole's Corner fits perfectly into the urban lifestyle concept of this shopping center.  It reminds me a lot of the sandwich shops you can find on a random street in a Chicago or New York Neighborhood.  Order your food at the counter, seat yourself, they'll bring it to you when it's ready.  If you're in a hurry, grab some of the refrigerated ready-made options.  The hot and cold sandwiches, the soups and salads are all fresh and delicious.  I've never had any of the treats or breakfast offerings, but I'm sure it's just as good as lunch.  I've also never ordered the grilled cheese, but have been told it is nothing short of amazing.  The most expensive item on Chole's Corner's menu is $7.75.  No sides are included, but the portions are perfect.  You can enjoy a good lunch for about $10 if you include a drink.  My only disappointment about this place is that it closes at 6:00pm.  I understand that it's a lunch and breakfast spot, but why not stay open an extra hour to catch a shopper who just ran into one of the stores to pick something up on the way home from work?"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!  It's super cute and you get full service anywhere you are sitting, whether it'd be outside or at the bar. Service is super friendly! The BF and I got the ceasar salad with chicken, tomato soup, a slice of pizza, and pastrami sandwich. Everything was great! Very satisfying. I especially enjoyed the Pizza and it was the pizza of the day too. It had bacon bits on it and it was oh so satisfying! Yummy!!!!  Service was great with refills and very attentive staff. I would definitely come back if it were only to get the pizza."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or breakfast. Lots of open seating indoor and out.  Internet access and great customer service.  Someone will consistently come to your table and ask if you need anything else - even if you're there for a couple of hours working away."}
{"text":"The prices are high the food is ok. I had a sandwich a bag of chips and a glass of tea total was $12.33. It was way too pricey for a lunch."}
{"text":"While window shopping at Kierland today with my sister, I felt the familiar hunger pains that usually come around after a long day of walking around  in the heat looking at expensive things. I wasn't really in the mood to sit down somewhere fancy in Kierland and spend a ton of money so my sister suggested The Counter. The Counter is somewhat hidden down a street diagonal from Anthropolgie, but it was full of people which is always a good sign. The best way I can describe The Counter is a chic cafe with much more than food. The Counter offers a nice open and light environment with a counter for ordering and eating at as well as tables inside and outside. It also offers fun quirks such as a candy counter, jewelry, women's designs, and home decor to name a few. I was also happy to find a wall with phoenix magazines which I borrowed while I was waiting for my meal.     After taking a look at their hand written menus above the counter I decided on a Albacore Tuna Salad which includes field greens, albacore tuna salad, hard boiled egg, hearts of palm, tomato, and balsamic vinaigrette. I also picked up a drink from their huge selection of beverages which included but are not limited to: vitamin water, iced teas, sobe, sodas, naked juice, energy drinks,and assorted waters.  I picked a table and relaxed with my magazines until my salad was ready. The salad was really tasty and I was surprised how well the tuna went with balsamic vinaigrette. It was a nice portion size and I wasn't even able to finish it. The Counter also offers sandwiches, soup, pastries, coffee, milkshakes, and wine by the glass. I really enjoyed my experience in every aspect and I'm sure my Kierland munchies will find me there again soon!"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER and so extremely unsanitary! I went to lunch with my boss and co-workers and somehow our order got messed up even though the gal taking our order repeated the order back to us and repeated every sandwich we ordered.  It appears one of the cooks missed one our sandwiches and we only got four instead of five.  Then the manager came over and said we only paid for four and that's why we didn't get it.  He then said they would make her sandwich right away and that we didn't have to pay for it.  Then when they brought her sandwich they brought the wrong order, it was someone else's sandwich instead of hers.  When they placed the sandwich on the table my co-worker touched it and then realized it wasn't hers.  So she told the person who brought it, who then proceeded to pick up the same sandwich and take it to another table and serve it to someone else even though my co-worker had touched it - so EXTREMELY unsanitary.  Finally my co-worker's sandwich arrived after the rest of us had finished eating.  About five minutes later the manager comes over and hands us a bill for the sandwich and said we now had to pay even though it was their error to begin with and he said we didn't have to pay before."}
{"text":"This place was truly busy the other day and we were lucky to get a table. Guess they are doing very well and so they should. This is definitely one of the better quick lunch spots you will find. To update the Spinach Salad is very good and there were some cool photo prints and artwork for sale on the walls that was not there the last time."}
{"text":"I always forget about this tucked away little lunch spot in Kierland. Today I bought the tuna melt which comes on their cranberry and walnut bread. Oh my. What a treat that was! I love tuna but I'm not often a fan of fancy bread. Consider me amazed. I also had to treat myself and get a lemon bar. Shame on me... But it tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Looks cute and all, but seems like a bunch of amateurs running this place! I asked if I could sit at a table instead of the counter. Of course! The server says. Then I sit and wait over 5min before I finally get the attention of another waitress who tells me I have to order at the counter and then I can sit at my table. Oh, that would have been helpful to know when I walked in. They only serve scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs that have obviously been sitting under a heat lamp and are NOT made to order. The oj was also old and very tart tasting. Guess I'll pay $18 for eggs at my hotel tomorrow. Gladly."}
{"text":"Great sidewalk cafe breakfast & lunch foods, such as; awesome salads, hot & cold sandwiches, and nice small breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in Scottsdale. Both hot and cold sandwiches are unparalleled. My favorite cold sandwiches are roast beef, BLT chicken salad and tuna salad.  Fave hot is pastrami. Ask for sauerkraut if you want a reuben.  Salads are fab too."}
{"text":"We have been coming for years!  My favorite is the chorizo egg burrito. People think parking is tricky but it's not. There is a large lot just across the street. I highly recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot in Kierland! The staff is so nice, and they have a variety of quick and homemade lunches, drinks, and fruit to go! Their iced coffee is also *drumroll please* ONE WHOLE DOLLAR! And delicious, and they have a corner where you can add vanilla or hazelnut creamer. Or regular cream + sugar.  You can see why I'm in love. Their lemon chicken salad is delicious, but my absolute favorite item is the tuna melt. It's amazing. It comes with pickles. Order it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful day to eat on the patio. This place is nice. Cold and hot sandwiches, fresh tasty food. Generally Inexpensive for the area, (kierland commons). Lots of options for picky people. Overall nice place, with great location."}
{"text":"Now working in downtown Phoenix, I have to say this is the place of my lunch meeting dreams. Not only can I make my own salad and do the grab and go... but I can have a sit down lunch meal too!   Their patio is small but a nice place to catch up with friends or business people.   I know I will be back... probably more than I should be."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a coworker here a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed it. It's one of those places that I've heard a lot about but have just never been. We were luckily able to grab a parking spot at Kirkland and waited in line, which wasn't too long considering the lunch rush. Plus they have a lot of knick knacks for you to look at while you're waiting. I had a bowl of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich. If you do this combo, I would recommend getting a cup of soup as the bowl is giant. Both were really good, my coworker had the same and also enjoyed it. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Chloe's is a perfect lunch spot for the price. The shop itself has a positive atmosphere without the snobby Scottsdale air about it and the food is dirt cheap. I'm not sure how they make such great sandwiches for $7 but I plan on going back repeatedly. Be sure to check them out if you want to relax for lunch."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make. I am addicted to coffee. That's how this all started. Rumors surfaced that there existed a magical place near Kierland Commons that served $.50 cups of coffee. Surely such a place couldn't make a profit off of so little. And if it did, the coffee must be terrible. It turns out that such a place DOES exist and the coffee is amazing. (Iced coffee is a $1.00 -- to all the negative reviews about iced coffee being $1.00 REALLY?! That's what your're going to be upset about? If you can find me cheaper and better iced coffee I would love to hear about it. I'll wait....)  Anyway back to the important things. The food is also really good. I recommend any of the hot sandwiches especially the American grilled cheese and the chicken pesto.   The service is really why I will be coming back. They are the nicest and sweetest people to be around. Ask for Eli and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place does NOT get enough credit for its fast, friendly service, and tasty quality menu items at fair downtown prices. The pastries are the best downtown, and I grab coffee or lunch at least twice a week. I've even brought the kiddos down on a weekend, and they were happy with grilled cheese. I love that I can order at the counter, from the diner style bar seating, or just grab something quick from the cases."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Chloe's and was so excited after I found out about their 50 cent iced coffees. I would come several times a week as my work is right across the street so it was super conveninent and good to my wallet. They have the same people that work there every morning and some are definitely friendlier/more approachable than others. I went maybe two weeks without going and then went in the first week of May with my 50 cents in change and after I ordered, they told me it would be $1.00! I know it seems petty to complain about paying $1.00 for coffee when the Starbucks in the same shopping center charges $3.00 but how do you double in price without even notifying your clientele? The sign outside still says 50 cents, too!  I decided to go back (and had proper change this time) two weeks later and the two guys in front of me that ordered their iced coffees were charged 50 cents so I assumed they went back to their original price. I ordered (next to them and at a different register) and of course, mine was rung up for $1.00. I didn't want to cause a scene asking why they were charged 50 cents and I was charged $1.00 at 8 in the morning with a bunch of people around so I paid my dollar, noticed the sign outside STILL says 50 cents and walked my unsatisfied self out.   Unfortunately this might be my last iced coffee from Chloe's."}
{"text":"Always super amazing homemade food. Best tomato soup ever! The staff is really really friendly  too. Only thing keeping me from giving Chloe's 5 stars is that my orders have been screwed up a few times ... So I suggest checking it before you leave, but you'll probably still end up with something delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after some shopping, was hoping for a better experience.  The music was load both inside and out, it was a little too hot to sit outside so we sat inside and needed to wear our jackets very very cold.  Some items on the menu are overpriced.  The milkshakes which are average size sell for $4.75 and they do not use good ice cream but rather ice cream with lots of preservatives, was hoping they would use Breyer's or Haagen Daz but they chose to go with a less expensive unhealthy brand like Dreyer's so we opted to pass on the milkshakes.  There is not wait staff, you order at the register and they bring you your food... The Spinach salad was very tasty with fresh spinach, strawberries, blueberries, pistachios and goat cheese.  I went specifically to try the spinach salad and it did not disappoint.  Also had the American grill cheese which is over-priced @ $7.00 and very very salty...the grill cheese sandwich we had should sell for $4.00 if that much, very very boring.  overall it was a good salad nothing was wow, the cookies - triple chocolate and toffee chocolate both were super super sweet.  I expected a old fashion place so was a little disappointed with them.  The spinach salad was good just be very careful when you eat it as mine had a shell from the nuts and the shells can break your teeth.  The sandwiches do not come with anything and they really should come with chips or something, the sandwich looked so lonely on the plate...lol"}
{"text":"The only spot in downtown PHX that isn't a chain and has good sandwiches. I like the market concept. Now if only the rest of downtown could follow suit and get its act together..."}
{"text":"Soo good! This place is perfect for a casual lunch. Their sandwiches are so amazing! Really good chips and a good selection of drink choices & delicious milk shakes!"}
{"text":"I brought my little sister here for lunch because her name is Chloe and I thought it was kind of funny (because I'm lame like that) and I wasn't overly impressed. Chloe ordered a salad and I ordered a hot turkey sandwich. We grabbed a little table outside and it was very nice that outdoor seating was available. Our food came in a reasonable amount of time, but I was somewhat surprised that the only thing that came with it was a couple of pickle slices (yuck!). My sandwich was good and Chloe said her salad was good as well. I just found that it was nothing special and I thought it was a little overpriced to be honest. With a couple bucks added on the tip line, our two meals and two bottles of pop was over $25. I guess I was just somewhat surprised when I was done eating and kind of thought, \"that was it?\" I've been back again and my reaction each time was similar. Underwhelmed. If your rich and have money to spend on sandwiches, this is a great place to go. I just like to have something when I go out that I can't make at home."}
{"text":"The coffee is good, but they keep raising the prices. Also, mostly ice. It's annoying that they say out from 50 cent cup of coffee!! (which is how much it used to be a year ago) and you go in and they tell you iced coffee is $1. \"Cup of coffee isn't another word for hot coffee.. I think iced coffee comes in a cup too.  Anyway, decent prices and okay food."}
{"text":"coffee.. and hot chocolate.. All i needed on the cold night downtown =)"}
{"text":"Food was very good and the staff was very pleasant. The food was priced a little higher than expected but overall very inexpensive for that area. Will go there again."}
{"text":"Cozy and down to earth! Fast friendly service accompanied by great tasting edibles and drinks! I visit this little patch of 'easy going' every day for lunch or an iced coffee.   Their busy usually around lunch time and a little before, so plan accordingly. :)"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill since the change in name/ownership. I go to the salad bar 2 or 3 times a week, and since ownership has changed they don't keep it the salad bar as tidy and also they run out of items frequently or just don't monitor the bins to know when something is empty.     It's still decent but, I'm afraid it is going to continue the downward spiral.  I hope I'm wrong, but....today there was a Band-Aid on the salad bar....I should have taken a photo."}
{"text":"Oh my--I have discovered Chloe's Corner! I cannot believe that I've been here and working in downtown PHX for 2.5 years and haven't walked around enough to find CC. A coworker recently took me there for lunch. I love the variety of waters (Gerolsteiner!), the salad bar, and the healthy foods on the menu.   The place is open and airy, and the eat-in counter that surrounds the chefs is cool. Additional seating wraps around the Central Street side down to Jefferson, and there's great seating at a corner that looks towards Chase Field. There's outside seating on the CityScape side as well.   I've been there several times over the past couple weeks and have tried half of the salads. I can't choose a favorite right now, though the Chef salad or the Corner Chop would be in the running. LOVE Chloe's Corner! This is my new favorite place to get lunch when I work downtown."}
{"text":"Decent food for what seems to be ok pricing. Clean but not something were you \"gotta go\""}
{"text":"I got an ice coffee and my friend had a regular coffee, it was really good.  The place get busier by noontime, seems like they have a large menu and it reasonably priced. Coffee was 0.50 cent and Ice coffee $1.00. Yes not mistakes. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Quick and easy breakfast or lunch. Really good salads and I also enjoyed the pesto sandwich. I like that they serve alcohol there too. My favorite thing at this location might be the baked goods (cookies, muffins, etc)."}
{"text":"OK I love sandwiches. I was the kid who had the same Turkey Sandwich everyday for lunch growing up by choice because I love sandwiches. Now with that being said I live near Old Town which is lacking a good sandwich spot in my opinion. So when my girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp! we were excited.   First of the place looks really cool. It looks like sharp and somewhere you would want to eat. It was a Sunday afternoon and we walked in around 2pm, the place was relatively empty. After we looked through the cold case and the menu we walked up to the counter and waited.....and waited....and waited. There were 5 employees standing right in front of us really enjoying themselves until one finally realized we had been waiting to order. We ordered panini style turkey sandwiches paid and sat at the counter top bar.   The food also took a while to come out. As we sat there we just watched the employees play on their phones, make fun of each other, hangout in the back and overall very unprofessional. When our $9 sandwiches finally arrived they were only OK. Nothing we couldn't have made at home with a $10 panini press from target some deli meat and bread.   It gets two stars because of the restaurant decor and OK food. The staff kills this place they are loud, unkept and unprofessional. I'll spend a few more dollars and go to many of the other great restaurants in Kierland."}
{"text":"Very cute breakfast\lunch spot.  A little over priced but there is something for everyone here.  Lots of great seating, food options, salad bar, sandwich bar and   barista corner.  I ordered a Sumatran chemex and a bagel & lox.  Super friendly and fast service. Manager was always present, approachable and helping out on the floor, engaging customers.   Small specialty food items in the grocery section.  This is an ideal place to pack up for a gourmet picnic, desk lunch or quick bite."}
{"text":"Chloe's Corner, opened last week in the CityScape, Downtown.  The interior is modern, spacious and very comfortable. The design is not only admirable, but also very broad. Inside the restaurant there are various types of seating. Tables, counters even plush chairs to chill and kick it with a glass of beer or wine among friends. There is an outside patio too.  The first thing you notice during breakfast is a fifty cent cup of coffee. This is a bold brew in a paper cup and plastic top. Excellent coffee. For my morning meal I order Chloe's favorite, a six dollar 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, toast, wedge of fruit, plate. The swirled marbled rye bread crafted at John Anthoney's Italian Bread Company was perfect. Potatoes sauteed with fresh chili peppers were tip top. Bacon was thick and so good.  This is one of the areas newest restaurants, and even has a few groceries. Fresh ready to go pre-made lunches, fruit, wine, beer and soft drinks. I would love to recommend at least one bottle water that would come in a paper carton instead of plastic. I took home a bottle of Le Village, Sparkling French Limonade, tasty.  Also a big thanks to Malalay, a super svelte, very friendly gal that not only poured the coffee and brought the food, but laughed with me too. And ^5's to my cook.  Total bill today was $10.33. I will visit again. Happy Hour next time, to check out the beer garden."}
{"text":"I love life and life loves me. This breakfast house is worth it's weight. And if it wasn't for yelp, I never would have dined here. Both of the gals I interacted with are all that. Awesome smiles with beautiful personalities.  And kiss the cook, I hope she's a girl, because my egg sandwich was the best. Love my fity cent cup of coffee in a mug and the apple juice was a kiss sweeter than wine.  Here's to you Chloe."}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and a cup of tomato soup. I had it delivered to my work via doordash. (love doordash!) The soup was nice and hot! the bread was really fresh on the sandwich. I could have used more chicken salad in my sandwich. Other than that it was pretty good. Its a nice change from the typical chipotle or jimmy johns lunch."}
{"text":"The overall vibe is great. There's so much variety, you never have to get the same thing twice if you don't want to. There's coffee, gelato, pastries, salads, sandwhiches, and even good breakfast food! The location is perfect. I think this is what downtown Phoenix is all about."}
{"text":"Stopped by Chloe's Corner during a recent shopping trip. What luck! The decor was cute as a button and the food was down right delicious. I'm gluten-free and don't often find options that I like. The Pastrami Sandwich on gluten-free bread was winner and definitely will have coming back for more. The others in my party had the Chicken Pesto and the Roast Beef Sandwich. And they loved their meals as much as I loved mine."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chloe's Corner, mostly because of their Egg Salad Sandwich. Their Egg Salad is really creamy with notes of mustard, and large pieces of egg throughout. It's really quite good. I like the style of the restaurant as well.  You order at the counter, get a number, and then take a seat. They also have a refrigerator section where you can get to-go items and pasta salads that aren't on their menu. I often get a side of the Greek Pasta salad. It can be a little hit or miss because sometimes the pasta is too oily and needs to be drained a bit. They also have big jars of old fashion candy and large house-made individually wrapped cookies. It's a cute concept. Chloe's Corner is a good place to grab a quick bit while shopping at Kierland."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for many years and it just keeps getting better. Walking around Kierland and once I saw it, I immediately started to crave their BLT + A - the bread is perfectly toasted, heaps of crispy bacon, and fresh avocado. The only change I would make is to have a handful of chips versus the handful of pickles."}
{"text":"Just moved back to PHX and I was excited to see the opened up a location downtown since my wife and I used to go to the Kierland location all the time before we moved away. My wife had the turkey cranberry and I had the chipotle turkey, both were delicious like we remembered. The location and decor are awesome, great place to relax after a day at the science center."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast and got the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito.  It was tasty, fast and the servers and manager were very friendly.  Cute atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great people working here, great food and awesome coffee. Best and most economical coffee in the valley! You really can't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"I went to Chloe's Corner yesterday for lunch in Kierland and couldn't of been more impressed. The atmosphere is a throw back to my childhood in Oklahoma where you came and parked ur behind at the counter but with a modern twist without trying to be too trendy.    I talked to the manager and he told me it used to be a fox restaurant but the owner, his sister who worked for Fox bought them out when they no longer wanted to won the place and she took it over herself and tweaked the menu. I thought it was very cool that Chloe's went from a corporate place to a locally owned one.   So onto the important stuff. The food. I ordered a grilled cheese and it was one of the best grilled cheeses I have had in a very long time. What I love about this sandwich is that they are not trying to \"update\" or \"modernize\" it. They took some fresh white bread and buttered it up then placed thick slices Cheddar, Swiss, and White American on top with a thick cut of juicy bacon and a tomato. When I bit into it cheese oozed out and you would get that rich taste of the cheese, the freshness of the tomato and the right amount of saltiness and crunch from the bacon. It tasted so good it felt like I was eating in slow motion. I might have to go there again today because it was so dang good.  One of my favorite things in the world are oatmeal raisin cookies and they had some oatmeal dark cherry cookies that I had to try and these were fantastic as well. The cookie was big, dense, and soft just how I like them and when you bite into it the cookie melted sweet goodness and just when you think its getting a little too sweet the tartness of the cherry hit and really brought it all together.   If your in the Kierland area anytime soon I highly recommend Chloe's. I certainly will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little sandwich shop. They have an awesome menu that includes tasty sandwiches and fresh salads at reasonable prices.  When I went to Chloe's, I ordered the cold Roast Beef sandwich and my friend got the Asian Chicken Salad. They were both delicious. My favorite part was the homemade chocolate chip cookies; MMM! The service at Chloe's was also great, but it's important to note that it get's VERY busy during the lunch hour, so plan ahead some extra time!"}
{"text":"What a cute place! Decor is bright, funky, a bit industrial, and cozy all at the same time. All of the staff was friendly and perky at around 9am on a Saturday, which was a huge plus. Kaleidoscope Juice and Passport Coffee are located in an open floor plan with Chloe's, as well as a little fresh fruit/cheese/craft beer/wine grocery section. I was able to sample all of my favorite things to try when traveling - food, coffee, and fresh juice! I will definitely come back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I started at C3 Kitchen in Scottsdale Quarters in 2013 and now have made Chloes Corner my everyday stop (Same Owner) .....Again greeat quality food, consistent,  Service is Great and the GM Andrew is outstanding...1st met him back at C3 Kitchen...Just a Great Guy....The Owner is lucky to have him....Everything on the Menu is outstanding and the Prices are very fair....Keep up the Great work...Thanks Michael"}
{"text":"Cashier and server were nice, food was prompt. Don't get the tune melt. It was bland, and very dissatisfying. Something I could have made better myself. The atmosphere was cold and unwelcoming. It seems popular and the prices are good but I'd rather spend my $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant at least once a week since they opened. I always call my to go order in advance to save time. I've always gone right up to the front to pick up my order just like I would at other restaurant where you call an order in advance. Isn't that the purpose of calling your order in advance to save time? Today the staff were extremely rude and asked me to go to the back of the huge line and wait to pick up my order. I clearly see my order is done and waiting for me. I took the initiative to call in advance as I don't have time during lunch to wait in long lines. I found this new policy to be strange. I felt like never going back but I decided to give them another chance so I called the manager to let him know about this. I was totally shocked at how unresponsive and rude he was to me! His response was there is nothing he can do to help me. I will never go back here based on the principle. Customer service is a lost art form at this establishment."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Loved the food and sitting on the terrace! Great place that I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A nice little hang out for a talk & meal.  I like the small outdoor seating area - great people watching spot.  Inside is cool too.  Order eggs/bacon & Coffee for breakfast.  Grilled cheese/tomato soup & Coffee for lunch.   Did I mention the Coffee - its only 50 cents :).  You run in to it after exiting one of the parking garages - great way to start or end your Kierland shopping experience.  Not much else for me to add."}
{"text":"Chloe's is an excellent place for a quick and casual lunch in North Scottsdale. Located in Kierland Commons, it has an old style counter behind which the magical grilled sandwiches are prepared. The tuna sandwich and the tuna melt are both very good. The best thing about Chloe's is that it's simply good, clean and has 50 cent coffee - with free refills. Tough to beat - one of the best, clean, tasty and easy in-and-out lunch places around."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make... I am a cookie monster and Chloe's Corner made me that way...Their naughty pastry chef whose name I am not familiar with makes the best of the best most scrumptious cookie ever...triple chocolate chip oh my...I'm moaning at just the thought of it...the price is right too..the bitches behind the coffee counter kinda have an attitude and were making fun of me because I said I wanted a latte with an inch of foam in it..they were all giggling at each other as if they were watching \"Bruno.\"...  That is one big place and I really want to go back there for lunch...."}
{"text":"if you want the best cookie in town, then look no further than Chloe's Corner. The naughty in house bakers make a triple chocolate chip cookie that is to die for. In my humble opinion, not even Paradise Bakery's cookie's are that good in comparison.  Yes, Chloe's Corner is absolutely worth the detour for just a cookie. Some might think that $ 1.25 is a bit much but for the quality that you get to deliver to your taste buds, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I really didn't think I would like this place but it was wicked awesome in just about every way.  Love the open design and the simple decor.  Love the cold counter with all the grab-&-go stuff to make life easy.  Really love the bar where you can sit and watch the guy make the food.  All big pluses.  I ordered an egg salad sandwich which was a strange order for me.  I don't ever order egg salad but, oh well, I did and it was damn good.  It came with a side of pickles and was neatly plated.  Impressed with the presentation and the quality.  All very good.  Will have to try something else next time and, hopefully, some sweets too."}
{"text":"We popped in here for lunch on our last day at the Westin Kierland across the street.  Chloe's Corner was my husband's pick (found here on Yelp), and despite its simplicity and casualness, it ended up being one of the most enjoyable meals we had in Scottsdale.  On another Yelper's recommendation, I had the American Grilled cheese (three types of cheese, bacon, tomato and pickles) with a cup of tomato soup.  My husband devoured the chicken caesar salad and barely had room for his hot turkey sandwich (turkey and havarti on cranberry walnut bread).  The staff was so darn perky and upbeat it was hard not to be in a good mood while we were there.  Because we sat at the counter, we overheard at least a dozen other customers placing their orders and, although at least half of them were clueless/picky/rude, the staff was patient, helpful and totally on top of their game.  Yes, it's just a small breakfast/lunch place, but if you're in Kierland Commons and need something quick and good, I don't think you could do better than Chloe's Corner."}
{"text":"Literally come here all the time. Work right next door.  Had to wait in line while their systems went down. We were at the front of the line.  They decided to serve their \"regulars\" before us. We had been in like 5 minutes prior to these people walking in. They got to order food before we were even asked if we were getting coffee. Ridiculous. Not to mention some of the employees are extremely rude."}
{"text":"This place is totally cute inside and i guess i expected the food to be just as good as the place looked but ended up being super disappointed.   Bf just the grilled cheese that came with bacon and he was not that impressed. It was more like an overload on cheese and tasting like a goopy quesadilla on soggy bread and my sandwich was all wrong when i got it. I was on a lunch hour and got frustrated and didn't have time to wait so ended up getting my money back for my sandwich.   wompwompwomp was hoping this would be a new little go to sandwich spot."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast here! I order a la carte and it's the best. Egg whites, goat cheese and spinach with a side of cranberry-walnut toast is a must try! Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Chloe's has options for just about anyone.  If you just want a latte and a scone they've got you covered at the bakery case and coffee counter on the west wall as you walk in.  If you need something tasty to-go. They have their full menu available, which includes breakfast sandwiches, pizza, soups, salads, and hot and cold sandwiches It's relatively quick from order to pick-up.    Chloe's is one of the few spots in downtown that has a salad bar (This is where they solidify my 4th star).  It has a great assortment of veggies, greens , proteins and toppings.  Don't expect to find that orange French that strange goopy italian dressing options.   What you will find is an assortment of house made vinaigrette and a few more traditional/standard options.  The salad bar is a dine-in or carry-out option priced by the weight.    In their large refrigerators they also offer a selection of easy take away options like sandwiches, salads, fresh veggies, hummus, egg salad, chicken salad, cheese plates, etc.  Also offered is a large assortment of beverages.    I enjoy coming here to take a serious sit-down  lunch break from work. Spotting a stool at the counter I belly up, order their house iced green tea and check out their specials or order off the menu.  The bar around their \"kitchen\" is full service.  The only other times I was there for dine in we ordered up front, they provided us with numbers, we claimed a table and then delivered our food.    They offer beer and wine and have recently added Kaleidoscope Juice to take over the back side of their \"kitchen\".    Prices are in line with most other downtown eateries.  [$7-10 for sandwich or salad, chips, sides ]"}
{"text":"The Bf and I went to Chloe's yesterday to start off our fall break right (haha). We each only tried the latte. The space is much bigger than I thought it would be, but it is nice looking and they have a lot more food items than I expected. They even have a little mini grocery store area. We walked up to the coffee bar and ordered. The lattes were good, but a little on the weak side. I would come back here if I were shopping at Cityscape (definitely over going to Starbucks), but I probably wouldn't make a special trip just to come here."}
{"text":"Maybe it was my mood, maybe it was the weather, or maybe eating a Chloe's Corner Pastrami & Swiss while enjoying the new Pop Up Park at CityScape was the best lunch experience I've had in 2+ years working Downtown. Let's start with Chloe's. The sandwich was very tasty but the service deserves separate mention. The staff, led by manager Lisa, is so nice and eager to assist customers that you wonder why other restaurants don't pay closer attention. Or at least spy on Chloe's to see how it's done.  We ended up taking our lunch (my friend had the Greek salad and tomato soup, also good) outside on the plaza, where DJ William Reed was playing everything from Snow Patrol and Hot Chip to Santagold, and the Downtown Ambassadors were letting folks shoot hoops, play cornhole, check-out books and magazines, and use a variety of board games. The Pop Up Park is a new concept and happens M-F from 11-1. William Reed and Sean Watson provide the music on Thursdays and Fridays.  You really need to experience this for yourself, especially now that the weather is idyllic. UPDATE: Whomever controls the music knows their business. This morning the place was rocking Smiths, Tragically Hip, and vintage REM. Perfect pairing with the formidable scent of eggs in the air."}
{"text":"I eat here almost every day! Healthy food options, great salad bar. Hummus! Pizza that looks amazing(I'm gluten free). Great little coffee and pastry bar, wine!!! Seriously love Chloe's.   If they would mix up the salad bar a little and carry a few gluten free baked treats, I would be in lunch heaven."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chloe's Corner.   The setup and atmosphere are great, very warm and inviting and the staff have all been very friendly.  On to the food. I have ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and the hot roast beef and both were delicious. The cheeses really bring out the flavors of the sandwiches and you can tell the types of cheese were chosen carefully to represent the sandwich. I also have a slight addiction to the chocolate chip toffee cookies. so so good."}
{"text":"This review is biased because I live right down the street, but this is one of my favorite breakfast place. Honestly, I get one of two things here. Chloe's favorite or the sandwich, both are excellent and are very simple. There's probably more stuff on the menu that's delicious, but those are my go-tos. Oh! And their coffee is amazing at only 50 cents!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try this place out when my husband decided he didn't want to do lunch and bowl at Lucky. Boy, was this place packed! I am glad to see the locals and downtown workers embracing this place.   Inside it has something like a grocery area with drinks, snacks, salads, etc. After ordering at one of the food or coffee counters, you can choose to sit at the counter to eat, or sit in the dining area. Service was very prompt and attentive.  I ordered a cheese pizza and triple chocolate cookie. My husband had a pastrami and swiss sandwich that looked incredible. My pizza was very good as well. For all of that and a drink, it seemed pricy at $15. Especially since the sandwich didn't come with chips or fries, anything.   I will still go back though as there was alot of dining options here and the food was really good."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about. I've been here quite a few times due to the convenience when working nearby and each time I found myself with an overpriced, mediocre meal. The service is lacking. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I ordered the Egg Sandwich. It was wonderful. The staff is do incredibly attentive. Gracious staff. Just delightful."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick (or not) lunch!! Love the spinach salad which I ordered with grapes instead of the berries (allergy). The cashier who put my order in suggested the switch since he knew this blueberries and strawberries were stored together. Very thoughtful! I love meeting friends here for lunch a talking over food and free refills of their tropical tea. I also tried the chicken pesto sandwich on a previous visit and liked that as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast.  They have excellent soy chorizo and egg burritos.  I get mine w/ egg whites and no cheese on a spinach tortilla. SO DELICIOUS!  My husband loves to order the same and usually a bowl of their oatmeal. Our 3-year-old loves their bowls of berries.   Our only complains are that there is not a large enough dining area and there are only 2 high chairs to go around so we have learned to always be sure to bring our baby in his stroller even though there is really not room due to the limited space because the likelihood of scoring a high chair is slim to none. ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm going to stick to a coffee review.  I've only ever had their baked goods and coffee (although the food looks spectacular).  I pop in here with my kids and grab a coffee ($0.50 for a refill) each weekend and buy the kids a muffin or cookie.  Their coffee is WONDERFUL.  I'm a coffee snob and even roast my own beans at home...  so when I give kudos for good coffee - I really mean it!  They have spectacular coffee.  My kids love their baked goods, and the fact that everyone there is SUPER friendly is the 5-star boost."}
{"text":"The most AMAZING tuna melt I have ever eaten in my life!  Seriously it is so good I have day dreamed about having one. They have a variety of menu items that everyone would love. To top it off, we had the best service today from Cassidy! If you stop in be sure to ask for her and don't MISS the tuna melt!"}
{"text":"I love this place, everything here is completely fabulous! Everyone is so polite and they have the best fresh squeezed orange juice I've ever tried!"}
{"text":"We go here on lunch breaks often. Very nice little cafe, with fresh food. The only thing I wish they had where a side offering of more than bagged chips. None the less for the price, the quality is spot on.   A little gem in North Scottsdale, with fast and friendly service with something to eat for everyone."}
{"text":"Great food, delicious cheap coffee, awesome service. This place located in prime location but the price the food is reasonable. Frankly anyone can afford it. Cheap doesnt mean bad food, in this place it means delicious food. Thank you for that"}
{"text":"What a shocker walking into this place in downtown Phoenix! It has a really cool setup with a market on one side, table service, take-out, or full service at the bar. The interior is huge and very modern. I ordered a chicken salad, which came out super fast, and it was excellent. It was super fresh & tasty.  If I'm downtown I'm definitely going back to this place."}
{"text":"I lurv cute little restaurants in nice areas...you eat a good meal and then shop it off;)  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Was feeling like some comfort food.  I also had a cup coffee, which was only $0.50.  I had ordered the coffee separately, and had only large bills, the guy said forget about it...very nice.  The coffee was a little diluted today, not a big deal.  My food order was good, but not memorable.  My husband ordered the chicken pesto.  It was also good, but not memorable.  I like the vibe at the cafe, and if I lived in the area, I would probably return.  But as a tourist, there are too many other places to try out."}
{"text":"I love the corner, they have probably my favorite breakfast sandwich (bacon, egg and cheese) and the best BLT anywhere.  The spinach salad is also excellent.  hard to go wrong I eat here for lunch a coupe of times a week."}
{"text":"Friendly & attentive staff. Great healthy food options & prices are very reasonable. Parking lot across the street. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Great place to have lunch with girlfriends!"}
{"text":"This is a nice downtown spot in CityScape.  Lots of urban hipsters abound but if you can get past that it is well worth it.  We were enjoying our time sitting at the counter enjoying the downtown view when the owners came over and said our pancakes had taken too long to get to us - over 12 minutes - so they would be no charge.  We didn't want to say we'd waited longer at IHOP.  We graciously accepted and after paying for only our iced coffees;  we tipped our server mightily.  Very impressed with the customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a couple weeks ago to meet up w/friends.  The people working here are so friendly and helpful.  I am a tea connoisseur of sorts.  And, they have a great selection of iced teas.  The guy who helped me was so helpful w/all my questions on the teas they have available (which happens to be a great selection).  When I couldn't decide, he recommended what he thought I'd like best and so I went w/his recommendation.  To my surprise, he actually told me there was no charge for the tea because I took his recommendation and 'nobody ever listens to him'. LOL  How funny, and what a kind gesture.  Also, the place is full of take-home items and they have a FABULOUS selection!  So, you can meet your friends here for a casual lunch or snack and then pick up food to take home for dinner so you don't have to cook.  And, the options they have for take-home are really amazing... really delicious healthy foods, but they also have wine in their take-home section too so if you're like me and you like some wine w/your quinoa salad that you take home, they got it... one stop shopping and a great place to meet up w/friends for lunch or a snack.  They've thought of everything.  Great place w/great service and great food AND great iced teas!"}
{"text":"I've been into Chloe's a couple times now, so it's due a review.    Today I met a friend who I hadn't seen since last Summer.  Hectic schedules sometimes prevent even the closest of friends from being in the same physical space.  He'd suggested a couple places in CenPho and I wasn't feeling either one of them, so I suggested we just meet up at CItyScape.  I remembered Chloe's was there, so it was a quick decision.  We showed up during the lunchtime rush, which at Chloe's translates to long lines (to the door).  The lines moved fairly quickly, though, so we ordered and got a seat within about 15 minutes.  We ordered the chicken pesto sandwich (me), the hot pastrami and swiss (him) and the classic grilled cheese (DD).    The food arrived with little fanfare and no presentation.  In fact, to take the picture for yelp, I staged my sandwich so you could see its contents.  My adequate sandwich arrived simply sliced in the middle and served with a couple slices of pickle.  The pastrami arrived the same way.  The grilled cheese?  No pickles on the side... just a square sliced diagonally.    My sandwich was slightly better than average, as the warm chicken was quite good.  The pesto was a little bland and the focaccia was just okay... but fresh.  Still, I was a little hungry after finishing (even with pacing myself as much as humanly possible).  My friend felt much the same, perhaps more so.  He couldn't help eyeing DD's plate as she slowly ate her cheese sandwich.  I don't blame him.  If it were just the two of us, I would have stolen a bite of it myself.    I'd give Chloe's a 3.5, but I am rounding up because I love the space, the location and the vibe.   I've had their pastries before and... well... they rock!    I'd go to Chloe's again, but not during the peak lunch hour.  And, I would probably just do the salad bar and a pastry (or six)."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place!  Kierland is really uppity in my mind, so I tend to shy away from all their dining options.  Too fancy schmancy for me!  However, after a long day of shopping and browsing the crazy ridiculous Sur La Table, we were getting really hungry.  Chloe's Corner was on our way back to the car so we decided to stop in.  The layout of the place is really cute, and almost retro.  The decor is very tasteful and bright feeling.  We browsed the giant chalkboard menu for a few moments before sitting down and ordering.  I chose the Grilled Ham and Cheese.  It was so DELICIOUS!  It was probably the best grilled sandwich I have ever had, aside from my own.  It was so buttery and toasty on the outside and it had the most amazing crunch.  There was a ton of yummy ham inside with a nice pairing of gooey cheddar cheese.  It was really a great sandwich.  Overall, I really liked this place and would definitely go back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick sandwich or salad. Usually when I come I get the chipotle raspberry chicken which is awesome. Today I got the veggie which was pretty amazing. My friend got the chicken pesto which was also really good. Unfortunately the sandwiches don't come with any chip or sides, but just a few cut pickles. Otherwise they have a good assortment of bottle beverages and teas. All in all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This is where I go for coffee EVERY morning before work.   I'm not kidding... EVERY weekday morning.  A cup of coffee is 25 cents!!!  Sometimes I grab a quick lunch here and when I do, it's the American Grilled Cheese ALL THE WAY!  They have a cute little kids' menu and tons of candy jars all over the place.  The decor is really cute and they're always switching it up and changing it.  There are a few tables outside and they have a great beer and wine selection.  They have everything a diner should, from milkshakes to licorice!  The menu is not huge though, but it's healthy (which is a plus in my ratings) and there's definitely something for everyone.  This is a great place for a playful first date, reading the paper by yourself or catching up with a friend."}
