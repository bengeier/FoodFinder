{"text":"Quick and delicious!   I've had Dragon Fire Pizza a few times and they are always very friendly.  I was surprised how quickly I could receive a delicious oven fired pizza."}
{"text":"ERMAGERD PIZZA.    Yeah, so now that I said that....    This was a random last minute early lunch choice and dang... just....dang.  So first of all the owner is super friendly with his customers. This dude obviously has a sense of humor and likes his job.   I got a Gold Dragon and it was amazing.   I went to Italy and I feel like a crust snob. It needs to be crunchy and chewy at the same time for me to really love it.   Dragon Fire Pizza nailed it. (Yeah for you!)    The pizza size is just enough to look like you can't eat it all, but then somehow you magically can. Boom! It's just gone. So needless to say, I ate the whole thing myself.   It was hot, it was fresh, it was flavorful and it was pizza. Do I really need to say more?   Like the owner said \"What American doesn't like pizza\"   Just go. And don't plan to share."}
{"text":"If you'd told me a year ago that I'd see a portable brick oven tooling around Champaign-Urbana, selling pizza that they bake with fire in just a few minutes, I'd have said you were crazy. But that's exactly what Dragon Fire Pizza is. And their pizza is amazing.  I'd never heard of Neapolitan-style pizza--I'm usually a deep-dish fan myself--but this pizza is seriously fantastic. Really, really tasty, with lots of flavor options, and a crunchy-chewy-slightly-toasty crust that's something special. Plus, the people are really friendly and you can tell they earnestly want you to have the best experience possible. I've visited their truck a number of times, and I always come away happy.  Also, they're big on supporting the community--and great with kids! We invited them to my son's cub scout troop and they very handily taught a bunch of rowdy kids how to stretch their own pizza dough and make their own pizzas. It was unforgettable--the kids AND the parents enjoyed it a lot.  When you see them out and about--and they're hard to miss!--do yourself a favor and check 'em out!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but only sometimes.   Depending on who makes your pizza, sometimes they can overcook and burn the pizza! Crispy carcinogenic bits taste good only in small doses."}
{"text":"Best woodfire pizza in CU so far!!! Excellent service and always piping hot, made to eat."}
{"text":"A little over rated in my opinion. Over priced for the size and quality. Practically a pizza served on a naan(Indian flat bread). For the same price I feel I could have gotten more food at a chain pizza joint."}
{"text":"Dragon Fire is awesome! The dragon fire with the ghost pepper cheese is my favorite, with the bronze dragon being a close second. Their specialty pizzas are all really good, but with the speed of their cooking and the wood-fired oven you will get a little bit of a burnt taste. In my opinion, their regular pizzas (plain sausage, pepperoni, cheese, etc) are just average.  The service is really great. Dave and his staff are always super friendly. Like I stated previously, I love all of the specialty pizzas I've tried from them but their regular pizzas are a little too burnt-tasting for my liking."}
{"text":"If you think this is good pizza, you need to get out more. I tried two kinds: the bronze dragon and the breakfast pizza. I honestly couldn't tell you which was supposed to be which. Maybe it was because the line was long, but the crust was underdone and too doughy, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. I'm not from the Midwest and I have yet to find pizza that even comes close to what I'm used to in PA/NJ/NY."}
{"text":"Going with 4 stars despite the fact the pizza seems a bit bland for a company that calls itself DRAGON FIRE PIZZA! They were at the farmers market today so decided to support the locals trying hard to bring fresh local products to CU.   They were out of pepperoni so went with the homemade smoked Italian sausage and green/red peppers from the original menu. Kinda bland...could not taste any fennel or red pepper flakes or anything at all for that matter in the sausage. Added jalapeno peppers for some zing but got about a tablespoon of chopped fresh peppers for $1.50 extra which I could not taste. If you want to consistently taste jalapenos use PICKLED JALAPENOS...the fresh ones vary dramatically from scorching hot to nothing...I got nothing this time.   But I think the real problem is that they simply dont use enough salt in the dough or sauce. I know I know...salt is evil, but without proper seasoning you have just plain bland food, especially when using fresh vegis which dont come seasoned! I thought I would fix the problem back at the Hyatt Hotel by adding salt pepper and hot sauce but even then its to late...seasoning must be throughout, you just cant put it on top.   Still give Dragon Fire 4 stars because they are obviously trying very hard and everything is truely fresh but I dont think 5 minutes from ordering to presenting is enough time to crisp the crust and heat the ingredients through. Slices were limp and just barely hot...how bout 7 minutes...I can spare another 2 minutes for a really great crispy crust and flavorful pizza. Is it worth $11 including the added peppers? - ABSOLUTELY. Give them a try...hope they take some of this to heart. Bravo guys!"}
{"text":"so i recently ate at this truck cuz of all the rave reviews, and i have to say....the reviews are true! the pizzas are amazing and so fresh, u can literally hear the crunch of red onions...so y the 4 star? because they are a little on the expensive side for a personal size pizza..almost $9 for a personal size!-they only come in one sizes btw! but still really good...BEWARE THO, the workers are EXTREMELY defensive about their pizza and will pounce on you even if u say the littlest thing to offset their already inflated truck pizza ego..."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. The crust is perfectly cooked. A little pricey, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I love this food truck.   In my books, this is the best pizza in Champaign.  They are super friendly and always helpful.   Their pizza comes out fast (90 seconds if there's no line) and within 5 minutes if there is a line (after you place your order).  They have the standard toppings -- pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc.... as well as some different pizzas such as dragon fire (green chile sauce, jalepenos, hot sausage and to make it spicier -- ghost peppers) and once in a while, a SMORES pizza -- marshmallows, m&ms, chocolate sauce.... so good.  And they even have a secret menu -- ie. brisket BBQ!!!!    The crust is soft, chewy AND foldable!!   They have an awesome char on the bottom and the cheese is to die for.   Everything is spot on!!!  No complaints!!!  They were even nice enough to drive out to our house and cater my 5yr old's birthday party --- they were a hit with everybody!!!!  I love this place.  Follow them on twitter or FB to figure out where they're going to set up for the day!!!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of having almost everything on the Dragon Fire menu, and I have to say I'm very impressed. I like spicy food and I was pleased with their self-named \"Dragon Fire\". Spicy isn't the only thing they do though. The Red Dragon is probably my second favorite.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was impressed with the large number of vegetarian pizza choices they have. And for the non-vegetarians out there, with most of them you don't even know you're eating something without meat.  Probably the best aspect of their pizzas is the dough. It's very chewy, but not undercooked. It kind of reminded me of a warm flat-bread (like the kind you would use for a gyro) but thinner and warm. It folds easily so it's not droopy.  Probably the best advice I can give would be for you to bookmark the \"Finder\" page on their website. They keep a current calendar and Twitter feed on there so you'll always know where they are."}
{"text":"I went to the Tuesday night farmer's market downtown Champaign and saw the Dragon Fire Pizza food truck. I heard about it and have seen my friends eat some of their pizza. So I decided to give it a try.   They have seven specialty pizzas that already have toppings picked out. There is also the option of creating your own pizza. I ordered the Margherita pizza and a Red Dragon pizza. While I was waiting for the pizzas to come out of the oven, I asked the workers about how they make the pizzas and what was unique about them. They make the pizzas \"neopoliton\" style which refers to the way Italians make their pizza. The dough is hand-tossed and the pizza is baked in a ceramic oven.   The workers were really friendly and helpful in choosing a pizza that I would like. We took the pizza home, which was about 15 minutes away. The pizza was still warm, but not as warm as it would have been when coming out of the oven. In my experience, I would take my pizza and eat it as soon as it was ready.   Dragon Fire pizzas are not like regular American pizza's because the crust isn't seasoned and there isn't an overload of cheese. It is an acquired taste that I would recommend delving into."}
{"text":"Best food truck. I like spicy food so I order their green dragon every time (my favorite). Could be a little spicy to people who don't like spicy food."}
{"text":"Awesome I absolutely loved the yummy pizza you got to love this place it has all your wildest dreams"}
{"text":"Tried it tonight at Triptych, and was not disappointed. My wife and I had been wanting to try Dragon Fire for a while, and it was glorious. The service was friendly, and it only took about 5 minutes for our pizza to be ready.  We had the \"Bronze\" and I noticed the sausage, and all ingredients for that matter, were fresh.  Try this place if you ever have the chance. You could probably eat an entire pizza by yourself, but we opted to share one.  Next time I'll probably get my own. Good stuff."}
{"text":"It was ok. I think maybe I had super high expectations...  I'll definitely try it again. Lots of other people clearly love it and the staff was friendly.   I had a classic dragon/margherita pizza. That's a go-to pizza for me, so I've had lots of others to compare it to. I know some people do red sauce like these guys did, but I prefer the olive oil/no sauce version. (That's how I had it in Italy, so to me that's how I always want it.)  I just thought this kinda lacked flavor. There wasn't nearly enough basil for my tastes either."}
{"text":"My favorite food truck in CU. I haven't had a bad pizza yet. They come to Downtown Champaign on occasion and the line gets long quickly--and for good reason! They are able to quickly make their delicious pizzas and they're consistently tasty.  I have tried the Red Dragon a couple of times; great for those who only want mild spice from pepperoni and onion. My husband took the Dragon Fire pizza challenge--it is spicy to the max.  I have also gotten a custom veggie pizza with spinach, peppers, and onion, and was very pleased. Even though the crust is thin, it holds up well with multiple toppings. I like folding the slices in half, NYC style, to get all the good stuff in one bite.  Courteous, fast, professional, and tasty pizza to go for $10? Yes, please."}
{"text":"Neapolitan style pizza!!!  Just find them!! It's amazing! Ghost pepper pizza is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here while at Tryptich in Savoy.   Nice atmosphere and the guys were so friendly while we waited for our pizza (only about 5 min max)  Great crust and they were great to offer suggestions"}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time today at the Urbana food truck rally. Had the margherita pizza and even though it wasn't the best I've had, it was still pretty decent. I think the brick oven just adds to the charm. The wait time was pretty nominal as well. Won't go for the same thing again though. Might try something else next time."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Their green dragon sauce is delicious.  Spicy, but not overwhelming.  They also had the option of ghost pepper cheese to turn up the heat a bit.  It sounds scary, but was very good (and not too spicy).  I'm also fascinated that they managed to install a wood-fired brick oven on a food truck.  Such a neat idea, and they executed it well.  With pizza, you worry about how long it will take to get an order out, but they can pump out pizzas quickly.  We used them for a kids party, and they were able to turn out 50+ pizzas in under an hour.  It was incredible.  We'd use them again in a heartbeat for a party.  They were very accommodating.  It was nice to have the guests get whatever they wanted without worrying about appeasing everyone with my topping choices.  The ingredients are quite good too.  The Neapolitan style dough is thin and crispy and delicious.  You may want to ask them to leave it in the oven a bit longer if you want it crispier."}
{"text":"This is darn good pizza. Super fast and super friendly!  I have been to the Dragon Fire Pizza food truck a few times since they love to park between work and my bank and I have never been disappointed. The prices are reasonable and the selection is fun! I cant stay away from a place that lets me try ghost peppers in a different way.  I have shared this pizza with my family and we can always find something that everyone will like. The pizza are a generous size for lunch and I usually opt to share them, but all the boys in my family could easily (and happily) eat the whole thing. I usually pick one up on my lunch break after I go to the bank because they cook so quickly I always have plenty of lunch time left to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Their dragon fire pizza is AWESOME. Just the right amount of spice and packed with flavor. I was fortunate enough to buy some while chopping down our Christmas tree at Pheasant Ridge and it made the experience that much better. Best wood fired pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Really great addition to the champaign urbana food scene. Great spot to eat at lunch with short wait times and high quality ingredients.  After eating here again, I still think it is great. I'd definitely recommend ordering your pizza with fresh mozzarella as one of the ingredients."}
{"text":"I tried their pizza last fall at an event at Prairie Gardens. Delicious!   Lots of interesting pizzas to choose from and they made it quickly.  Since they are a food truck I don't have the opportunity to catch them often, but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite food trucks here in town!  I have had both the Bronze Dragon (sausage, mushroom, peppers with tomato sauce) and the Dragon Fire (sausage, peppers, onions, jalapeños with spicy green sauce), and both are excellent.  I tried one of their weekly specials (BBQ chicken pizza) last week and I did not care for it as much (and it was much more expensive).    They offer it on cardboard rounds if you are eating immediately, or in a box if you are taking it to go.  They also offer a ghost pepper cheese add-on to the Dragon Fire that I have not been brave enough to try yet, but I've heard that is good as well.  Very friendly staff, and it's freshly made pizza brick-oven pizza in just a few minutes."}
{"text":"The pizza is OK. I had a margherita - it's unbearably salty.  Like, tears in your eyes salty.  Mozzarella behaves strangely and it's loaded with some kind of oil I can't identify.  Anyway, it's a pretty decent pizza for the price (Around $8).    Edit:  Spoke with the owner, and have since had much, much better pizzas :)  I'll keep an eye on this place and keep going - I think I just got them on an off day!"}
{"text":"We stopped by when we noticed the new food truck at the Boneyard Creek Celebration in Urbana. It looked really attractive with the brick oven and everything. We came up to read the menu and I found the woman at the register to be a pushy sales person. When we finally decided on a pizza and were getting ready to pay, she interjects a comment about how we should leave a tip for the baker. How rude to insist that we tip? Doesn't the baker make a full wage? He's no waitress after all. We probably would have tipped anyway but it felt strange to be pressured like that. Also, I'm almost positive that they're grossly abusing the term \"local\" because it's trendy. The peppers were all listed as locally grown...then it occurred to me, it's April in central illinois, what kind of crazy magician is able to grow bell peppers right now?? News Flash: no perversion of the english language could allow for California, Mexico, or Florida to be considered local to central illinois! I would have even accepted \"regional\" but local? No way. In the end, the pizza was okay, just okay."}
{"text":"Did you know that on Thursdays Dragon Fire Pizza Truck is at Triptych?   Now you know that.   Did you know that on Thursdays, Triptych runs one of their beers through a Randall? (do you know what a randall is?) (a randall is a device, sold by Dogfish Head, that infuses things into beer. Kind of like a reverse water filter, instead of taking impurities out, it puts other things in).   Now you know that too.   I believe this week, triptych will be doing the Red-5 with ginger/lemon tea. This would go great with a pizza. Next week, they are looking to do Sprung with Pineapple (which would go great with a Hawaiian pizza, don't you think?)  Try the green snot pizza, I hear it's amazing!"}
{"text":"So after my previous review, I have had pizza from here many times and they were cooked beautifully each time. Hope, the consistency in quality remains like this forever. And also, please never ever stop making green sauce. I love it so much."}
{"text":"I was really intrigued by the idea of a pizza truck that makes oven fired pizzas, so I finally hunted this truck down to try. The lady who took my order was extremely friendly and inviting.   In no time, my Margherita pizza was out. The pizza was beautiful. It had a little less cheese than I'm used to; however, it didn't need more. The sauce and the crust were the true stars of this pizza. The bites with cheese were a nice complement, however, I still would have given it a five star review if it had no cheese at all. The pizza is very flavorful without being greasy.   They really mastered the pizza truck! I felt like I had ordered a pizza off of a fancy Italian restaurant."}
