{"text":"0 stars!!! Do not eat at this restaurant. Our order was incorrect we called back to let them know. We did not ask for a refund and he basically called us Liars. We've been eating her for almost 10 years and the owner of this place basically said no you're wrong I make the sauce the same way every time there were vegetables in my dish that I specifically did not ask for and missing items in the to go food and then he wanted to argue about it and we recommend you don't waste your time or your money. Place has no clue what they're doing no idea about customer service and when I called back to let the lady know, that she lost patrons, she told me to let it go!!!!! so there's customer service for you. Sucked. Outright."}
{"text":"Great fast Chinese food like you would find in NYC - try it. Cheap & fresh, love this place."}
{"text":"We have been customers of FuShing's for years.  It was consistently great until about a year ago.  Now it is great 4 out of 5 times but sometimes it is so horrible we had to throw it away.  We kept going back because when they are great they are great.  Unfortunately you can't know when they have a cook there that is so bad you can't make yourself eat it.  I'm not talking about slightly different, it literally isn't edible.  Yes, you will read many great reviews.  If they have eaten there a few times and got the great Chinese food we used to love there they will say it is great.  Listen to the long time, frequent customers that warn you that it is hit or miss...  great today, beyond horrible tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great Chinese. Best in cabarrus county. I drive long way to get my Chinese from here. Family owned and good quality. Generous meat portions in their dishes."}
{"text":"For take out, this place is hard to beat.  Never had bad meal from here.  Owners very nice and cook clean quality food ."}
{"text":"They have gone down hill.   Check your order I have been missing food on takeout orders.  Who wants to drive all the way back after getting home to a hungry family."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  Really good food and cheap prices!  My favorite Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the only places that delivers to my home. It is good food at a very good price!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 2x previous... And I must say that the food is prepped quickly & hot. There is a nice flavor to the food, not a rushed taste. The place is quite clean, where as you may turn away, due to an unkept facility! Will definitely return, especially since the reviews from another place has kept me away from them!"}
{"text":"Okay food.  Decent price. 

Crab Rangoon was flat.  Kind of odd.  
Chicken wings were nicely seasoned.  
Pork fried rice.... Um.. 7 out of 10.  

If you are short on money and want something other than fast food, go for it."}
{"text":"For the money they are THE BEST in Harrisburg... I go there when ever  I am looking for a good lunch."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food ever!  Greasy, no flavor at all, and plain nasty!  I got my food home, took one bite and spit it out. Rest went into garbage. Will NEVER eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"If I can give them 0 stars I would. I ordered a chicken with broccoli and white rice and when we get home, it's a sesame chicken with white rice. I called the place back to let them know and the woman argued that we ordered sesame chicken. How I know we didn't because it was for my son who hates sesame!!  I would never recommend this place to anyone!  Customer service is awful!"}
{"text":"Went in to order food and saw the short young Asian girl with her fingers in her nose. She covered her nose it as I came in towards the table. I have bought food here so many of times but as I came in the guy asked me what get he get me and I said I'm sorry but seeing her working in the kitchen around food with her finger in her nose, no thank you, never again...."}
{"text":"Where's the meat?\" 
This place used to be a regular for me for years, until one day I ordered hunan chicken take-out. Bottom line, meat was almost non exsistent. Mostly veggies but litle tiny strips of chicken I could barely find. Very skimpy. I called to inquire if they mistakenly gave me a veggie dish, and I was they pre-measure the amount of meat in their dishes. Went to another chinese restaurant that was a little cheaper AND with HUGE chunks of chicken!. Since then, I have decided since I like meat I haven't gone back."}
{"text":"I'd like to think of this Chinese place as a hidden Harrisburg spot. The staff here is very friendly and willing to accommodate any kind of dietary restrictions you may have.

They are tops because of their lunch special pricing. All of your Chinese food favorites are served from 11-3 (Saturdays too!) at the low price of $5.55 (plus tax). The lunch specials come with an egg roll and pork fried rice. 

I always call ahead and my food is always ready by the time I make the 7-minute drive."}
{"text":"We love this little Chinese restaurant. We buy takeout from FuShing regularly because it's been consistently good. A friend recommended it and we've been getting our Chinese food from there and not our regular spot ever since. We've had their chicken with broccoli, chicken with garlic sauce, lo mein, chicken wings, boneless ribs, wontons and pepper steak. I've been happy with all of these. The prices are reasonable, and you can get small or large portion sizes."}
{"text":"I placed a pickup order and the food came out quickly and hot. Staff was friendly. The food was average. We enjoyed our Lo Mein but weren't impressed with the seafood soup or the Kung Po shrimp."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Anything you order with shrimp has large, tasty shrimp. None of the small shrimp you get at other places. Everything on the menu is good, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast delivery and it was still warm. I tried the egg rolls which were yummy. The curry chicken was pretty good, though I had to use some extra hot sauce to make it spicy enough for me. I also tasted the hot and sour soup, which was full of tofu, mushrooms, pork strips, and a couple other things, but again, I had to add hot sauce. It was by far the best Chinese food I've ever had delivered."}
{"text":"Best fast food Chinese in Harrisburg.  They have great lunch and dinner specials and have never given me a problem about my special orders. The black bean chicken is one of the best things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is really good and reasonably priced. Fast and friendly delivery. Food wasn't coated in a real heavy sauce which was nice. Compared to other Chinese food in Harrisburg I would recommend them."}
