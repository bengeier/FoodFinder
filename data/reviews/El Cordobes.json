{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas!!  A diamond in the rough!!  Authentic, real Mexican food. Reminds me of my childhood. No, it's better than that!! Hope my moms not reading this. Best Mexican food I've ever had in my life!!! Don't pass this up. 

Family owned and operated quaint little spot to catch some real homegrown Mexican food. Every time I'm in Vegas its a must stop for me and my whole family. We love it. Definitely one of the high points of any of our trips to Vegas! We love this place!!!

Don't believe me, you have to experience it to believe it. Order anything on he menu, from Mariscos(Seafood) to Burritos to Chile Rellenos to menudo and Pozole, and be prepared to be WOW'ED!!!! Give it a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is really good and cheap. The burritos are amazing. I believe they accept cash only but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Tasty chips and salsa! Tried the Carne Asada and Chile Verde burrito, both really good!  Great hole in the wall restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Cordobes since I we a kid in El Monte! So happy that I get to visit and enjoy the best bean and cheese burrito on earth when I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came in here with my parents before heading to the airport, and was not disappointed.  The burritos were incredible.  They were full of so much flavor,  or to mention the guacamole that came with it.  The owner, José, came out and welcomed us.  We talked with him the whole time we were there.  He and his wife were so pleasant.  They were so polite, and very appreciative of us for coming in to their restaurant.  I will definitely be returning, and will be making recommendations to friends who will be coming into Las Vegas for El Cordobes restaurant.  Thanks, José!"}
{"text":"Customer since the late 1990s. Still return on a monthly basis. Owners are super friendly! Food is delicious"}
{"text":"First time eating here. My wife loves Mexican food. We had lunch and I had a Carne Asada Burrito and she had  Machaca. We were both please.  I took half ok my burrito home."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot almost every Sunday morning with the family best authentic Mexican food in town !"}
{"text":"Went there because it has 4&1/2 stars. Ordered Menudo and Pozole. I was very disappointed with both; broth too watery not enough chile sauce therefore no flavor."}
{"text":"A great little hole in the wall with excellent food! I had one of the combination plates - a taco and an enchilada. It was excellent! T came with refried beans and rice, both of which were on the same level as any I've had down in Mexico itself. I ordered the taco to be chicken, which was very tender and tasty. The enchilada was cheese, my favorite, and was just as good as any I've had south of the border. The chips were thin and crispy, just like I like them and the salsa had an excellent bite to it. Overall, the best Mexican food I've had since coming back from Baja last October. If you like good, real Mexican, you won't be disappointed. Don't let the \"dive-y\" look deter you from pushing the door open and going in. You won't be disappointed either! 

Oh yeah, they have real Mexican Coca-Cola in a bottle, too. If you've never had one, you'll be surprised at how different they taste from our Coke in the U.S. Try it!"}
{"text":"What can I say, El Cordobes is a hidden gem here in east Las Vegas.  Authentic typical mexican comfort food prepared by Mama and Papa.  This place offers breakfast dishes like huevos a la mexicana, huevos rancheros, chilaquiles and more.  For lunch there is tacos, burritos, tostadas, taquitos, flautas, tamales, beef soup, pozole, menudo, seafood soup, ceviche, carne asada, goat stew(birria) and it goes on.  Mexican soda pop, beer, coffee, and other drinks.  This place takes cash only, and it is very inexpensive.  So splurge!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and the food here is awesome!  I didn't even know about this restaurant until my mom asked us to go with her.  The first time I went I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) which was delish.  During yesterday's visit I ordered 1 chile relleno burrito, 1 tongue taco, 1 adobada taco.  I asked for rice to be added to the burrito, and this was done :). The burrito was great with a lot of cheese.  The tacos had so much flavor.  The day before I tried the tacos from Taco Tijuana but the tacos at
El cordobes are better that Taco Tijuana.  
Taco Ranking so far FYI
#1 spot- Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. 
#2 spot- El Cordobes
#3 spot- Taco Tijuana
You can read my reviews for all.  
El cordobes has very good prices for their food.  Everything I had was 1 burrito, 2 tacos and 1 soda all for $10.50.  When I walk into this place it feels as if I were walking into my grandmas home to eat her food.  The only problem here is that they do not have flavored water like horchata, tamarindo and Jamaica.  All they have are sodas and beers, but the food is soo good that it makes up for this.  Please make sure you get the refried beans with your food!!  Also, I think it's cash only.  I payed cash but I think I saw a sign that said no debit/credit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great prices great food! Wish I had known about this place before I moved from Vegas... will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Really good chips and salsa... Tacos was amazing and the rice and beans was the best I've had in years.."}
{"text":"Don't understand what the hype is all about. Food didn't have flavor. I ordered the chile enchilada/chili relleno combo. Chile relleno was really hard, I couldn't even cut it with my fork. The customer service was terrible. They were not attentive and didn't even refill my water. Then they seemed bothered when we asked them to split the check."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!! They have your typical Mexican dishes that are all good flavorful and really cheap too! My husband had a carne asada burrito smothered in green chili and topped with cheese. I had sopes (chicken and deseprada AKA shredded beef) they were amazing! The beans are to die for and the service was great! I will be going back to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing but homemade style food here!! Always a must visit while in Las Vegas. Try the Chile relleno plate, campechana cocktail & any of the combo plates! $3 bohemias;)"}
{"text":"This is just an awesome little \"hole in the wall\" Mexican restaurant. Their prices are great and their food has that home made taste that many places struggle to capture, but El Cordobes does it with ease.

If I had to describe this place in one word it would be \"authentic\". Their menu isn't tailored towards Americanized Mexican food like so many other places do. You won't find a salsa bar or queso dip, but you will find tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and things like goat soup.

As soon as you walk in you'll notice the dining area is very small, just a few booths and some tables in the middle. I wouldn't come here as a large group, as I don't think they would have the staff to handle it even if they had the room. This seems like a place that always has just one cook and one server.

I love the salsa here, though be warned it is a little spicy and they don't have anything milder (like I said, authentic). Funny enough this is they only thing I have had that seem's spicy, though everything is well seasoned. One thing that stand's out about their food is they seem to use less salt than any other Mexican Restaurant I have been to. You don't really notice how salty most Mexican food is until you come to a place like this that doesn't use as much. The lack of salt is actually a good thing, as it let's the natural flavors of the ingredients and seasoning's stand on their own. And heck, you can always add a little salt if you need it (though I have never felt the need here).

I've tried quite a few things on the menu, and I have been impressed with almost everything. I am even more impressed considering their prices are excellent. Almost all their meals are less than $10, and burritos run for $6 or less. The two thing's that just astound me are that they have ceviche tostadas for $1.50 and tacos for $1.25. You can't find prices like that at Mexican fast food, let alone a sit down environment! And they have a ton of meat options for the tacos to; chorizo, asada, pastor, carnitas and chicken just to name a few. My wife and I almost always get a few tacos in addition to our meals every time we come here as they are very good and you just can't beat that price.

My favorite thing on the menu is anything with shredded beef in it, though I also love their chili verde. To be honest the only thing I ever had here that I didn't like is a torta with breaded steak, and even then the flavor was good it was just really chewy and tough. I also see a lot of people order soups, which I haven't tried myself but smell great and are served in large bowls. The next time we come here I plan on trying one.

One last thing, they have Mexican sodas and Mexican beers for great prices to. Sodas are $2 and beers are $3. Everything is served in glass bottles, and the coke is even in the larger size than the typical 12 ounce size. Yet another thing that adds to the authenticity of this establishment.

If you love really good authentic Mexican food, then you really need to give El Cordobes a try. This is one of those places that really stands above most of the rest."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is good, quality mexican food. My parents love the food here. They have mexican soda and aguas frescas. The owners are attentive, great service."}
{"text":"Burrito was very good. Had a chicken burrito. Simple with meat beans and cheese, how I like it. Chicken was very good and moist, not dried out. Glad I came here for lunch. Pricing was good for lunch too. Customer service could be better."}
{"text":"Had a tasty chili relleno burrito and da Hunny had chix tacos. For some reason he received a coke on Tap, no in a bottle like everyone else (what's up with that??). This is a cash only establishment, so if you are hungry, stop off at the ATM first"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. It is still the best Mexican food I have ever had !!!!!!!!!!!!! Reminds me of the food my family serves in Mexico. Authentic is an understatement. The small, simple setting, reminds me of relaxing in the home of a family member. This family owned small business makes every dish with the classic TLC. I will be going there for more years to come."}
