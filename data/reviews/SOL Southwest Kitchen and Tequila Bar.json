{"text":"We've been looking for this type of restaurant in Steele Creek/Berewick Area for a long time. High-end restaurant with reasonable prices. The atmosphere is southwestern, sophisticated and rugged, all wrapped up in style.   The first test was trying their salsa. We had the pineapple. The grilled pineapples were sweet and fresh. Loved it. Next, enchiladas for me and chimichanga for my wife. The enchiladas were tender with a little kick in the red sauce. I enjoyed it. My wife's chimichanga was awesome. It's a heavy dish but does not taste heavy. It was just a joy for the taste buds.   As for the staff, our waitress was great, friendly, and checked on us when needed. Even the GM stopped by our table. We talked for a few minutes about the restaurant, food and excitement starting 37 Sol in Steele Creek.   Enjoy friends!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch had the chicken tacos with grits the food was amazing.  The service was outstanding and very knowledgeable about the food and background on restaurant as a whole.  Differently coming back.  Thanks Teland"}
{"text":"1st visit.  Just ok food. Atmosphere was nice. Pricy for tex-mex, given the quality of food. Limited selection.  Waiter was good."}
{"text":"Very good drinks. Had 3 bartenders make custom cocktails for me and all we delicious. Bison burger was perfect too. This will be my local bar."}
{"text":"Welcomed addition to the neighborhood with exceptional food quality. Perfect size portions and choices on the menu.  The margaritas are really good but one suggestion, when you order ask for less ice. If not you have a dainty glass slam full of ice and only three swallows of margarita.  The tuna lollipops are amazing and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came at 5:15, no crowd, empty restaurant... Took 20 min for my drink to come out. I'm vegan, mentioned it to the waitor, ordered vegetable tacos with no cheese. The tacos came out with cheese. Waitor says, oh you never mentioned the cheese. Then takes the food back and returns with a \"new plate\" which was the same taco with some cheese scrapped off. Cheese still on the plate. Extremely unprofessional. Will not be here again."}
{"text":"Really awesome environment - the patio and screen porch are beautiful on these spring evenings. The service was satisfactory and the food was VERY slow to come out - it was a salad and tuna tacos, which are prepared rare. Would try this once more for a better experience."}
{"text":"I've tried so many things on the Sol menu and I still can't find anything that makes me come back for more. All of the margaritas I've had here had tasted like straight salt. Their quesadilla was bland but I'd prefer to eat it anywhere else and their chicken sandwich and fries are pretty forgettable. The service is okay."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting SOL, and I have to say we were a little disappointed. We ordered the steak quesadilla as well as the steak tacos. The flavors were okay at best. The caramelized onions were way too sweet which I felt ruined the tacos and overwhelmed the meat.  We also tried the habanero grapefruit margarita. It was also just okay and tasted watered down.  For a new restaurant trying to make a good impression, the service could have been better.   Overall, I would not choose SOL over a traditional Mexican restaurant if you're looking for that type of cuisine. The food was not worth the money."}
{"text":"Just \"eh\" I am in a dinner group we meet once a month at a different restaurant. This month was Sol. I had the Mexican Corn and seasoned fries, it was pretty tasty. The others ordered various things from queso dip and the Lobster Quesadilla. No one felt the food was super great but not terrible either. It was just somewhere between I come back for drinks but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating here since it's with in  walking distance to my home and I've watched it being built.  Upon arrival, we were promptly seated.  No wait for a Friday night is always welcome!  The restaurant is new and the decor is fresh. The place is clean.     The Margarita's here are exceptional and they also have an impressive selection of tequila.   I like that they offer some organic food, but honestly, I wasn't overly impressed by the food.  It was ok.  What I didn't like was that our waitress was hard to find when she was needed.  I wasn't going to write this but after seeing another review, it needs to be said:  I think my hubby got food poisoning from this place. He has a stomach of steel, but started feeling nauseated a couple hours after we left. He ended up throwing up later that night. We got different entrees, so I think I just got lucky.  We won't be going back.  Ever."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable. We walked in and were greeted by friendly staff and got sat down right away.  We asked to sit in the patio because it was a nice day out. We started our order with some drinks, my fiancé got the house red sangria which she loved. I ordered The zombie on draft. Our waitress also let me sample some beer before placing my order. For dinner We ordered the chicken avocado salad sandwich and green chili chicken nachos. The nachos were under the appetizer menu and it was a big serving I actually had another table ask me what I ordered.  The sandwich was a good size and it came with a side of fries. The food was amazing especially for it being there 2nd day open. From what we could see the restaurant looked to be running smooth and the staff was friendly. We will definitely be going back to this place. We have been waiting and waiting for a good restaurant to come into the Steele Creek area and we have finally received it. Also a plus that there is a bar."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but overpriced for decent taco's. Interesting drink menu but again, theyre proud of them! $$$$"}
{"text":"(Update 2/24)Thank you Jameson and the 37 Sol team for going above and beyond for remedying our last visit. Tonight's experience was a complete 180, all the food was delicious and the service top notch. Our friends also had a great time and I'm sure we'll be a regular sight in the restaurant.   ------------------ Had a good lunch here, however dinner was a completely different story. Started off fine, my wife enjoyed her cocktail and we both liked the apps. However, the shrimp in her shrimp and grits were rubbery, dry, and slightly crispy.   I ordered the chicken sandwich, and while initially thought the only flaw was timid seasoning, I found it to be underdone towards the thicker part. I will say that the jalapeño slaw was very good.  Service was also a bit of a miss. Our waitress started off friendly, but seemed much more hurried later into the meal. Our app plates (the ones the food came on, not the small bread plates) were never cleared from the table even though one held nothing but discarded corn cobs. Before we were even done with our food the check was dropped off without a word (I don't know if there are desserts on the menu, but we certainly weren't offered any, not any after dinner drinks...)  I was waiting for a decent time to bring up the cook issues with our proteins, just as a comment since I'd eaten most of the chicken before discovering the issues, and my wife usually doesn't like to complain and had eaten all but one. We sat there with a table of dirty plates, but nothing was cleared away and no one stopped to do anything. Finally we decided just to put down a card which was promptly snatched up before we could say anything. Deciding it wasn't worth it, we signed the check and left, and even as we walked out the door our dirty plates still sat on the table...  Was really hoping that we'd have a better experience since it's the nicest looking restaurants in the area, but I guess not.."}
{"text":"I wanted to like SOL. I really did. I saw mixed reviews online but decided that it would be worth a try.  I was quite underwhelmed.   The location is beautiful and conveniently located across from Charlotte Premium Outlets. The bar is well stocked with a great variety of tequilas (afterall is a tequila bar). This where my excitement ends.   Service Our waiter seemed quite rushed...almost unpleasant. We arrived around 8:45 pm and the restaurant closes at 11 pm. So, I could not understand the rush. Within a period of 10 minutes, the waiter asked us 4 times if we needed more time. I was greatly annoyed. When asked for a recommendation, he proceeded to inform me that he had not tried many options on the menu...which should have been a red flag.   Food & Drinks I ordered a strawberry margarita which looked really pretty but was almost too sweet to consume. It tasted like a combination of strawberry syrup and lime juice. Yet, my date's tequila sunrise was heavy on the tequila and quite light on everything else.   I ordered the margarita shrimp tacos with a side of roasted veggies. The veggies were great but the tacos left much to be desired. The corn tortilla was raw and cold. The shrimp had portions of shell still attached and the version of crema tasted like regular sour cream. It also included cut iceberg lettuce which is just a personal food pet peeve of mine. I prefer shredded... so no points deducted there. I was very underwhelmed.   First impressions are everything. I don't consider 37Sol worth another visit."}
{"text":"***Bar Review Only***  I came here for happy hour with a few co-workers. I was very pleased with the service and the drinks! Yes, they are pricey...but oh so good after a hard day at work.   I'm not sure at the price point if I'd add them to my regular rotation of happy hour spots - but for a treat this place is worth it!   I tried three margaritas and here's what I thought:  Citrus Margarita - Ahhh a classic. The perfect mix of tequila, fresh oj and sour mix.   Blood Orange Jalapeno Margarita - if you like it spicy...this is the drink for you. I loved the combination of flavors and the blood orange juice was a perfect compliment.   Blackberry Margarita - I think there's something special in that blackberry puree! It's absolutely delicious.   I can't speak on the food - but the drinks are awesome."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of chains but I really enjoyed my meal here. The chowder could have been spicier - but I love me some heat. However; the salmon and grits were super tasty. And the salmon was cooked perfectly.   The restaurant is beautiful and the service was on point.  I can usually find something to complain about. But I got nothing."}
{"text":"The service was great from our hostess and waiter. They were not at all the issue. The problem was the food. They have a good menu selection but my meal had a rock in it which i discovered unfortunately in my mouth instead of my plate with a little over my meal left. When i showed the waiter the rock in my food, he immediately took the plate back and told the manager. The manager came by the table with a less than stellar explanation for why no one noticed the rock in my food that came from the beans they prepared before it was brought to me. They took $1 off my meal when i didn't even complete half of my food when it was taken. I left the restaurant still hungry having paid full price for a meal that i didn't eat bc of their mistake. I would be more upset but what i ordered wasn't that great anyway."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food and atmosphere awesome. Can't wait to go back! I never order steak but I took a risk and it paid off."}
{"text":"GOOD Margs. I came in on Cinco De Mayo and I had to have a marg. They had a special that day. It was tasty and you can tell they were well trained as I had two and they both tasted the same. I ordered the chicken quesadilla. I liked how they were square. It was different they the typical. I wish they had more spicy to it however."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, and I'm really happy there were fresh organic ingredients. Don't order the chicken nachos if you're getting them for the kids. Although the employee told me on the phone they were not spicy at all if I get them without jalapenos, my little 6 year olds were not able to handle the heat. I did not take any stars away though because they were delicious, fresh, and on time. Will definitely be back again frequently!! Vegan options were delish as well!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and great service from Melody. We had the Chicken Chimichanga and Queso Blance. I think the location is great for this area, considering it has a large bar and outdoor seating area.  I will definitely come back and try more items on menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after shopping at the outlets because I wanted to try it. The food was amazing!! So delicious and fresh!!! We ordered the lobster quesadilla and the tuna avocado salad to share, it was so good and perfectly seasoned. Service was great as well. We will be going back, I can't wait to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was great! Was with a group of 3 total couples, and we all enjoyed our food.  My fiancé and I got enchiladas (he the shrimp, me the chicken) and both were excellent.  We got the trio of pick your own salsa, guac and queso and unending chips.  The guac was a little heavy on the onions for me, but the queso and Barack bean and corn salsa were delicious.  We even got the chili brownie which was by far the best dessert I've had in a long time.  Our friends got the apple empanada which looked amazing too.  The margaritas were also on point.  We got the strawberry and house margaritas and both were so tasty we got multiple!    The inside decor was really cool too.  Loved the lights.  The one downside was the shape of the plates weren't conducive to the small table we were in for 6 people.  They were long serving style plates that barely fit on the table.  I would change those out for smaller tables, but at larger tables maybe not a problem.  Either way, still highly recommend this place.  And finally, a great restaurant in the Steele Creek area!! Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"On the west coast we call them the perfect margarita....and finally I found one in Charlotte.  SOL Southwest Kitchen serves an excellent, all natural, fresh perfect Margarita.  The food is fresh and healthy.  The Sea Bass was delicious, complimented with grilled seasonal vegetables and rice. The presentation enticed a couple sitting near me at the bar to order the same.  A great outdoor fire pit, if you are a smoker, that's your spot, and if you sit at the bar, Brian is the guy to provide great service."}
{"text":"Ehh...that's what I can say about the food. Cocktails and beer selection is good, but the food is no really on point. The environment is very attractive, and has a decent vibe, but the food just threw me off. Nothing against the management or wait staff. Wish them all luck."}
{"text":"Really nice addition to the restaurant choices. High end, creative cocktails make this a fun place to meet for a drink or a leisurely dinner.  The flank steak tacos are bursting with flavor.  Service was good and the atmosphere is unique.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! Awesome atmosphere-very clean and unique western feel. Averi was an terrific server-very friendly and gave great suggestions. Food was awesome! Had the trio which was a perfect serving for three people. Entrees were also awesome-would recommend  the chicken enchiladas and mushroom quesadillas. I think this place is definitely going to be the spot to eat after a long day of shopping at the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Finally a real restaurant in this area!! So nice to be able to sit down and order good food and cocktails. This side of town is missing the bus when it comes to non - fast food options.    The tuna lollipops and the mezcal mule are my go-to' s."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great drinks. Plenty of parking. FOOD is phenomenal. Our waitress was Kayla. She was great as well. So, my husband said give them a \"4\" because he wasn't able to mix and match the tacos lol. Also, I wish a side came with my quesadilla since it was a little small but man was it good!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp great reviews!!! Went with my family around 1pm for the lunch the hostess was very stand-off like we were bothering her. I was with my husband and two young sons. A nice man helped me cleaned off a table while I got my family out of the car. She then sat a 4 top in front of us where we were going to sit. I asked for a high chair and a booster never said enjoy or anything. I asked for a Kids menu she said we don't have one but they have crayons. We decided this place wasn't for us. My husband told her we were leaving she just shook her head. Never will come back and didn't even get to try it."}
{"text":"I want to say one should reserve any harsh judgements for a while as this place just opened up. As with any business when it's first opened there are going to be kinks to work out. The do have a large drink menu, or shall I say they have a lot of tequilas. Couldn't get a mojito, decided on a citrus sangria, it was ok. The menu here is very different. I thought it was going to be more of a \"Mexican\" style menu, but it was different. So everything I was expecting like refried beans and regular rice weren't there. They only have black beans and brown rice (they have other sides but no other bean or rice options)I'm not a fan of either. Their adobo fries are just seasoned french fries, don't let the fancy name fool you. Let me say that in my opinion the servings are small, for what I got which was the two tacos, they were small like the ones that you would generally get for the $1 elsewhere for the taco Tuesday specials. I'm still interested in their brunch menu which appears promising. The pricing I want to say is above average, one thing that stuck out to me on the menu was a 9oz skirt steak for $24. Love new business here in Steele creek, here we grow again."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and the food is very good; margaritas are amazing. I have been there for lunch and dinner and it would be nice if the had a lunch menu. It's the same as their dinner menu and a little pricey for lun  Returned last evening (2/17/18) with a party of 8 and the service was terrible. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time. We ordered the Trio appetizer and one was correct but the other was missing 2 items, which we had to point out to our waitress. It took 25 minutes to get a beer order and 30 minutes for our food to come out. The waitress even admitted that we were her only table and that she should be more on top of things. It will be a while before we return."}
{"text":"I've visited SOL 3 times.  Two of my visits have been negative, one of them was positive.  Today my two children, my wife, my mother in law, and I visited for dinner.  It took about 50 minutes from the time we arrived to get our food.  The cook time was substantial, unexpected, and inappropriate.  When we finally did get our food, it was incorrect.  My mother in law ordered a chimichanga without the sauce.  She was served one with sauce.  A few minutes after we received our food the server stopped by and noticed the issue.  She took the initiative to have the cooks fix it.  The manager brought the \"fixed\" meal back out.  She explained that they re-plated the food and made it look nice, since presentation is important.  I cannot for the life of me understand why she would focus so much on presentation and totally ignore the fact that the chimi still had the sauce on it... (to be clear - the plate is filled with the sauce, and the chimi is placed on top of the sauce, so it soaks into the bottom) By the time the chimi came back, I was done with my meal, so it didn't make sense to send the chimi back again.  They could have made the issue right by comping the chimi since it was never made as ordered.  Instead we were charged for it.   Management - if you want to build a sustaining customer base, you need to learn how to appropriately address issues when they arise."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always wanted to go to the SOL is Charleston. So when we found out that this one was coming, we were very excited to go. We've been twice so far and I would absolutely go back again. The first time was probably some of the best service I've had that wasn't at a high end restaurant. The server was very attentive and had great recommendations. We had the queso dip to start with that we thought was pretty good. Just a few chips were too salty. I had the chicken chimichanga that I thought was pretty good. It could have had a little less sauce on the bottom of the plate but other than that, my dish was great. My boyfriend had the flank steak quesadilla and he said it was the best quesadilla he's ever had. He loved how it had a slight hint of sweetness. It was different which is what we both wanted. Not a regular meal.  The second time my boyfriend had the flank steak quesadillas again which again, he loved! I decided to change it up and ordered the flank steak tacos. I was slightly disappointed as the steak itself didn't seem to have too much flavor as the steak in the quesadilla. The rice it comes with was cooked great and was full of flavor.  The atmosphere seems like it will eventually take on  to be a prime spot around there to have a few drinks and a great meal on the weekends. The patio/fire pit area looks to be very large and a different area to be when the weather turns a little warmer.  I would definitely recommend SOL to anyone who wants non traditional Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite place especially here in Berewick/Steele Creek area. The adult drinks are amazing, food is always hot, fresh and delicious. I love going here 2-3 times a week,  satisfaction guaranteed every visit."}
{"text":"Tried this place out the other day after shopping at the outlets and it was really good. Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful. For starters I tried the strawberry margarita. It was very flavorful and fresh.  For the meal we tried the chicken nachos and I created my own enchilada with rice and beans. Basically, I ordered the veggie enchilada without the veggies it came with and added my own rendition of spinach and mushrooms. The staff was super accommodating to my requests and the meal was so flavorful and delicious. Everything we ordered had a small spicy kick too which I usually try to avoid but it wasn't bad. Portion sizes and prices aren't bad either.    I like the seating options as well. Very spacious place, with both indoor and outdoor seating. There's also a fire pit outside that I really want to come back and enjoy on like a fall evening or something.   Anyways, I am a fan of this place. It was a good find and I can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"This review is based on this weekends experience. You are located across the street from an apartment community. It is not fair to the residents who live here to hear the music vibrate through the entire community. It is disrespectful and careless. I live 2 buildings away from the restaurant and I can feel the vibration of the music through my home. You #neighbors but you are not thinking of your neighbors when you blast loud live music for several hours"}
{"text":"Went here for mother's day dinner yesterday. Overall, it is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area that I've tried. The service was very good, and the atmosphere was more upscale than your typical Mexican restaurant.   My only complaint was that it was hot in the restaurant. It was 93 degrees that day, and for some reason the staff had the access to the outside seating area completely open. The result was that it felt cooler temperature wise outside in the parking lot than it did in the indoor area of the restaurant. And the only fans were also in the outside area, there just wasn't any relief to be found. Several from our group ended up walking outside to cool off during dinner.  I mentioned this to our waiter, and he said that they had the AC on its lowest setting. But issue was that they kept open the wall that separates the indoor and outdoor seating areas. If this were closed than it would've probably kept the temperature more pleasant."}
{"text":"Ok I was really  excited about a restaurant here.  The service we had was excellent.    The drinks excellent  The appetizers we ordered were good the portions too small and overpriced.   The steak skewers the pieces of meat were so small it was laughable.  $11 for 2 skewers.  I should have taken a picture.  Tiny tiny pieces of steak.   Also the firecracker jalapeños were also small.  4 was all you got for $9 and they were not spicy at all.  Very plain.   2 other taco entrees were fine but sides are very small.  Mixed veggies were good and I had a side of them but also a small serving.  The food is good but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Alex was our waitress and she was fantastic!! We had the nachos and quesadillas, super yummy!! Love the Bloody Mary too!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sol for several months regularly and it has been great including the staff. I stopped by after work early this week one night. The bartender was so so at best and full of himself which not welcoming. He was saying to several of us that we had nothing to worry about because he was really good at what he does. I guess he didn't mean as a server because I waited 15 minutes for him to come around and help me get a drink. The restaurant is gorgeous but I will not return!"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience here - I have been wanting to try out a new restaurant and I live near at Solis Berewick - originally I order a Patron and Lime Juice drink however the restaurant didn't have Rose Lime Juice but the Bartender Jamie was able to achieve a better taste with fresh squeezed lime juice and a sugar and water liquid which I enjoyed - I found myself eating what I consider BAD n HEALTHY lol - never had fried green tomatoes which shrimp but it was tasty and the presentation was excellent - Spicy chipotle shrimp, fried green tomatoes, green Chile aioli, salsa verde - they call it South by Southwest Shrimp - I will definitely be back to this restaurant - hopefully they continue to hire pleasant customer focused employees - since moving here from Washington DC some of my general favorites have fallen short on customer service - However I rate this establishment A1 - GOOD JOB!"}
{"text":"I was desperately looking for a good new restaurant in this area. The service was fantastic. Every single bartender was attentive, and knowledgeable. I LOVED the specialty seasonal margs. I ordered the ahi tuna salad and the avocado chicken salad with a side of the grits. The food was fantastic. I will be returning."}
{"text":"The margaritas are awesome! Highly recommend the blackberry margarita and the cranberry spiced margarita. Carnitas napoleon and Chicken chimichanga"}
{"text":"Our experience with 37Sol was great!  So happy to have this addition to the neighborhood. The service from walking into the door to the bar was prompt and friendly.  Our server at the bar recommended margaritas after asking us a few questions on what we liked.  The drinks are made from fresh and homemade mixes and purées. The margaritas were awesome and went down quick!  We ordered the chicken enchiladas with the poblano and Gouda grits and the carnitas napoleon.  Both came out quickly and beautifully presented.  They tasted fantastic and very well paired with the house made habanero hot sauce that our server recommended.  The portions were perfect and left me full but not feeling like I overate. Both dishes are must haves!  We absolutely will be back!"}
{"text":"What we ordered was good but I expected more food options. Our waiter wasn't attentive at all. Another waitress saw that we needed drinks and brought them to us."}
{"text":"The food is good but 20 minutes for tacos on a Sunday afternoon is a little long. People ordering after us getting their food before us (tacos)"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good limited variety of food but depends on what you like has the inside and outside with fire pit outside."}
{"text":"So good! The quesadilla was amazing as well at my sangria. Great place to grab drinks after work. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The fool presentation is very high end and the taste is even higher end. I got the shrimp and grits which was a little different then traditional S&G in the since that the grits are served in a grit patty style with and amazing sauce. The shrimp to grit ratio was a little off but I fought through it. Has a little spice to it but if you know me that's perfect. Chris doesn't like spicy food. It is a little on the pricey side but you'll feel vindicated when you take your first bite. I tried the Shrimp and Jalapeño Bisque which was a good little starter and once again not too spicy. Over all a great visit. The food came out fast and hot and the server was super quick with refills and knew her stuff. The only minuseseseses was our table was wobbly, I know that seems small in the scheme of things but it can show a lack of attention to detail which could transfer to the food. Also, it could make things messy as my sister's coffee spilled a bit. Any WWE fans may want to stop by as Kurt Angle was there having lunch."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Everything from the food to the drinks to the service was great. Sat at the bar and all the bartenders were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Food was not good, service was slow. I ordered the shrimp bisque, awful! Campbells can soup taste better! I also ordered the chicken sandwich, it was greasy, fries were greasy. My husband had the salmon and grits, he thought it tasted awful, losing its flavor trying to be too complex. If I could give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the food didn't disappoint either time however they definitely have some work to do on the service. We came on a Saturday at 5 p.m. and it's really the first day of spring was great weather. They were grossly understaffed.  I ordered a strawberry margarita with a salted rim and got it with sugar. No big deal I'll just be very clear the second time. Well I went to the restroom and my wife said she had to send it back because it came with sugar again. When the waitress returned she brought the drink without either sugar or salt. Wowsers! Nonetheless, when we finally got it right to drink was amazing.  On the food front we got the queso with chorizo and that was really good. I got a pork taco and my wife got the chicken taco so that we could swap. A huge gripe for me is that you cannot mix and match tacos here. The chicken taco was phenomenal. Bacon makes everything better! :-). The pork Taco was really good also. I would get them both again. All tacos are accompanied by rice and beans and in my opinion this is some of the best rice and beans that I've ever had. I look forward to coming here again.. For the food. Not the service!"}

{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and awesome food. We thought the service would be slow due to being new but they did a really good job. Definitely going to be our new go to place."}
{"text":"This place is really nice change to the outlet mall area. We went here on a Saturday evening and it was not too crowded and for 6 of us we got a seat right away which was nice. The food here was delicious and they give you a good portion of food for the price. I am pregnant so I wasn't able to enjoy the drinks but everyone else did and they said they were delicious. The Jalapeno margaritas were the favorite of the table. I got the mushroom quesadilla and that was pretty delicious. The bar area st this restraint was really nice too. The o ly thing that was kind of awkward was our waitress.. This seemed to be her first waitress job and she didn't seem to understand social cues because she would come over and tell us really weird stories that just made us feel awkward... Like when she told us we should go up to her boss and tell him she is doing a good job, but besides that this place was great! We will def be going back"}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago. Love the fact that this side of town is growing, so adding restaurants like this is a plus. The food was pretty good but the portions were small like tapas. Service was great was able to jump on the waiting list thru yelp app always a plus!"}
{"text":"Tequila flights and tuna tacos, what more could you possibly want in life. Okay, just kidding, literally everything here is awesome. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and the menu is chock full of delicious choices. Now when it comes to the tequila be prepared to look long and hard before you make your choices, because its mind blowing. You have over 60 to pick from. I love going to places like this to try something it before I buy a bottle for home. Great place."}
{"text":"37Sol again, and once again ... delicious.  Chicken enchiladas wrapped in a baked corn shell that still had crunch to it was stuffed with firm, tiny diced veggies that added texture, while the christmas sauce (aka red & green chiles) made for a sweet & savory flavor. Excellentè! Their Jalepeno Bloody Mary is garnished with a ribbon of bacon & a skewer of a pepperoncini stuffed between manzanilla olives. The added generous pour makes for an excellent drink! Our waiter was apparently young & inexperienced but it didn't affect service at all. The greeter was right-on, assuring noone had questions & that everything was satisfactory at all tables. Great teamwork!  A perfect example of good management! The raw, natural decor with faux-wood upholstered booths & a mix of seating arrangements makes for a chic, relaxed ambience. There's also an awesome pet-friendly patio with a fire pit! Perfect setting for a private party. Highly recommend 37Sol!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat when your at the Charlotte Premium Outlets.  Good selection of local drafts and extensive selection of tequila and margaritas.  The flank steak tacos are a must try.  Sweet and spicy beef."}
{"text":"So it's best I start this review by stating I was with a very large crowd of people, but I do know that the staff was made aware of the number of people who be dining at least 4 days in advance. Food: Good, I did feel the portions were small. Price: depending on what you order reasonable. Very nice atmosphere and convenient since we live in Berewick.  Service was poor. Like I said I was with a large crowd of ppl but the staff wasn't organized with how they took our orders and literally it took close to an hour and 15min  before our food was brought out. Not giving up on this place yet will give it another try. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Went to lunch on a Friday. Good food!!! Good drinks!!! Friendly staff!!! Laid back!!! Outdoor seating looks great. Big bar with sports on."}
{"text":"*Bar Review* This place has a lot of potential.  The decor and interior design are appealing and the openness of the outdoor space is inviting.  The blasting repetitive country music was terrible. The bartender was also not particularly attentive.  The drinks were decent and we likely would have stayed for more if the music didn't drive us away."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, over priced. The food was just OK, I certainly wasn't wowed for the price. If someone else wanted to go there, I wouldn't say no. However, I wouldn't seek this place out either."}
{"text":"2nd time here, best Mexican food in Charlotte! Had the Carnitas Napoleon and it was amazing! Pork was cooked just right, not dried out like most places. Had a little spice but not so much where it wasn't enjoyable.  Oh, and make sure you start with the Queso with Chorizo"}
{"text":"The staff members are dedicated to making sure you have a great experience to keep you coming back.   I started off with the Grilled Street Corn ~~ not what I was used to having from a food cart ~~ but the corn was so sweet. I'll definitely be having this again.   The South x Southwest Shrimp was amazing. The shrimp & fried green tomato combination is a for sure shot! The flank steak tacos were plain but seasoned to perfection. The steak & fries were delicious as well. Dinner was paired with a Bubbly Brut, Spain, Sol Mule & blackberry margarita.   So head on over, grab a seat on the patio & treat your tastebuds."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night (12/29) and I'll start with the good. Our food was really good. We got the guacamole, lobster quesadilla, and chicken quesadilla. We each got a drink and this is where it went downhill, we asked our waitress (Rebecca) what they make the sangria with\" she says \"I don't know, I'm not a bartender\". So I said \"well do you know what they put in it\" she says \"no\". Never offered to find out what's in it. Just walked away. I'm very big on customer service. If you look at my other reviews I've complained more about service than food. We asked for the manager he came and apologized and gave us a complimentary glass of sangria. The other servers who either brought our food or picked up our empty plates were very nice. So I would say she just was the bad apple of the bunch. We will certainly come back and hopefully it will 5 stars star to finish."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying go straight to the bar and ask for Alex! He's awesome and pleasant ! ( and cute). But he was friendly, knowledgeable on the various Tequila's! As a fer-formed college Tequila drinker I am pleased! The food was great, I highly recommend the Chicken Taco. I wish I had received 3 opposed to 2. However it's still great. I love the view. If you sit at the bar and see the open patio it adds to the ambiance. Needless to say I will be back.. this time with the girls !"}
{"text":"I really don't know if this place is going to last. I went with a friend who suggested this place and we came for lunch. They weren't busy at all.  I could not believe the prices. Way overpriced. Pricing was up to $25. Chips and salsa are not complimentary. Not a huge deal for me but it definitely would be for my husband.   I got the shrimp tacos with no beans and extra rice. It was $11. I asked for the crema sauce on the side since I can't have a lot of dairy. The waitress was fine with that and even repeated it back to me. About 10 mins later she serves our food and the crema sauce was all over the shrimp tacos. Annoying but I didn't complain because I didn't want my friend waiting. My $11 shrimp tacos were chopped up shrimp. They weren't even full shrimp. My rice was a small portion for what it was. My friend got the soup and she liked it and it came with a small quesadilla. I ate all my food and I was still hungry. Their lunch quesadillas are approx $11-16 a piece. Their sol plates are approx $13-25 a piece.   Not sure if I would come back. There are so many mexican restaurants around that all have their different styles for way cheaper. The food wasn't terrible but definitely not memorable."}
{"text":"Nice edition to Berewick. Staff was friendly, decor is tasteful, food is fresh and tasty. Prices are a little high, portions aren't that large; 16oz Hop Drop was $8.00 seemed steep. All in all great experience, looking forward to trying more of the menu items, and seeing how this restaurant pans out. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was good. Atmosphere is good. Just a tad pricey or it would've been 5 stars. But that's not going to stop me from eating there."}
{"text":"Came here twice in one day - first for a late lunch with my son and friend and again later at night with a large group for drinks.   Let's start with the service. Both times were \"ehhh.\" The lunch waitress was very nice but my son's drink stayed empty too long, too many times. The waitress passed our table three times before I finally had to yell for her to come over and refill his drink. She couldn't hear me when I used my indoor voice. The second waitress wasn't much better. We had a large group, sitting at a large table between the bar and front door. The waitress took one appetizer order from one side of the table and left. She didn't bother going to the other side to ask if anyone else wanted apps. After she dropped off the one appetizer, she disappeared until we asked the hostess to get her. It wasn't very busy and I saw several waitresses in a small room by the door, chit chatting. I hope the service improves- that's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.   Now on to the food and drinks!  Everything was AMAZING!   Started with the Trio sampler app - queso, guac and the House red salsa. Yum! It was so good, I ordered It again the second time I was there, the only difference being that I opted for the habanero salsa which I loved! Just the right amount of heat. Queso was creamy and the guac was so fresh - better than Chipotle's! We also ordered the lobster quesadilla, chicken nachos, bison burger and carnitas napoleon. Everything was delicious but my carnitas were a tad dry. I poured salsa over It which made it taste so much better. But then again, salsa is delicious on almost everything!   My favorite thing about this place is their drinks. So good! I tried the Blackberry Inferno lemonade and blackberry margarita. Loved them both! A friend ordered the jalapeño cucumber drink and It was way too spicy. Consider yourself warned!   All in all, I enjoyed the meal and drinks here. My friends live in Berewick so I'll be in the area often and this place will be on our list whenever we're in the mood for drinks. Just hope the service improves!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday weekend and we decided to try this restaurant out to try. We actually went at night so the fire pit was going which gave the restaurant a great decor.  (side note;  Customer actually use this as there designated smoke area.  So if you don't like smoke stay clear) We were greeted well once we walked in and were seated in a booth.  The decor is very southwestern and very open with a stain glass accent wall.  The bar layout is actually cool especially at night.  (side note; its very very very dark in the restaurant so don't drop anything on the floor because it will be hard to find it.)  We ordered chips with salsa, guacamole, and queso witch was actually good. Our main course though lack the seasoning to actually be good. I had the chicken sandwich and my date had the shrimp tacos both were just flavorless.  Really big disappointment being that the decor was cool but the food was just bad.  I don't know about the other items on the menu but if you decide to come here don't order what we had."}
{"text":"This place was ok but expected more being from Charleston. First we came in and was told a 25min wait and they had 8 tables open? So we just sat at the bar to eat since it was empty. The bartenders were super nice and waited on us like sitting at a table (not all places can provide same experience at the bar). We got the queso with chorizo which was great other than the chips tasted like they were out of a bag and not homemade. Unsure if they are but I've actually had better chips out of a bag. I got the chicken chimi and it was good but the sauces lacked flavor on the plate making it overall kinda bland. We did get their homemade hot sauce which helped boost the flavor. My husband got the chili enchiladas which he agreed were good but nothing exciting, just average. Homemade sangria was great and they had top shelf tequila. The one big thing especially with flu season is I watched one of the bar tenders cough several times directly into his hands then never wash. He is touching glasses, plates of food, etc. I'm sorry but teach your wait staff to protect their germs... cough in your arm and not on your hands. Or atleast wash them after! It's new but I hope they evolve the flavors and teach sanitary practices for their wait staff."}
{"text":"Wonderful Atmosphere, wonderful staff, and the best bacon wrapped jalapenos and the tequila is by far the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The hostess Lauren and the servers are knowledgeable and pleasant. They helped me choose menu items. By the way the menus are uniquely mounted on wooden boards. The food is Mexican inspired because they add their own flare to it. I went with a friend and we enjoyed the street corn. Then we branched off into a deliciously crispy chicken chimichanga. It was accompanied by two sauces which complimented each other although the red one was slightly bitter when eaten alone."}
{"text":"I have never been to the south west of the US. Maybe one day. But I like to think that when the great rapper Chuck D first said the words \"By The Time I Get To Arizona\" he had no idea places like this existed. If only he'd known we may have been robbed of one of the greatest songs of all time. By the time I get to Florida just doesn't have the same ring to it.  Sol is beautiful inside and out. Whoever decorated this joint did the damned thang. The food was all intriguing combinations that made me want to return and try them again and again. The food feels fancy but the atmosphere didn't make me feel under dressed in my t-shirt and jogging pants.   This place hasn't been open long and I think we got a waiter who was new. He seemed a little unsure of himself but he did just fine in the end. It is a little expensive if you're just expecting Mexican food. It's not. It's got that South West plane ticket on it so come prepared to spend a little dough.   Sol is a great get away spot for Americans to remember what brings us together in these troubled times. We may not agree on which lives matter, if men are trash, who can marry who or who the president of the United States should be... but we can all agree that transfats are delicious.   And isn't that what it's really about? All of us distracting ourselves with delicious treats as we pray Kim Jong doesn't nuke us into oblivion before Black Panther comes out on February 18th 2018?"}
{"text":"Couldn't believe the lack of crowd here on a Friday night! It should be packed with the amazing choices of beverages, delish food with a large variety of choices and the great atmosphere! I think what I loved most about the atmosphere was how spacious it was with plenty of room to move between tables. We tried 4 different drinks from their menu and each one was refreshing and different. We also had the sol trio appetizer of salsa, queso and guac and it was delish with plenty for a party of 4. Everyone in our party was overly satisfied with their dishes. The service was friendly and prompt. No complaints here at all and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Shrimp jalapeño soup was excellent . For a cup of soup it had several big shrimp. Wedge salad was good but I've had better. Beautiful restaurant. I'll be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Had flank steak quesadilla and steak  tacos.  Meat was super tender and full of flavor.  Awesome roasted peppers, caramelized onions, rocking Chihuahua cheese and a spicy avocado cream on top.  Perfect blend of flavors.   Server Jamie was a terrific and  super friendly.  Will definately be back."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and very friendly staff. We sat at the bar for lunch, bartenders were very knowledgeable about the menu. I had the tuna tacos, and my boyfriend had the shrimp tacos. Both were outstanding. If you are a tequila fan this is also the place for you. They have a separate menu of just tequilas! So great to see restaurants like this opening in this area."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are absolutely delicious!  Atmosphere is nice as well!  Service is quick.  Easy to get in and out, great location!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my moms birthday. Made a reservation over a month ago and when I called to confirm they didn't have a reservation on the schedule. Fortunately Jennifer was able to accommodate our party . Upon arrival our party was sitting out side; I had requested inside seating because there was a possibility of dogs sitting outside and my mom doesn't like dogs. There was in fact 2 dogs next to our table. So I asked the hostess to move our party inside because I had originally requested inside. They again were able to accommodate our request. Alex was our waitress and she was great. She was attentive with drinks appetizers and our entrees. She was able to get my mom a birthday brownie too. The blackberry and strawberry margarita were top hits. We had the shrimp tacos, shrimp and grit cakes, chipotle chicken quesadilla. Next time we will sit out at the fire pit. Make sure you confirm your reservation too"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  The service is fabulous & the food is unreal.  Try the tuna lollipops & grilled corn. Great margaritas too.  So glad to actually have good food in this area of town!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our first time at 37 Sol. Great service, attention to deal, up and coming spot, shop at premium outlets and relax with a handcrafted cocktail, I recommend the shrimp tacos, drinks and service from Hanaa and Teland.   Looking for a place to dine after shopping at the premium outlets, try 37 Sol. Plenty of wall outlets to get your phone recharged and hooks at the bar for your bags."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. The food was good especially the posole. The trio is over priced though ;)"}
{"text":"As soon as I got here I looked on Yelp at the pics of the food. The \"must have\" chicken enchilada with the Gouda poblano grits spoke to me and that's what I got. OMG so good, very fresh tasting. I had no trouble subbing out the rice and beans for the grits. You can sub out with any of the sides. Although, my hubby got the slaw and that wasn't that great. His steak tacos were phenomenal. Highly recommend those too.   Service was fantastic, thank you Jas. We sat outside by the fire pit with a beer after lunch. My kids have been there for breakfast and they said that was very good. This place is just outside from the outlets. Do a little shopping, then go have a bite to eat. I'm full of great ideas"}
{"text":"Simply delicious. The service was awesome. It's been a while since I've had this much great service and food. Totally awesome \"in my Cali voice\". If your lucky. You'll meet Richie"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had from a restaurant. Last night I had a large party of like 14-16 show up, half almost an hour late. The kitchen did not close until 11pm and our reservation was at 915pm. I was expecting to relax, chat, and have drinks until our the majority of our party came. But after 30 min the cook came out the kitchen reminding us that the kitchen closed at 11 and we need to order soon. It was only 9:40pm. My party was highly upset by this remark. The manager came and apologized offering to buy the table's first round of drinks.   The waiter was horrible. If you have a large party and need help -2 waiters would suffice !! He would grab an order, leave, and I would have to hunt him down for another order.  The wait time was incredibly long as well. As he was taking our orders he complained that \"ugh this is going to be hard for me but oh well\"... Oh! And when we first arrived we had a bar-top table for 8 MAX with chairs to seat 10.. when I asked about more guests arriving he suggested we pull more chairs.   I've worked in customer service for years and this was all around bad service. The restaurant was SO SLOW and not even busy. There was no excuse that would justify how rudely we were treated. Also, 4 ppl from our party did not get their first drink covered. This was the worst decision to have my 30th Birthday Dinner here. Now this is the memory I have to remember. THANKS."}
{"text":"First time there and the tex-mex style food was very fresh and very good. For tequila lovers, they have more variety than I've ever seen. Cool atmosphere and decor. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food and drink selections! Just a littlw overpriced and  could use complimentary chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"A bunch of friends went to SOL for Cinco de Drinko (ha) here and had an amazing time. The atmosphere is great for a casual get together. We went to the bar and got a margarita and took it out by the firepit while we waited and it was perfect. Lots of chairs outside and on the patio while you're waiting. We were seated in about 20-30 minutes and had great service while also enjoyed a wonderful meal. My friend had the salmon and literally couldn't stop raving about it. We each had something different (salmon, shrimp tacos, southern shrimp and grits and chicken tacos) and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. I would also recommend the queso and guac!"}
{"text":"The food was good, I had the shrimp and grits.  Service was slow and there was hardly any patrons in the restaurant.  To top off the slow service, there was an incident with the staff; the cook came into the dining area shouting at the servers because they weren't moving fast enough with retrieving the food orders off the line, how unprofessional, it was embarrassing to watch!!!"}
{"text":"A great new addition to the Steele Creek area. This is the nicer restaurant I've been waiting to open in this area. We have a lot of fast food options, but few options to a step up in dining. My first trip here was on a Thursday night. The business was active, but not full. We were promptly seated, the staff very friendly. We got the Trio appetizer to start. Guac, Salsa, and cheese dip with tasty chips. This was a great app, just the right size, and very good. I ordered one of their top end margarita's, it was very good. For Dinner I ordered an Enchilada with beans and rice. It was attractively prepared and very tasty. My wife ordered the sea bass and said it was delicious. If you want to go to a nicer restaurant in this area, your options are limited, but this is a fine place to visit. For comparison sake, it would be in the same stature a Vida in Downtown Charlotte. Enjoy the eats!"}
{"text":"Such a huge disappointment!  Food was horrible and over priced, service was slow and the servers were not educated about the menu.  Super disappointed as we live in Berewick community. We were so excited to welcome a new restaurant in our neighborhood. We will not return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this new restaurant as I live 2 seconds away! We ordered the queso to start with which was cold/warm. My husband got the chicken sandwich which looked great and he said it was good. I ordered the shrimp tacos which only came with 2 tiny soft tacos and a tiny scoop of rice and beans. By the end of the night I had FOOD POISONING! It was horrible! Body aches, fever, you know the rest...all day the next day as well. Went to the doctor and confirmed it was in fact food poising! I called the restaurant the next day to tell them and all I got was \"I'll call to check up on you\". Sorry but that right there was the cherry on top. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"This new place is great, awesome atmosphere great food and drinks and excellent service by George and Alex, I will definitely be going back, so convenient right across from the outlets. They have an awesome outdoor space with a fire pit and a large screened in patio that will be great in the spring and fall.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"We went there after playing golf and shopping and the food and service were terrific. We were mid afternoon so the place was empty, which was even better. We got the corn and bean salsa and the tuna lollipop appetizers, which we loved. The tacos were about as good as we could find in town also. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"So this place just opened up 2 weeks ago and i have been itching to get here everyone knows mexican food is my favorite! It's a nice cozy spot in the heart of the outlet mall shopping center. The hi light of Sol Kitchen is no doubt the fire pit outside that immediately caught my eye i thought it added a nice touch, not to mention it was cold outside last night. Our waitresses were super friendly and attentive. One of them even opted to take a picture by her specialty drink the black diamond margarita and oh boy was it good. We also tried the solarita, and blackberry margarita, the black diamond margarita hands down was the best.  Everything about this place was perfect. My only complaint would be the prices. Again usually generally Mexican restaurants are generally cheaper never should you leave out of a Mexican restaurant and spend $70 alone on drinks when you didn't have many to begin with. I was looking for that traditional margarita glass vs the cutesy rimmed glasses that have you asking for another drink and find yourself spending tons on drinks alone. So i couldn't decide what i wanted when i arrived so i asked the opinions of the waitresses i asked them both if your establishment were up to win an award and you had to cook your best dish that could win you that award what would you choose? They both raved about the salmon and grits. Whew now those grits were definetly tasty with the variety of spices and ingriedients added with the slices of avacodo pieces, the salmon was good not great. Recommended i just wish they had drink specials."}
