{"text":"Listen, I've been eating pho since I was old enough to go to soccer camp every summer. Basically, I think I know a thing or two about the pho experience.

This place is good. Not great. The service was on the slow side (about 10 minutes), the broth a little bit bland, and the rare beef wasn't that rare (it's best when sliced thin and served completely uncooked). Still, it was pho and I had a good time.

Unfortunately, this place also suffers from an unfortunate trend towards skimpiness I've noticed at many Canadian pho places. There's no option for a large bowl and the regular bowl will run you 10 bucks and may leave you wanting more if you are really hungry."}
{"text":"I eat here often, only because there's not much else in walking distance of my office.
I keep ordering various items and am always left unsatisfied. 
It's alright, but flavours are one dimensional, unlike Vietnamese cuisine where freshness and exotic spices lingers frangrantly in the air. 
Meat and vegetable dishes are soggy, like when you over crowd a pan and all you get a soppy wet mess. 
Vietnamese cuisine is my favourite of all Asian cuisines and this is NOT a good example of it. When you've had some of the best vietnamese food, this is a big let down. 
Ordered: 
No. 20 Spicy Beef Sate with Basil - One dimensional flavour (taste like only curry powder and no other spices), soggy meat, could not taste/find any basil. 
No. 21 Garlic Beef with Stir-fried Bok Choy - soggy beef & bok chok, no flavour.
It's not worth the $10.50 that's for sure."}
{"text":"This review will be limited to respecting allergies. I have ordered take out 3 times from this place. Informing all 3 times I have shellfish allergy and particularly from fish sauce which contains shrimp shells. I was assured that they would remove the risk and omit fish sauce. Twice we received the food with sauce that contains fish sauce , that spilled on to the dish. This after we requested to have it removed even on the side. I can't comment on the food as I was unable to taste due to the shellfish allergy. Worse when confronted they only offered to make the dish again, but we would have come back to pick it up. I have no confidence that any of the food they prepared would respect an allergy."}
{"text":"when I saw a veggie pho on the menu at Hanoi 3 Seasons, I didn't have to think twice about what to order.   To start,  I had the vegetarian cold roll wrap, which was fresh and full of fresh herbs. Skip it if you are adverse to cilantro because it's full of it.  My husband ordered the spring rolls and was not impressed with their taro filling, which I quite like so I ate most of them.  Living in Leslieville I plan to return to this little spot, but if you're not from the area I don't know if it's worth making the trip.  Unless, of course you are looking for vegetarian pho, which seems almost impossible to find in Toronto."}
{"text":"If North Vietnamese Cooking is bland then Hanoi 3 Seasons has it down.
By far the most tasteless, boring, Vietnamese food I have eaten in Toronto. 
I will not be returning and would not recommend it."}
{"text":"so far this is the our place to go for better quality pho, otherwise we head to Pho 88 @ Bamburgh
nice small cozy atmosphere 
the candy that comes with the bill is yummy"}
{"text":"First up - cash only. I always forget (lucky for me the bf always has cash)
Second - best chicken pho in town. It's got all the flavours you want, lemongrass, salty, sour amazingess that dances across your tongue and down your gullet. One taste and you are back in your vietnamese grandma's kitchen getting love spooned into your mouth.
Now, I don't really have a vietnamese grandma, but if I did, she'd make me soup just like this."}
{"text":"Great spot. Get the flank and rare beef pho. The garlic bok choy is also amazing."}
{"text":"Very solid Vietnamese.  Lots of vegetarian options too.  The veggie fresh rolls were a modest start, nothing exciting but the spring rolls were great.  Beef with book choy was flavourful and the tofu with vegetables and lemongrass was yummy. A little bit on the dry side over the vermicelli.

The pho was excellent, a great vegetarian dish. All the portions were large and the prices reasonable. The server spoke great English too."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant (particularly the back patio on a summer eve) with friendly staff. The pho is not quite what I'm accustomed to from other Vietnamese restaurants nor my Vietnamese family kitchen...but still scratches the itch for a quick, tasty soup, when I don't feel like spending hours making it myself. The spring rolls aren't the best here but LOVE the lotus salad and the fried fish (grouper) with dill and vermicelli as well. My husband and I are regulars here!"}
{"text":"This is not to be mistaken for a review of the Gerrard St. location.  We go there all the time and are regulars there.  We know the servers by name there and we love it there.  We happened to stop in at this location while in the area with my 9-month old daughter.  The restaurant was practically empty, there were about two tables seated and it was early....about 6pm.  We asked for a high chair and they said they didn't have one... I got the message.  Kids are not welcome here.  The server was a bit flippant about the whole thing, didn't seem to care to be polite or apologetic...just kind of sending the vibe of \"your kind are not welcome here\".   Strange for a restaurant in such a family-friendly neighbourhood.  The restaurant is not fancy... not a kid-free type place."}
{"text":"It was a warm night in late spring and 5 of us wanted to find a nice patio to enjoy. Not being from Leslieville, we thought that it would be a nice change of scenery, so a quick look on Yelp resulted in this joint getting the nod.

It was nice to see a place that takes reservations for the patio, but it ended up being rather unnecessary at 8:30pm considering the lack of clientelle. The patio is small, seating only 16 or so, but it's in a nice garden enclave at the back of the store. Funny thing is that you have to pass right through the kitchen to get to it.

Two in our crew were late so we started off with some hot sake and Saigon beer coupled with spring rolls and crispy shrimp rolls. The quality was above average, but the bar selection was definitely weak. Gekkeikan was the only sake carried, whether served hot or cold, and the beer selection was small. This place could definitely do well with a more stocked bar.

Meal time wasn't challenging as most Asian restaurants tend to be. There are only a few dozen choices, not hundreds. Of course, Pho was on the menu, so I decided to try the well-done beef Pho while others tried a variety of chicken, shrimp, and beef dishes.

Overall, the level of satisfaction was middle of the road, with nothing spectacular to report. The Pho had a well spiced broth but rather bland noodles and subpar cuts of beef. I was expecting more from this dish and was let down.

The service by the pretty lady was great and the pricing was excellent for what we were given (the beers were $4, 2 spring rolls were $3, $25 / person including tax and tip in the end). A great night was had by all until the bugs began to have their dinner (us) after 10pm."}
{"text":"Basic atmosphere but very comfortable.  Quality food, good quantities and flavourful. Veg & meat options. Service is good and because the location is small if you need anything you can always easily find a waiter."}
{"text":"The meal was very nice and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was relaxed and the service was great. I will go back."}
{"text":"You will be surprised at the special. The Pho they have there is different and it tastes delicious"}
{"text":"A great tasting meal served by a very friendly host. Well worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Having newly move to the neighbourhood we were eager to try all the new eats. And there's lots to choose from. 

Unfortunately, having just finished takeout from there I can be sure there will be no future visit to the dining room.

I ordered the chicken with lemongrass and coconut milk (vermicelli), my wife the garlic beef with bok choy (rice) both with the $1 spring roll addition. The dishes were about the blandest Thai food I've ever eaten and the meat in both was overcooked and dry. Even the spring rolls were bland. And to top things off, both of us had the distinct texture of MSG tongue.

That said, I have to agree with other reviewers on one point; great decor. Perhaps they should sell nice Nothern Vietnamese furniture instead."}
{"text":"Go for the Hanoi style grouper, stay for the coffee.  I'm a big fan of Hanoi 3 Seasons and am happy it's in the neighbourhood.  Have taken friends here and everyone has enjoyed themselves.  Relaxed atmosphere, very good food.  My transatlantic boyfriend and I think of this as our number one place to go for an evening."}
{"text":"Pho fusion food, even though owner are Vietnamese there food are catered to white people. They hired two hipster waiters which I find kind of funny at a Pho place.  Nice patio for summer time but food is pretty mediocre to me. Quite expensive for Pho and limited food options"}
{"text":"In many ways this location of Hanoi 3 Seasons blends blandly in with the general pho landscape. Bare bones service. Small chipped tables that are serviceable but not especially comfortable. And all the character you would expect when someone throws a bunch of tables and a potted plant in a room and considers that decorating. 

Add to that, however, the mediocre, overpriced pho (one size only and that size costs $7.50) and the fact that while I was there they were playing Mariah Carey's 1993 album Music Box from start to finish, and you get yourself a solid two star rating. 

There's much better pho for less money within two minutes of here."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. For some reason the food is better at their gerrard street location."}
{"text":"Its local for us whenever we have the urg for Pho, but too lazy to trek to Gerrard and  Broadview.

The food here is very different from the Pho everyone is used to.
As another poster mentioned, dill is used quite liberally in their dishes.
I guess you either love it or hate it.

Aloof service every time we visited.
Always prompt but not overly attentive, and in some cases, we have to get them to get additional items like another drink or the bill.

Food has always been consistently delicious.
Special Pho is my go to, and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Came here last night and I thought everything was lovely.

The staff were some of the nicest, coolest servers ever, and there was a really nice relaxed yet fun vibe in the restaurant.

I had the chicken lemongrass with coconut milk (with vermicelli) and my bf had garlic chicken with rice. My dish wasn't bursting with flavour from the first few bites, but this was quickly sorted with some hot sauce, which really gave it a kick! I loved the vermicelli in particular, it was satisfying and kept me full but gave me no horrible stuffed bloated feeling. I tried some garlic chicken and it was delicious! 

The prices can't be beaten in the area. $10.50 for any main dish And the portions are really big!

A lovely experience overall."}
{"text":"The price let me be clear is on the high end of pho.  It's over $10 and for Pho seems a bit high for Pho standards.  With that being said, the broth and the condiments that comes with it is great quality.  I really enjoyed the Pho and the service was very very good.  Friendly and efficient.  I will go here again for sure."}
{"text":"Dear H3S,

The BF insisted that we eat Northern Vietnamese food tonight. As we passed up Angkor Restaurant, I cringed a little because I am Cambo and would have loved some Cambo food, but I trusted his tastebuds. There was no need to look at the menu because we came for the Hanoi style grouper. It was the most flavorful fish I have had in a long time! The dill made it extra tasty! And the crispiness of the fish along with the vermicelli and shrimp paste sauce made all the flavors come together.

Please don't ever change the recipe! It's stellar!

Love,
Dreamsrey"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. We love the food and what makes it even better is the service provided by Lucas.  Always helpful and gracious to all his guests.  Would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 or 6 times over the summer.  The back patio is great, and it really feels like being in S.E.Asia (which means not fancy, unmatched tables and chairs, but a serene vibe.   I didn't know bamboo could grow outdoors in Canada!).  Plus, you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it.

 The service is friendly and helpful, and they give advice/explanations on dishes. Lots of lemongrass, dill, and other spices in the dishes, and the place is aromatic and heavenly.   The smoothies are amazing... especially the avocado!

It's cash only, so be forewarned."}
{"text":"There are several locations but I like the one in Old Chinatown (Broadview and Gerrard), which has some neat guys serving. They have a variety of the standard Vietnamese dishes.  Coffee with condensed milk over ice for the warm days, Pho Tai (noodle soup with thinly sliced raw beef)  for the cold ones.

What makes this little Northern Vietnamese restaurant's so special is the signature dish, grouper vermicelli. I am not a big fish eater, typically I prefer to order meat dishes, but this fish is magical.  The  grouper is lightly dusted with flour, dill and curry (I think) and then fried so the edges are crispy.  This is served on a bed of vermicelli noodles, shredded lettuce, cilantro and peanuts.  You can add sauce or just eat it the way it is. I love this fish!  I have also tried the grouper as a soup and it is equally good.  Other standout dishes for me are the beef sate with basil and mint and calamari patties."}
{"text":"After Reading all of these reviews, I visited this Hanoi 3 Seasons locations to see what the buzz was about. I live *right* by the location on Queen, so I had not bothered to walk up to Gerrard, but last night we gave it a try. Hanoi 3 Seasons is what my Asian SO teasingly refers to as \"No Tea White Pho\" - and we knew this was the Siddhartha of East Chinatown before we arrived. 

I was SUPER disappointed. The staff seemed nice, and I feel bad, but the entire experience was pretty sub-par to tell the truth. They were full, but there were 5 staff on and the restaurant likely seats 20 at most. They should have been able to handle it. The crowd was mostly Caucasian, Some families, some college students a few couples. Only one Asian family.

Came in, sat down and ordered beverages. Avocado Milkshake for me, Beer for the SO. We give our food order at the same time. Beef with Rice for him, Pho Chay for me.  Within a few minutes our drinks arrive. 25 min later our drinks are done and no food. We are obviously restless and order some fresh spring rolls to tie us over.  10 min later one of the girls walks buy and drops the spring rolls on the table without dipping sauce. We are ravenous and pour Hoisin on the plate to dip in. At this point I swear the two women (who are looking right at me) are having a conversation about forgetting the sauce and decide just not to bring any. 

10 min after that (this has been a RIDICULOUSLY long wait for our food) our mains arrive. My soup is scalding hot, and my SO has a plate of cold, soggy beef and rice. I tell him to send it back but he is starving and its now almost 9pm. 

I eat my soup, and (the owner?) comes by noticing that we look agitated and asks if he can do anything. Tea perhaps? On the House? Sure. We would both love some tea. 10 min later I finish my soup, my SO pays the bill and no tea ever materializes. 

And to be honest the Pho Chay is kinda lacking. It definitely has a half portion of noodle. Ginger does it better and its around $4 something there. Broth with some tofu and a few floaters of broccoli should not be expensive., especially if tea isn't included. 

Anyways, its sad as I expected more.. and I was happy to have vegetarian Pho options, but this neighborhood has MUCH better options. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go. Good service and good food but they only accept cash. That's sad!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and delish!

Tonight, I had the chicken & bok choy with vermicelli noodles for $10.95 and added a spring roll for $1. The spring rolls are a must - crispy & not terribly greasy. The bok choy was perfectly cooked. They had run out of rice tonight (strange) but the noodles were a fine substitute. 

My boyfriend had the rare beef pho and commented that it was good but that the rare meat wasn't all that rare.

They have Saigon beers and they're only $4 a pop. Domestics are $3.

Apparently they are moving to a cash only payment system. They accepted our credit cards tonight because we didn't know (which we appreciated).

Sit on the back patio in the summertime."}
{"text":"The foods are so delicious. Like the patio seating. Surprised they serve morning glory vegetable."}
{"text":"Just moved to the East side, so coming from being Golden Turtle regulars, this is probably the most flavourful viet food we've had in the city. Great service as well, very fast and friendly. 

The menu isn't huge but there are options for everyone, including vegetarians. 

It may not be the most \"authentic\" In terms of the standard grey pho you can get around the city but in this case, I'd say that's a plus. Tons of fresh garnishes and seasoning, fresh noodles. The meat was juicy, not dry. 

We got the sate beef bun and spicy shrimp noodle soup. My bf added a spring roll to his bun which wasn't the best but the rest was great!"}
{"text":"I love northern Vietnamese food.....and there are not so many of them around. I love the bun cha ca here, it's so authentic..... 
The only cons here is the pho is little pricey compare to other pho restaurant. But definitely the place is nice and clean.... 
Would love to come back any time for the bun cha ca......"}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is fantastic.  The #10 (the fried grouper) is to die for and the menu, while small, is a venerable collection of the greatest hits in any Vietnamese establishment in Toronto.  The sautéed clams appetizer is a great starter.  The Saigon beer is a terrific pairing with the whole menu, but, if you want to drink beer don't sit in the back patio as the restaurant doesn't have a liquor license for it."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat. I usually order the Curried sate chicken and vermicelli bowl, and spring rolls and it is always delicious.

It is slightly more expensive than the Gerrard location and I find the portions to be a bit smaller, but that could just be me.

I alternate between the two locations and enjoy the food in both."}
{"text":"Cheap, healthy food. Hai, the owner is very pleasant and the servers are always great. Noodle and rice dishes and pho are great. A small patio is open in the summer. This is a must for all those that enjoy or have never tried Vietnamese. Most options can be done vegetarian with tofu as the protein. I've been told their \"fish\" sauce is vegetarian as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday 45 mins before their closing time (10pm) and we still felt very welcome by the staff. Service was great and the food came quick.

Spring rolls and calamari patties - basically squid balls, not bad as an app, nice chewy texture, not an excessive amount of flour used (which is a common mistake of a lot of squid balls I have seen) - $7.50 

House special noodles - Authentic and unique soup base, very impressive and just the first spoonful of the soup already got me, it is pure, light, and clear.  Noodles are also different from what you usually would get. Just loved it.

Mussels in ginger and lemon grass sauce - $11.50 we got 15 pieces of medium to big size mussels - very satisfied with the sauce which was a bit gingery, I just loved that heat.

Cozy and a bit hipster decor and I already can't wait to come back and try other items on menu."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here. You don't expect much and they always surprise you. It's certainly not the best of the best but it's good food for a solid price."}
{"text":"I've been coming back for the ginger chicken with vermicelli  for years. I really love it. I've pretty much tried everything on the menu and the good is great. Big portions.  Very relaxed atmosphere. Not pretentious at all. Lucas is very welcoming and hospitable."}
{"text":"They have a cute backyard patio - sunny for the tables in the middle but shaded for the tables along the perimeter of the backyard. It's super nice on a sunny day. 

There were 2 of us and we ordered the spring rolls to share. I think they are smaller than usual but very flavourful, I really enjoyed them. For the actual noodle soup we ordered the Hanoi 3 Seasons Special and the Well-done Beef. The Hanoi 3 Seasons Special comes with 3 types of beef and a different lemongrass broth. I actually wasn't a fan of the lemongrass broth. It also comes with some sort of chili oil because when it came, the broth looked really red but it actually wasn't too spicy. 

The well-done beef was very generic and similar to all the other pho places. Overall I enjoyed this place and would come back if I was in the area! Good pho all around."}
{"text":"FOOD - BLAND, TOUGH
SERVICE - EQUALLY BAD

It's been a long time since I saw the reviews for Hanoi 3 Seasons, but I moved out of the area so I never had a chance to try it. I was deciding between Hanoi 3 Seasons and Pho Mi Gia Phung. I saw a bunch of old ladies heading to 3 Seasons and that confirmed my decision. 

Today was the day I tried it. I'm not sure if I went too early (noon) or not but I ordered the 

Food Review 
#12 Bun Bo Hue
Soup - Bland, it tasted like those instant tom yum soup but heavily diluted with water
It was not rich, and the flavour wasn't there. I did not taste the sour,sweet or spicy compontent. 
Noodles - It was nicely cooked but with no soup base to follow up it was just al dente bland noodles
Meat - The Beef shank was extremely tough and dry and flavourless 

Service
The younger lady who was serving me did a poor job. She never re-visted or refilled my cup of water. She was too busy texting on her iphone to even notice. I even had to wait until the older lady told her to accept the bill. It was extremely frustrating. 

Maybe this restaurant's Bun Bo Hue is just bad, but paired with the terrible service I won't visit again. I'll just stick with the ossington resturants for Bun Bo Hue."}
{"text":"The pho is alright but definitely not the most tasty pho restaurants in the area. The pho broth tasted less beefy and I don't understand why there is only one size, have a L or XL i'll gladly pay the difference for a bigger bowl just to be full and not hungry 1 hour later.
Service is not that attentive, water refills are hard to come by unless you get their attention. 

Overall, I would choose another pho restaurant to go to, like Pho house, Pho XE Lua or Com Tam Dao Vien, which all three have different bowl sizes including XL."}
{"text":"There's a lot of pho places and so I find it hard to pick a favourite because so many broths are so good in their unique way.

Hanoi is a perfect example of a differentiated top performer.  Their soup was very pleasant and flavourful yet light and not too salty, and they use a more transparent noodle version which is different to the typical pho places.  It was a very pleasant light meal.  

Only thing is they come in 1 size only, so you can't pick an XL for the starving boys.

Also, I wasn't as impressed with the sides I ordered...when I go to a restaurant and order mussels i would be expecting fresh muscles, not those big one shell packaged mussels.  (even though I have to admit it was cooked in a nice way)

Service was very nice and quick (but maybe because there wasn't anyone else to serve lol..)

HOWEVER, I still have to give a 5 star, because I honestly really liked that pho.......good job Hanoi 3 Seasons!"}
{"text":"Has become one of my wife's and mines favorite local eatery's! Great service and friendly neighborhood atmosphere. We both love the Pho soups. My favorite is the Grouper. It is awesome and I always leave full."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff + super food = a great spot

Tonight was another awesome Yelp outing.  The company, as always, was outstanding.

I had the spring rolls, which were some of the best I have ever had.  They had a bit of a sweetness to them that was quite refreshing.

For my main, I had the grouper goodness.  Or as I like to call it, the \"groper\", kinda like Mr. Roaper from Three's Company, but a bit more fishy.

The dish was great.  Actually, it was a lot of food - I couldn't finish it all!  The seasoning, the perfectly fried fish - a wonderful combo.  

I had a sip of Kat's fruit shake, and it was like summer in a glass.  Super refreshing!

Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"we have tried the other Vietnamese nearby and this is the most tasteful around.
We had tried all items on the menu now and all were tasty and generous. Altogether, we come for the delicious Hanoi dill crispy fish (soup or noodles) and the grilled meat platters (chicken lemon grass is my favorite).

the staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is cosy. yes, they do not have everything Vietnamese but the few (pho and bun mainly) at excellent!"}
{"text":"#27 w/ vermicelli is divine! Staff is friendly and the wait isn't long at all."}
{"text":"We were in the area and we like to try new pho spots. This came up on Yelp and we decided to give it a try. We walked in at noon on a Sunday and it was empty. She brought us to the backyard patio where there was another couple seated but otherwise a quiet place to take in a bowl of noodles. 

The server came to us promptly and gave us waters and chopsticks. After a few moments she returns to take our order: spring rolls, 3 Seasons Hanoi special, and cooked beef pho. 

I judge a pho place by their spring rolls. It's the first impression you get because it's the appetizer that comes first. I've had better to say the least, they used shrimp and they were small spring rolls. Our pho came and my special had used lemon grass broth. It wasn't a big deal to me but it would have been nice to been aware of it because the next person might be expecting beef broth. Mine had cooked beef, rare beef, and beef balls. The cooked beef pho that my partner had was great though, a good standard bowl of pho. 

They accept credit card here and we were on our way. Decent spot with real Vietnamese people working the business. I'm never in the area so probably won't return."}
{"text":"Picture it: Hanoi 3 Seasons, 2010. Two people arrive within five minutes of each other; one tells the server he is waiting for a guest and sits outside, the other tells the server he is waiting for a guest and sits inside. After 20 minutes, both people feel as if they have been stood up, but it turns out they were mere steps away from each other. Somehow the server didn't put it all together. Somehow.

If any of you are confused by this Sofia from Golden Girls-style tale, this just happened to ME at Hanoi 3 Seasons tonight! I've been a server before and I feel like this is Sesame Street-level connecting the dots, but hey, I'm REALLY smart. It made me feel like the server was apathetic, and not really happy to be there. (I do recognize that is sweltering hot, blah, blah, blah.)

The food was--and always is--very nice, though. I usually order the #28 Thit Lon Nuong Seasoned Pork with Vermicelli and a Spring Roll. The ingredients seem very fresh--tons of cilantro! But the pork is really, really salty. I usually have to down several glasses of water when I get home. Lots of water.

Overall, Hanoi 3 Seasons is a great low-priced meal option in Leslieville; however, I don't think it's memorable food. I always think that I'm eating a tasty $10 meal, rather than just thinking it's amazing food. Know what I mean?"}
{"text":"Review on the Run:

It was more like running in molasses!

To be fair, we went as a medium sized group (UYE) on the same night another large group was there.  It took 45+ minutes for our food to arrive after a long time before our server even took our order. 

Upon someone's recommendation we all pretty much ordered the same thing.  By the time the food got there, I just couldn't enjoy it very much.  That's hard to excuse, but even more so, unfairly or not, because it's a Vietnamese restaurant where I expect my food to arrive almost before I even order it.  They should be able to read my mind.  I swear the Xue La across the street does.

The food we did get (the fried fish as per Neil T.'s recommendation), wasn't bad.   It was cooked well, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.

Conclusion: Eat Here?  I will give this place another try, but I won't be going out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Decent but had better. I think the expectations were set too high. 

The ingredients were fresh. Flavours were flatter than expected (broth seemed to be lacking layers). Fresh rolls were nice. Service pleasant. 

The bun bo hue was not what I was expecting to be. Not enough spicy, only raw beef slices. I think they just use normal pho soup then add a bit of chili  oil to make it look like it. The was a epic fail to me :(

Would go to Bach Yen on Gerrard before I came back here."}
{"text":"Awesome place!

Thanks to Neil for recommending as a few yelpers came out to H3S tonight for a light refreshing Vietnamese meal. Strangely enough we were all in agreement as to what we would order so we all had the house specialty the dill fried grouper. It was solid and hit the spot!

The dish involved pan fried chunks of dill spiced grouper atop a bed of vermicelli, carrots, cukes and cilantro. If you wanted to kick it up a notch, there was infamous shrimp paste (though this incarnation was more like a juice) and sweet fish sauce to douse your dish with. 

Decor isn't much and this place is small but it's definitely a must-try for Vietnamese food in Toronto. If not at least for the house special dish!"}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese  restaurant since they opened!...excellent food and friendly service is always guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food at prices that won't break the bank. Located on Gerrard Street East, just across the bridge from Cabbagetown, this eatery has traditional Vietnamese and South Asian fare, a warm environment, and waitresses who can help you pick the right plate for your tastes.  Although it's out there and far away from the hustle & bustle of Yonge Street, it's worth the trek to enjoy some of the best Vietnamese cuisine in all of Toronto."}
{"text":"Quick lunch with DW...  she had the pho special, I had the lemon grass lime chicken. We had the deep fried spring rolls which as another reviewer mentioned was veggie (taro) no meat. I prefer the meat spring rolls over this one (will skip next time).

The pho soup base was light and tasty. The lemon grass/lime chicken was juicy (not over cooked)...but didn't really taste the lemon grass. It still was tasty.

Definitely will come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I had the Hen, Pho and satay beef with bok choy and vermicelli.
It makes me want to go home and cook these dishes myself.  The service is great but I miss Hai's(owner) attentiveness at the queen street location.

There is definitely more flavor than most Viet restaurant but it is not over powering.  

I also recommend the leslieville location as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's great value, super friendly service and very fresh, flavourful food. This is small, casual, no frills restaurant - quality and service wise they are consistently on point. My fave pho in the city by far!"}
{"text":"I had the lemongrass chicken with coconut milk and I forget what hubby had but I remember it being like, meh. My dish was really oily and heavy and the flavours just weren't there. We went back because we forgot we had gone there a couple of years earlier and miraculously I ordered the same thing without realizing! (I guess the description of the dish got me both times). I only recognized the dish when I began to eat it, and didn't like it the second time either. I am hopeful in saying that maybe we (both) didn't order the right things? I honestly cannot comprehend why this place gets such good reviews."}

 The food tasted cheap and  greasy. The beef in my soup was like eating rubber. The broth was sickly. Overall it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant saved my sanity and grew my appreciation of Vietnamese food while spending 7 months in Toronto during the winter. I would eat my lunch and dinner here at some point many days in a row / eating my way through their entire menu. Finally I got set on their  Vermicelli house special. The meat is prepared with love and care, the veggies are fresh and tasty. Everything is served at its ideal temperature. What a treat!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect it from the facade but this restaurant knows their Vietnamese cuisine! Very decent pho and vermicelli plates. My favourite has to be the spicy baby clams with rice crackers. They have a great kick and are packed with flavour. The service is decent too. I usually get the male server who can speak and understand fluent English (I find this uncommon for little asian restaurants). Definitely worth a taster if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"North Vietnamese is a cuisine I haven't come across before and it's nice to find a restaurant that features Hanoi popular dishes for all those people that hasn't made that trip to Southeast Asia like myself.

We stepped inside to this Vietnamese themed decor with a mood lamp lighting ambiance.  It was unfortunate that there was quite a big group gathered here for their dinner and broke the sound barrier I couldn't hear myself think and just as a note it could have taken part in the meal prep as large group orders all at once are hard to handle and rush out unless reserved in advance.

Others already commented about the servers/owners, so I'll agreed with them as I had first hand experience of similar degree.  The basement washroom had a nice waiting space as well however there's a dish of LYCHEE of some sort that you shouldn't touch or else let their Fruit Flies swarm you.  2.5 *Stars*

#6 Hen(Sautéed Spicy Baby Clams served with Crispy Rice Crackers$7.00).  Crispy Rice Cracker was good to eat and strong Sesame flavour that is a nice change from Pita Breads and Nachos.  The Baby Clams however I have to say is not for my palette.  It might be authentic but something in my mind just didn't like this non-fresh Clams texture.

#10 Cha Ca(Hanoi-style Grouper with Dill & Shrimp Paste $12.00).  The Rice Vermicelli, Shredded Lettuce, Cilantro, etc are standard as any Bun dish you'll have at Pho places.  The Fried Grouper reminded me of Filet-o-Fish, I'm not against it but I imagined some Bread and Tartar Sauce as I ate.

#23 Ga Nuong Xa Sua Dua(Chicken with Lemon Grass & Coconut Milk $10.50).  I believe the Chicken would have been better if grilled but if I'm correct, they fried it instead as I taste that slight Lemon Grass flavour but couldn't find the Coconut Milk.  

The Oil from the Chicken was soaked into the Rice Vermicelli below and it was excessive almost like an Olive Oil tasting.  I'm one that don't mind excessive Oil, but at least it has to have some flavour or be the healthy variety."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Northern Vietnamese cuisine.  It isn't your typical pho joint that's for sure.  This cute, dare I say 'classy' Leslieville location serves a much different clientele than the Gerrard and Broadview location.  This is more of a dinner atmosphere.  

+++PROS+++
1. Authentic Northern Vietnamese food, much different than the regular pho fare.
2. The one female Vietnamese server (don't know her name) is absolutely gorgeous.  I love.  She's a good server too!
3. The owner (Hai) stays true to his vision of the restaurant, which I dig.
4. Cha ca -- just get it.  Ask for the purple stuff.  This is the only place I've been to in Toronto that serves this dish.  It is a lightly fried grouper with dill.  Simple, fresh, and perfect.
5. Ample seating, better for larger groups.
6. Take credit cards.
7. Street parking is free after 6pm.

---CONS---
1. Another server is pretty much terrible (white male).  He once poured fish sauce all over my hands and table and didn't even bother to get me napkins, or to clean it up.
2. A little expensive.  Don't quote me on this, but I think the dishes are slightly more expensive than the Gerrard location.
3. Though the Gerrard location is much smaller, I find it more charming and authentic than this location.  I prefer the other location.  It feels like I'm eating at a dive in Hanoi.
4. A bit of inconsistency in the 'purple' sauce they serve.  This is best served as potent as possible!  They may dumb it down for those not in the know.

Overall, I love this place.  If given the choice though, I'd go to the other location."}
{"text":"This is perhaps Toronto's only northern Vietnamese cuisine restaurant (with another location in Leslieville opening later this summer).  The food is different than other run-oft-the-mill Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto, which predominately serve more southern style cuisine.

I believe this is the only place in Toronto where you can get \"cha ca\", the famous fried fish seasoned with butter and dill atop a generous portion of vermicelli noodles.  This is the signature dish.  Locals will eat it with the \"purple stuff\", which is fermented shrimp paste that smells absolutely rancid, but tastes surprisingly delicious.  American GI's used to call it \"Vietnamese tear gas\".

For pho lovers - I find the broth a little less flavorful than the southern style, but it is excellent regardless.

Service is very prompt and the staff is knowledgeable, much better than you would get at most other Vietnamese restaurants in the city.  The chefs can often cater to the taste of each person, be it adding more dill to requesting a certain Vietnamese dish that isn't on the menu.

Prices are about $1 more per dish compared to the regular Viet joints, but it is easily worth the extra money -- about $8-15 per person.  Oh yeah, they take credit cards!!!"}
{"text":"Well I finally had the \"cha ca\", a great North Vietnamese fish dish. It is a nicely fried grouper, in a succulent dill seasoned batter. It is served as either a \"Pho\", or without the broth. The consensus amongst the diners was that we would all try it as a dish, not a \"Pho\". Neil who had spearhead this Yelp outing suggested that it might be better to not get the fish soggy with all that liquid.

This is a unique, stand-alone, one of kind dish. It appears a simple preparation, but it is loaded with many levels of flavour. The other ingredients of the dish are simply the non-liquid parts of a good \"Pho\". But the fish............no wonder this dish has acquired such a reputation and following...It is truly unique. And when you complement the whole thing with \"purple sauce\" it is delicious.

I also tasted, for the first time, a Vietnamese beer and it was delicious. The restaurant is small, homey and the service is pleasant. It is a nice casual place, not fancy, but it does deserve a stop. The conversation and company made the whole experience just that much better. 

A great place to break bread, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! So glad Hans and Neil T convinced me to come here! Not that it took much dragging since I was starving and all I'd eaten was one of Kat's lemon bars (which were good!).

The staff here is seriously nice. I think we got special service as Neil and Mai were with us, but I still think they'd be nice. In fact, we were the last ones there, after 10 and they were trying to close and they were still so nice and patient. Hans wouldn't leave though, he just kept chatting away.

I loved loved loved the hen. I could devour a plate on my own easily. So good.

We all got the cha ca too, on Neil's reco, and again, so glad! It was good. They didn't give us the super-authentic purple sauce to dip the fish in, but I still loved it.

In a way, I am glad there wasn't enough food at the Elite event, because this way I got to have a delicious dinner at Hanoi 3 Seasons, at a very reasonable cost. Way to look on the bright side!"}
{"text":"very average in my opinion. I ordered the fried grouper with dill, which I was told is amazing but I was somewhat disappointed. nothing special about the pho here or any other dish we had. I believe the portions were small compared to other similar restaurants and a bit more pricey."}
{"text":"I'll never dine there again. For one, they have no high chairs or booster seats for kids. I find any restaurant that doesn't have this offensive and insulting to parents. It's like \"we don't want your kids here\". Stayed because I was starving. I was coming back from a doctors appointment for my toddler and I was craving Pho and this was the closest location I found through google. The soup is absolutely nothing to brag about. It wasn't rich in flavor. The fried banana and ice cream was $15.00 . BOTTOM LINE:over priced for the quality and service. I can honestly say. I've had much better."}
{"text":"In search of a good Vietnamese restaurant among the many along Gerrard and Broadview, this was one of the first ones I saw. Perhaps my last trip, I might add.

The restaurant was small with approx. 15 small tables at most. Service was friendly and since there weren't too many peole during lunch, food came out fairly quick. 

Here comes the disappointment. As mentioned, there is only 1 size for pho for $7.50. It was small-medium at best. If you think that perhaps the overpriced pho would be offset by something outstanding, you'll be walking away disappointed. The broth was standard and the noodles were soft and thin (small qty as well). Overall, a sub-par experience.

My search continues..."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Delicious food for great price!!
I always get the Spicy Shrimp with Lemon Grass and make sure to include Spring Rolls. Their spring rolls are delicious.
And to rinse it down with Vietnamese Coffee.
Family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"We were at the MadMen themed Elite event at the Curzon and when it came up light on the eats we just couldn't go without sustenance any longer so we hit up Queen Street.  My well intentioned plan of scarfing back a burger from Dangerous Dan's to add to my Decemb urger list got completely waylaid.  I found myself teetering along Queen St. in my high heels with Melinda M. to join up with a couple of other Yelpers at Hanoi 3 Seasons. 

The Hanoi Three Seasons came highly recommended by Neil \"say cheese\" Ta and his guest Mai. Joining in the dining goodness was Dave \"Where's the 5th star\" O. and Hans \"I've got all my Yelp reviews written in my head\" B.  I'm not all that familiar with Vietnamese food so I basically sat back and took direction from Neil and Mai, both very familiar with this cuisine.   Smart move on our part.  

We started out with a couple of shared plates, some spring rolls which were hot, crispy and tasty. Along with that we had something called Hen, no this is not a chicken dish but rather it is shredded clams in some spicy sauce that you scooped up with these super cool rice & black sesame seed crackers. This was really delicious and I could have probably just made a meal out of that alone. 

For mains we all heeded the sage advice of Neil & Mai and went with the Cha Ca which is basically pieces of fish, lightly breaded (not battered or panko'ed) atop a bed of vermicelli noodles and cilantro. There was some fish dipping sauce which was quite strong in flavour. I passed on the fish sauce and used the other dipping sauce they provided. The fish was moist and flaky with no fishy taste at all. I loved this dish!!!! I'm definitely putting Hanoi Three Seasons on a must return to try new things list. 

Afterwards I teetered back along Queen St.atop those heels for our last call libation at the Curzon with the last of the Yelper's who were still controlling the playlist on the iPod.  :)  

Great meal.  Thanks Neil for the lead."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant on Queen. This is the second restaurant following in the footsteps of their original Gerrard location. The food if consistently good and the service is always good. Try a milkshake and either the pho or vermicelli is great. I wish the seats were a little easier on the backside!"}
{"text":"Allowing employees to smoke at the back door, big complaint...
Restaurant stinks of cigarette smoke, 2018, got more than a few of us who don't want that in a closed restaurant.
Rare beef pho was very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here this evening.  

The Hanoi Special Pho was great, and we also had the seasoned pork.  Nothing to complain about.  I really like the decor, and for a few more bucks than a china-town style pho place, it was definitely worth the visit.

It's November, so no patio action this time round, but come summer, I'll be here for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The #13 special pho is my fave.  
I've had it at both locations.  I think I prefer this location for take out, the one on Queen E has a better vibe for sit down dining.

I grabbed take out on this visit.
My bf ordered a chicken and noodle dish, that was also yummy."}
{"text":"ive been to the one on gerrard street (they just opened up a new one on queen thats much nicer looking than the this one).  this one fine enough decor wise with simple black tables and virtually no vibe.  if there is any vibe, it comes from the staff and the food (which, for most asian restaurants is the standard by which you judge i believe - except actually i would just pare that down to the food, not the staff otherwise...well i think we all know.)  strangely, this was the first time i have ever been to an asian restaurant where there was a white server.  (peculiar informational tidbit is all.).  he was very cordial, pleasant and inviting.  one of the other servers, who was asian was actually quite a ham and made the entire eating experience very pleasurable, not even considering the food.

so the food, in my estimation was great.  we shared some veggie spring rolls which were awesome and i had a clam dish which i enjoyed, but the most memorable was a pho house special with three kinds of beef - rare beef, well done beef and beef balls.  i found the broth quite flavourful, the meat tender and tasty and the accompanying sauces great to combine with the dishes.

i hear good things about their signature fish dish which i will try when i return."}
{"text":"Me and the GF went here and had a great time! very cozy little joint...the ambience was very comfortable. had garlic chicken and boc choy and the girl had pho. also some sprouts which were very refreshing. we had a couple of saigon beers (4.5 bucks a piece...very moderate)
but I noticed the house wine they had was not bad qaulity. Usually asian restaurants have swill for house wine.

the quality of the food was very high...everything very fresh and well cooked. the prices were very very fair. The highlight was the server...Tom. Very pleasant young fella with a really good attitude. We'll be coming back"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat Pho in Toronto, hands down. All the plates are great and proved to be consistent all through my regular visits over the last 2 years. Good service, patio, beer, take out, nice decor and free parking available if you know the area. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Hanoi 3 Seasons. Nothing special about the ambiance, and it really is a tiny location BUT the deliciousness of the food makes up for it several times over :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I wandered down to this area because we wanted to try a banh mi @ Rose's, which was mysteriously CLOSED. Anyway, pissed off but hungry none the less, we instead took ourselves, and our money, to Hanoi 3 Seasons. It's small but clean. Friendly, quick service. I had the Vegatarian Pho and it was BRILLIANT!!!! Absolutely delicious and they give you TONS!!! I had so much left over! I am having the rest for lunch today and it may just be too much! I know other posters have complained about the price, saying it's too high. Seeing as this was my first time ordering Pho, I have no frame of reference but I got two big meals out of it so cost-wise, that's pretty good.

My only gripe? Thankfully the weather was not TOO hot as it was rather \"close\" in there. I would hope that comes a hotter, make that HUMID day, they have air conditioning.

Next week, we will go back as we want to try Rose's (and hope that they're open this time) but I would go here again and recommend."}
{"text":"A very nice Vietnamese spot on the east end. Lots of diverse flavours and pricing isn't crazy.

Yes yes another Pho review. For me right now it has the right amount of protein and volume of food to keep me full. I found this place on yelp and wanted to see. Nice atmosphere. Quaint with a clear view through the restaurant. They have a back patio though didn't get to see it since it's winter time. Lots of street parking on nearby streets as well.

The food is just right. House special with rich and fresh flavours that don't linger in a bad way. Fresh basil, sprouts and chillies as always with a broth that is done the right way. Nice find and glad into have a quick lunch here.

Friendly staff and decent decor would have me book marking this as a spot I can come back again if people ask me \"what's around here?\"

Solid 4.0"}

{"text":"REALLY DISAPPOINTING. 

We ordered fried tofu, vegetarian spring rolls, vegetarian summer rolls and ginger tofu and bok choy on vermicelli.

Everything was mediocre but the vermicelli was overwhelmingly gingery. The best part of the meal was the peanut sauce.

Totally understaffed, really cramped and far too warm in there. Door was open and no A/C as far as I could tell. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Have been to each location, both were amazing although the Leslieville location has a nicer atmosphere. Fantastic food, will come again!"}
{"text":"The restaurant definitely looked very promising with intimidate settings and was cleaner than most Chinatown spots. The pork spring rolls (special) was great while the pho definitely disappointed. The noodles were not fresh or chewy, the broth bland, and the beef balls was not homemade. However, the beef slices and beef brisket tasted very fresh and high quality. I might go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Just finished pho at H3.  I had the rare beef with brisket, my gf had the veg pho.  Here's how it went down:

Beef and brisket a solid 4 stars.
- beef was plentiful
- brisket was thicker and delicious
- broth was tasty

Veg pho - 3 stars
- they had tomato in the broth which over powered everything 
- lots of veg though.

We will come back"}
{"text":"What is so good about this place and why isn't it out of business yet?  I went here for some pho, the service was good, and it's really cool that they serve tea in Ikea mugs, rather than the little cups that you keep on having to refill but... I'm still asking myself the question \"why isn't this place out of business yet?\"

The pho was $7.50 and it came in one size, the equivalent of the small in most places.  The broth was good, but very different.  Instead of a beefy broth with lots of flavour, it was actually a nice balance of beef and lime - which was a little different because I'm used to putting in the lime myself.  Another thing that was different about this pho place was that the server was white... weird, but not unpleasant.  

The pho noodles were just terrible... they were just breaking apart and that made it difficult to pick up with chopsticks - this is unforgivable, I've never seen any other pho place make this amateur mistake.  They also took longer than 10 minutes to bring the pho out.  That makes me question why anyone would pay the extra money to eat here.  For $7.50, I can go across the street and get a pho bowl large enough for my family and I to bathe in, or a small pho and an avocado shake.

Are people being sucked in by the decor or ambiance?  I mean... I can tell that they are trying with all those framed pictures spammed across the wall and with the little tealight candles - also from Ikea btw, but it's not doing it for me."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food! Nothing like 99%of Vietnamese food you get in town. Yes it doesn't serve you the food with flavours that you're so used to, but you can taste the ingredients they put in each dish without overwhelming added flavours.
We had baby clans&crispy crackers , fish noodle soup, which are unique and tasty. Will go back to try other items."}
{"text":"Great Pho place in Toronto! I can never finish my soup and always leave happy! Beef balls and lemongrass Pho's are always a good go to! Back Patio in summer is a great day spot too!"}
{"text":"This second location by the same owner (original on Gerrard that I've also been to) is lovely. A friend of mine who used to live in Toronto but now lives in Calgary always unites a group of us at Hanoi whenever she's in town. 

My first (and honestly) only experience with North Vietnamese food is with Hanoi and it has been wonderful every time I've been there. My personal favourite is a #10 and most people at the table order it - a delicious dish served your choice as a soup or with vermicelli (I choose vermicelli) is a healthy serving of noodles, lightly coated and cooked white fish with carrots, cilantro, and I'm not sure what kind of sauce but it's delicious!! 

Others have ordered the spicy chicken version of this dish and there are many variations, I've never seen anyone disappointed. We usually start with a couple of orders of the clam appetizer - also delicious served with rice cakes for getting a good spoonful. 

The wine is fine and a couple of eclectic beers are on the menu. The service is always pleasant and efficient. And the price is unbelievably low - 9 of us had drinks, apps, dinner all for under $300 - including tax and 20% tip - about $35 per person. Amazing.

And the owner always remembers us and sometimes gives us a delicious complimentary dessert plate of green tea/white bean/ginger ice cream, fried bananas that is mouth wateringly tasty. 

Decor is simple - there's no pomp and circumstance here - just nice people serving great food for great prices. Perfect for a group, a casual date or reuniting with great friends."}
{"text":"Delicious pho, with a generous portion of meat and a tasty broth that isn't too salty. My companion had a very appetizing spicy shrimp dish with coconut milk sauce. The servers were all very friendly. No complaints really: a solid choice for Vietnamese if you find yourself in the Gerrard/Broadview area."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Hanoi 3 Seasons for the first time and I'll definitely be back. The food was wonderfully flavourful and delicious; the staff was friendly and helpful; and the price and portion size were both good.

The menu is just the right size; plenty of choices, but you won't be overwhelmed. Our picks for lunch:

To Start -
Fresh Shrimp Rolls ($3): Meh. Nothing to rave about here, decent but pretty standard. The only thing we had that wasn't amazing.

Steamed Mussels ($8): Awesome! The best thing we tried. A least a dozen large mussels with onion and green onion in an amazingly flavourful and fragrant broth of ginger, lemon grass, and lime leaves. I'm not ashamed to admit that I drank the broth once the mussels were gone.

Main - 
Spicy Shrimp with Lemon Grass ($8.50): Excellent. I wouldn't classify these shrimps as even remotely spicy but they were excellently flavoured regardless. These guys aren't stingy on the shrimp either, you get a good number of large shrimp. Served on vermicelli noodles.

Chicken with Lemon Grass and Coconut Milk($8.50): Another winner. While excellent, I didn't like this quite as much as the shrimp. The chicken was super tender and moist.

Drinks - 
Avocado Smoothie ($3): Interesting. My friend order this and it turned out to be much better than I expected. I don't think I'd order it myself though.

Mango Smoothie ($3): Good. Not too sweet and the mango flavour is more subtle than what I'm used to in a mango lassi for example.

I can see myself coming back here often and I'm particularly interested in giving their vegetarian options a try."}
{"text":"Hanoi gets 5 stars because they are easily my top choice for Pho. The ambience is laid back and informal. The service is genuine and professional, the value is excellent, and the food comes quick and is always delicious. When I lived in the area, I would come a couple times a month to order Pho or the Ginger Chicken. Looking forward to my next visit to Hanoi 3 Seasons!"}
{"text":"Hanoi 3 Seasons is a solid Vietnamese place. The soup broth is tasty and the meat is always well prepared. The Spring Rolls are pretty decent (nothing mind-blowing) and the ingredients are pretty fresh. The service is ok and the prices are reasonable.

I can't really find anything to complain or rave about. It'll hit the spot and not break the bank!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a small place near the corner of Gerard and Broadview so easy to get there on TTC. We wondered in without knowing restaurants in the area and we were pleasantly surprised. The menu has some good choices even for vegetarians. The pho we ordered was excellent as were the spring rolls. Service was friendly and fast. Prices were very reasonable considering the food quality. This place seems very popular with local residents."}
{"text":"I have been searching high and low for a good Northern Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto as there aren't many in the city.  I was super excited to try Hanoi 3 seasons but it didn't do it for me.  I had much better in Vancouver. 

We ordered the spring rolls which only comes in vegetarian, I was kinda hoping for a traditional meat spring roll but the taro wasn't so bad.  The shrimp with lotus shoot salad was delish, very refreshing.  As for my  main, I was particularly eager to dig into the grouper with dill noodle soup but the taste fell flat for me.  The fish (grouper) was deep fried and the broth wasn't as flavourful as I expected to be. There wasn't any distinct flavours of lemongrass or tamarind. They are very very generous with the amount of fish and noodle though.  The prices here are just slightly above your traditional Vietnamese restaurants but it's compensated by the generous portions and a very nice dinning space/decor. 

My only complaint is the Vietnamese coffee.  I ordered a coffee to go at the cash register and to my surprise, it was instant coffee as oppose to the authentic drip coffee that I'm used to. To make matter even worst, after she poured in the water, she put the cup into the microwave!  Did I just paid $5 for instant coffee? I think so. #IThinkIJustGotRippedOff"}
{"text":"For some reason they like dill in this restaurant.  As in, every dish we ordered was seasoned with a generous amount of dill.  Which is not what I expected from a Vietnamese restaurant.  But then, maybe it's a Hanoi thing - I don't know my regional Vietnamese cuisines too well.

Anyways, the dill was a bit much, and kind of overpowered what would have otherwise been pretty good food.

Our waiter seemed to be in a contest with the menu to see which one was brighter.  The menu was winning - he didn't seem to understand the question \"do the smoothies contain yogurt?\" (I don't know if they do - we decided not to find out).

And to make the evening more enjoyable, the people sitting beside us seemed to be unable to construct a sentence without loudly using the f-word.

Maybe our experience was bad luck.  Maybe they have some dill-free food.  Don't think I'm going to bother to find out though."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place forever because my friend served some of their spring rolls a while back at a baby shower and they were great.  It also looks really cute from the outside, and I have heard that they have an excellent back patio though I've missed out yet again on it considering it's now October.

If you start off your meal telling the server that you're allergic to MSG and spend a bit of time talking together about ordering dishes that do not have MSG, you'd think you're in the clear, am I wrong?  Well I was wrong.  Let's just say that my face is still on fire as I write this review and my stomach?  Well, let's leave that one alone.

I started with the cold shrimp spring rolls.  They were fresh tasting though not mind blowing.  For my main, I ordered the curried sate chicken on vermicelli.  I didn't find the chicken very flavorful and I had one bite that was full of really nasty gristle. There also seemed to be a plethora of lemon basil in the dish which was kind of bitter and jarring.  I would really prefer if they stuck to Thai basil.  I think the MSG problem must be attributed to the sauce but I could be wrong.

The best thing about this meal was the server.  Even though he didn't help me avoid food that would cause me to feel like crap, he was really sweet."}
{"text":"New discovery in my area. Good portion size, authentic. Must try their house specialty - fish dill and shrimp paste vermicelli noodles. Very appetizing! 
Tasty rolls too. Must come back for more..."}
{"text":"Thank you Tony F for reminding me to review this shite hole.

I know a dirty little secret about Hanoi 3 Seasons - they named it after the average wait time for a customer to receive their food.

That's right. Go here, wait approx. THREE SEASONS and then your food will arrive to the table. 

When the food finally did arrive it was only OK. Yeah sure, this place seems to be the only place that serves the grouper dish in Toronto. But maybe that is because none of the other vietnamese places think it's even worth the bother of having on the menu. I found it a bit bland. Nothing special."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot.  While the Yelp crew that I dined with on this evening all consumed the grouper I (along with Christine C.) opted for the lemon grass chicken.

Aside from the mountain of cilantro I had to shove off my plate the dish was excellent.  I found the spring rolls appetizer to be quite bland though the spring rolls were two to three times larger than most vietnamese places I've been.

Our server was quite friendly having a few laughs with the group, but didn't intrude like he was trying to befriend us for a larger tip."}
{"text":"ive gotten take out here on two occasions, sampling the clams dish (spicy, delicious, inventive, really great) the spring rolls (better then average, great pnut sauce) and the spicy pork + vermicelli dish (wow is that ever good!)) im very happy with the food, the service, and the price, this is not something i would eat daily but very good vietnamese food. there are better pho places down the street, this place specializes in curry, bun, etc."}
{"text":"I am not Northern Vietnamese Food Expert.. my usual experience is Pho and Bun, so I was really excited to try out some authentic Northern Vietnamese food at Hanoi 3 Seasons... But after eating here I am confused and a little disappointed.

The good:
The restaurant is really nicely decorated and have a Spa like feel to it and I love that!
The owner is really nice and sincere when he takes out order and give us recommendation and I always love good services!
Good, Clean washrooms, I really like that.. hardly any vietnamese places I been to have washrooms that clean!

The bad:
The food here is just to greasy. Everything are deep fried.. Even the Lemongrass Chicken with Coconut Milk are deep fried until the chicken are so dried out! The Cha Ca tasted ok but did not Wow me. The Fish sauce they served here is really weak, taste more like coloured water.

Since the restaurant was full with a big group of 30 people ordering the same time, the kitchen might be stressed out and thus affect the quality of food?

I might give the other Hanoi 3 Seasons a try but for sure I am not coming back to Queen Street location anytime soon.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I had the spicy seafood pho and my partner had the rare beef pho. They were both really good! Light, flavourful, and a perfect summertime dinner. That being said, there's only one size so it might not be very filling for a hungrier person (but we were both alright). The service was also really good as well. The waiter was really caring and respectful. Also, get a glass of wine. The glasses are basically overflowing."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pho, you can really taste layers of flavour, and they don't mind doing substitutions. The mussels are probably my favorite, such rich broth."}
{"text":"I love typical Pho but Hanoi 3 Seasons offers so much more. 
My favorite dish is the Grouper with vermicelli. My second favorite is the Buddhist Treat which really reminds me of a Korean Chapchae. 
The garden has super tall bamboo and the inside is quaint. I feel like the Queen East strip needs more restaurants in this price range."}
{"text":"This is some of my favorite food in the city. Don't be put off by the ambiance - the food is spectacular. This beats heavy hitters like Golden Turtle hands down.

Protip: The Queen location has better ambiance, but the Gerrard location has consistently tastier food.

Prices are low, particularly for drinks - wine is filled to the top of the glass and it's only five bucks, bottles of domestic beer are THREE bucks!.

Start with the mussels. They are huge and so tasty (save the broth!) and enough for 2-3 to share.

As for mains, I recommend any of the vermicelli dishes. I don't eat meat, but you can substitute any meat with perfectly done tofu and a spring roll.

The pho is great too, but I'm less of a fan, so see other reviews for expert opinions."}

Be warned they are no longer taking credit cards...so bring some cash.

Service with a smile!"}
