{"text":"This little place is great. Our waitress was amazing. Cant wait to go back and get some more pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered three to four times now and each time has been great.  Plus, the owner or manager that's usually there seems like a great guy.  It's nice supporting a local business operated by decent people.  Farinacci took second place in the PD \"pizza playoffs\" last year.  While it's hard to rank the many great shops around NEO, I certainly can't find any fault with this 2nd place finish.  Cash only though."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. And great old school feel. All fresh ingredients. Best salad dressing in Ohio. Any one that hates go eat at donalds"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to find a great, secret pizza joint that most of the world hadn't heard of.  It's definitely secret, located north of First and Main in what looks like a warehouse, and they're open 4:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  We dined in in the smaller dining area, and service was *very* friendly, helpful, and fast.  We ordered one thin crust family-sized with pepperoni and one thin crust  large with sausage and fried peppers.  Skip the salad - for $3.25 I got a small bowl of iceberg, half a tomato slice, one cucumber slice, and two black olives.  The pizzas were good, though the outer crust on both were slightly overbaked.  The fried peppers were a mixture of what seemed like sauteed red peppers, green peppers, and onions - I'm not sure what makes them \"fried,\" but they were great.  I wish I'd skipped the sausage (which was probably hand-formed into disks and was a little tough) and just had a pizza full of fried peppers, although that mixture seemed to make the bottom crust very soggy.  Their menu is extremely limited, so if you're looking for jojos and wings, you will be disappointed, although they do serve beer and wine.  Good 70s and 80s music played in the background, and they have a decent sized banquet room."}
{"text":"I can't give five stars to any pizza in Ohio, but this is the best you can get in Hudson, in my opinion. Yes the decor is hokey, but the pies are quality with good ingredients and a nice crust.  This girl who lived on Long Island gives it a solid four stars."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas and 2 salads yesterday since my parents were coming over.  Pizza was very high quality and tasted great.  All in all 2 pizzas and 2 salads fed 4 people with just a little to spare.  I'd recommend Farinacci to anyone locally!  Only downside is no delivery, but you sacrifice certain things for quality.  Parking is along the street and they share with the entire strip mall, but you can drive a little short or long and find a lot behind the building."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite pizza.  About as good as you can get in Ohio!   We have been going to the original location in Northfield for years and were so pleased when this location opened in Cuyahoga Falls.  The Fiesta salad is wonderful.  The salad is definitely big enough to share and when combined with the Family sized pizza makes for a great meal."}
{"text":"Another place that fails to live up to its hype........ Maybe a trip in the WayBack Machine would help one understand all the hub-bub about this \"local legend\". I was left wondering if they bought their pizzas at Giant Eagle in the frozen section."}
{"text":"This is the pizza of the Gods. I have grown up eating Farinacci's, and can't find a pizza that compares. By far my favorite crust, I don't know how they do it. You can't go wrong with a half sausage, half pepperoni pizza.   But don't forget a fiesta salad, just make sure you're a cheese lover as it's topped with a cheese mountain. The only thing I would change is to take off the cold-cut ham. Not my favorite.  Only downside is they don't accept cards. Additionally, the decor could use an update (it could have stood an update in the 90's!). But that really adds to the charm I guess, don't let it scare you off.  Top notch!"}
{"text":"The best!!!  We used to go to the Northfield Farinacci's but the first time we went to Hudson was on a Monday because Northfield is closed on Monday. Now we go to Hudson anytime we get a chance.  We have been there many times since they opened and the pizza just keeps getting better.  We get 2 small pizzas (Husband likes anchovies and I won't let them near my pizza).  That 1st bite with the gooey cheese is like heaven.  Everyone is so nice it is a pleasure to make the trip."}
{"text":"I had a great pizza at Farinacci's Northfield - however the interior of the sit-down restaurant is rather revolting. Actually - the place is a total gut job! I drove across town to try them out, and they deliver a GREAT product. It is really too bad it comes in a totally decrepit, old package. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza around the south side.....a throw back to the way pizza parlors used to be in the good ole days.  If you don't like that, get it to go!"}
{"text":"Farinacci Pizza is a very good pizza place, with a new, second location in Hudson's First and Main. It is located in the back of the Actors Summit building facing the library. From the outside it looks like you're walking into a warehouse. Inside, there is an open kitchen with a counter for carry out and a small dining area with about 10 tables. I did carry out when I tried Farinacci's. The dining area looks like it's lacking atmosphere. The pizza selection is somewhat limited, you won't find any specialty gourmet pizzas here, much to my discern. You can get single or double ingredient pizzas, as well as a deluxe pizza with almost everything on it. I ordered a pizza with sausage and pepperoni, as well as a house salad. The sauce was wonderful. They really know how to make a pizza there. It was an excellent pizza. The sausage and pepperoni were perfect together, both being somewhat spicy, which perfectly complemented the tomato sauce. The crust wasn't half bad either. The salad was good, but nothing special. The dressing was very good, but it was just lettuce with a few tomatoes and a couple of other scant veggies. Overall, Farinacci is a very good pizza place that provides competition to the many pizza places in Hudson (believe me, there are too many). But carry-out, as the restaurant itself lacks atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan and dine in once a week. The pizza is great and the service is awesome. I love mom and pop restaurants and the wonderful family feel."}
{"text":"Guess gotta try fish. Pizza soggy, sausage awesome. Wish could buy seperately! Hand made, but pizza just soggy! Would've given 1* for pizza, but not tried fish, so..."}
{"text":"I can tell you that I was very disappointed in this Branch of Farinacci. I have been a loyal customer of the Northfield one for many many years, and when this one opened it was just a great at that one. but things changed about a year ago. WHen I ordered there I got, undercooked pizza, not just once but many times. Twice I ordered there and got the wrong pizza. had to wait for a new one to be made. This pizza place is NOT what it used to be! I will travel out of my way, to the northfield one, or maybe give the NEW one in Cuyahoga Falls a try before I ever go back to Hudsons."}
{"text":"We get farinacci pizza about once a week, that's how good it is. Not only is the pizza consistently delicious every time, the owner Dave and staff are so friendly and personable. It really is a great neighborhood restaurant with a friendly local atmosphere. We have tried other pizza places around the area and keep coming back to farinacci because they have yet to top farinacci's pizza."}
{"text":"I held a baby shower here in their back room on a Saturday afternoon.  Pizza is great!! I ordered pizza, Italian sandwiches and garlic bread to feed the crowd.  Everyone loved it and I was able to order more pizza as we needed during the party.  The owner, Dave, and his wife were great, keeping the drinks and food coming plus setting up the room.  They couldn't have been nicer.  This is our go to place for pizza...so tasty and a relaxed atmosphere. Love it."}
{"text":"Whoever posted that this pizza is mediocre is ridiculous!  Yes, the sit-down portion of the place isn't luxurious and the cash only policy and opening at 4 makes you jump through hoops, but, in the end, it's all about the pizza and it's great here.  Not the single greatest I've ever had, but up there!  Great sauce, crust, sausage!   Everyone loves it in my family!"}
{"text":"Really good old fashioned pizza. Cash only.  Reminds me of how pizza was back in the day."}
{"text":"Best Pizza you will ever have.........Huge Farinacci Pizza fan and I have been too them both."}
{"text":"If you have not tried this yet you have to at least once in your lifetime.  Honestly I am not sure what it is but the food is amazing from Salads to Pizza to Subs........  One of those places that should be on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.    Only thing they do not do is deliver, but if they did I don't think they could handle all the business.  Its always packed when you go in there.  Also a good sign is when you walk in you see the take-out shelf full all the time.  Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Salad is great.  Pizza is decent for Ohio which is not saying a whole lot.  Since I moved to Ohio I haven't had a great or even almost great pizza.  People here are blissfully unaware of what good pizza is so they seem happy with it.  The place is cash only which I hate...I mean really? Service always seems to be good.  We do go here when we want a decent pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  Dined in and the pizza had a nice crispy crust, good amount of fresh toppings and tasted just fine.  They also have a great juke box.  Would go again."}
{"text":"Ok Pizza but not on my top list. I like that it's not a chain and privately owned.  I'll never go back strictly because they do not take credit cards. This is 2016, how can you not take credit or debit cards?  I have not carried cash in my wallet for 10 years. They're missing so much business for being a cash only place."}
{"text":"We always come here when we are in town visiting family. The definition of a whole in the wall joint. The pizza is great and so are their salads. The service is friendly and quick!  Cash only so come prepared and ready to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Farinacci's when they opened their 3rd store in Cuyahoga Falls. it's definitely worth a try. I think the pizza is as good as any in the neighborhood and they did a really nice job remodeling the building. I'd rate it Very Good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this location on Oakwood so no big deal to pick it up.  When I ordered they said it'll be 30 minutes.  30 minutes?  I'd order delivery from somewhere else if I was going to wait 30 minutes.  If I am picking up I expect 15 at most.  So I went and picked the pizza up about 20 min after I called.  Of course the pizza was done and sitting in the box getting cold when I got there.  Then...my biggest pet peeve...I pull out my bank card to pay and told \"cash or check only.\"  First, you should let people know that on the phone.  Second, then have an ATM inside your place.  Seriously, it's 2012.  I can't stand when places don't accept credit cards.  So I left and went to the gas station down the street to get money from the ATM they had in there.  The pizza:  smallest large pizza I might have ever seen.  About the size of a frozen pizza from the grocery store.  At best it was a medium anywhere else.  I did just read another review that mentioned this and said their \"family size\" was more like a standard large.  Again, you might want to mention this to people since you place is still relatively new in the area.  Very greasy. Reminded me of Sbarro's pizza from the mall.  Taste was okay.  Not a lot of sauce.  Since it had been sitting for a while the cheese was kind of one solid piece, not melty or anything.  Fine amount of pepperoni I guess. No better than a $5 Hot n Ready from Lil Caesars.  Was thinking of going there with my family and friends one Friday night since they serve beer and wine but probably won't do that now.  Oh and with all the options for $10 or less large pizza's out there, no reason to ever go back here.  Especially since it was really a medium for the price of a large."}
{"text":"Farinacci Pizza Is REALLY GOOD! It's the best Pizza in the area! They Offer Yummy Pizza, Delicious Salad and lots more! This pizza is my favorite and it's SO GOOD! I recommend Farinacci Pizza COMPLETELY!!!!!! Hopefully you'll like it too! ;)"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place but the pizza is good  the entire menu is postcard sized  the pretty much have pizza, salad, a lettuce salad and a sandwich or two  nothing else.  The pizza is a bit different than most of the pizza I have had since moving to OH - The sauce is not as sweet as most and I like that!  The building is not nice and I guess supposed to be charming in its simplicity but to me just a bit too industrial.  Great pizza so-so building brings me to a 4 rating but the pizza itself just may be a 5."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! It's all family owned. I would highly recommend it. Joe (the owner) is such a great man. He is very nice, he is approachable, he loves to talk to his customers. I have been coming here for years and everytime it gets better! The prices are very good for a pizza shop with great tasting food! Come here and bring the family!"}
{"text":"Meh, okay at best. Not much flavor, tough crust, and their \"large\" pizza is more like a medium anywhere else. Save your money and just get a Digiorno for half the price and twice the size (and taste)."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and were very disappointed in every other pizza place we tried. Farinaccis is the best tasting pizza in the area with high quality ingredients. Also, if you add on an ingredient, they put a lot on instead of just a few. We did not dine in, we got take out."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good. Staff was nice and attentive. My family enjoys getting pitchers of beer and listening to the jukebox."}
{"text":"Average at best. Thin soggy crust, runny sauce, and so-so flavor.   Hudson has a lot to learn about pizza.   Cash only."}
{"text":"Farinacci's is my favorite pizza.  Yes, I live in Chicago, famous for pizza. Yes, I've been to New York, equally famous for pizza and have tried many different places there. Yes, I have also eaten at other Akron-area pizza places (i.e. Luigi's) that are touted as (and are) delicious.  But... Farinacci's is an institution in my family and I basically grew up eating it.  Anyone with a connection to the Nordonia Hills area (you currently live there, you grew up there, or someone in your family grew up there) can attest to how great of a pizza this restaurant serves up.  Thin, but not too thin, lots of toppings, light on the sauce and full of grease!  It may be a bit greasy for the faint of heart, but a non-greasy pizza is like eating... cardboard.  Yuck!  They also serve a great side salad loaded with cheese and house dressing to die for.  Every time I come home my family makes it a point to get Farinacci's at least once.  Until they opened up this location we used to drive from Stow to Northfield (about 45 minutes round-trip) just to get some pizza.  Even though they did open a Hudson location a few years back my dad couldn't go there because it just \"wasn't the same\" (he was just being nostalgic - it's exactly the same).  I was finally able to convince him to pick pizza up from this location and now he's a believer.  This place is cash only, as are all of their restaurants.  Since I prefer plastic over cash that is one drawback, but I know enough about finance to let it slide for small family-owned businesses.  I am unaware if there is a dining room here as we have only done take-out, but they are also a pick-up only restaurant so make sure to get it home quickly and eat it piping hot!  Thank you for finally coming to Cuyahoga Falls.  I really hope it catches on here like it did up in Northfield!"}
{"text":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE EVER!  This restaurant was founded in the early 70s back when my parents were teenagers.  It pretty much was your typical high school pizza place hangout where everyone went before games, dances, parties, etc.  I don't even think the decor has changed since it was opened.  The pizza is just phenomenal.  It is a thinner crust, but not super thin like the Chicago style which, by the way, I do not care for.  There is a perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and whatever toppings.  One of the best things about the pizza though -- the grease!  It is super greasy, so if you are planning on dabbling your pizza, you might need a whole roll of paper towels!  The waitstaff is nothing but friendly (the head waitress is my chlidhood babysitter).    The place is usually crowded once it hits 7PM, whether it's families, friends, high school students, what have you.  It is truly a neighborhood pizza place.  Even though my family lives 25 minutes south of Northfield, we still pick up 2 sheet pizzas every weekend for dinner.  Farinacci's doesn't deliver, and considering there are hundreds of pizza places in our town alone, that is something to say.  It really is THAT GOOD.  Whenever I am in town, or have friends in, I always make sure to stop and grab some pizza.  So if you are ever in NE Ohio, I highly suggest doing the same."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Thin crust, tasty sauce, really good. The best in the area in my opinion - the closest to authentic east coast pizza. The sizes do run really small here though .... A large looks like a medium, but their 'Family Size' is a 12 piece, true large size pizza and it's about $12.00.  They only accept cash too - just FYI. I guess it's to keep prices down. Great pizza though. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cash only is the only downfall. Great pizza!! Good salads with cheese. Soft drinks only have 1 free refill but are reasonably priced. We've had young high school servers before that aren't very experienced however all in all its a great local place that always serves good food at a great price. They even still have a juke box."}
{"text":"When I want to visit my childhood I go here.   The pizza is still the same pizza. The songs on the old jukebox are still the same. I still load Parmesan cheese that come in the shakers on my pizza. And if you don't finish this pizza, it's always amazing to have cold for breakfast.   Please try the salads here. Fresh shredded mozzarella cheese. Piled on top of the salad. House dressing hasn't changed since I was little-- and should never change.   I wish they would open a place closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Take out Review - Nice phone order experience, but food did not live up to the professionalism of the employee.  Garlic bread - nice garlic flavor, not greasy, but $2.50 for a sub roll? The bread was nothing exceptional... if it was pie dough and made in house i might have been happier... and better able to say something about the dough (1 star)  Pizza - generous topics overwhelmed the sauce... it might as well have been a white pizza... the shiny spots on the photo were pools of grease... took several paper towels to sop it all up. The outside edge was deep dish like and crispy... but the center was goo... and it was golden brown on the bottom so it wasn't that it was under cooked... it just couldn't stand up to the toppings... and we live 3 blocks away? (no stars)  1 additional star for the rock  star order taker!  Very limited menu doesn't really give us a chance to try anything different to give a second opinion.  The Hudson location has a Facebook page that lists the same menu that we received from this (newer) location in the mail so other locations would not offer a better variety than here either.  They do offer Bud on tap as well as bottled beer and wine for those dining in house.  All locations are cash only"}
{"text":"The salads were wonderful we especially like the shaved mozzarella. The pizza was good. The customer service was fantastic! We felt like each staff member was genuinely trying to make our experience positive! That was really refreshing in today's industry."}
{"text":"For this town, it's as good as it gets.  Here's a tasty pizza with fresh ingredients.  Farinacci's is great because all they do is the basics.  They don't mess with wings and everything else, it's just pizzas, and their pizzas are great.  We loved their thicker crust, but thinner bottom.  Their two-topping family pizza was perfectly sized for our family and priced at $14.40 (Oct 2011).  I'd rather pay top dollar for fresh, never frozen ingredients, and wait 25-minutes for a pizza that isn't pre-made.  They only do a dinner service opening at 4pm, and they're not open very late (they close 11:30pm on weekends).  If you're not familiar with town it could be hard to find, but once you see the giant mural of famous Italians you know you're there.  They have a small seating area, but I've yet to see anyone sitting in the dining room.  They also have a Ms. Pacman machine, just like the pizza parlors where I grew up!"}
{"text":"We took the family to Farinaccis before a Christmas show.  They were amazing! Took great care of the kids! Food was awesome! Service was perfect! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok to good.  The salad is not so good.  I would describe it as bland.  The ambience was terrible, even for a neighborhood, old school pizza parlor.  The service was above average.  They were friendly and helpful.  The selection of beer and wine was not good at all.  There was not a single beer or wine on the menu that I would drink.  Overall, I would probably return for the pizza and the service..... But..... There is a deal breaker for me.  Cash only.  Nope.  If you don't take debit/credit cards, you won't get my business."}
{"text":"Went there for a coaches meeting and the pizza was great. Great atmosphere great and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Off the bat, if its your first time go for they're deluxe pizza. Also, keep in mind \"large\" is a ten slice medium and \"family\" is your typical large size.    Ingredients - Nothing from this restaurant is ever frozen and no preservatives (per company literature); taste proves it.   Sauce - Previous reviewer was right, they don't put a ton of sauce on the pizza...and its a good thing because it would be a mess w/ all the toppings they put on. Well balanced in my book...but if you like a crazy amount of sauce, just ask for extra, no big deal.  Crust - A very nice, crisp (but compact) crust with a lot of flavor. Perfect amount of moisture and sweetness. Some may believe that the inner crust isn't done all the way but with a lot of toppings you have a lot of moisture, so its impossible to get a crisp bottom without searing the outer crust. If you like a crisper crust, go for one or two toppings or ask to make it well done.  ***Note that the vegetable ingredients are steamed. This is because they use a carousel oven and not a forced air conveyor style which gives the pie more of a bake than a zap.   Disclosure: no affiliation  -TR"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Lots o' cheese. Also ordered a salad with cheese ...again, awesome. Lots of cheese and the red wine vinagrette-style house dressing was really good.  They do have a dining room, which certainly could use updating, but it is very clean.  The pizzeria is located in a small strip, and as others have said, parking can be hard to come by.  And if you DO find a spot, well, be uber careful backing out, because you will be backing onto a 4 lane road complete with turning lane in the middle. (guess that makes it 5 lanes, huh?)  But, overall, worth the hassle. It's certainly not the cheapest pizza, but it IS one of the best I have had in a loooooooong time."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great people! I'm picky about pies and they have one of the best."}
{"text":"1brought my sibling here for her birthday and it turned into the gathering from hell.  The food took way to long to cook.  We waited over 40 minutes, other tables who came in after we did received their food within a few minuted after we received ours.  30 minutes in, we told the waitress we were ready to go because: (1) she didn't check on us or give us an update on our food  (2) we had no food (3) she took my sister's drink away because something was in it but completely forgot to bring her another one for roughly 15 min (by this time I waved her down).  Now I understand when a place is busy, things may take longer, but there was only 4 tables (including ours) that was taken up.  After the manager convinced us to stay, the waitress then decided to check on us more consistently.  I went to pay and here's the best part NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED, CASH/CHECK ONLY!!!  There was no signs outside or within the establishment so how are first time customers supposed to know.  I give 2 stars because the pizza was fair.  I've already had people ask me the name of this place, so they would never go there.  Fyi, the waitress offered us a lollipop at the very end of the fiasco.  I think she knew she messed up.  The mgr was good and meant well, the waitress seemed very distant from us (really didn't help since we were the only black folks there) until I threatened to walk out.  Both my sister and I noticed how she wasn't paying us much mind our first 30-35 minutes in.  Will not be going back.  UPDATE: 9/11/2015.  Spoke with the mgr about our experience and his response was \"It is what it is\""}
{"text":"Nice family owned pizzeria. I admit to just ordering takeout, so my focus is on pizza and service.   We enjoy the balance of sauce and cheese. Not a fan of huge amounts of cheese on pizza. If that's your thing, order extra. The one pizza we buy is the large double fried peppers. They pan fry peppers and, well, it's great. Yes there's some oilyness, but it's my favorite pizza in the area.   Staff has been uniformly friendly. When we first ordered the double fried peppers we were greeted by the staff to meet us. First time they had made one like that. Great folks and good pizza."}
{"text":"I was really rooting for this place because it's got a lot of local history in Northfield. But to be honest the service was a little rude and the pizza was okay. A solid three star but didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place went unnoticed by me for so long!!  From the outside, the place does't look lik emuch, but it is actually cute on the inside.  It has a full dining room with very friendly service!  I ordered a 1/2 carafe of wine, which was served in a chilled glass, which I didn't like at all. I think red wine should always be at room temperature, never cold or chilled.  Boyfriend & I got a thin crust pizza and felt like it was a little over priced for the amount of pizza we got.  It didn't have the \"wow\" factor we were hoping for.  Personally, I don't know of any great pizza in this area, but I will keep looking.  Would I return again? Yes!  I will have the regular crust next time- I want to find the best pizza in the Falls & am willing to let Farinacci have another chance!  Brig CASH & be sure to enjoy the juke box!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around! We drive 15 minutes from home to get it, totally worth it. Fresh. The crust is so good, nice sweet sauce. Nothing fancy or new age, just great classic pizza. And order a Fiesta Salad, the dressing is so good!"}
{"text":"The good; you can get a family size pizza (like a small sheet) cheap. The bad; the pizza is a bit soggy/doughy uneven dough, and bland sauce. I like the crust and style of sausage they use, but the pizza is extremely greasy. The cheese falls off too. Not in my top 5 pizza list. Pizza tasted better the next day."}
{"text":"Typical NE Ohio local pizza. Nothing stands out as being better or worse than anything else in the area."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. We usually order to go, but they have a small dining area.  I do not know of a better pizza north of Akron. My family loves this and we visit often. The menu's limited to pizza and salad.  The only place better is Luigi's in Akron."}
{"text":"There were enough good comments here on Yelp that I thought I'd give the Hudson Farinacci's a try.  I dined in, but I think it must primarily be a carry-out place.  It wasn't bad, there just wasn't anything special about the experience that would make me want to go back.    The dining room felt like an after-thought, not the cozy kind of place that would make you want to sit and relish your food.  The salad was good, but nothing special. The pizza was good, and if you're sensing my theme, you know there was nothing special about it either.   There weren't many customers dining in, but the service was slow nonetheless. The waitresses were nice but doubled as cashiers for the carry-out business, and those customers apparently were more important since they were taken care of while the dine-in folks waited and waited. It took at least 20 minutes for someone to collect my payment."}
{"text":"Things I like: Cash only.  Kind of cool to run into a place like that.  Service was ok. (not including the 25 minute wait for pizza after we ordered)  Things I don't like : Everything else.  Wood panel walls (like from your grandparents house).  bad seating, bad prices, bad food.  When I can pick out better in the freezer section of the store, there is a problem.  I was really let down too by the local legend of the location.  Cash only hole in the wall usually equals good food.    One review below states exceptional American Style pizza?  Define please? Thick, thin, stuffed? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_in_the_United_States read up.  Damian C in his review states \"It is a thinner crust, but not super thin like the Chicago style which, by the way, I do not care for.\"  It's comments like this that make me drink (ok so there is a lot of things that make me drink like Mondays, Tuesdays, rain, sun, Care Bears, etc.)  Sorry for the rant, but this is why I can't find really good food around this region of blandness."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. My wife and I enjoyed it. If you like sausage pizza they have a recipe that's apparently from the 70's. (Good stuff)    Seems like a good group of people working in there. Very friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be going back in the future."}

{"text":"Hands down still the best pizza around.  I've been going there since 1978 and I have raised my son on it.  He prefers them to any other place."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Nordonia Hills area, and to everyone from there this place is iconic for pizza.  This location holds up to that reputation right down to the decor.  The pizza is some of the best around the area.  Only drawback is that they do not delivered cash only.  \"Local\"  franchises like Farinacci's and Theresa's have better pizza that the national chains. The sausage pizza is fantastic, and you can tell it is fresh sausage and fresh cheese.  The pizza tastes the same as it did in 1978.   I also recommend a salad topped with cheese.  Their homemade house dressing is fantastic and puts Luigi's salads to shame.  Yes they have a small menu; but, they are a pizza shop, and they have that mastered!!"}
{"text":"Our neighbor highly recommended this pizza joint for dinner after the Browns game. So we ordered take out as they don't deliver. Grabbed cash from the arm since they don't use credit cards. Pizza place is small not much parking and not much seating but the employees were very friendly. Not a long wait for the pizza and when we got back home we ate. It was delicious. Even the kids enjoyed. Outer crust  was thick inner crust thin and moist. Cheese on the perfect side. Sauce perhaps sweet? Not sure but it was delicious! We will order again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza parlors in greater Cleveland. The pizza dough is made fresh every single day. The sauce is just fantastic with plenty of pepperoni. They utilize 100 percent cheese. It is so simple and fresh with the finest ingredients. Carry on! My highest recommendation."}
{"text":"The pizza is pricey but exquisite, and there's no two ways about it. The salads are like the  joke on family guy--awful, full of whole tomatoes, cheese wedges, and a barely cut head of lettuce. But the pizza--holy hell. Just good, no frills, delicious, amazing, gorgeous pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza in my opinion. It's a cash-only joint and dimly lit. Could very well be my new go-to pizza place. The large pizza was on the smaller side, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"This is the best Ma & Pa place around! I love how the deccore has not changed since the day it opened - if people complain about that LAME - but anyways.....  I moved out of Macedonia - neighbor town to Northfield - about eight months ago to DC and I can not wait to go home to get a slice or I should say square of this place.  It has just the right amount of cheese, pepperoni and grease. Of course beer too!  Staff is nice but I really don't care if they were good or bad just don't change a thing about the decore or the PIZZA! :)"}
{"text":"Great old school pizzeria atmosphere and super inexpensive.   Get the salad too, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome and at a great price.  The sauce is great and the crust is perfect.  Great customer service too!  This is the best pizza place in Hudson."}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite pizza place in Hudson.  As long time residents here we've tried them all, and this one is tops.  The pizza is flavorful and delicious, and I love their \"family sized\" pizza.  This is a larger rectangular size with 12 square slices.  Perfect for when you've got a few extra kids over, and you don't have to order ahead or give them extra time.  The owners are really friendly, and they work hard to learn your name so that you always feel welcome there.  Yes the ambiance is a little ordinary, but the food and service more than make up for that.  Absolutely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Farinacci Pizza is an old fashioned pizza parlor.  Nice family friendly environment, no fancy bells and whistles but they offer a well baked nice tasting pizza at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I like pizza at Mark & Philly's or Rocco's just a bit better, but this is a good change of pace.  Way better than what they call pizza at PJ's, PH, and Dominoes.  I'll be ordering from here and again."}
{"text":"We were fans of the Northfield location, so it worked out perfectly when they opened the C. Falls location practically at the end of our street.  We typically order the \"family\" size, which is a 12-cut rectangle.  (Who am I kidding, we always order 2 so we have leftovers).  Great flavor and consistently well baked.  The pizza tends to be on the thinner side but is well balanced with sauce, cheese, and toppings.  This is our go-to pizza joint in the Falls.  Keep in mind that they only accept cash and checks - no credit cards."}
{"text":"It's a hole-ine-the-wall pizza place that doesn't deliver, has hit or miss parking, shuts down for a month at a time in the winter for vacation, and doesn't even take credit cards, but this pizza is amazing.  The place is usually packed on the weekends.  It's the best pizza you can get anywhere around here.  It's worth the trip for sure!  The sausage is home made and to die for.  Get a few family sizes to go, it's great reheated if there's any left!"}
{"text":"Local mom & pop pizza spot that has been here forever! My mom said she would come here all the time for pizza as a kid. I really liked the pizza here and the staff is really friendly! I will say the portions were smaller than what I had imagined. A family size felt like more of a true large and a large was more of a medium. I personally like the saltiness of the pizza, but someone with a less tolerant salt palette may feel otherwise. All in all I'll definitely be back and would recommend this pizza place!"}
{"text":"Great tasting, fresh ingredients, hand crafted - love it. Salads are great too. Eating in is ok- small, crowded interior. Cash only! Worth it!"}
{"text":"Love the food. The pizza with fried peppers and mushrooms the best. Gotta love a family owned restaurant. Used to NY style pizza, this is nothing close but great for Cleveland standards!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, especially the family size, but lately hate the wait.  I call up, order the Za, they tell me 30--40 mins or whatever.  So I get in my car and drive up at 40 mins. (cause they don't deliver) and there's still no pizza!  And they're like, \"oh, sorry - we are swamped - another 25\" or 15, blah blah.  Seriously, the first time I was like, \"oh, well, it happens,\" but after the fourth or fifth time, I think it's time to move on.  Which is sad - it is my favorite pizza in the area, but I really can't deal with the crazy waits."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this is the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. We were told by a friend that this place had the best pizza, only reason we didn't try it before now is because they don't deliver and only accept cash. We were so excited to try this little mom and pop pizza but it was such a let down. Awful cheap toppings. Trust me when I say a frozen pizza is better than what they are serving."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I've realized a lot. Some people grew up in the area and love what Farinacci's has to offer. Those hometown sweethearts may be attached to the joy Farinacci's brings them and they might find it a local hotspot.  And some people may have expected more out of it, for example they may have expected it to be a tad more modernized and upscale.  Here's my two cents:  It's a family owned business and it's huge among locals. I don't know how long that's going to be \"in\" but they're doing pretty good. The pizza is delicious.  I grew up in the Northfield area. My family used to come here every Friday when I was a kid, and even as I grew older, we would still get pizza from here at least once a month.  I love the pizza here. The dough and sauce is the best part. Would I drive out of the way for it though? Not at all.  If you live in the area, you have to give it a shot. I recommend getting it to-go. However, it's pizza. Yes, this place is cash only. Yes, they don't deliver. Yes, they have weird hours. Yes, the inside looks outdated and old fashioned.  However, they have great pizza and good service. This generation is too obsessed with fast casual hipster places and they discredit every single place that is either family owned, old-fashioned, ma and pa, rooted in another culture/language, etc. Not every place you eat at is going to be that cool Coffee shop with gluten free pastries in Ohio City. That's what makes dining unique.   If you don't like it, don't bother eating there. But whenever I'm in town, I'll be glad to stop by."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. Wonderful family owned business! The Extra Cheese is really cheesy. It is a little greasy but worth it for the flavor. The Medium is small. So if you have more than 2 people, get the Family Size."}
{"text":"Truly the best. They don't cut corners and will serve you the most delicious pizza ever.  Good old fashioned pizzeria pizza.  Crust is not too thick and not too thin.  Go there.  You will not regret it.  Oh, did I mentioned the owners and staff are pretty amazing too?"}
{"text":"Found this on my Yelp app because we wanted a pre-movie meal and boy it was GOOD. The place was small and only takes cash or check, but for the price you can't get better pizza. Two of us were stuffed with pizza and salad for under $20. The wait staff were very friendly.  Will definitely go back. Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a pizza last night after work. It was my first time that I actually set foot in the place and I liked it. It is good to see the usage of the ferris wheel style ovens. The place was packed to the gills. Farinacci is one of my favorite pizza places in Cleveland. I recommend going there sometime if you are in the area hiking or what not at the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The leftovers taste just as good, if not better the second time around."}
{"text":"This is seriously my favorite pizza in Cuyahoga Falls place hands down! I only eat pizza every once in a while and this place really is worth it! I highly recommend the salad with cheese and their house dressing as well."}
{"text":"We love the food--always consistent quality, freshness, and taste, and we think the owner is an awesome human being!  Hudson's Farinacci Pizza surely does exemplify excellence in product and management! PS.  Every year, twice a year, at election time, Dave generously donates delicious pizza and salad to all of the election poll workers at the Hudson United Methodist Church location!  We so appreciate his generosity time after time!  By dinner time after a long day at the polls, hot, fresh, tasty pizza and crisp salad loaded with mozzarella and veggies surely hits the spot!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Farinacci's Pizza! When I first moved here I used Yelp to find this place and it's SO good.   I like their rectangle pizza the best. For some reason I find it to be better then their round pizzas.   Be aware, they are a cash only establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious!! the only bad thing is that the week we usually decide to have a \"Farinacci's Pizza night\", the \"family\" is on vacation somewhere great!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my kids hated it, the cheese they use is very pungent. The atmosphere is frozen in the 70's. Glad the locals love it so much but we won't be back."}
{"text":"What can I say but this place reminds me of the type and style of homemade pizza I used to have as a kid. Very tasty with great sauce and real topping not mass produced tasting.  Decor was very 70's with a very jut box and old beer lamps and signs a long with menu board that have to peg the letters and numbers in."}
