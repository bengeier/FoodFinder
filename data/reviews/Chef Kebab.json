{"text":"Been here twice, both times the owner was rude and insulted our table. They are not accommodating, nor friendly in any way. You are served by children, the decor is cheap and tacky.
Too bad, we really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food/armenian in Laval. Very authentic, home feel. Great service and friendly people. Excellent place overall. I wouldn't think of another place to eat middle eastern/armenian food in Laval. I would definitely refer everyone to this great place. Garo, the owner is always there and makes sure everything goes smooth."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker and found ourselves walking into an empty restaurant. Either this is a blessing in disguise or it's a premonition for things to come.

Service was friendly and we ordered our food without issues. I went with the filet mignon and soujouk sandwiches. The filet mignon sandwich was decent but I'll be honest and state I've had far better. It didn't feel like it was grilled on charcoal but more so on propane which clearly doesn't taste as good. The soujouk was completely off, I've always enjoyed soujouk and I'll be honest... it was pretty bad. I got another sandwich for my Lebanese boss and she came to me later on in the afternoon wondering what I tried to feed her! The Aryan drink she got was watered down as per her opinion.

With other options in this area, I don't see myself coming back here. Price-tag is pretty expensive as well."}
