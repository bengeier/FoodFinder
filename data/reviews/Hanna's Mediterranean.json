{"text":"With \"shawarma\" in the name of the restaurant, I figured that it has to be a signature dish. Wrong. Dry, oversalted chicken smothered in a greasy, flavourless, tarator-type sauce. Enough said.  I've worked throughout the Middle East and by no means do I expect places in the GTA to exactly replicate the rotisserie process. But this place was just bad. Too. Much. Salt.  Service was okay. Not friendly, but not rude."}
{"text":"The worst service on the face of the planet.  The restaurant wasn't even busy and they still managed to make it the worst dining experience.  The servers are very airheaded and rude servers that work there.  The gave us the wrong meals, took three requests for our pita bread, forget to bring us our salad dressings and took 45 minutes to prepare our dinner.  The food quality has also gone down since the renovations.  I used to go every week and now I will never go back even if you paid me to."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend and they recommended the falafel dish here.   We ordered the falafel with 3 salads dish and chicken shawarma dinner. The salads for the falafel dish were beet salad (just beets), red cabbage (marinated cabbage) and hummus (normal hummus).  To say the least, it was uneventful.  The chicken shawarma came with a house salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, carrot, lettuce) which looked as though they have been made the previous morning and put in the fridge. The sauce is served in a plastic lid that looks like it is out of the same fridge.  The chicken shawarma came with fries (which were excellent) and undercooked veggies. The shawarma was on the dryer side and we ate it with hummus.   For dessert we had baclava and tea. The bill for 2 people incl a glass of wine and a beer came to 65$ which seems quite expencive for the experience.  I am not planning on going back unless it's to have some french"}
{"text":"Very good, very fresh, good service, reasonable prices (except for the taboulé take-out : $8 for a med. container is a bit much, but it was A1)."}
{"text":"I'd say that the food is good. A table for 1 was $30.00 before tip (20%), I asked for extra laffa to take home w/ 80%  of a hummus plate, and was told that I would have to be charged? Poor and shallow business mentality.... a small gesture usually goes further than $1.00"}
{"text":"Been going there for year, I think there may have been a management change, last 2 times I was there the chicken shwarma didn't taste as it use to. Service was very lethargic, waited almost 30mins for 3 order of chicken dinner and 1 order of kids chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation and I was treated very rudely.  I was very disappointed.  I do not deserve to be treated this way.  I left a message for the owner, Albert to call me.  I don't feel like the person will even pass on my message."}
{"text":"I come here often with my family. I should say they have one of the tastiest shawarma in town and we order a lot of take out from them but sometimes if you go a little later at night they don't have any shawarma. In overall its one of my fav shawarma place by far and their service is good as well."}
{"text":"I love grills and middle-eastern foods.  Me Va Me used to be one of my favorite places, and the location on Bathurst and Steeles still is.  The Me Va Me up north is terrible.  We went there three times, thinking that it was maybe teething pains at the beginning, but it was consistently just bla.  Add to that the noisy acoustics of the place, and we decided to not go there again.  Fortunately, Hanna Shawarma across the street is great.  Probably even better than the Me Va Me on Steeles.    Portions aren't as big as Me Va Me, but they are plenty big (each of us often has a bit to take home from the dinner plates).  We have been there a dozen times now, and except for one time, the food was consistently very good.  Once, the lamb was undercooked (we asked for medium-rare, but got rare), and when we got it back, it was still undercooked.  An off day for the kitchen, maybe, as the rest of our visits have been excellent.  Pickles can be better, but they are free, so doesn't matter.  Falafel is excellent, as is the humus.  Pitas are just average.  Service is good, place is clean and looks good. Also, even when there are a lot of people there (which usually there aren't), it's faily-quiet.  for the price, you can't really ask for more."}
{"text":"We only do take out, so I can only comment on the food, not the service.  The food is delicious.  It's significantly better than Me-Va-Me, which opened another location just across the street.    We always get their baba ganouj and fried eggplant salad.  Both are delicious and fresh.  The hummus is also quite good.  Pitas are usually fresh.  Some come free with dinner, but a good thing is that you could also buy them by the piece (instead of getting a full bag).   The shish-kebob is nice and moist, significantly better than the burnt meat you get at Me-Va-Me.  Shawarma is not bad either.  The do put onions on top of everything (for garnish), so if you don't like them, make sure to mention it when ordering.  They have just changed their menu and now have kefta-kebob as well.  Also, their prices have been lowered a bit.  Take-out is usually pretty quick (again, compared to Me-Va-Me), and the plaza is better designed and more accessible.   They're also planning on expanding their eat-in space (the sign's been up for a while), as it is pretty small right now, and busy in the evenings."}
{"text":"Hanna's Shawarma  Hanna's Shawarma is a cozy little Middle Eastern Restaurant located in Richmond Hill. The décor and setting is very comfortable and the service is great. The food is delicious and the portions are sizeable. I would recommend starting with the hummus and pita, they also provide you with complimentary peppers and pickles. For mains the veal kebab, lamb kebab, or veal schnitzel are all succulent and fresh. I would also highly recommend getting a side of roasted garlic potatoes. The shawarma sandwich at times can be runny, but they definitely use fresh ingredients and the sandwich is sizeable and worth it, especially for $6."}
{"text":"They give you free pickles as an appetizer (like how French restaurants give you bread) I loved that!   Servers were good and the interior decor was very modern and nice.   As for the food I have mixed opinions. Spicy hummus appetizer was great. My girlfriend's chicken schnitzel was amazing! My kofta, however, was terrible. I'm very surprised that a shawarma place had better schnitzel then kofta!   Overall even though most of the food was really good I felt it was a little over priced for what we got. I am a huge fan of middle eastern food and had never been to a real sit-down middle eastern restaurant so I was a little disappointed. Still there is a good chance I'll be back because of the pickles and schnitzel."}
{"text":"I always do take out when I am in the area. Used to work in the area a couple of years ago. i love their chicken shawarma ($7.99) and i do take out on the babaganoush on a small container and another eggplant side dish that is tomato based. they are fast doing your take out now. employee retention seems to be better. they only have beef shawarma on the weekends. one time i dined, the experience was nice. highly recommendable."}
{"text":"As an ex meat eater this was one of my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant. So when I was craving falafel I decided to give them a try as a vegan.  Falafel is pretty much their only vegan option for a main dish. I like the way they open up and fill up the pita bread (picture below) rather than just wrapping. More toppings and less bread. The falafel lunch special is served with a side of choice. I do recommend their French fries as its crispy and tasty. My friend ordered the salad and he wasn't very impressed.  Overall great place and I recommend their falafel pita with a side of French fries."}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant about a dozen times... I always go for main course dishes.. First thing first.. The goulash soup is amazing and you can make it even better by adding morsels of the hot and fresh from the oven bread!! As far as the main course goes, you have to try their grilled European sea bass, wow it reminds me of the grilled mediterranean sea bass served in Greece and Herzilya marina  Finally, their tender and moist beef skewers or rack of lamb is worth your money!!  One more thing.. Their salads are very fresh and generous portions along with their special dressing!  Also, do not forget to order their amazing Naana Tea if you love tea with lots of mint leaves.. Works really well if you have it with their Chocolate Truffle!!"}
{"text":"Half of me wants to give this place one star and the other half wants to give four. The food is pretty amazing but two of the three times I've been here, my experience was been ruined by one very rude waitress. I don't know her name (not that I should name names anyway), but if you want to avoid her, she has an Israeli accent, longish hair and seems about 40 years old.   I'm a lamb fanatic, so every time that I have been to Hanna's, I rush to the lamb section of the menu. Both the lamb chops and the rack of lamb taste incredible and are reasonably priced, but the chops are what have my heart, mostly because it's better bang for the buck. Even the sides are delicious. The fries are always very crispy, the rice flavourful, the potatoes perfectly cooked and the salad fresh.   Now for my first pet peeve: I always ask for half sides with my lamb meal (e.g., instead of just rice, I'll ask for half rice and half potatoes) and for some reason, Hanna's just isn't able to figure out how to do that. The plate always comes out with only one side, and then it has to be brought back to the kitchen to get replated with the second side. This has happened EVERY time that I've been here. One time, they messed up even after bringing it back to the kitchen, so I ended up with an extra plate of sides just because they kind of gave up. I can't complain about getting extra food for free, but I really don't see how it's so hard for them to give me the correct sides.  Second pet peeve: Free peppers and pickles. I'm not complaining about them being free, I'm complaining about the fact that I've been DENIED the free peppers and pickles. The first time that I ate at Hanna's, the peppers and pickles were put on the table immediately after my party sat down, so after we weren't given any during my second time at the restaurant we asked our super rude waitress to get us some and she told us that we couldn't have them. That's it. Other tables had them, but we couldn't have them and she didn't really have a good explanation other than \"they aren't free\". The third time I went to Hanna's, we got the same waitress as the second visit and when we asked for the peppers and pickles she brought them out without any argument. What happened the second time, and why did we have to ask for them the third time anyway? I know they're just pickles and peppers, but they're delicious, and the inconsistency between visits is very irritating.   Third MAJOR pet peeve: The rude waitress has a major attitude problem. It doesn't end with the free peppers and pickles. Don't get me wrong, I've had two other waitresses here and they were both incredibly nice and accomodating, so this woman isn't representative of the entire staff. But holy moly, I can't remember ever being treated as badly as this woman treated my friends and me on two separate occasions. She starts off with a fake smile, but once you ask any questions about the menu or bring up any problems with the food (like wrong sides!!!!) she acts like you've just insulted her mother. Very curt responses, demeaning tone of voice, etc. It's really offputting.   During our third visit, we were initially served by a younger waitress who was very nice, but the rude waitress quickly came and took over (it seems like they were sharing duties). At the end of our meal when we got the bill from the nice waitress, we all opted to pay separately by card, though the bill had already been printed, so we were just going to split it up manually and do multiple transactions for the one bill. We tipped about 10% each because the service from the rude waitress was really bad, but we didn't want to completely screw over the nice waitress. After we all paid, the rude waitress came back and started \"apologizing\" because the other waitress \"made a mistake\" with our bill that caused us to undertip, all while the other waitress was standing beside her with an awkward smile. Uhhhh no, we tipped 10% on top of the tax (which, by the way, is still 10% higher than you deserve) because you were so rude! When we told her that there was no mistake, she actually brought out a calculator and started calculating how much each of us tipped and told us that it wasn't enough. I guess she doesn't understand the concept of tipping, because I'm pretty sure tips are supposed to be earned based on performance. She kept badgering us about how much we tipped, and that's when we decided that we would not come back to Hanna's, at least while she's working. Seriously, how disrespectful can you be towards your customers and your coworkers!?  I'll really (REALLY!!!) miss the food, but this waitress is a complete nightmare."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices and tons of bang for your buck.   I had the lamb kafta plate with garlic potatoes and Israeli salad. Kaftas weren't my favourite ever but not bad. Garlic potatoes were very good. Salad was ok.   Also tried the chicken schnitzel which was really nice.  Laffa breads were tasty and we had a plate of dips (hummus, babaganoush, etc) that was tasty.   Take out sandwiches seem like they'd be very legit here but I haven't had them"}
{"text":"Bad service for a place that was empty and not experiencing rush hour.   Server told me and my girls \"she doesn't have time\"when we were waiting for our drinks and ketchup before our food actually came lol. She's forgot my friend coke 4 times.   There was 2 servers and lots of ppl in the kitchen and our food took 35 mins.   We were also seated beside a table that had a big party and it wasn't cleaned up right away, not even after we paid our bill. We were basically eating beside a big dirty table.  Ew."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant a few times and always enjoyed their food. Hosted a couple of customers yesterday and was impressed with the appetizer sampler; hummus, babaganoush & beets, very good flavours with all the ingredients. Had the chicken kabobs with rice and potatoes, very good, it also included a mixed salad.  The waitress was very attentive and prompt with our order.  This would be my goto place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They changed their name to Laffa House and everything has gone downhill. A lot less food for the same, expensive prices. Quality of food has also gotten a lot worse. I used to come every week, and would do take out at least once a week as well, but I will never be returning again. This is how you lose loyal customers!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service , the food was far from being fresh. The sea food dish had a bad smell . Prices above average"}
{"text":"Went here last night after their extensive renovation.  They had been closed for close to four months.  We used to go there on a regular basis prior to the reno.  I must say that we were disappointed.  They have removed the trio of salads from the menu which I always looked forward to.  The portion of the Israeli salad was substantially smaller than what it used to be as well as the mixed vegetables that accompanied the Red Snapper entree that we had.  Anyway, I will give it another try and then will be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just had a falafel and Laffa here and it was the best I've had yet in the city. The laffa was very tasty and the falafel balls had such a delicious flavour. Way better than Other middle eastern places. I was served fast and water was refilled without asking, which is extremely important. They give you a lot of food and you leave full for a value price. Great find!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I tried Israeli food before Me Va Me and I fell in loooove!   The decor is OK, nothing fancy at all. It's pretty small with only a few tables to sit at. There were a lot of people waiting on take-out so I suppose it serves as that most of the time. I went on a Sunday around 5-6 pm so it should have been busier.   We (I mostly...) ordered the chicken shish kebab which came with a rice and salad, onion rings and an assorted platter of salads (hummus, baba ghanoush, fried eggplant salad and green eggplant salad) which came with pita and from what I recall the pita was free so we just ordered whenever we ran out of stuff to dip.  I will tell you this much - Hanna's has the best onion rings I have EVER had in my life. Aside from the black and tan at Puck n Wings, Hanna's regular rings were something next to heavenly...they were perfect in every way. Maybe I just got lucky. Every single time I pass this place I just have the biggest urge to go in and order the good ol' onion rings."}
{"text":"Best Isreali food in the area (compared to MeVaMe, etc)...always fresh and delicious!!  Chicken breast dinner and Shawarma are amazing.  Try coming at lunch for the Shawarma when the outer layer is crispy and spectacular!"}
{"text":"Really good food, OK casual ambiance, waitress was polite, the place was jam packed and we still got our food in an orderly time, had the chicken skewers and rice and salad, the other order was beef skewers, both were really good, the salad was fresh, the meat was however slightly salty but not overtop. Would go again for a second time, definitely better than our experience with me va me. My only complaint would be the fact that we had to wait 10 minutes for our bill."}
{"text":"I came to this place to have some taste of middle Eastern food. I ordered the chicken skewers with rice and Cesar salad. The chicken skewers were good and I liked them very much the rice was not bad either. They gave there signature souse which was not mayo bases as most signature souses seems to be mayo based which was nice. However the Cesar salad was bad I did not like it the it was just lettuce and croutons. The lettuce were old and mainly the shaft which I was not happy about. The place was nice but I did not feel the middle Eastern theme and the menu had lots of Greek food and not as much middle Eastern as I expected and the name and the place state middle Eastern.   Overall not bad place good chicken nice place just not as middle Eastern as I wanted to be."}
{"text":"I really didn't know how to rate this place. Food was very good. Had a large variety of stuff at our table. Everyone happy.... but.... it's not a nice setting to sit for dinner. Feels like a school cafeteria and has terrible acoustics. What really put my off, there was an elderly male waiter that was picking his nose so disgusting in plain sight. Really off putting."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant and I don't think I would come back again.    I ordered the chicken schnitzel dinner for $14.99.  It's served with a house salad and your choice of fries, rice or potatoes.  I selected the fries and found them too greasy and lumpy...just an unpleasant, overfried texture.    The chicken schnitzel was huge, had a nice crispy batter however it didn't taste like it was seasoned to me.  It was served with lemon and a garlic dipping sauce which helped, but overall I didn't find the flavour was there.    The house salad was the best because of the delicious house dressing it comes with.  It had mixed greens, some shredded carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes and red onion.  It was a good portion.  My husband ordered the shawarma hummus- again it was a very large and generous portion, however the hummus was bland and lacked seasoning.  It was served with pita bread, which was very crispy and therefore not ideal for dipping and scooping.  In addition to the overall bland food, the service was lacking.  The server took awhile to come take our order, although there were only two other tables at the time.  The server seemed a little rough when she was placing the food on the table and curt when taking our order."}
{"text":"This place makes the best chicken schnitzel! I've been here three times and each time I've ordered the same thing, chicken schnitzel dinner, which includes a salad (i.e., house or caesar, or you can upgrade to Greek salad for $1.99) and choice of side (i.e., fries, garlic potatoes yum!, and I'm not sure what else). The fries are crispy and well-seasoned with salt.   The house salad comes with a creamy tangy salad dressing, and the schnitzel meal comes with a creamy garlic dip, good for your chicken and side of potatoes! The schnitzel portions are HUGE by the way, and it's only $14.99 for the plate. I have never been able to finish a whole meal and often will bring half of it home with me for a yummy sandwich the next day (or later that evening). I guess it's also because we typically order appetizers which can be filling. Great choices for appetizers: Baba ganoush with laffa (yum!) and falafel (crispy and warm, served with hummus and tabouleh on the side).   This restaurant has a loud environment. It gets quite busy and on weekends, it's packed with families and their children. It almost feels like a cafeteria. They have desserts from La Rocca, and baklava. The baklava will need to be shared because they give you a huge square portion that is cut into two triangle halves. It's not overly sweet either as baklava typically is.  The service unfortunately is lacking. Usually there are 1-2 bus people and two waitresses at a time. I think they get a lot of returning customers because they often spend a lot of time chatting with them. The service is also a bit slow and they don't come to the table as often to check up on you. Also, I've noticed that the waitresses there have very long hair, and I've noticed at times that whenever they reach over the table to place a dish or a glass, their hair swoops onto the table and almost touches the food. This kind of turned me off. If the food wasn't so good, I probably would have said something.  All in all, this is definitely a place I'd return to. I'm afraid to sway away from the schnitzel as it's the best I've ever had.  I've heard that their chicken kabab is pretty good as well. Man, I'm really looking forward to eating the remainder of my schnitzel from last night!"}
{"text":"Been a staple in the area for around 10 years.  Typically good food. Larger portions. And well seasoned middle eastern food.  Some great options on the menu. Both family friendly and famous for take out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  If you're into this kind of food you really have to check it out.  Service can be bad sometimes but the chefs make the food completely worth it.  -RK"}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 Rating (If I could issue one)  Yes the food is good here. When I've been here in the past though, the service has been spotty. Long wait times and mistaken orders has eroded what the food does so well to balance out the experience.  Is the food revolutionary? Not really but it is done well here. I just don't find myself sitting when I'm hungry and Hanna's rising to the top of my list to eat. It's good, not great and it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Love the falafel pita sandwich. Always have to remember to ask for extra napkins though!"}
{"text":"I feel like Hannah's plummeted at the same rate as their competition across the street. Unfortunately a restaurant I once really enjoyed has started dishing out dry, flavourless chicken shawarma, stale laffa, and gritty hummus. It's too bad, the food used to be much better and offered far more value that the current standards. Truly a last-resort option based on proximity."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? They were a five star restaurant with great tasting food.  Food quantity and quality is drastically changed. This happened recently after changing to Laffa House."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot. It has definitely gone down hill. Had the Snitzel Chicken and was dry beyond edible. Wait staff was mediocre. Ambiance seems failing. Won't return."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here.  It's cozy and the food is fresh.. very delish."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and very attentive to our needs. The space is modern and very clean.  The food is delicious - we keep coming back just for the salad combo where you can pick from a wide list of salads including humus and tabouli and interesting other dishes.  The beef skewers are also very tender and moist.   I visit often and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be my new favorite Israeli joint, since Me va me's quality has declined below acceptable, but things did not go according to plan. Our visit started at a 5 and ended with a 2, what a disappointment.  First of all the place is very small and cozy, just wooden tables and chairs and not whole lot of decor, you could see into the kitchen where the grill is. We ordered lamb (cooked to medium) and chicken kebab which everyone is raving about, humus with tahini and two peach spring juices, which came at a hefty price of $3 each. The humus was nice and smooth, the salad that came with the main was full of fresh greens and we really like the dressing, very garlicky. They also serve pickles which were nothing special and tasted exactly like in every other place that serves them. The pitas were whole wheat and somewhat burned, they were a sign of things to come. After the kebab arrived we immediately dug in, only to find that the chicken was underdone and the meat was still pink, the lamb was just barely cooked from outside and very much raw throughout. We asked the server to cook them a little longer, she went back into the kitchen yelling \"surprise\" to whoever was there. After a few minutes the kebabs were back, very burned on the outside, the chicken was done, lamb however was still raw. Hence we sticked with the chicken, which was nothing spectacular given the fact the burned bits are not my favorites. What was especially impressive is that at no time the server asked us if everything was ok, she did not apologize for the undercooked chicken, never asked if we liked it at all after it came back, overall she displayed a couldn't-care-less attitude.  I can see the potential in this place, and we will come back sometime perhaps during lunch to see if we just got unlucky at dinner, but so far I would not recommend it. I have never been served raw chicken in my life so it is a major let down."}
{"text":"We got take-out from here, and the food was delicious. The prices are quite reasonable. Here are the details:  1. Kafta Kebab - lamb kebab was flavorful and nice and moist. 2. Chicken fingers - very good. 3. Beef Filet Mignon Shish Kebab - excellent meat, perfectly cooked to medium. 4. We wanted lamb+veel shawarma, but they didn't have it. We ordered the chicken shawarman instead, which was very good. However, it was a very small portion. 5. Humus - very good hummus.  I have two complaints: we didn't get a bill with a price breakdown, so it was hard to double check the prices. Also, the salad dressing was way too garlicky. I mean it was burn-your-mouth garlicky. You do not want to have it on a date ;-)"}
{"text":"I've come here twice on two separate occasions (both Saturday nights), and on both occasions they were SOLD OUT of chicken shawarmas. Yes, I repeat, the Shawarma restaurant was sold out of shawarmas."}
{"text":"Shawarma was ok I don't like the spice that much but the beef and chicken were good. Not expensive so worth the cost ..."}
{"text":"So I eat at Hanna's about once a week. Normally it's take out. Their shwarma's are pretty tasty. My kids love the falafel as well. I would recommend giving them a try. I also go in for their matzaball soup when I feel a soar throat coming on."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place a lot, back when it was located further west on Rutherford Road. It used to be a great little place with reasonably priced, very tasty middle eastern food. The last few times have let a lot more to be desired.   I won't be going to this place any more.   While the food quality has gone down slightly, the service has gone completely downhill - enough that I will no longer frequent this restaurant. On our last visit, although we made reservations, when we arrived, they didn't even relate to it. We were seated next to the windows, but it was very hot with the sun beating down, and when we asked to be moved, they made it seem like it was a big hassle - even though there were plenty of tables open. When we finally were seated elsewhere, the waitress - who didn't smile at all throughout, and didn't say the basic courtesy of \"how are you, welcome to Hannah's\" - handed us completely worn out and old menus. You see, it all starts there - the little things! If a restaurant can't even keep its menus in both good condition and up-to-date, what else can be said about the entire operation?!  We waited a near 15 minutes before we finally got to order our meal - way too long - and when  the appetizer of hummus and salad arrived, we noticed that we didn't have cutlery on the table, and ended up waiting another 5 - yes, 5 - minutes for our cutlery, which we had to ask another waitress to get us. But the best was yet to come...  As we were eating our hummus and salads, our waitress approached us and, without any hesitation and in a nonchalant manner, asked us if we would be so kind as to move tables, because another larger group was arriving and they had to seat them. We were shocked that they would ask us, guests of their establishment, such a crass question - after we already started eating! I politely said no, that we were already settled and didn't want to move a second time, at which point our waitress shrugged off and went about her duties.   The food was good, but as I wrote earlier, it's gotten worse over the years. The dark meat chicken in particular was burnt and dried out.   So, all in all:  -rude greeting -making a hassle to move because it was too hot -worn out and old menus -completely forgot out cutlery and napkins -asked us to move again  Who to blame? I could blame the waitress, but you know how it goes - a rotting fish smells at the head. The management of this restaurant took a once-great place and turned it downhill. Basic courtesies are needed."}
{"text":"I had heard about Hanna's a bunch of times and wanted to know how it compared to the Me Va Me across the road (my reference point for Israeli food unfortunately). There was a lot of overlap in the menu but the two places differed quite a bit in ambiance and decor. Hanna's struck me as a bit more causal and spacious. It seemed like a good place to go in a large group and it's definitely more kid friendly.   I loved the complementary kosher pickles but did not care for the Unico pepperoncini or the store bought pitas. We ordered three sides with the falafel platter, of which the baba ganoush was quite good. The lamp and chicken shish kabobs were succulent and tasty. The veggies were way too oily and garlicy. In fact, I don't generally like the excessive use of garlic. I feel like it really takes away from the flavour of the food and it makes me suspicious about the freshness of the food.   All in all, when in the mood for some Israeli food, the Me Va Me across the road will be your best bet. However, if you don't like crowds or have a rowdy little one then Hanna's will suit you more."}
{"text":"A good average place, very similar to the other restaurants within a 1km range serving the same cuisine/menu. They also offer delivery which is great, BUT they're almost always out of drivers!! So every time we plan to order and call in , then we end up placing an order for pickup instead, which isn't that convenient. Food is always good, again average taste. I recommend ordering the chicken schnitzel with their rice which is real good, as well as Hummus with chicken shawarma. I do however prefer the original spot of Hanna's restaurant, where it was just east of where it's at right now, on rutherford and Thornhill woods. It was much smaller, so it's always full creating a nice ambiance, where it's too big now, it's always never full and only few scattered tables instead."}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch. Super friendly staff and great food. I had a Shawarma and a salad. Both were very tasty and fresh. I also had the lemonade with mint. It was a perfect compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Average food. The menu is very confusing .. there was falafel on the menu in 4 different places ... The hummus portions were tiny. The bread wasn't fresh it was just heated up and served to us. Doesn't compare at all to me va me across the street !! I'm not going to be going back here ..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for the food. Service is not the best. Sometimes very rude, but all in all very good portions and the price is great."}
