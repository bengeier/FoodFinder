{"text":"This is my morning coffee spot on the way to my office! Their coffee is way superior to aroma and Starbucks in the vicenity, and at a much better price. They offer all the dressings you could need for your coffee as well. 
Of course, their bagels are pretty good. They don't skimp out on the cream cheese and offer lots of fresh toppings to boot. 
Also, service is ALWAYS quick and friendly. 
If you're looking for a consistently satisfying, quick, and easy morning spot I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've ordered countless bagels at this place. The people who run it are always upbeat and service is terrific. They know their usual customers and they're always happy to serve you. Even if the lineup is ten people deep, you'll still get your bagel faster than you think."}
{"text":"Located in the food court of Yonge and Eglinton Centre, this Bagel Stop is the least generous one of all. They do not stack on bagel fillings like the one at Yonge/Sheppard does. It is also owned by Koreans, but the owner of this location does nothing to help out his staff when it gets busy. The poor women scurry around during peak hours while the owner just stands by the cash register waiting to collect the money. 

The coffee here isn't very fresh, I suggest the cookie and coffee combo at mmmmuffins located just next door. They also don't make their own bagels. To get fresh bagels, go across the street to What-A-Bagel, where they give you free bagels for your birthday!"}
{"text":"This place is never busy when I pass by. It's convenient right off the subway entrance. What I love is how they're always cheerful here and they rarely run out of bagels, no matter what time I'm there. Also, they're gret at making a tuna bagel sandwich...and they don't look at me funny when I order extra extra mayo."}
{"text":"Better breakfast sandwiches than Timmy's and Starbucks.  Love the choice of bagels. Also, they use fresh eggs, so BONUS!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Yonge-Eglinton Centre, great go-to meal or pick-me-up snack. Bagels are on display nicely, and the staff are pretty quick preparing food. 

My fave is the cheese bagel toasted with vegetable garden cream cheese. Their cheese bagels are unlike other bagel stores bagels, the cheese is melted on top of the bagel, and sometimes if you're lucky, you'll find a nice melt glob of cheese in the centre hole.  

Their Tomato Bisque soup is also very very tasty! For food court, fast food (try saying that 5 times fast), a pretty good choice!"}
{"text":"There are many fast food franchises in the Yonge and Eglinton food court, but I'd highly recommend this sandwich shop if you are looking for a healthy and nutritious meal. They have different breakfast combos and lunch specials everyday!"}
{"text":"I love their bagels! Many mornings that I ordered from here for a bagel to go. 
The service is fast, and the ingredients are fresh, toasted bagel comes with a good size too.

Every morning they offer special as well. My personal favorite is BLT on a sesame bagel."}
{"text":"I showed up here today and waited for 20 minutes with nobody around. This placed lost about 15 customers due to having no one there. I finally gave up and left after 20 minutes.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Its a bagel place in a food court so keep expectations appropriately inline.  That said, there is a good selection of fresh bagels that is reasonably priced.  They also use fresh eggs that they crack and cook as you order which I appreciate. I've grabbed a few breakfasts on the go here on the way to work and it is a decent experience."}
