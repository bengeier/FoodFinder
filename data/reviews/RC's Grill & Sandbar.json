{"text":"A nice surprise!  The inside is not what you would expect from the outside...it's modern, and clean and amazingly nice!  The staff is good and the beer is cold!  Wings and homemade potato chips are yummy but the fried pickles are just ok.  I'll defiantly be back often!"}
{"text":"I've never been here before, but I would give it more stars if I could give it more stars I would. The food was amazing I enjoyed every bite of it. I would defiantly e coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here 4-5 times and the food was great.. About a month ago we stopped by and instantly noticed the food quality diminished significantly. New cook? Getting cheaper food to cut costs?

-wings were rubbery (possibly frozen before cooked?)
-quesadilla was sad. No lettuce or garnish included, salsa was runny and watery
-prime rib sandwich was over cooked and and the sandwich bread was stale (&they forgot the au jus sauce!)

We really had high hopes for this place. It's hard to find decent food in fort mill (is it even possible?) 

Note to owner: You were really friendly and have a great atmosphere- stop taking those short cuts when it comes to food. Please."}
{"text":"Great place my family and I enjoy going up here!! Friendly staff and sometimes even some good live music. Food is always good , love the fried mushroom with their homemade ranch dressing. 


Have noticed that they recently have had different people running the kitchen, food is still good but was much better when they first opened."}
{"text":"The best social gathering for a weekend night out..or just going fir lunch or dinner. Lunch menu is  reasonably priced with nice menu choices..I would definitly recommend it if your looking for a friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!!!! This place was great. From the atmosphere to the food this place was a hit. I will def be back!"}
