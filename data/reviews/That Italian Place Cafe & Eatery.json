{"text":"Best veal sandwich ever ( i like rapini/ garlic top)...pasta, lasagna, chicken...all good. Good service, nice clean place, parking, good food= 5"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for lunch.... wow it's super busy.  Mostly for workers on their lunch as this place is located in an industrial area.  Waited  15min for lunch and it was worth it. The veal and chicken sandwiches were huge! !! I had only half of mine and saved the other half for dinner. Quit pricey sandwiches especially when the toppings are extra. 2 sandwiches with drinks were over $20. OK for once in a while"}
{"text":"I can't believe I only recently discovered this place...had the stromboli and it was delicious - I don't think they have them all the time so you might have to call ahead. It's served with tomato sauce and cut into quarters so you can dip it. I could only eat half - but my mouth is watering right now thinking about it!

it sure would be interesting to check out their stromboli eating contest because those things are filling. They have cheese and various meats rolled up in pizza dough - so yummy but admittedly a little high on the sodium!

I have to go back to try out their pastas and other dishes."}
{"text":"I saw this on the YOu Gotta Eat here show...and man is he right! Great food and great staff. I call ahead most to the time and its always ready when I get there. 

STROMBOLI!!! if you're looking for it call ahead! Its a top seller there and it sells out!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident while doing business in Brampton. What a gem! I wish we had a place like this in Vancouver. Reasonable price, good service, kept it simple, with a true Italian atmosphere.
I wish I knew this place at the beginning of the week, not on the last day of my time there.
You are on my fav. list and I will be back!"}
{"text":"My favourite is their meatball spaghetti. I only order this and I have been there numerous times. It's the best."}
{"text":"There are not much Italian Sandwich shops in Brampton and I was lucky to find this one on Yelp. When comparing Italian Sandwiches, I set California Sandwiches as the standard. I got the veal sandwich and I was somewhat disappointed. Although the taste was amazing, the proportion was small and I still felt hungry after eating the sandwich. The worse point is that the sandwich was overpriced. The extra toppings for the sandwich each had a pricetag in which I ended up paying almost $15. I would comeback if I was desperate for and Italian sandwich, other than that, I would rather drive all the way to California Sandwiches in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that the food in the place remind's me of Nonna's cooking. I went twice this week alone to get a decent veal sandwhich.

Although i have not tried many things on the menu... the place is promising. All signs point the right way. 

They don't have the same things everyday 
Everything is made as it would in a normal kitchen (fresh, homemade comforting food)
People are awesome (they even call you by you're first name)
Was recently on that show \"You Gotta Eat Here\"
It's Italian food ... 

Worth a try"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches.  When I am in the area on business.  I always make a point to either stop in for a sandwich or have it to go.  My favorite is the veal sandwich and everyone should be warn, the sandwiches are huge and filling.  I can never finish an entire sandwich at lunch, but 1/2 size portions are not available.  The restaurants also have a nice selection of specialty coffee, and soup.  This is a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the best veal cutlet and pasta dinner here today. Everything was cooked to perfection. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I work near this place.  Fancied some pasta for lunch, so tried TIP.  Very disappointed!  I had the penne bolognese, which was absolutely swimming in oil and had very little taste.  My kingdom for some peperoncino!  An appetizer sized portion for $8, $1.50 extra for a sprinkling of parmesan (ma, che c*zzo).  The place is super busy, guess the Chrysler plant supplies them with a steady stream of customers willing to overpay.  A veal sandwich can run as much as $15 once you start adding toppings.  If they are going to charge for extras, then they should do it by weight, like at La Rose in Etobicoke.  And watch at the cash, they can overcharge."}
{"text":"This place dishes out amazing pizza. I have been here thrice and have always left happy with their pizza. The pasta was okay. The chicken in 'That Italian plate' is also fairly good.
They are a small family run business dishing out fabulous pizza by the minute in their wood fired oven. Would highly recommend them for pizza. The best we liked in Brampton so far."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. Was hoping to have the famed Stromboli, but alas, they were all out. So, instead I had a wood fired pizza with prosciutto and arugula, and it was phenomenal! Helpful, friendly and fast service, and excellent food. Highly recommended! Hope to go back for Stromboli very soon."}
{"text":"Great place for some good veal sandwiches. Gets pretty packed at lunch. Good staff. Need to relocate the cashier as its bank opposite the entrance and forming a line could be a challenge."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on TV..YOU GOTTA EAT HERE..and they weren't joking either. This place is soooooo good. I love the veals and pastas..I haven't tried the pizza yet. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Being featured on a TV show clearly got to these people's heads. Pricey for what they sell and very little customer service. I was standing in line waiting to be served and this lady - who CLEARLY saw me - just ignored me while she constantly glanced at me/my direction knowing that I was there waiting to be served. Havent you heard that you're supposed to take care of the line up/customers first before doing whatever it is you needed to do??? Clearly wasn't trained properly. Ended up walking away and ordering food somewhere else as she was taking too long and obviously her sweet time doing trivial things. Such a shame as my husband is a big fan of this place. Not anymore."}
{"text":"Ok, something happened today which totally   improved my impression of the place, and that is: pizza. They've added a genuine brick, wood-burning Neapolitan style oven. They've made it a big deal since half their menu is now pizza. It's the real deal 900 degrees, ready in a couple minutes type pizza that you need to eat within a few minutes to appreciate. 

My pizza had basil, andouille sausage and broken meatballs along with tasty marinara and cheese. Delicious, and only critique would be that it could have a little more meat. Great crust as well.

The pizza is nearly a '5', but mixed experiences with sandwiches and pasta along with cost leave it overall at a '4'. Still, I'd recommend the pizza with no reservation. I doubt anyone else in Brampton is doing it this way, and probably not many in the GTA for that matter."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place. My wife and I had heard wonderful things about the food here so we stopped in for lunch. We got one of their sandwiches and a pizza. We were quite disappointed on both of them. They were quite bland and have not much flavour. The sizes were fairly small, and for almost $30 it wasn't worth it. I'm giving it 2 stars because it was a nice place in terms of atmosphere and the food was fresh, but my advice would be go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I saw this place on \"you gotta eat here\"
Found out you dont gotta eat here.
had the veal, it was just ok.  All the hype for an average eatery was a bit more than i could handle today.  I wanted wow, i got OK.  However the price is good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. 2 chicken sandwichs a brio and a coffee. 32.00 bucks ??? WOWSERS!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is phenomenal! When we asked some locals about a good pizza a joint in the area they replied that would be tough. Found this place on Yelp and man were we blessed!
Lots of pizzas to choose from, we ordered several, I can't even remember the names. However, the sauce was great, the dough spot on, and the toppings were fresh and wonderful.
Unfortunately the Stromboli was sold out, we really wanted to try it. Everyone was super friendly and they also had a great selection of drinks (non-alcoholic). 
Give this place a go without hesitation!"}
{"text":"When we scheduled a team lunch for my visit to Brampton and wrote 'That Italian Place' on the meeting invite, everyone questioned what that particular restaurant was, thinking that it was their go to spot. You know when you go somewhere so often that you use the coined phrase \"oh we're going to that place\". However, the restaurant really is called That Italian Place and after eating here, you will start referring to it as THAT Italian place, while making it a favorite go to spot because it really is THAT GOOD.  

Visiting from NY, I was told Brampton had very limited food options, so I wasn't really expecting much. After a quick Yelp search, I stumbled and settled upon here as I'm always in the mood for pasta / pizza / sandwiches. It's a fairly small venue, with probably 8 tables max (the tables can seat 6 / you can always combine tables), so do plan to arrive before 12:15 to snag one / avoid the crowd. Trust me, once it hits 12:15, it's a mad house! Also, claim your territory before you order because this place is kind of like casual \"fast food\", where you order at the counter and then they'll bring you your order; you'll also want to claim your territory because for a small spot, the menu is really extensive and everything sounds amazing, so you will have a hard deciding as well. 

They ran out of the prosciutto Stromboli that I wanted (it was only 12 pm too :(!), so I went with the pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was AMAZING - definitely would be NY quality as it was a great thin crusted pizza. The crusts were also chewy, which I love in pizzas. My coworkers went with the veal sandwiches which were huge! I had 1/4 of one - it was okay compared to my pizza. I love how they let you customize the sandwich with toppings (i.e. broccoli rabe). Highly highly recommend you go with one of the pizzas instead! 

Prices are really affordable for the quality and quantity you get - pizzas range from $12-14, while sandwiches are around $8. If I worked in Brampton, this would be my Italian place."}
{"text":"We went to this place with much anticipation...knowing it was featured on the food networks and such we went there wanting to be impressed. I ordered a penne bolognese...can't say I was impressed. It was barely memorable. Though, i was there in a bit of a rush, I barely remember any redeeming factors or taste. I however remembered looking over to the table next to me and regretting not ordering the massively colorful fresh salad. Perhaps, I will give this place a second try before writing it completely off, hopefully they aim to impress next time. We didn't see any dessert selections or drinks, which as a bit disappointing. Will post an updated impression and review on a later date."}
{"text":"we saw it on \"You got to eat here\"
and it didn't disappoint
everything was great!!
we will be going back"}
{"text":"I can actually say this is one of the best Italian restaurants I've had when it comes to sandwiches!

I believe the place is family owned. You walk in and it feels like you're walking in a big family get together. Everyone is so nice and friendly. The restaurant is divided into two areas. When you walk into the restaurant the right area is where you can purchase all your Italian items (pasta, home made sauces I believe etc) and then the left side is the dinning area. 

My coworker and I had a veal sandwich with jalapeños and the sandwich was huge. Half the sandwich literally filled us up. Everyone should def try this place out. Including their home made desserts! Yum. The price is slightly pricey but I believe it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Checked this place after I saw it feature in \"you gotta eat here\" and to be honest, wasn't highly impressed. The service wasn't bad, I was taken care of pretty quickly but the quality of food was pretty average. I was serviced semi warm food which I had to send it back to get it warmed. The girl at the front felt sorry about it and brought back my order warm and fresh. Overall a low key experience."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, pastas, and also a great espresso bar.  Friendly service too.

I come here every once in awhile and this place is definitely as good as it gets if you're up for fast Italian food.  Portion sizes are nice and large.  \"You get what you pay for\" and I say this in a positive way."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! One of the best pizzas I ever had...the salad was delicious, all the ingredients were fresh. The service was quick and friendly staff. 100% highly recommendable!"}
{"text":"So if you live in Brampton and have not heard of this place or not been to this place then please please please crawl out from where you have been hiding and try this place RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!  I can go on for ever about the food here.  I have been here MANY MANY times and have never left disappointed.  From a veal sandwich to pasta to Italian deli ALL is amazing.  I do have to tell you about my most recent experience.  They now do stone oven pizza.  I was kind of in rush so I asked how long it would take.  The oven cooks the pizza at 800 degrees so it takes 90 seconds WOW it takes longer to prep the pizza then to cook it.  It was cooked to perfection.

Oh and this place was on the food networks You Gotta Eat Here and I have to back them up and say \"YOU GOTTA EAT HERE\""}
{"text":"Best Pizzeria in Brampton! The closest to a real Italian oven baked pizza you can get."}
{"text":"Besides NYC, which is an entirely different breed of pizza, this is hands down the best wood-fired pizza we've had. It's a little pricey, $75 for lunch for 4, but it's really worth it. Service is extremely fast and ingredients are extremely fresh. The dough is the show stopper! Try this place..try it now and if you live nearby..try it often :)"}
{"text":"This place is always busy, and I don't think it's purely because they were featured on You Gotta Eat Here! When you walk in, it seems like there's a lot more local workers and residents dining in than \"foodies\" looking to cross a popular restaurant off a list. I'd say this is a major contributor to the friendly neighbourhood vibe that the restaurant gives off.

TIP has a wide variety of Italian cuisine, including pastas, pizzas, and sandwiches. I've tried many of their sandwiches and pizzas, but have yet to try their pasta. I always go back to their veal sandwich - it's delicious. The toppings are all a la carte, so expect to spend anywhere between $10-20 on your meal.

Upon entering, you file into a single line for both dine-in and takeout orders, so if you want to beat the lunch rush, I'd try to get in before 12 or after 1pm. Not sure how rush hour affects their dinner schedule but I'd expect more of the same.

Believe the hype with TIP, it's the real deal."}
{"text":"Oh I love love love this place. Pizzas are so delicious and ingredients always fresh. I come here for the desserts too and they are to die for. I will definitely keep coming back here. Sometimes at peak times you might have a hard time finding a seat but other than that it's a fantastic place to eat and reasonably priced as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We only visited That Italian Place once during an extremely busy lunch period for pizza and a sandwich that, while good, didn't quite seem worth the wait or the price. There's no denying that the food is authentic Italian, but in many respects doesn't differ much than most other Italian hot tables."}
{"text":"For the price and serving size it's not worth it. 17 bucks for 2 dollars worth of pasta and a stale bun."}
{"text":"Great food. Clean. Lots of parking. Friendly service. The food is a little pricy but it is worth it because it's delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent veal and chicken sandwiches.
Lots of seats. Friendly staff.
Only negatives, could use a few more employees, slow. Cash is right at the front entrance, need to use other door to allow a line to form. They have the space, clogged at the entrance."}
{"text":"Not so sure why people are so enamored with this place.  See a place on TV, then suddenly it must be awesome! 

Not so much.

It's OK.  Pretty run of the mill fare, at extremely high prices.  The place is an absolute zoo ever since it was on TV but I just don't get the hype.  A \"small\" pasta in tomato sauce is a whopping $8, then they have the nerve to charge an extra $1.50 when they ask you \"do you want cheese on it?\"

Who the hell would say no to that question, and why isn't it built into the price?  Parmesan is expensive but it's not THAT expensive, just strikes me as greedy and a slap in the face.

They *NEVER* have the more labor-intensive stuff that people want to try, like Stromboli or Porchetta, even though their website boasts about it.  They say \"oh sorry, we're sold out\" but we know damn well they never had it to begin with, or made such a tiny portion of it that it's not nearly enough for their customers.  Then once you are already in their shop, and they're out of everything good, you have to settle for their overpriced pasta and sandwiches.  Interesting tactic, but all it does is make me want to tell people to not bother with the place.

Will give it one or two more shots, and will adjust my review to be more positive if something changes.  And if there is no porchetta to be found, or stromboli, or any of the stuff they show on their menu yet NEVER have in stock, then this 2 star review sticks."}
{"text":"Tried it after seeing this place featured on TV I have tried this place a few times
Pros:
Portions are HUGE
Staff is friendly
Pasta is decent (love the mac and cheese)
The stromboli

Cons:
Food selection.  Certain items, they only make a few.  And once sold out, they are done.
The worst part is that most people come here for the Stomboli that we all seen on TV.  And it's rarely there.


Sandwiches aren't made fresh.

When you go and they are missing most things you are forced to order something else (well your there you might as well eat)"}
{"text":"So I've been to this ace before and the food was ok. The pizza is actually very good. It looks like they recently expanded the sitting area. The pricing is a bit high. The major problem is the staff. The red head girl that eats while working the cash is rude and slow. Must be related because she would be gone a long time ago if I was in charge. Then the other server cut her finger and was licking her finger then handling food. So needless to say I ended up walking out. I won't be going back any time soon. The service is the kind of thing that can kill a place. The food has lots of potential. And the poor guys in the back look like they just want to put out some good food but the girls need to go."}
{"text":"I (Karn) came here PUMPED!! I had just watched the \"You Gotta Eat Here\" episode and I knew exactly what I was going to order --- A STROMBOLI! Neetu had the wooden oven pizzas on her mind.

When we got there I was puzzled because there was no Stromboli on the menu. So I asked the  employee about it, she shrugged it off and said they were sold out. I've always heard that you double down on your skills and what you're good at. If your place is known for strombolis, you should never be sold out --- either way, really disappointed in that. It was about 6PM and people were coming in for their dinners, no strombolis were had that night.

I ordered the Porchetta Sandwich and an italian beer.
Neetu ordered the quattro frommagio (four cheese) pizza.

The meat in the sandwich was delicious, a really nice cut of pork. The bread was a bit tough to eat and didn't compliment the meat much. You can't have a tender piece of meat and a tough sandwich, c'mon!

The quattro frommagio pizza was disappointing, but this is mainly our fault. It was loaded with blue cheese, and we don't like blue cheese. In our review video (see at bottom of review), neetu compared it to eating a pack of salt ---- it was really salty. The dough base and crust was perfect though, really fluffy and soft...loved that! 

We came out paying $38, and with a bitter taste in our mouth :P

We would come back and try another pizza, and hopefully----just hopefully---there will be some damn stromboli left.

{"text":"Great find. Good food
Enjoyed a fantastic pizza.  (Ask for it to be well done)

Served hot and fast

Veal sandwich was good too. Could have used a bit more sauce and it would have been great

Caesar Salad was fantastic!

Super friendly service. Owner greeted us personally from the back which was a nice touch. 

I would come back."}
{"text":"Quality food, laid back atmosphere.  Order at the counter and food is delivered to your table.   Bottled pop, water and juice are available in a self-serve fridge.  There's a daily pasta and sandwich.  I've always ordered pizza and I haven't been disappointed.  Crust and sauce are delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a God send. In a world of fake Italian food, this is the real deal. No fancy, phony, \"Italian-inspired\" cuisine, just the authentic stuff that delivers the pounds.
Whether it's the to die for Stromboli or the pasta of the day, all is amazing and made the way real Italians know.
I had the Stromboli again (can't resist). I only wish I had a bigger stomach so I could eat more.
Prices are amazingly affordable for food this good. You will not find Italian food like this anywhere west of Woodbridge or anywhere else in Canada.
I live in Halifax and real Italian restaurants don't exist. Every time I return to Toronto area I go out of my way to go here.
You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on you've gotta eat here and it looked interesting but honestly I wasn't impressed. I had the classic veal sandwich and it was okay. Nothing to really brag about. They do change their menu everyday so if there is something that you are craving make sure you call first and see if they have it."}
{"text":"We all judge food by the way it looks. I saw the pictures posted by yelpers and didn't have too much expectations. I ended up ordering the Italian plate dinner. It comes with one protein, one pasta and two veggie dishes. I ordered veal, penne, grilled eggplant and roasted peppers. The plate didn't seem appetizing at all but oh my, was it the best pasta sauce I have ever tasted. Fresh tomatoes were sweet and tangy; pasta cooked perfectly; the veal was super tender. I should come back to try the Stromboli!"}
{"text":"After seeing the ep of \"You Gotta Eat Here\", I guess I sorta had to eat here??

So on a recent jaunt to B-town, I decided to stop by here to see what the hype was all about.  To be honest, I was a bit disappointed for the following reasons:

1.  NO STROMBOLI! - As per the show ep where the host stuffs his face with this every Kosher's-worst-nightmare of a sandwich, I order only to find out that they don't have this everyday.  :(  Next!

2.  No gnocchi! - Coming off my Portland Built To Grill-high, I was informed that they also didn't have this on the menu, contrary to their paper menu.

3.  Baked goods aren't made in-house.  They're brought it.  I tried a marshmallow-topped brownie and it was hard, waaay too sweet, & just not good.  Who knows how long they've been sitting in that fridge!  I think instead of trying to cover all their bases with baked goods/coffee/whatnot, they should just focus on their strengths, homemade pastas/sandwiches.

Onto the good stuff...

Steak Sandwich was solid, but at $7.75 (naked with just barely any sauce) for a regular, kaiser-sized sandwich PLUS $1 for additional toppings was a bit much, I think.  It was good, but nothing better than what you can find at a good, Italian bakery for like ~$6 with free toppings!

Curly Mac w/ Pomodoro Sauce - $8 for lunch portion with 1 meatball.  Sauce was definitely fresh, with that lovely, bright orangey-red hue.  Curly Mac was probably from dry pasta, but it was cooked to perfection, al dente!  Portion was good for 2ppl/1 BIG EATER.  Meatball was awhight, but it seemed to have a good portion of filler, e.g. breadcrumbs.

Girl that I dealt with answered all my questions, to the point which I appreciated.

Overall, it's obviously fresher, but a step up from what you would get at a reputable Italian bakery but higher prices."}
{"text":"Not disappointed! Came for pizza but they ran out of dough. Ordered the meatball panini and sausage panino, rice ball pearl appetizer, and mixed greens. Delicious!! Everything was fresh, hot if necessary, and flavourful. Definitely eat here."}
{"text":"The wood oven pizza is to die for! Get the Bloke or bloak ( I can't remember the spelling as I was too into the food)

The 2 brother/owners are hilarious and super friendly along with the staff at the front 

The chicken parm sandwich is unbelievable but I gotta warn you, you get what you wish for when you ask for your sandwich spicy! 

It's a bit pricey but absolutely worth every penny

They have these ghost peppers you can ask for on the side for the adventurous type 

And if your hungry but wanna be conscious, the chicken ceaser, light dressing is a great Choice and big serving"}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 4/5
Heard some good things about That Italian Place Cafe & Eatery, took the drive from Oakville to Brampton to try it. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I especially enjoyed their pizza. Definitely will come back next time I'm in the area to try other menu items.

Food: 4/5
I tried the Italian Plate, which comes with your choice of veal, chicken or sausage, penne Pomodoro, and your choice of 2 veggies (I had roasted red peppers and mushrooms). The pasta and sauce was average, but the veal was very good, great exterior crunch and the flavour was good.

I tried a few of their pizzas, all of which were delicious. The crust is thin crust, with the perfect crunch, and made in a wood burning oven.

The pasta and pizza, plus two bottled drinks came to about $40.

Service: 4/5
Service is great, very friendly. Throughout my time dining in, I could hear the workers conversing with customers, laughing and having a good time. They were very patient with me, as I was having a hard time to deciding what to have. And were willing to help make recommendations as to what I should try.

Atmosphere: 4/5
Ambiance is casual, with a mix of personal and communal seating. You order and pay at the counter first, and the food is brought out to your table. Some of the tables were left dirty, otherwise the decor is nice.

Tips & Recommendations:
-Try the pizza!
-Plenty of parking in the plaza"}
{"text":"This olace is busy!! If ordering during your lunch time... call ahead and place your order.  
Daily lunch specials and their signature pizza.  You can custom your own also.
A little pricey but minimal italian eateries in Brampton... and this place is a good one."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after all the raves from yelp. 
I'll have to say I was pleasently surprised.
I had the bolongese pasta and veal on a bun w mushrooms onions and cheese. 
The pasta wasn't anything special, but obviously tasted great.
But the veal was to die for.
So sweet and perfectly cooked.
The only thing I'd say this place is quite pricey as others mentioned you hve to pay separately for all the toppings and they never seem to hve stromboli . Which I'm sure is a huge hit."}
{"text":"The food is good, however if you want the fancy stuff you saw on \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" you're pretty much outta luck.  I've been here three times and I ask for the Stromboli, and I have yet to get it.  Having been told come back on Friday.  I came back on a Friday another time and was told they are sold out, in the middle of the day.  If you came for dinner on a Friday don't even bother asking, if they do have them, some jackass will buy 10 of them and you're outta luck.  

But I digress.  Of the food that I have tried, I can say that it is good, but nothing special.  The chicken sandwich was ok and the \"pizzaboli\" was decent, but for the dollar amount that they charge, I could have just went to California Sandwiches instead to get a good sandwich for cheaper, and CS is expesive in my opinion.  

TIP's sauce is great however, and the meatballs are very tasty, but that's the highlight of what I have tried thus far.

I'd go back, but only cause I want to try that dodo bird of a stromboli, and only when I feel like shelling out $50 for a meal for the wife and I."}
{"text":"Coworkers brought me here for lunch today and oh man, is it ever yummy!

I'm not usually attracted to dine at standard Italian restaurants. It just isn't something I crave in a general sense. But give me the opportunity for fresh and delicious thin crust pizza, I will choose that every time. 

I chose the Gorg and Shrooms pizza, which had just the right balance of gorgonzola flavour and olive/mushroom ratio. Not heavily topped, but not skimpy either. I didn't have any red onions to speak of, as listed on the menu, but I found the pizza did not need them. I also scoffed a bit of my friend's extra pomodoro sauce to dip my crust in. Yum! You can tell that is house made.

As previous Yelpers have said, very busy place. We got there for 11:30, so we beat the rush. When we were leaving at 12:15, the restaurant was pretty slammed."}
{"text":"I came here with a co-worker for lunch today. He raved about the wood burning oven and how good the pizza was. We arrived prior to 12:00 pm since, in my co-workers experience, the restaurant is very busy at lunch. After a small wait time, we ordered the Gorgo Shroom pizza. This pizza comes with Gorgonzola cheese, mushrooms, red onions and black olives. Finding a seat wasn't difficult for us, but by about 12:15, there was no longer any seats available, so I'm glad we arrived early.

The pizza arrived and after taking a photo (for my review), we dug in. Thin crispy crust, mushrooms and the bite of the salty olives are a delicious combination. This pizza puts to shame all the \"chain\" pizzas, they cannot compare to the flavours of not just the ingredients, but the crust itself. 

The restaurant is clean, bright and the shelves are stocked with lots of items you buy for home. From pastas to olive oils.

The staff are friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. I plan on returning again and can't wait to try another pizza or maybe a pasta."}
{"text":"Good comfort food . Tasty pizzas and sandwiches. We tried the cookies for dessert- wasn't a fan . Would skip the cookies ."}
{"text":"After work i decided to venture over to that italian place to taste the truth. I have been meaning to come here because my friend swears they have an amazing veal sandwich.I would have to agree! 
  
That Italian place is located in a little plaza on the side of Brampton that I never visit. When I walked in I noticed it was pretty busy and I saw an exchanged of nods and smiles between the chef and some customers which lead me to believe they were regulars. The line moved very quickly and the wait time was less than ten minutes. A red headed cashier took my order who was very friendly and recommended the mozzarella and mushrooms to accompany my veal sandwich as I didn't know what to choose. I also ordered a mixed berry Canolli and  a brio to wash it all down. While I waited for my food I walked around and noticed the small section of Italian groceries and various kinds of bottled drinks and gelato. The place is very clean and the ac definitely works.

My Canolli was delicious and bigger than most canollis. The mixed berries was a nice twist to the traditional filling somewhat reminiscent of strawberry ice cream but not as Sweet. My veal sandwich was obviously made with love. Decent portion of meat. Cheesy mozzarella, delicious sauce and meaty mushrooms.

 My only complaint is the price. 7.75 a sandwich +1.00 a topping and 1.50 for cheese is somewhat pricey in my book. My entire meal came to a bit over 17. I guess I could omit the cannoli and it would have been 15 for a sandwich and a drink but to me those prices are similar to California sandwich (another place that sells a great veal sandwich) which I don't visit often because I think it's pricey. I guess it depends on who your target demographic is but as a full time student I don't have 17 bucks to spend regularly on a meal. I noticed a lot of business professionals there perhaps on break and maybe that's in their price range. I would suggest a lunch time student meal of maybe a sandwich+ 2 toppings + canned pop for 8 bucks. It just seems more reasonable. But I'm still curious to try other items on the menu."}
