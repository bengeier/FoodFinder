{"text":"I so enjoy Matt's Subs Shack's slow cooked beef dinner covered in brown rich gravy between sliced homemade italian bread then placed upon a pile of fries...big enough to share..yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Got fish sandwich and pizza. Very good and very reasonably priced. The sauce on their pizza is excellent. I live a mile away from this place and I didn't even know it existed. Found it accidentally. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A must visit if in area for anything.. Great food at a great price. try a hoagie. pizza etc"}
{"text":"Come on down to Matt's Sub Shack! Order to go or get it delivered. Not only are you supporting a small business, but Matt is one hell of a great guy and he cares about his customer and will go above and beyond if there is ever an issue. He offers discounts for Fire, EMS, Police, and Military which he doesn't have to but he believes it's the right thing to do. The pizza is amazing and the food is to die for. He works his tail off to make sure he provides the upstanding quality in all his food. YUMMY!!! I love it!"}
{"text":"very good food. Matt makes his own bread for the hoagie. really good prices. they take a lot of pride in what they do. they get supplies from Penn mac so you know it's all top notch. if this place we're in the city he would already have multiple locations. really friendly.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"My sandwich was HUGE and really quite tasty! Service was super friendly and quick for there only being one person working (I assume Matt, but I could be wrong). Easily worth going out of your way, and much higher quality than you'd get at a chain. A+!"}
