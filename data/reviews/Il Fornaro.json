{"text":"We ordered a pizza and a risotto from here. We live about a ten-fifteen minute drive. Paid online, including a $2 service charge for delivery. There was no option given to tip the delivery person. The delivery guy harrassed us for a tip, to the point that for some ridiculous reason (hunger, I guess) we actually searched around for change even though we had none in our wallets. The delivery guy refused to leave without a tip. To make matters worse, our dog got loose and because the guy hadn't closed the gate, she escaped. She could have run into the street and been killed. This guy stayed on our stoop for ten minutes badgering us for a tip. We managed to find about $0.70. I showed it to him and said, \"This is all we got.\" He ignored that and continued to go on about how we had to tip him. I offered to call the restaurant and have them charge my card over the phone (which I shouldn't have done because this guy was totally in the wrong), but he mumbled some stuff about how it didn't matter. Yet he refused to leave! I ended up having to say, \"Look, we don't have a car. I am not going to go out to a bank machine, make change, and come back to tip you.\" After which he grabbed what little change we had - less than a dollar in bruss! - and left in a massive huff, muttering some obscenities. I did call the restaurant to complain, but it's not like anything could really be done at this point. After all that, our pizza was cold and the risotto over cooked. Worst $53.00 ever spent."}
{"text":"After getting a glass of water slammed down in front of me, waited 15 minutes to be asked what I wanted, the time during which the guy behind me, who came in after I did, ordered and was served.  Borderline rude servers.  Uninspired italian food menu, I ordered steak and pasta.  Both were ok, but not 30 bucks ok.  Finally, though I ate, I lost a few pounds due to sweating -- air conditioning was non existent.  Not going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst service ever and the food was mediocre. The waitress was not happy that my party of 7 walked in.  We weren't allowed to order from their regular menu as winterlicious was on.  I ordered the osso bucco with pasta which took half an hour to arrive.  When the food finally came the pasta was cold and the osso bucco was way too salty.  One girl in our party told the waitress that she could not eat anything with black pepper in her food due to an intolerance.  Her plate came sprinkled with pepper and was unable to eat it.  The waitress ended up charging her for the whole meal explaining that it was not their fault that she could not have pepper.  It took one of us to get the manager, she couldn't even do that when we asked.  I will definitely not be coming back and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and the food was very bland. Soup had no flavour... Ravioli was very salty. Only thing that was okay was the tiramisu. Won't order from here again though."}
{"text":"Il Fornaro is a gem.   The first time I went was during Summerlicious and the prix fixe menu certainly helped sell the value of the dinner. I have returned since and the food is consistently fantastic, but I do find it a bit of a stretch financially without the prix fixe option.   Try the ceaser salad, and any of the pasta dishes! I was disappointed with the risotto, but otherwise I have always been impressed.   The service is fantastic! It is relaxed enough to be romantic, but when one course ends they are ready to serve you the next course, which is refreshing."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious lunch - great atmosphere and decor. Air conditioning kept us nice cool.  Food was good, specifically the pizza which was made in a wood burning oven, really delicious.  Service was great. Overall, excellent meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"We came here because our favourite pizza places in the neighbourhood were closed (Monday).    Il Fornaro's pizzas are a big disappointment, they advertise and have an a actual pizza oven  but our pizzas didn't come out of that oven, Perhaps because it's Monday it stays off.    Their other dishes might be better, who knows, but the quality of the pizza was below anything else you can imagine.    Service was great, place was very clean, but the food just not worth coming back."}
{"text":"\"An Italian classic that shames its heritage with mediocre food and abysmal service\"  This well established Italian restaurant on the Northern end of tony Avenue Road represents the very worst example of the dining/hospitality business. From atrocious service to the mediocre food, it's surprising to me as to why they remain in business. Simply because in a city where at least 15% of the population is of Italian heritage there are numerous other places to choose from that do a superb job in representing this great world cuisine. Please read my review of L'Unita as a fine example of a destination worthy Italian, also on Avenue Road.   So why did I, who is a believer in and regular contributor to Yelp, choose it and subject my friends and partner to it? Well, we were in a hurry, the location convenient, and on the last count which I'm loath to admit and beg their forgiveness: I didn't read the Yelp reviews. Had I had done so it would be crystal clear as to why this is a place to avoid, Groupon, coupons or even Winter/Summerlicious notwithstanding.  The service we received from start to finish wouldn't have been tolerated in a culinary school from a student who was on the very first day of their apprenticeship.  When we arrived I was asked if we had made reservations, we did. Our server, however, did not bother to verify it on the restaurants' online system, which resulted in my receiving an email the next day from the online booking service Bookenda inquiring as to why we missed our reservation.   Our server's uncaring and blasé attitude continued in his inability to correctly communicate a fellow diners simple request to the kitchen. \"Please substitute potatoes for extra vegetables\". Her grilled chicken breast ($21) arrived seriously over-cooked and with the unwanted potatoes. When questioned about them our server replied: \"this dish comes with it!\" When the same diner asked for her fork to be replaced, he brought another holding it by the tines. The waiter stretched his arm over diners' plates to pour water, with condensation from the outside of the stainless steel pitcher landing directly onto our plates.   My Chicken Marsala ($23) tasted only faintly of its namesake and the sauce's viscosity was far more like a watery broth. It lacked any vegetables but the plate was piled high with two large pieces of breast meat and pasta.   The Gnocchi ($17) served with Gorgonzola Cheese, Spinach, sat in a flavourful and hearty sauce. This well-executed dish was nearly ruined by our servers' overabundant sprinkling of very salty parmesan which was infinitely inferior to Kraft's.   The only outstanding dish, perhaps because only minimal input by the kitchen was needed, was their iteration of Caprese Salad ($12) made more appealing with the use of Kumato Tomatoes, a silky buffalo mozzarella, an excellent extra virgin olive oil and garnished with a delicious balsamic reduction.  Their 10 oz Black Angus steak ($27) with caramelized onions and red wine juice was beautifully done.   It was unanimous amongst our table that dessert and coffees were out of the question. All of us were looking forward to putting this meal behind us as quickly as the bill could be settled.   Sadly, Instead of using the marketing advantage of Summerlicious to grow their business, Il Fornaro management chose to reveal their mediocre culinary standard."}
{"text":"My overall experience was OK. I say that because the service was VERY slow and there were only 2 other tables in the entire place. The service was good. But it took a very long time to get our mains. Now the food, it was good. Standard Italian fare that is great for families that have a lot of time. The portion sizes are very good. The chicken Marsala was good, but the chicken could have been pounded. They were big chicken breasts that did not absorb the sauce. The lasagna was very good. A decent local joint."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service.  My second stop for Summerlicious 2013 took me to this Italian restaurant, after looking at the prix fixe menu with the combination of looking at reviews here. My party of five arrived at 6:30pm and were seated immediately and served cold water.  I ordered the following from the prix fixe menu: - Caesar salad - Penne Cacciatore - Cheese cake  The menu also came with flatbread as a starter, in which I did the usual Italian way of eating by dipping some extra virgin olive oil. Mmm, not too hard of a texture unlike Hot House Café yesterday!  The caesar salad was nothing special, and I was satisfied enough with it. Everyone else ordered the baby argula salad and seemed to love it...maybe I should've ordered that instead. The penne cacciatore was picture perfect, with the exception of the rose sauce, which I felt was slightly too watered for me as there wasn't that pungent taste that came after having the pasta. Finally, the cheesecake was very good, again I was satisfied enough with it to have no complaints about it.  My relatives enjoyed the salmon filet (fish of the day), veal marsala, and veal chop, and were all satisfied, with the exception of one who argued the veal chop was too dry for her. I also had a small sample of the tartuffo ice cream, which had quite unique of a taste, however I didn't like the red (strawberry?) portion very much.  Service was fantastic, and to my huge surprise, very quick for an Italian restaurant. We were out the door by 7:35pm, and I had my car parked till 8:30pm!  I didn't have a look at their actual menu to see if it's as much of a value as this. If so, I definitely recommend this place for people living around the area."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last minute. They didn't have a lot of notice that the 10 of was were showing up but we were welcomed anyway. It was a birthday dinner. Our server, Al was fantastic and really helped make the night fun. Food was outstanding and a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious on Saturday night.  Overall I liked the atmosphere and the food was ok.  My issue was this place has NO A/C and considering the temperatures we're having these day, it made our stay quite uncomfortable.  Didn't help that the waiter sat us in the corner near the stove where they make the pizzas at the front.   I think they should have more servers to accommodate the amount of customers they have.  Our was an older gentleman and he was running around like a chicken with no head.  We had to flag him down to get the bill.   The food was good - though I've had better. Presentation wasn't the best and the Caesar Salad was nothing special (a little too overdone).   I probably wouldn't come here again because I've just had better Italian food else where."}
{"text":"After previous decent experiences at Il Fornaro about a decade ago, I decided to visit again this last weekend while in the area. We were welcomed by an unpleasant exchange in front of the restaurant where a waiter was having words with someone and greeted us with a stern \"can I help you?\" and led us to a table in the back of the restaurant on uncomfortable chairs. Sporting a sore back, I quickly eyed much more comfortable chairs closer to the front of the restaurant at empty tables but said nothing given it seemed we were being put in our place. Also noticed when we walked in were an unused bar and the wood burning oven bricked. What of the wood oven pizza that the store front advertises? Very little staff in sight, the two waiters for five or six tables were doing multiple duties- greeter at the door, bartender, barista, security, and waiting tables. Given so few tables, it made little sense why food took so long to come out of the kitchen. The breadsticks other reviewers mentioned and provided pictures of are gone, in is room temperature sliced dry white bread which made no sense with olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table. A salad took quite a while to arrive, was a poor portion, and needed seasoning badly. I was informed by my fellow dinner that on a trip to the wc she saw the tomato and cheese from said salad were left sitting out in the kitchen long after they were used to prepare it. Clearly there's no work ethic here. Noticeable during another lengthy wait for our mains, an owner or manager was sitting at a makeshift office, open on the other side of a partition from the dining room, talking loudly on a phone. We could hear our server yelling at the kitchen for the length of time it was taking to prepare food. One thing definitely missing from an Italian restaurant were sounds and smells from the kitchen- no herbs or garlic or wood burning. Given how clearly we could hear the workings from our seats, something was definitely amiss. Now at three tables remaining, mains arrived at long last. Flavours of herbs and garlic were clearly missing, seemingly only the ingredients listed on the menu were to be used in any dish. However, what was served was perfectly cooked and ingredients stood out on their own. Service and food are top notch for what they're being given to work with, but that doesn't appear to be much. I imagine this place will suffer a fate similar to its former neighbouring seafood restaurant with For Lease signs in the window in the near future if this continues."}
{"text":"I find it shocking that there are so few reviews about this place.  I was first introduced to this place by my fiancee and soon to be wife (they are the same person). When I first laid eyes on it I was under the impression I was going to be severely let down as I saw it from behind and it didnt make a great impression.   Then we walked around the block to the front of the building and the restaurant did a full 180 as it looked so rustic and authentic as we stepped into a whole new place that I didn't know existed at all. We were greeted with smiles and led to our table to sit and order our meal. We were greeted by John who took great care of us for the entirety of our meal. He was courteous to make sure allergies were not triggered and kept checking in on us regularly.  I ordered the Arugula salad, Mediterranean Pizza and had the Tiramisu for dessert.  I could write a whole review about this Tiramisu. But I don't have the time. All I can say is that it is a 35 year old recipe and it is mind blowing. I wanted to take another piece home but we didnt have time. Now I just dream about it.  Price Fixe for Summerlicious for 2012 is $25. Well worth it. Definitely making my way here again soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Il Fornaro this past Friday night for dinner. We've gone there in the past and we've liked it. The decor reminds me of an old rustic Italian Villa. It wasn't too busy where the servers were rushing around.   We ordered from the fixed price menu -  I ordered the minestrone soup, The Meat Amore pizza, and tiramisu for dessert. My girlfriend ordered the Caesar Salad, the tilapia and chocolate cake for dessert.   Our apps came, and I found my soup to be oily. You know it can't be good when you see oil droplets floating. Her Caesar salad was nothing special - laced with dressing - almost completely saturated.   The waiter came back to take our plates away when we were done and a few minutes later, my pizza arrived. He placed the pizza on the table and left. I was thinking that my girlfriend's dinner should be arriving soon, but after 8 minutes of my pizza sitting and getting cold, still no dinner for her showing up. The waiter was making himself very busy serving other tables. When he came by with the pitcher of water, he told us that the fish would be another 2 mins. I told him I wasn't starting to eat until her dinner arrived. He offered to take my pizza away to reheat it. 4-5 mins later, the fish came. We never really got an explanation as to why it took so long. Total time 15 mins until her food arrived. Totally pathetic and all without an explanation.  When her fish arrived, it was saturated with the sauce ... almost to a point to cover up a mistake or blemish. To me it seemed a little undercooked or cooked from frozen. It was soggy and unseasoned.   When my pizza came back the crust was dry (probably because of overcooking) and looked very oily on the top. Usually fresh meat ingredients don't produce that much oil/grease.   During the time we were eating, the waiter never came back to refill our water glasses.  It was also an impossible task for the waiter to come by to see if everything was fine. We were never asked how our dinner was.  When he did come back, after we had completed our meals (my girlfriend left 3/4 of her fish), he offered dessert. We just took it to go.  I asked for the bill and I paid it.   To add insult to injury, the waiter never thanked us for our business.  He just plunked the bill on the table.   As we walked out, we may of just been invisible because all the staff at the front of the restaurant never thanked us for coming either.   We won't be going back for substandard food and extremely poor service. I'd rather take my hard earned money elsewhere for more attentive service and better quality food."}
{"text":"I have this weakness for Prix Fixe Menu... I just could not forgo a good deal.   I have to say Il Fornaro has the most extensive menu I ever see in an Italian restaurant... There are over 15 main entrees one can choose from including pasta, meat, fish and pizzas.  Prix Fixe Menu ($25)  - Baby Arugula Salad (tons of goat cheese) - Veal Chop (over cooked and dry but with tons of veggie on the side) - Tiramisu (creamy and tasty)  and   - Caesar Salad (fresh and crispy with the right amount of dressing) - Linguine Pescatore (tons of seafood, huge scallops!!!) - Chocolate Cake (meh...skip!!)  A good value for $25, but without the prix fixe then this place would definitely be a 2 star.  Services was efficient but cold. We got all our food fast and hot... but no one really care to come to ask us if everything is ok? The waiter just left the bill on our table when he served us the dessert... that 's really odd in a restaurant.... we felt like he was trying to get rid of us?!  Il Fornaro serves OK food at a great price point but I don't know if I would come back because the services here just not what I expected...."}
