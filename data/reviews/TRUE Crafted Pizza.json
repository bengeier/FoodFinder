{"text":"Coming from the NYC area originally I am always looking for great pizza. A bit strange to order and pay for your pizza before you sit down but the pizza is the best we have found so far in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem in Ballantyne.  My family has eaten there multiple times, and we have never been disappointed.  They use fresh, quality ingredients,  and they combine interesting flavors.  The pizza is delicious, and their side salad is big enough to share and is a great value.  In addition, their children's menu has many options and is fresh and delicious.  The service is fabulous -- everyone is friendly, and they pro-actively approach customers with offers to get drink refills, clear dishes, and anything else.  True Craft is one of my favorites.  Thanks for bringing such great quality to this area!"}
{"text":"5 Stars Service:  Everyone was very friendly and answered all questions regarding the menu and details about the restaurant.  This is casual dining, so you order and sit down; however the staff came by our table many times to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.   Grilled Pizzas: Holy crap, the grilled pizza was unreal.  We got the house made pesto pizza with bell peppers and onions.  The flavor was fresh, the dough was much lighter than any other pizza I've had and the portion was large enough for two people to get their fill.    4 Stars: Ambience:  I really like the set up, very reminiscent of Brixx's but still unique.  They have a bar in the middle, booths on one side, and a long wooden table in the front for big groups.  The second time my girlfriend and I went, they were projecting a video about Italy on a side wall (this seemed odd and the sound was off so it didn't serve much of a purpose).   Mozzarella Wedges: I love it when restaurants serve wedges instead of sticks because they usually have more cheese in them.  They could certainly use a little more salt but they were very appetizing.  3 Stars:  True Traditional Pizza:  Maybe this speaks to how good our experience has been but this was the only thing about the restaurant that made me go \"ehh.\"  The pizza was good but it was very bready and the toppings were very light for $1 a topping.  The difference between this pizza and the grilled pizza was enormous.  I also felt like it was less food for more money.    Overall, I love this place.  I still want to try the oven baked pizzas and the home made gelato but I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh new pizza experience in South Charlotte.  It looks like they have a good local beer selection to so I am eager to try that one weekend.  Bottom Line: Get the grilled pizza!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious!  True Crafted Pizza rivals any of our favorite haunts in NY!  The garlic clam pie, hot oil pie with spicy thai chilis and the sausage and broccoli rabe are our favorites.  All of the salads are super fresh and delicious.  The craft beer and wine selections are complimentary.  I would be in heaven if they added a stout;-) Couple a pie with the outstanding service -- we love the manager!  He's a very professional young man who really cares about the customer experience. You're doing yourself a big disservice if you don't try any of their recommended specialty pizzas. Very well done for Charlotte!  (Oh, and do yourself a favor, and add spicy oil to the clam pie.) Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  We usually order this Spinach and Argula salad and the meatball subs, but everything on the menu is delicious!  Service is fast and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure what kind of pizza you would call this, but good is not one of them. Tried the oven pizza and the grilled pizza. The oven style much better than the grilled. Very expensive for what you get. Pies are smaller than most other pizza shops. Sauce had a funny taste, almost like dish soap. Can not recommend."}
{"text":"Went for family dinner night, started with meatball appetizer which was delish - ordered three different pizzas and shared, all were awesome especially the recommendation of the Bacon & Egg pizza from the bartender. Prices are good and we had great service at the bar"}
{"text":"I'm in search of the perfect pineapple pizza. But to be honest, True Crafted Pizza's pineapple and ham pizza isn't the best. The crust was very difficult to chew as it was very crispy and tough. Overall it consisted of pretty bland flavors. I went when the restaurant had recently been opened so I don't want to criticize harshly. It was interesting how you could see the chefs cooking from our seats, though. It made me feel connected to the restaurant and the eating experience. I would like to go back to try their other menu options."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. Full of flavor and great combinations! Highly recommend this for pizza! I had the prosciutto di parma grilled pizza and it was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Food is great. place is clean. Owners seemed unfriendly. White dude was nice but two middle eastern fellas didn't want to help us much."}
{"text":"Love true! Amazing food and amazing customer service. This place has it figured out. The sausage and pepper pizza and meatball parm are my favorites. The cold copper beer not bad either."}
{"text":"Really like the order pay and sit down feel of this place where it's still a nice dinning experience. The open kitchen makes for a unique atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I eat at True Crafted Pizza very often and needless to say it is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at and the service there is great! As soon as you walk in you are greeted with friendly smiles and everyone working there is so nice and I always have a great experience when I come to True Crafted Pizza. Love it!"}
{"text":"Went here with my parents and brother. Wow the grilled pizza we had was pretty fabulous. So light and flavorful! Their regular baked pie was delicious too but we all kept going back to the grilled pizza.  Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Going back ASAP."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! The pizza is made soo quickly its out in like two seconds.again great pizza! Staff is friendly and accommodating. Food is always good--consistent!"}
{"text":"Tried True Pizza with my 7 year-old son on Saturday, March 5th, 2016 for lunch. We put our orders in right away (kids cheese pizza, and an 11\" with mushrooms and onions for me) and had hot, fresh pizza at our table in about 10 minutes. The pizza was great and the servers were awesome, checking on refills and asking if we needed anything else. Total for the two of us was $20. My pizza was large enough that I took about half home. Highly recommend True and will be back with the whole family!"}
{"text":"The prosciutto and the pesto grilled pizzas are delicious. Homemade dough and local produce!"}
{"text":"Great overall experience! Family-friendly and great service! Servers managed to ensure everyone's satisfaction. Food was great! Highly recommend the grilled flatbread platter and prosciutto di parma pizza! Great service and vibes! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love it every time we go. Pizza with balsamic and arugula is awesome. Love the hot oil one too. Tried the one with bacon and fried egg and that was good too. Kids like the plain. Quick and delicious. And they have my favorite jalape√±o beer :) \"Regulars\" here."}
{"text":"Their pizza is my favorite in Charlotte and I'm from New York! Get the pesto pizza. It's so good and the waitstaff are always so attentive here."}
{"text":"This is a great place with excellent food and a great local beer selection.  Try a grilled pizza for something different.  I've had most of the pizzas on the menu and made up a few of my own.  All delicious.  Fall and winter brings a daily soup to the menu.  These are fantastic.  Great friendly service.  Just go here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have not been to this place for some time so I thought try it again. Sat at the bar to get a beer and food. Well the bartender was cking her phone and it took 5 minutes before she come and ask if she can get a drink for me . The bar was not clean and needed a wipe down and she did not look like she was happy to be working. Ordered the pesto pizza . The bartender asked how it was and I said it's ok and little soggy She did not ask if there was anything wrong and went back to her phone . She was on that phone every chance she got. I just don't think if you are working you should ck your phone or emails or texts. Don't know if i am going back that's all"}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions and have had excellent food both times. The calamari is lightly battered and fried to perfection - tender on the inside. The clam pizza was also a hit."}
{"text":"So here's a secret that's not a secret. Truly good pizza in Charlotte is scarce.   TRUE Crafted Pizza aims to do something about that, and I think they're off to a great start.   I won't write too much here (I blogged, with pictures, here: http://is.gd/x7InUm), but our overall experience was excellent. For Charlotte, this really is about as good as it gets and our only regret is that we're 25 minutes from the location!  For those looking for a nice atmosphere, high quality pizza (with great local beers), and good service (thanks for stopping by to say hi, Todd), try TRUE Crafted pizza. You won't regret it.  (Also, as a bonus, a date night reverse happened - my wife was distracted from our conversation by the female equivalent of sports - old black and white movies on a projection screen with Jimmy Stewart. Well played, TRUE. Well played.)"}
{"text":"I lived in New York City from 1998 through 2007 so I've been exposed to excellent pizza. Pizza and bagels are two of the foods I have missed most since moving to Charlotte. They just don't make them down here like they do up there. Recently I went to True Crafted Pizza for the first time after reading an article about it in the Observer. I had low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised.   I ordered the grilled margarita pizza with caramelized onions. The crust was perfectly done: thin, flavorful with a nice texture - not crispy (except maybe on the very ends) but not too doughy. It was baked enough to be on the verge of burned, but not over the edge. The mozzarella cheese was creamy and delicious. The sauce seemed to be very basic with chunks of whole tomato. The pizza had a nice saltiness to the overall flavor, but not too much. It was truly the best pie I've had since moving here. Absolutely the most similar to NY style.   My boyfriend opted for the baked pie which had a bit of a thicker crust and was round (mine was rectangular). And his crust was also delicious - chewy, nice flavor and texture. It's too bad there isn't a True Crafted Pizza anywhere near Uptown as Ballantyne is a hike for me. All I can hope is that they flourish and decide to open another branch.   I will say, the ordering system could use some tweaks. You order at the counter and they bring you the food, which is fine except that you can't see the menu until you are right up at the cash register - talk about pressure. Being that it was our first visit we wanted to peruse the menu for a few more minutes before being pushed into a quick decision. We tried to let the people in line behind us go ahead of us but we told we could not do that since they had already assigned us a table number (or something along those lines? We were slightly unclear of the reasoning.) So we had to order very fast, but luckily our quick decisions turned out to be delicious anyway. Also the tables do feel a little bit cramped inside. Space layout could probably have been improved a bit although the atmosphere is very nice.   Nice beer selection as well. The salads looked good - we did not order one - but nice looking produce from afar!   5 stars for food, 4 stars for ordering system/space layout  We will definitely be back when we are up for another \"road trip\" down South! Now, if only I could find my Charlotte bagel shop..."}
{"text":"Tried this new place with my husband and another married couple. There is a bar in the middle and booths all around the outer walls. Every time someone opened the door, the cold air came rushing in (not fun in December). There was a long line to order and when we did order, I was shocked at the prices. It cost my husband and I nearly $50 for two pizzas and two drinks. The pizza was good, but I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Some food-savvy friends had mentioned this place while we were gone over the summer, and we made visiting a priority on our return to town.  Glad we did!    The reviews lauding the grilled pizzas as the way to go are correct, in my view.  The traditional varieties are fine, but not special in any way.  Our party had both the grilled pepperoni and the grilled prosciuto di parma ... both were EXCELLENT.  My wife got the baby spinich/arugla salad, and added chicken.  She is generally pretty finicky about wilty lettuce, so when True's passed muster that should be seen as a strong stamp of approval.  For a 'modified table service' approach (order at the front, then the staff brings your order and refills -- very similar to Brooklyn Pizza), the service level was good.  The staff was upbeat and engaging.  We enjoyed the very open layout.  The classic films playing on the big screen were a fun touch.  We will be back...."}
{"text":"Live this place. Wish we had one in Tega Cay. GREAT Service."}
{"text":"Our family just got back from two weeks in Italy so when someone said this was the best pizza in Charlotte we thought, OK, show us. Well they did. This is the best pizza in Charlotte, rivals the ones we had in Capri two weeks ago. The crust is just the slightest bit chewy, not all the options are slathered in tomato sauce.  Some trendy for the foodies, bacon and egg, clams and garlic; some traditional for the non adventuresome, pepperoni. Appetizers are great. They should serve the meatballs as a main course. Service is prompt and courteous in a private schoolboy summer job kind of way. My only criticism is the ordering system. You order and pay as you go in like fast food. If you want another glass of wine or something then you have a whole additional credit card event. We didn't have the great looking gelato as it would have meant a third credit card event. There were a couple of post graduate preppy guys walking around that looked like they owned the place so I am sure they will put their MBAs to work and sort this debacle out. The food overcomes this, just order a bottle of wine or two glasses when you go in until they figure it out.  What matters, the food and the service are outstanding! Oh and did I forget to tell you? It's trendy, its cool, hip and fun.....and reasonable. The check came and I was so pleasantly surprised. When was the last time you took a family of four with two large teenage boy appetites out to a trendy place, had great wine and the check was WAY LESS than $100. Absolutely the new go to place in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. We had a pepperoni pizza, ham and pineapple pizza and a chicken parm sandwich which came with some of the best coleslaw I've ever had.  The pizza crust was crunchy and chewy and not too thick. The chicken sandwich was cooked well with a good sauce, not overwhelmed by the cheese and served on a nice sesame seed roll. Seems kind of weird to over emphasize the side dish but the coleslaw was delicious. It was a vinegar-based slaw with another ingredient that just made it pop. Good place to go before or after a movie."}
{"text":"From the ashes of a rather mediocre pizzeria now comes TRUE Crafted Pizza. It's a tremendous improvement, to say the very least.   For starters, it's not a traditional pizzeria in any sense. You walk up and order from a menu above. Everything is hand-crafted and fresh-made; no slices of pizza that have been sitting there for hours waiting to be reheated. Additionally, all pies are individual sized; there's no family-sized pies here.   Not to worry, the pizzas are simply phenomenal. As they're baked via a wood-fired grill and not a gas oven, they have a crispy crust that gives it a far greater flavor. Of course, it helps that there are some imaginative combinations on the menu. The pesto pizza with bell peppers is quite spectacular, and the broccoli rabe with sausage is sublime. You can't go wrong with their grilled pizza.  There are other options if you're not jonesing for pizza. There are plenty of delicious toasted sandwiches and salads to choose from. Also, an excellent beer and wine selection to boot.  I've started frequenting this joint about once a week, and haven't been disappointed so far. It's my hope that TRUE catches on, because it's a welcome respite from all the chain pizza take-outs around town."}
{"text":"This is great pizza in Charlotte!  All pizzas come in a personal size that is just right for most people.  The staff are well trained and always friendly, as well as the restaurant always being bright and clean.  The pizza never disappoints, and it always tastes extremely fresh and delicious.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Besides the long wait time, the food is actually not bad. My son and I go here before heading to the movies. We like the thin crust style pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and my pizza was cold and was not consistent with any other orders I've ever placed here. To add salt to the wound, I asked for extra garlic on the side and was provided garlic POWDER! That's not consistent with \"TRUE Crafted Pizza's\" vision of \"fresh\" ingredients. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"In the summer of 2012, three families got together with the goal of creating the best pizza restaurant in Charlotte, NC. In their quest to create the \"best\" pizza, they traveled from New York to San Francisco, from New Haven to Los Angeles, and virtually everywhere in between in search of the perfect pizza. At TRUE Crafted Pizza, they take an artisan's approach to making pizza. With help from Harry Peemoeller, a renowned baker/professor at Johnson & Wales University (one of Ella's former instructors), they developed what they believe to be a perfect pizza dough recipe.  The menu features two distinct styles of pizza, the Traditional Oven Baked Pizza and the Signature Grilled Pizzas. This second type of pizza is unique to TRUE Crafted Pizza and is not offered anywhere else in Charlotte. We love unique flavors and if TRUE is the only place in the Queen City offering grilled pizzas then the decision on what we were going to order was pretty obvious. We started with the Crispy Risotto Fritters with creamy fontina cheese and fresh herbs, and then we split the Grilled BLT Pizza with bacon, grilled romaine lettuce, tomato with ranch dressing.  The risotto fritters were addictive, artery clogging, and smile inducing fried balls of risotto dripping with fontina cheese. The grilled blt pizza was delicious but we thought there might have been a little too much lettuce. So much lettuce that the pizza felt more like a giant salad than a grilled pizza. We loved TRUE crafted pizzas and can easily recommend you stopping by the next time you have a pizza craving in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good!  They also have a pretty good beer selection including local drafts, which is cool.  We got a Greek salad for our app and it was ok...not the best, but it wasn't bad either. I ordered the sausage/broccoli rabe pizza and it was really good.  The crust was super thin and perfect. My husband usually throws his crusts away, but even he ate his!  He ordered the mushroom pizza and loved it - I'm not a huge mushroom fan, so I didn't have any of his.  We'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Tried the grilled pizza (to go). The crust is chewy and not too thick. I liked it and felt like it was easy to digest vs sitting in your stomach like a rock. The margherita had a bit too much sauce and was soggy in spots by the time I got it home, but I'd rather that than a dry piece of cardboard. Everyone at home liked the pepperoni and the sausage and peppers.   Staff was friendly and helpful. I thought I ordered an arugula salad and didn't realize until later that it didn't get entered into the system but when I got home and called about it they offered to buy me one next time I was in. That's classy.   The dining area and bar are nice enough that I would consider eating in next time. There's a small patio too.   Finally, I would suggest calling your order in ahead of time if picking up to go bc I ordered there and waited quite a while. Everything made to order, from what I could tell. Worth the wait for fresh. Looking forward to trying the salad. It looks really good from pics."}
{"text":"This place has good pizza (wish they had NY style), a fun vibe, and outdoor seating. The sandwiches are good also -- so large I can save half for leftovers.  I wish the ordering system were different (more space&time to view menu), but the food will bring me back."}
{"text":"Love True Craft but after multiple visits I do have a couple of thoughts. It would be nice to have a couple more choices from the sandwich menu.  Maybe something not so heavy like turkey or chicken salad for lunch and a little wider variety for salads.   Additionally, the water seems to have an \"off\" taste. I did mention this to them during the last visit.  I believe they use the water from the tap.  I'm native to Charlotte  and let's just say I do not drink the water from my faucet.  Investing in a filtration system or offering a bottled water in the interim would be a great option!  Hope my thoughts are well received and are constructive!!  :)"}
{"text":"Truly indeed very delicious pizza here at this place and probably one of the best pizzas I've had in my lifetime. Very fresh and tasty ingredients. I also had the meatballs which was soooo on point. Service was awesome as the waiter at the bar was very friendly and was on point on his recommendations with regards to the menu. Another awesome pizza joint in the greater Charlotte area"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza!!! I love the garlic clam pizza and their gluten free crust is really amazing!! It's a go to in our family!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and salads. Love seeing the red truck! Owner is super great and takes a lot of pride in his ownership."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this evening--busy but we sat in less than 15 mins. Traditional and procuitto Di Parma were delicious, and we split a house salad and meatballs--now a family fave(helped that girls enjoyed Rudolph movie"}
{"text":"I came here with a huge group of college students. The staff was nothing but polite and accommodating in spite of the inconvenience we posed to them. The appetizers (particularly the mozzarella triangles and meatballs) rivaled the pizza (my favorite was the BLT pizza). We finished off the meal with creamy gelato. Enjoyed the meal from start to finish-- great food, great service!"}
{"text":"A pizzeria with Italian touch. Pizzas are well crafted, soup is worth trying and a few kinds of salads are offered as well."}
{"text":"Found my favorite pizza place south of 485! Fresh mushrooms, great local beers, amazing crust. One pizza is more than enough for 2 people. Will return very soon! Great place!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to True Crafted Pizza. While our pizza was good, our house salad for 2 ($9.00) was mainly the white portion of iceberg lettuce, garnished with only a small amount of toppings.  It was not very good and certainly not worth $9.00. Our total bill was $30 for 1 pizza. 1 salad and 2 sodas.   The staff was pleasant and attentive. We may or may not  try True Crafted Pizza again but if we do, we will definitely order a different salad to go along with our pizza."}
{"text":"We went to True Pizza on Saturday evening, and they were packed!  It was smaller and more cramped than I thought it would be.  The line to order did not move until tables came open, definitely a different way to handle things, but it worked out so that people just coming in can't snatch tables.  We started out with the risotto fritters.  They were good - breading with gooey cheese, served with tomato sauce.  As there were three of us, we decided to get two pizzas, but we could have easily just had 1.  We went with both styles of pizza - grilled pepperoni and the oven baked broccoli rabe/sausage pizza.  I liked the oven baked better, but the grilled was good (fantastic a day later).  My complaint about the grilled is that the outside pieces on the edges were burned - had no sauce or toppings.  I really love the flavor of their pizza - the sauce, cheese, toppings - it is wonderfully done.  My biggest complaint which is why they lost the star, is that the oven baked pizza came out 10-15 minutes before the grilled.  They classify these as individual pizzas, so what if I got one and someone else got another, I would be waiting and watching the other person eat, or vice versa. Luckily we were sharing and enjoying both, but they should time the two styles better so we can enjoy it all together.  We ended the night with Apple pie gelato, it was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Really great sitting outside with the kids food was fast and good . Service was amazing we had like 6 people check on us out side"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, very friendly staff, super fast service. We tried a regular oven baked cheese.  It had just the right amount of char on the crust.  We also tried the prosciutto di Parma. Very thin, delicate crust, fresh arugula,  and a nice sweet balsamic.  Sadly they didn't offer any hard cider, but a friend was happy with the beer on tap."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Stopped by on a panthers sunday and got their special sandwich: mozzarella, arugula, tomatoes and a balsamic reduction on a hoogie roll. It was delish!  My sister had the same but on a different kind of bread, and my brother in law had their pepperoni pizza, he ate the whole thing, and he loved it, and he's picker than your high school girlfriend. Staff was wonderful!  They didn't bug us, they smiled, they knew the menu, and they where just friendly and happy to be there. The restaurant was super clean and the decor was well decorated, the marketing for this place is simple and rustic. I can't wait to go back! !"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza made to order including substitute ingredients like goat cheese! I ordered the grilled pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese, it comes with arugula and balsamic drizzle and it's delicious. The atmosphere is casual and the service was pleasant even when it was busy at dinner. I liked the variety of the menu and I will be returning for more options. The service was good even when I had to wait for the wine, they apologized and said they were short staffed. I appreciate the candor and I like the pizza!"}
{"text":"I was at an event last night that was catered by True Crafted Pizza.  All of the employees were working very hard and were so nice.  Every bite of pizza was truly delicious and gourmet (don't think Little Caesars...it is NOT that kind of pizza) .  The set up with the truck in the parking lot was adorable!!!  It was so cool to watch the chefs hard at work, creating the next tasty concoction!  They are creative with their pizza.  The prosciutto pizza was so yummy!  I loved watching them cook them in their wood fired stone oven.  Great experience for all the senses! :)  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other tasty flavors I didn't have room for!"}
{"text":"Tried the bacon and egg pizza...really good, although it was more of a breakfast sandwich than a pizza. Crust was decent ingredients seem to be quality...we'll be back to try again. Beer selection was nice too!"}
{"text":"KEEP in MIND I am honest and I don't like to only write when it's BAD so please read how I started as a 4 star, went to a 3 star and how I ended up at 2 stars now.  I would give TrueCraft a True 4 stars as I've been a customer for about 4 years now HOWEVER since I am just getting to my review I have to take off 2 stars due to 1) An event I had which took them to a 3 star and now 2) the guy on staff ( maybe a manager) on my last visit who did something very unethical and unprofessional without knowing the situation. Let me paint the picture: Friday Feb. 24, 2017 It's a Beautiful sunny day in Charlotte so I take my son for pizza for lunch after some shopping for toys before my datenight evening set with my husband. We order him the kids pizza and he and I the Spinach salad to share. As I was paying I checked in on Yelp and there is a check -in offer for gelato. The nice young man reviewed my phone and said \"would you like it now\" and I said no I need my son to eat and then we will have it. As he was leaving he told the other guy at the register that I get a gelato this guy was spanish at the register now and very nice. After we ate I walked up to the register and mentioned the gelato and the guy asked which one which I allowed my son to choose and he put it in a cup with a spoon for my son and we went to head to sit back on the patio to enjoy the weather and the gelato together. THIS is where IT GETS unprofessional: There was another guy who I believe is a manager, taking the order of a lady and her family HOWEVER watching my son and I our the corner of his eye and our transactions with the Spanish guy. As we headed to the door IN the MIDST of him taking this lady and her family order he yells to the SPanish guy \" STOP HER she didn't PAY\" I mean REALLY a freaking scoop of gelato caused that much theatrical actions???  The Spanish guy went to explain to him that I have a Yelp Check-In offer and I turned politely and asked if he would like to see it or if he would like me to give him the $2 for the gelato so he could focus on his customer and not me with a toddler and a scoop of gelato. I mean come on, its a Yelp offer so if I didn't pay YOU OFFER IT for FREE for Yelpers...  IN THE PAST: I would've given them 4 stars as I said because 1) I discovered this place through a movie night Yelp event in 2013 and afterwards I ended up having Big Red come park in our home driveway and I had a BackYard movie night with Big Red providing all the pizza, salad, appetizers and gelato you can eat for my friend and family. It was a great night for the most part as everyone loved the food. My only issue was the fact that they didn't realize a family member approaching and decided to talk rudly about my guest late arrival and say things like \"We are LEAVING when we are set to LEAVE regardless if her guest are here or not\". I mean as a business you shouldn't have to say those things out loud as I am paying and if I have a contract for a certain timeframe, I'm professional so I know how to abide by my contract so that goes unsaid. Or it could've been discussed with me and not amongst the staff and management in a disgruntle way in public where neighbors and all could hear. If I would've wrote my review after my event it would've been updated to a 3 stars.."}
{"text":"We stopped by TRUE Crafted Pizza one night after the movies.  I had visited this location a few years ago when it was a different pizza place that offered pizza by the slice.  The old one was just ok, so I didn't have high expectations for TRUE.  TRUE blew away my expectations.  Not only do they offer WHOLE pizzas delivered quick at fantastic prices, but they're delicious and offer unique topping combinations.    We ordered the Broccoli Rabe & Sausage and Prosciutto di Parma pizzas.  Both were unique and delicious, although I preferred the former because it was hotter and the arugula kept falling off the latter.    Everyone was super friendly, and the atmosphere is very modern.  TRUE will be our go-to restaurant from now on when we're in the Stonecrest plaza for shopping or a movie."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best pizza I've ever put in my mouth. Very little cheese. Very little topping. Burnt crust.  If making a so called \"CRAFTED PIZZA\" is just throwing less of everything on it, and then over cooking it, well then this is your pizza! You found your place."}
{"text":"Just ate here and was so pleased. As a NJ native, I have a hard time finding \"good\" pizza in Clt. This was excellent! The crust was amazing, I recommend the \"oven-baked\" regular crust, not grilled. The grilled was great as well but more like a flatbread. I got the margherita and highly recommend it. The place was hopping and I hope it stays that way!"}
{"text":"Oh, gracious. The food is so fresh and delicious. I had the hot oil pizza, my husband had a pepperoni and Mushroom, and my friend had the margherita. We were all blown away by the portion size and how amazing the food was. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A gem in Stonecrest. Fresh ingredients, friendly service and a great value. Finally an establishment in this specific store location that adds color to the area and a simple beer/wine pizza option before a movie. This one could last."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband before seeing a movie at Regal on a Monday night. For a Monday it was pretty busy, but it's also Summer and 75% of the people there was a large group of teenage girls.   When you initially walk in, you need to know that you order up front. There isn't a waitress to seat you and take your order, and it's not very intuitive, so just be aware.   We ordered the Pepperoni Pizza, the mozzarella wedges, a cup of tomato soup, and my husband got an Old Meck Copper. Our total was $26.   The pizza is a \"personal size\" meaning that it's about 10inches. My husband and I shared, and we had enough. Would probably be enough for a couple with a small child, but any more, you would need 2 pizzas. I like the fact that you can tell the pizza is handmade because of the crust. However, when I get to the crust, I kind of want to skip it, because I would like a dipping sauce. Their sauce is good, and there is a lot of flour-y crust to be had.   The mozzarella wedges were not great. The cheese was a little too runny, and if we got there a second time maybe we will try out the meatballs.   The tomato soup was also not my favorite. I was expecting it to be more creamy, but it reminded me of their marinara sauce, which kind of weirded me out.   And for a Monday, they didn't have any drink specials. They also don't have any ciders. Both, something I hope they pick up in the future."}
{"text":"When True Crafted Pizza opened in Stonecrest my initial reaction was \"great, another pizza restaurant\" - it feels like there's one on every corner, how could this one possibly be different. But I WAS WRONG! As soon as we walked into True Crafted Pizza we could see the difference - it's nothing like the pizza place that used to be there. It's clean, bright and very inviting. The menu is easy to understand and the staff were fantastic. We went for a late lunch/early dinner and we were starving, so we split a caesar salad for 2 and it was wonderful! Great portion size and the dressing and croutons were fantastic. We also got the mozzarella wedges, and they were light and delicious. I ordered the four cheese pizza and my husband got the bacon and egg pizza. He said it was the best and most unique pizza he's ever eaten and my four cheese was equally awesome. We will definitely go back to True Crafted Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great! The inside is small and sort of intimate. I love the bar area with the 6 or so beers on tap. This is a great place for a low-key date, or to come crab some grub + brews with your bros.   I came here for an event and was fortunate enough to be able to try almost all of the pizzas... and I would recommend almost all of them! BUT, if I had to choose... it'd be tough.  -The bacon & egg was awesome, especially if you're into 'different'/non-traditional pizzas. -The garlic & clams also had an awesome taste, although I felt the clams were skimped a tad on the piece I had. Also good for you non-traditionalists.   The BLT, House-Made Pesto and Sausage & Peppers pizza all tie in my book for my first choices. You really can't go wrong with any of them.   buon cibo!"}
{"text":"A refreshing change and a nice addition to Stonecrest's food choices. True is owned by the people who run Nothing But Noodles and, like that establishment, they know how to prepare good food in large portions at affordable prices. We tried True on Friday (7/5/13) night and we enjoyed the experience. The manager came over to talk about our meal and things in general. We expressed our positive opinions and said we'd be back. Staff were helpful and didn't fumble the order or the service. I can heartily recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great food, good service. Order the spinach and arugula salad! And the tomato soup. Both are superb. Also, definitely recommend both the mint Oreo, and the mango gelato. Get one of each and share with a friend"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere where you order and pay up front, but tons of staff continually checking on you and taking future orders and delivering them to you. Great beer and wine selection. Fun pizza choices and the Italian Tuna salad was phenomenal. Gluten free crust coming this Monday which is great news because the pizza looked amazing! Fun for kids too with gelato afterwards!"}
{"text":"Stars all around for being True to their name.. The pizza was fantastic!  Light, crispy crust... chewy cheese... we had the broccoli raab and sausage pie and it descended to our bar seats fresh from the oven like an angel.  I wish I lived closer to here to make this joint a regular.  Other dishes we had were fine, tho not the star.. the calamari with jalapenos had  a little fire, but not a lot of bite, the Caesar salad lacked kick too.. anchovies?  Didn't see them.  Dressing was minimal, if any.   But oh, the gelato made up for that too.. fantastic, authentic, creamy love scooped right from heaven. One other unique feature of this place... the way it works... you get in line to order your food BEFORE you seat yourself.. so they've done away with waiters and replaced them with runners, UNLESS you choose to sit at the ample bar (which we did) in which case the bartender tends to you directly.  Our approach had three advantages. - 1.  Maybe the best local IPA I've had  2.  The pizza prep and cooking show is worth viewing  (from assembly to the oven or grilles to the guy that cuts them up to the runner...they've got it down!), and 3.  No waiting in line for the bar."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant looks much different than the previous pizza places that inhabited the space. I like the bar space they put in - makes the place look much nicer than it did before.   However, it is still a \"fast casual\" concept where you walk up to the counter, place your order and pay.  We weren't sure what to get, but decided we should try one of the grilled pizzas.    I wasn't thrilled with any of the grilled options listed on the board, so we decided to build our own... we chose a grilled pizza with tomato sauce, basil, spinach, chicken, black olives, and mozzarella cheese.  We didn't order any appetizers or salads, but after we got our pizza, we realized that we should have.  The pizza was good, but not overly large.  It would have been the perfect amount to share if we had started with a soup or salad."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza in Charlotte!    I am actually gluten intolerant, which means I shouldn't be having pizza in the first place... But this stuff is worth a couple days of limping around with inflamed joints!  That's a rating right?  \"Walking cane delicious\"  I have tried most of what they have to offer and you really can't go wrong.  My favorite is the grilled variety.  Its flavors are fresh, simple, and of palatable quality - from the rustic hearty crust to the homemade chunky tomato sauce and all the wonderful toppings.    As far as catering goes, True Crafted Pizza is a show stopper.  They roll in a fire engine red retro truck and unveil a beautiful kitchen with a live roaring brick oven.  You can pair your meal with salad and some fresh gelato too.  Hire them to cater your next outdoor event and your friends will still be talking about it days later."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday night on a whim.  Tried the Garlic & Clam pie.  It was delicious!  The line moved quickly, friendly staff, plenty of seating,  and a family friendly environment.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The staff was very courteous always asking about our experience. The prosciutto do parma was excellent and I highly recommend it. The flavors were the perfect combination of salty and sweet."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place after seeing some decent reviews. Not impressed at all. Got the Margherita which looked good at first but all the tomato and cheese basically fell off the crust as you lifted it off the plate. Way too soggy for me but the outside crust had a decent texture. Maybe it was an off day but this wouldn't be a first choice if I decided to go grab some pizza in the area. Service was okay."}
{"text":"4 solid stars. Not the most likely spot for a great pizza place as Stonecrest tends to be ruled by chains and easygoing eateries. Happy to say that TRUE is truly....pretty damn good. The interior is a little tightly packed, but gorgeous. Killer bar, plenty of booths, tables, and a great patio. We came in for an early-ish dinner to check it out.   It's a walk-up situation. Walk in, go to the counter with a nicely sized menu above, order, and grab a seat with number in hand. There are a few options when it comes to pizza -- traditional style, grilled pizzas, and oven-baked. We checked out the traditional cheese and the grilled pesto pizza.   A few notes: the grilled pesto pizza was awesome. Good amount of char on the bottom, killer grilled flavor, tasty veggies, pungent pesto, a dusting of parm, and not-so symmetrical shape. I think we both could have gone for a well-done crust, but it was still awesome. The cheese pizza was good, but also was lacking just a bit in the doneness of the crust. Though, we are both fans of blackened crust(s) on pizza.   We also checked out the mozz wedges as an app. Where they didn't blow me away, the cheese was perfectly gooey and flavorful. I was curious if they were making it in-house.   Another huge plus, they have a nicely organized grouping of local brews -- OMB, Birdsong, Triple C, and NoDa. Went with a few pints of Jalapeno pale and CoCo LoCo.   Pricepoint is rather fair. Can't argue too much with two pizzas, an app, and two beers for $30.   I'm looking forward to heading back really soon.    Another plus: The men's restroom smells like cookies and, for that, I am thankful."}
{"text":"The pizza is sensational - the best in Charlotte. Atmosphere is neat. Service was non-existent,  Never had a wait person come to our table except to deliver original order.  Had to go get drink refills.  Had to go get a to go box.  My tip reflected the service = zero! No one seemed to care!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Confusing walk through ordering system. What do I do if I want a second beer? Pizza was average."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the mushroom and onion pizza.  Excellent service and they continued to check on our needs often during our meal.  Got a free cup of gelato for checking in on yelp.  It was delicious.  Would def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Took way too long to get orders in. 4 separate couples all left because it was way too slow."}
{"text":"Our second visit was ok! Tried the Sausage & Pepper pizza, a couple of dry Caesar salads and beverage. Friendly staff was quick to provide more dressing once I returned to the \"place your order here\" counter. Early dinner so we had the place to ourselves (4:30). Menu described fennel sausage which tasted more like ground beef.....with not a hint of fennel. All good, all gone but a tad bit disappointed!"}
{"text":"True Crafted Pizza is, in every respect, a restaurant worth going to. The pizza itself was delicious of course, but the appetizers and gelato really topped of the entire experience. The servers were attentive and professional, and the atmosphere was welcoming while still being quite chic. Prices were not too expensive, especially with the high quality of ingredients, so value is definitely there. Overall, this restaurant comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"I don't know... this place had some good reviews and I was craving some pizza so I checked it out.   So I'll start with, the pizza was great!  I'm sure the food is worth the trip. That said, I walked and it was slammed; very busy place.  Indoor and outdoor seating, very attractive. However, as soon as I walked in I noticed a smell that was off putting. I'm not sure if it was the doe or a old mop. Either way, it wasn't cool. I was able to make it past the smell, not a huge deal but odd.   My largest complaint once I noticed was some of the employees where just hanging out. I shouldn't really care but some folks where busting their butts. Hey to some people out but what looked to be the assistant manager of sorts because he wasn't in the same shirt as everyone else.  He was just bs'n with other employees to the point I noticed. If I were running this place, he would just have the day off or a extended absence, zero contribution.   All in all, this place is ok for me. That said it won't be a priority for me to come back. Maybe take out..."}
{"text":"Located in the Stonecrest shopping center, TRUE Crafted Pizza is a welcome spot for pizza! This previous tenant in this location was also a pizza place but TRUE elevates the experience. The decor is really cool and modern - marble table tops, wood and metal seating. The hubs and I ordered the arugula salad with apples and goat cheese and the zucchini and yellow squash grilled pizza to share and we were both pleasantly surprised. Both were very flavorful. I look forward for the next visit!"}
{"text":"This is a \"fast casual\" place with a twist. While you walk up to the register and order, there is a bar inside that serves beer and wine. Because of the setting, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very impressed. I got the four cheese white pizza. It was good and the crust was excellent. My wife ordered the \"Bacon and Eggs\" pizza with bacon, fried egg, and potatoes. It was good as well, but I would have preferred a bit more bacon. So far, it is the best pizza that I've had in Charlotte. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great experience brought my youngest For pizza, ordered a pepperoni mushroom and onions pizza was outstanding. My little guy ordered a self cheese pizza, I've never seen him eat so much. Great atmosphere, good staff will definitely go back"}
{"text":"They have really delicious pizzas! The pepperoni is my favorite. But, a close 2nd is the pesto pizza.  I also like their variety of salads.  Their meatball hoagie is also very good.   The place is very clean. All of the employees are friendly, helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend because the pizza and salads are excellent. Service was abominable. We were greeted, and informed the greeter that we would be dining at the bar. At the time, there was 1 table with about 3 people and 1 other person at the bar. That's it. We proceeded to watch about 8-10 employees in the corner of the restaurant all counting their tips at 8pm on a Saturday night. None of them even looked up as we stared at them for about 3-4 minutes. At this point, we had enough and left. Only the greeter and bar patron noticed us leaving. Employees were still too busy talking amongst themselves and counting money. We went next door to Smoke Modern Barbecue where the food is not as good, but service was excellent, even though it was packed full of people. This was a truly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I were lucky enough to sit outside and enjoy the lovely food and weather. We split the grilled flatbread which came with little cups of honey, ricotta, bruschetta, caponata and pesto. It was delish and I would return again just for that alone. It's more than enough for two people to share for an app. We also split the margherita pizza. It was as you would expect. The pizza was baked in the oven and the crust was thin and crsipy. We also shared a small cup of gelato. All in all the whole meal was about $20. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte, hands down.  I am from Connecticut and lived in Manhattan for a few years.  I have tried every pizza place in Charlotte that people tout as NY style.  Nothing compares to this pizza.  It is closer to the CT/New Haven style of pizza but that's great for me since Pepe's in CT is by absolute favorite pizza.  True Crafted pizza has a great charred/chewy dough, thin crust, fresh sauce and flavorful cheese.  What else can you ask for?!  The service is also really great.  We always sit at the bar and you can order there and order more drinks while you are eating which is helpful."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza I was told that there wasn't any good pizza in the Charlotte area that would compare to New York City but I liked this and although not the best it was excellent even by NYC standards  I recommend it if you're craving a nice margarita pie !"}
{"text":"I am new to the Charlotte area and was hungry for some pizza this evening, but didn't want \"factory pizza\" (aka Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc.) so I jumped on Yelp to look for pizza places.  Found TRUE Crafted Pizza - and just did take out.  I called ahead, and they said would be ready in 10-15 min.  After ordering I jumped in my car, and headed to pick up.  The pizza was already waiting for me.  I had quick service and the pizza was fantastic!  I even ate a slice in the car before I left the parking lot! lol.  Will definitely be back to try some different menu options!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. You order everything at the counter, pay, and then sit at whatever table you like with your number. The workers are all very friendly and prompt. We were asked if we wanted our drinks refilled or boxes to take our food home without having to make eye contact or ask them for it. We got two pizzas, two salads and two fountain drinks for over $40 and the portions were on the larger side. The crust on the pizza is awesome, the only reason I took a star away is because the sauce on the Margarita pizza was a bit watery and could've used more flavoring.   Judging from all the signs I think this place may be new. They're off to a great start and with a couple of small fixed they'll be really successful!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Charlotte IMO. Have been there 3 times now and each time gets better and better as we explore different pizzas. These are A+ brick oven pizzas and would highly recommend to any pizza fan. Great food, great atmosphere and great service. The bar tender (Peter) is extremely friendly and has given us several recs that were amazing. Definitely go here soon if you haven't been already!"}
{"text":"Went to try the local small business.  Was pleasantly surprised.  The food was good, not too loud.  The only exception was that with 2 doors, when people leave, there is a GUST of cold air that hits you if you are anywhere on the left side of the restaurant.  Have been back twice, and will wait for summer to come to go back.  Thanks and good luck."}
{"text":"Run don't walk to True Pizza!  Amazing pizza, great staff, and a welcoming ambiance. We started with the resort balls and house salad. Delish!  The dipping sauce for the risotto balls was so flavorful. And the salad was perfectly dressed. We shared the broccoli rabe and sausage pizza. So sad to see it go!  My husband never eats the crust and he did not leave anything on his plate with this pizza. Definitely worth the drive and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally, I found a really good pizza place in Charlotte!  I tried their pizza at Taste of Charlotte last year and I've been hooked ever since.  I always get the pepperoni pizza and chocolate gelato ice cream.  The ingredients are fresh, they make their dough right in front of you and cook it in a wood fired pizza oven.  The crust is my favorite part of pizza and theirs is perfect!    Their food is worth the 45 minute drive...but I hope they expand to Huntersville or Cornelius soon."}
{"text":"All pizzas are personal pizzas if you try hard and believe in yourself.    Located at Stonecrest, at the end near City Tavern, in a spot that has been a couple of other pizza places, the interior of True Crafted is definitely an upgrade from the former tenants.  When you walk in, to your right you will order at the counter and get a number to put on your table for delivery.  They have booths, a long wooden family style table, chair seating and bar seating.  The pizza special for the day today was an 11\" white pizza with asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli, ricotta, mozzarella and red pepper flakes.  I ordered the special without mushrooms with a Coke to drink (yay Coke products!) and it was just over $12.    I love, love, love white pizza.  This, I did not love.  I do not like for the ricotta to be in globs on the pizza, which this was.  It's a personal preference, and not a reflection of a bad tasting pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy without being hard.  The broccoli was cooked through as was the asparagus.  The red pepper flakes were a little heavy in some places on the pizza, but overall it was well balanced.    The wait staff delivers your food and checks a few times to see if you need refills and see if everything is okay.  I found them all to be pleasant and helpful.  A couple of gentlemen, that I believe to be the owners and/or the chef(s) after seeing their webpage, were walking around the restaurant checking on people as well.  I did like that the restaurant seemed to be kid/family friendly without catering specifically to children, thus alienating those of us who don't want to listen to some guy making balloon animals while trying to eat.    The execution of the pizza was fine, I just didn't particularly care for this pizza.  I will go again and try a regular cheese pizza and will update my review then."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing.  So fresh.  They have outside seating which is really nice to sear outside and eat.  Great customer service.  Mozzarella wedges were really good  and we were served with our food in less than 10 minutes.  I will be definitely going back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited true crafted pizza for the first time last Saturday and I have to say I was disappointed. The restaurant looks really appealing from the outside but the food and service is a different story. After ordering a pizza to split with my date and sitting down, I placed my numbered table marker on its designated stand and waited. And waited. After a while an employee approached and asked if we were still waiting for anything and I told him we had been waiting for our pepperoni pizza. He said he would check on that and I watched him go retrieve our pizza from a shelf near the back of the cooking area. I'm assuming the pizza had been sitting there unattended for a long time because it arrived at the table room temperature. I'm not sure what happened there. I never moved seats and I made sure the table marker was clearly visible on its stand at the center of our table. As if eating overpriced room temperature pizza wasn't bad enough, half way through my second slice I chomped down on a piece of soft plastic that had been baked into my pizza. As a rule I never complain to management at restaurants but had I not been on a date I would surely have made an exception to that rule."}
{"text":"First time here after son recommended.  It is certainly A-OK in many ways and then it is an \"experienced better\" in other ways.  Let me explain.  Their pizza is good, flavorful dough.  Prices are really high.  You pay $11 for a traditional 11-inch cheese pie and toppings run $1 for most veggies and $2 for meats.  Some toppings are higher.  But the pizza is good.  Pies are 11\" and 7\".  The toppings are really skimpy.  Even with fresh sliced mushrooms, there were about 7 on the 11-inch pie.  Their sausage, pork with fennel, is excellent, but don't count on a lot of in on top...similar to mushrooms. Meat balls were excellent and you got about 8 halves on a pie.  Basil, barely one leaf per slice.  But the pizza is good.  Eat in or take out.  Their suggested combinations, to me, were odd, which drove wife and I to order the create your own.  The facility is immaculate, they have a full bar and a nice large long table for those soccer teams.  Staff is very pleasant and is there is not a line will coach you through the process.  We will try it again, but for now it is A-OK.  I would not rush back, but is worth another try.  Give it a try and tell us what  you think."}
{"text":"The atmosphere over the weekend is so good. I personally like when lots of people are waiting in linevfor the orders. That means the food is good. Excellent open kitchen concept and even when there was so much rush we  got our orders taken in 10 mins and got them in quick time. Food .. Delicious. No doubt abt it."}
{"text":"TRUE is my to-go order pizza place. In the seven months I have lived in Charlotte, I haven't ordered delivery from any chain because of places like these that are as tasty and fresh. The to-go ladies are always friendly and quick, and even on busy nights, my order is always ready when they say it will be. The gelato is very tasty, too!"}
{"text":"Thus comfortable little pizza place offers a simple menu consisting mainly of personal pizzas and stone oven baked sandwiches. You order at the counter upon entering the restaurant and entrees are delivered piping hot to your table. The centerpiece is a huge stone oven which is surrounded by simple, well laid out seating.  In addition to the standard pizza choices, I have also tried their unique items such as the Bacon, Egg and Cheese pizza which is loaded with bacon and thinly sliced potatoes with a fried egg in its middle. The hot Chicken Parm and Meatball subs are also very good.  It is under the same ownership as Nothing But Noodles, so you can bet it is well managed, has great service, consistently high sanitary scores and receives my \"Gotta try\" rating!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My favorite is the House made pesto signature pizza and my husband who doesn't like pizza much loves the garlic & clams one. Very thin pizza. I can practically eat a whole pie myself!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! We come here often. Quality ingredients. They even have a gluten-free crust which is tasty. We have never been disappointed. Nice selection of beer too."}
{"text":"Pizza is authentic and they have a friendly atmosphere. Great place for a date, family dinner, or kids day out."}
{"text":"Great pizza in Charlotte? What? Really? Yup! Favorites: Hot oil pizza, sausage and pepper pizza, and my fav make my own treat, salad pizza. They are very accomodating here. I have a pizza with just oil and a side salad then I dump the cold salad right on yop. Oh so good and light in calories. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I'm a pizza obsessive, and I'm always looking for great pizza.  I finally got around to trying TRUE pizza and here's my thoughts.  Neapolitan Style- not traditional in any way, but a fantastic artisan crust that really could have bumped my rating to a five star had it not been for a really poor tomato sauce that ruined the experience.  It was strange, wanting to continue eating a pizza because you look forward to the snap and flavor of the crust only to be deterred from taking another bite because of the bad sauce.  The sauce was so displeasing that I could not finish the pie.  Grilled Pizza- Another crust win with a unique crispy and salty crust that you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte.  The toppings of the House made pesto pizza just didn't do it for me.  I wanted to like this pizza more, but the toppings lacked brightness and flavor.  It was sort of a great crust with colorful yet bland toppings.  Surprising because pesto and peppers should have tons of individual flavor.  I didn't care for their sausage.   The ambiance is great, what a cool interior.  Unfortunately, neither pizza left me with a desire to come back.  I see elements of greatness, but the overall flavor was disappointing.  I like that they are unique and I hope they continue to work at improving their product.  I will try again down the road cause I really want to see places like this show this city that non-chain establishments are where it's at."}
{"text":"While the ordering process (unless you sit at the bar) is a bit odd, and the lighting is a bit too bright, the pizza at TRUE is...AMAZING! There's pizza and then there's pizza that tastes like a real meal. This is that pizza. Checking in on Yelp and getting a free gelato was the proverbial icing on the cake. (Thanks, Yelp!)"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This pizza is truly amazing....any negative reviewer of this place likely calls The Olive Garden or Applebees their favorite restaurant.   Let me start off by saying my family is Italian. We make pasta and dough from scratch, buy our 00 flour from Italy, have immediate family in Italy, take an entire day to make sauce from our garden tomatoes and fresh basil.   We just went to Italy this summer and we made it a point to eat pizza everyday at some point. Sounds excessive but a margherita pizza in Italy is about 5 euro and it's a smaller portion than we have here so my wife and I would split one during second breakfast or 3rd lunch or one of the other 10 meals we ate each day.   This is by far the closest to Italy that we've had in Charlotte and maybe the states.   I first tried their pizza from their food truck at my son's school and was really impressed, then we went to the restaurant a few weeks ago and now I'm hooked.   These guys take their time to let the dough rest and buy great flour. Obviously cooking the pizza at 700-800 degrees also is a key, which these guys do as well. I like a lot of different pizza places in Charlotte so I'm not a hater of \"american\" style pizza but if you want amazing, authentic Italian pizza then you've got to go here."}
{"text":"Prosciutto pizza was really good, however traditional style pie was bland and forgettable. Fried mozzarella wedges were good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars: better than OK, short of excellent  The food We ordered two pizzas, but one would have been enough.  The onion and mushroom; very good crust and the baker wasn't afraid to \"toast\" it dark (but short of burrned) well done! The onions and mushrooms flavors were fragrant - none of that crap canned slice 'shrooms so many cheap joints rely on - the onions held a bit too much water as it's often the case. Still I'd order it again. Prosciutto on flat bread:  man, they are generous with the cured ham considering it retails for $16-22/lb, a little skimpy on the provolone though. Tasty and the baker smartly avoided the common pitfall of drying out the thin sliced prosciutto.  So quite good. Possibly the menu could be expanded, I didn't get the impression there that many options.  Service. No menu until you get to the cashier to order at the cashier which I HATE. Luckily there was no one behind us. After that they bend over to please, 4 different people stopped at our table to find out if we needed anything else, if we wanted more water etc. Nice but it makes no sense to me, if you're going to have a full staff why not order at the table?  Decor: Lovely, clean, fresh, loved the white on white, the thick marble tops, the reversed back metal chairs, the lamps etc but space planning is a FAIL. The combination of a store-wide hall as you enter and the totally oversized pizza prep station  centered in the room totally chops up the space. No it's not \"small\" inside, it's actually a nice space but the architect butchered it. Customers are left with 3 small areas to dine in. Eight cramped tables at one end, 6 booths at the opposite end and joining both area a long communal table but again the space it too narrow for it - the bench was pushed out of the way so people could walk by.    If I was the owner I'd admit mistakes were made (possibly strangle the architect) and make some changes to the layout ... and that is constructive criticism for a store that zeroed on a good formula and should be in business for a long time."}
{"text":"My kids liked the pizza and gelato.  Andrea, our server, was very engaging and friendly and made good suggestions of what to get. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pizza with fig and arugula is nice. More of a flatbread than a pizza, though."}
{"text":"Decent pizza.  Awesome mozzarella sticks and great customer service."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place! I have only done take out so I can not review the ambiance or the wait staff or the drinks but I can tell you that the pesto grilled pizza is delish! It's covered with vegetables and as a vegetarian that is very important to me. Most pizza places give you barely any toppings and I always end up paying more to get double the toppings but not at TRUE! My husband and 16 month old love the meatballs. They also offer a daily special pizza which is fun... My husband usually gets whatever the special is that day since they usually have meat on them I don't eat them but he has always been happy with it.  The take out person has always been nice and friendly! Great pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 5 for an early dinner before a movie.  There were two other families dining.  We ordered and waited 30 minutes for our pizza that arrived at room temperature.  We had heard great things about this place from friends. The crust and their marinara are very good, but were so disappointed with the \"not hot\" pizza.  A pizza is not a food you can send back to reheat and we could have asked for a new hot one, but were not going to wait another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the staff needs serious training.  On a Tuesday at lunch there were a total of 10 customers there including my son and I.  There appeared to be at least 10 staff people that I could see.  This would obviously not include the ones in the back.  It was a very slow time and not a lot going on so getting service should not have been so challenging.  We watched as staff stood around chatting and hanging out.  We attempted to make eye contact while we were there to get service but were completely ignored.   Just getting our order in and drinks took 15 minutes and there was no one ahead of us.   During our brief lunch we each had to get up to find an employee for a drink refill.  I only right a complaint if things are REALLY bad.  This one definitely qualifies"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, not quite true NY pizza but comes much closer then most places here in Charlotte.  The only thing I didn't like was the crust had a Wierd texture that's hard to explain.  But I like how the breeding part was thin and it had a nice amount of cheese on it.  I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was here the other day with my dog.  It was warm outside so I didn't want to leave him in the car while I ordered.  (Complicating the \"order inside\" policy).  Emily was our server, and another man brought out a few things.  She came outside, took my order and my card so that I didn't have to go inside.  She was wonderful!  Super friendly and sweet to Thor (even brought him a water dish!).  I ordered the grilled pepperoni pizza and a sprite.  It was delicious, came out quickly and Emily brought out a plate, silverware and napkins as well.   I'll definitely be back here with Thor on the leash. :)"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I were craving grilled cheese and tomato soup a couple days ago (when the weather was actually pretty chilly). And we heard this place has the best - according to my other older and wiser co-worker!  We went to check out their menu (online) and we saw they had a margheruta pizza. Well a grilled cheese and soup is not enough for two people, right? So we ordered the pizza as well!! When the food arrived - she picked it up - it was delicious! The grilled cheese was HUGE! Way more filling than I thought. Half of their grilled cheese and soup was MORE than enough. It was ooy-gooy deliciousness. If you do not like that much cheese, DO NOT order this meal. The soup was creamy and yummy as well. After eating the grilled cheese, I was stuffed. But I still forced myself to eat a slice of the pizza. It look fresh and tasted great! I waited a little too long to eat it because it was a little cold but it definitely was my fault. I could not get enough of their grilled cheese!!   I will definitely be back. Who know a pizza place would have such good grilled cheese?!?"}
{"text":"Thankfully the fella and I arrived early on a Saturday night (around 5:30) because the place was absolutely packed when we got there. I didn't realize it was an \"order at the counter\" place, and we were a little confused about how everything worked at first. (Am I dumb?) We stood in line for about 10 minutes, and that gave us time to debate where to sit - do we sit at the bar? If we do, do you order there, too? If not, can one of us grab a seat before we order, or is that rude? (Ok, I'm dumb.) When I got to the register, the cashier explained that we ordered everything there, and if we decided we wanted another drink, we had to go the bar and pay for it separately. Kind of annoying, but okay.  We got the meatballs to start, which were huge and meaty and saucy and delicious, and we split a pepperoni pizza. It was tasty (isn't all pizza, really?) - a little on the thinner side with more cheese than sauce, and gooey cheese at that, and a smidge greasy, but that just added to the flavor. The fella got a NoDa Hop Drop 'N Roll, and I settled for a soda. All of that was about $30.  Service was on point with a few different people checking on us, getting us napkins, refilling my drink, etc., so it was definitely good... I just felt like they weren't quite sure what they were going for - neighborhood take out pizza joint (which a ton of people were doing) or nice, sit down Italian restaurant with a bar.  By the time we left, the line was wrapped around the restaurant, and I felt like a salmon swimming upstream just to get out!"}
{"text":"This is now the third pizza place in this location in about two years, and it's finally a winner. The first two sold nondescript pizza in a nondescript setting, but TRUE tries to change that a bit by incorporating new decor in a fast-casual setting. The new decor is so much better than what it used to be--the place is gorgeous. It now has a bar in the middle, and a darker, more calming color scheme compared to the whites, greens, and reds of the last few places.   We placed our order at the counter, which was a cheese pizza and a meatball hero. We decided to sit outside, and the food came out in about 15 minutes. The meatball hero was okay, although I wouldn't order it again. The meatball itself didn't do it for me and the sandwich didn't come out hot either. The pizza, though, was quite good. It may have been a little heavy on the cheese, but it had a nice crust and crunch, and was overall a solid pizza. The pie was enough to feed one and a half people.  The service was very good--the employees were personable and they seemed to be happy to be doing their jobs. The location is also very good--Stonecrest is always busy and they will likely see a lot of traffic on weekends. Overall, I'd go back, it's solid pizza in a good spot."}
{"text":"Multiple take out experiences; all good and will go back.  Nice thin crust with moderate toppings (authentic IT) that is rare here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a pizza here. Tonight we tried the BLT.  Really different and really good. The Greek salad was great"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Though the pizza was tasty, it came out slightly burnt. Will try again though!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob from NYC and was skeptical when I visited this place. First of all, the interiors are bright, airy and clean. The space is very well-designed.   We ordered the calimari, a \"Hot Oil\" pizza and the traditional Margarita. All was truly excellent. The sauce is particularly good with just a hint of sweetness to it. This is a 5 star Neapolitan pizza.  I was not expecting to find this great of pizza in a shopping center in Charlotte, NC. KUDOS to you, True Crafted Pizza!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better places in the area. Prices are reasonable and the food is pretty good. The shop is really well designed and is a great place to go before the movies. We took some friends here, and one was a vegan, and they even had a pizza for her (not sure how good pizza without cheese can be but she said she liked it!).    We love sitting at the bar, the bartenders are always willing to have a conversation and the crowd is always very friendly as well. They even have gelato!"}
{"text":"Best pizza crust I have ever had.  All the usual pizza flavors can be found here in addition to some very creative combinations.  My favorite is the garlic and clam!"}
{"text":"Anytime we hear the boys ask for pozza it inevitable ends up being this place.  The food is consistently good as is the service.  Great white pizza and margarita pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay but nothing to write home about service was great and the price was good. I got the Mediterranean pizza."}
{"text":"We came in 15 minutes before the restaurant closed and they treated us like royalty. My wife ordered a small salad to start and it was huge. My pizza came and they nailed it. The crust was crisp. The sauce was just right. They were generous with the cheese. Good music. We sat outside. I left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place! Very cool, laid back, but modern vibe. Service was friendly and quick. We had our table before we even ordered.  I ordered the gluten free four cheese pizza with bacon. The flavor was great! I didn't give 5 stars because the crust could've been cooked a little longer. The pizza would flop down when I would pick up a slice and I prefer my crust to be firm and have a little crunch to it. Also, my mom ordered the calamari and said it was a bit saltier then usual. Overall I was happy & would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza and a good beer selection a bit a chaotic but they have a good system for seating and what not. AWSOME gelato."}
{"text":"We had an evening event at Hendrick Acura that True Pizza catered and they knocked it out of the park! The food and service were both equally amazing and impressive."}
{"text":"My love affair with True Craft continues. Recently I have been trying their grilled pizzas that have an awesome crispy thin crust. The Prusciutto di Parma was simply incredible; mounds of arugula, prosciutto crudo, shaved parmesan and a drizzle of balsamic fig glaze. The BLT pizza is pretty dang tasty choice too! A small salad was enough to feed four people! I loved that they put radishes, shaved carrots and peeled, diced cucumber in the house salad. The Ranch is homemade and delicious! Great staff, great food, great beer! Throw in a free scoop of gelato for your Yelp check in and you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Great fast casual pizza experience. Menu has tons of options. The staff is friendly and helpful.   I had the grilled pesto pizza. The crust was crispy and delicious, and the ingredients were fresh.   They also have a great little bar area as well with some local craft beer options."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!  We were a party of 6. There were no available tables when we got to the restaurant.  The manager and staff were very accommodating. And I mean over the top accommodating!  This kind of service is hard to find at restaurants these days and I hope it continues.   BEST PIZZA IN CHARLOTTE!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing and service at the bar was awesome! We went with a group of 5 and tried multiple pizzas. The broccoli babe and sausage was our ultimate favorite! However, the prosciutto and arugula was amazing too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"terrible - I can't even describe how bad their pizza was - the bad taste of the cheese, the horrible crust, the sauce.  All of my kids hated it - we call it \"true crap pizza\" every time we pass it now on the way to the movie theater."}
{"text":"I had only tasted this pizza once before at a food festival in downtown Charlotte and it was just a small piece,  now I know what I was missing all these months.  It is outstanding! Came in on a Saturday and ordered the hot oil pizza with sausage,  truly covered with lots of sausage and delicious hot oil.  Also  had the mozzarella wedges which melted in your mouth and had a great crust on them. I enjoyed a glass of the house red, which was perfect to go with my pizza.  I also got to taste the calamari which also had a beautiful breading , it just melted in your mouth. I will definitely be coming back here I'm sorry that I waited so long to come here. Love  true Pizza"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Great house salad and I loved their grilled prosciutto pizza! Also their grilled zucchini and mushroom pizza is amazing!!! The oven baked pies are good but nothing beats their grilled pizzas. Great for lunch or dinner. Super casual. Walk in order, take a seat and they'll bring you your meal. They have beers on tap and a decent wine selection. I love this place. It's out in stone crest but worth the drive! You can grab a movie after or go to marble slab for dessert"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Staff was awesome upon first visit. Very attentive and awesome during lunch of 7/17/14!! However.. My mother came to visit me this past Sunday (07/17/14) and I decided to take her, my boyfriend, and little brother to eat here. The tall brunette at the front counter (2pm-ish) wasn't helpful. She was very impatient and made us feel uncomfortable and rushed as we were reviewing the menu and no one offered to refill our drinks the entire time. The pizza tastes awesome! Overall it was great the first time, second time not so much."}
{"text":"Personally I think the pizza here is great. Today I had a hot oil pizza that was fantastic. My wife, who is celiac had the gluten free margherita. A little back story now. Last time we ate here my wife got \"glutened\" She got really sick. We contacted management and the owner was kind enough to get in touch with us and said our next meal was on him.   Now it's been almost a year since we've dined here. We sat down today for lunch And a couple of hours after lunch she is doubled over in pain, or sitting on the toilet. The pizza was the only meal she had today. So there was no doubt it was the pizza that got her sick. So I must sadly say, we will no longer be eating at true crafted pizza"}
{"text":"I eat here solo at the bar most often or grab something to go. My typical order is a kids pizza, you can add any toppings. It basically reminds me of a Pizza Hut Personal Pan pizza I used to get when I was a kid like a million years ago only this actually tastes REALLY GOOD. My favorite combo is pepperoni, pineapple and jalape√±o. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE their vegetable chicken SALAD. I always get it without chicken. If you love real whole vegetables like, asparagus, squash, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and bell peppers you'll like it. It's served cold with a creamy dressing and some type of pesto as well. The veggies are grilled to perfection every time. If you are a VEGETARIAN, I highly recommend it. It is so filling. I think I could live off it. If they ever stop serving it I will ban this place from my life. The service and ambiance hasn't left an impression on me either way. It's fine. What you'd expect from a pizza/bar type place, good for families, lunch, etc."}
{"text":"If only they washed their hands... No, seriously I told the manager about his dirt-under-the-nails staff who grabbed the fresh basil I requested and he was appropriately disappointed. He asked to replace my pizza but I told him it wasn't necessary. I think this place has good potential."}
{"text":"From start to finish these folks have their act together. Risotto Balls oozing with fontina cheese, salads ice cold & crisp thin crust pizza that I have not had since last years trip to Italy. It only takes one bite to recognize quality ingredients. Service was spot on throughout and we especially enjoyed the very comfortable bar seating. Their beer selection is great as is their selection of Italian wines. The whole place was imaculate, not a easy task given that it was Saturday night & the Peanuts movie had just opened at the multiplex. Just wish that they'd carry a decent imported non-alcoholic beer:("}
{"text":"Wow! Visiting some family here and decided to do carry out from here. We got a few pies but our favorites  were the pesto pizza and the hot oil.   The pesto pizza was so good! I love tomatoe sauce and was worried that  I would need it for this but didnt! The crispness of this pizza was so good!   Hot oil... yum! If you love spicy... get this! It will burn your mouth off.   The staff was very nice and quick!   Didn't get to walk around but the place looked nice! Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I love the interior of this restaurant. There are few seats inside of this place. The grill cheese was great but pricey for just a grill cheese sandwich.  I got mom the magherita pizza and it was good. Why the three stars because it is pricey for pizza. There are other pizza places that are really great. You order your food at the front counter, and they bring your food to you. Heads up for the ladies, the lady restroom is hidden on your left side."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. I was delighted to find many light sandwich options, as well as the many pizza choices, and finally decided upon the Caprese Sandwich. It was a beautiful sandwich filled with basil oil, baby arugala, fresh mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, balsamic reduction, and prosciutto. An extra bonus, they had NODA's Hop Drop n' Roll on tap (which I've had difficulty finding in Ballantine). I will for sure be back again for my quick lunch stops during the week."}
{"text":"I found this exciting, little gem of a restaurant by accident, when we were staying  at a local hotel. For us True Pizza has now become a destination point, on any trip to Charlotte. The pizza has a unique, light dough, cooked in a fire oven with loads of choice toppings. My favorite has been the sausage and rabe. It you are a beer drinker they have lot's of craft, choices! I'm  a wine lover and have been VERY pleased with the large selection of fine choices. You can also choose from a selection of fresh salad choices. The staff go over and beyond to please. I find this refreshing, in a world that has become so fast paced. Great service but never to busy to smile! I would highly recommend giving this restaurant a try. I guarantee if you do, it will quickly become one of your favorites!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype - We stood for 10 minutes waiting to be seated, not real busy but almost every table was dirty, plenty of employees.  Left and went next door - Don't know if the food is good or not, service is horrible!"}
{"text":"True crafted is one of my favorite pizza places to go to when ever I travel to Charlotte, North Carolina. They really make a good pizza here, one of the best I have ever had. And you can get wine with it too! Very sophisticated, very European...I love it! Choose from the menu or create your own, thin crust and lots of options for toppings. I usually create my own with lots of olives, peppers, pepperoni and mozzarella cheese...yes! That is why it's my own combination! Get appetizers to start and gelato to top you off! Nice, modern decor, fast service, fresh tasty pizza everytime. I've never been disappointed and I have brought my husband, and he has brought his friends whenever he is in town to eat here. Always a good option for anyone to consider!"}
{"text":"Went to True with the family after a movie next door.  I remember back when it was Anzi which I never cared for so after a few owner changes here we are.  True is pretty good pizza.  it's artisan style so you're not going to get a slice like from the window in Brooklyn but all in all it's purdy good.  Sweetie and I split the pesto pizza which had great flavor.  Nice pesto flavor, grilled onions and peppers on top with some dusted parm.  I would have liked to see it cooked a bit more since it was a little limp / soggy if you know what I mean. The kids had plain cheese which must have been good since we only had one piece left.  The pies are 10 - 11\" and very reasonably priced.  The service needs a bit of improvement from what I saw yesterday.  It's an order at the counter, they give you a number and bring the food deal.  The kids they have working there are pretty inattentive and are focused on just doing one thing.  I had 4 plates for 5 people delivered and gobs of straw wrappers on the table.  Kid walks by and I ask for another plate and if she could take the straw wrappers, she walks away without the wrappers and brings me back like 6 plates(now I have too many) and never takes the wrappers.  Her job was to bring plates....no other thought involved, throw your own shit out.  Anyhoo.....True Pizza is a solid choice for artisan type pizza at a good price."}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place and so glad I finally did.  The Margherita pizza was delicious and the salads were fresh!!!  The customer service was stellar!!!!!"}
{"text":"One recommendation - egg and bacon pizza is amazing! Sounds strange, but great for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow - this outstanding traditional pizza joint in Stonecrest has it all: good food, GREAT gelato and a fantastic selection of local craft beers! Each one of their delicious pizzas is large enough to feed one hungry grown up, or two not-so-hungry kids. Place your order, then grab a table or sit at the bar and enjoy a cold pint of Copper or Ramble-On Red while the open kitchen fires up your meal. TRUE Pizza is a wonderful, family-friendly pizza place we'll be coming to again and again!"}
{"text":"It's Friday evening after a long week and we all want pizza..however, we don't want to go out because we are 1. exhausted - adults and 2. got a new Xbox game - kids.  So, pick up was what we were all looking for.  Everyone wanted to do the traditional pizza, however, I just got my Sur La Table magazine with all of the great looking specialty grilled pizzas.  So, I wanted one that had arugula and prosciutto.  True Craft Pizza had something for everyone  - we ordered a Grilled Prosciutto de Parma, 4 Cheese White Pizza, Traditional Cheese and a Traditional Cheese with pineapple and ham.  Each one of us got what we wanted.  Pizza was really every good.  Since we did pick-up, I think the crust would have been crispier if it hadn't gone in the box. The 11\" pizza was a good size.  We had two small slices left and I'm sure  they will get eaten for lunch or late night snack.  I don't like paying $44 for pizza, however we all really enjoyed the pizza and I usually pay $37 for two large pizzas (cheese and white) and then end up throwing out half of one of them.  So, this was worth it and I'm sure we will adventure inside at one point, but I'm still a fan of the take out  - I will just probably suggest going there and ordering the pizza versus ordering from home and picking it up (less time in the box)."}
{"text":"The broccoli & cheddar soup is tasty. They added chunks of cheese which gives the already thick soup (yes not at all watery) an extra kick. The bruschutto pizza is a slightly spicy, loaded with arugula acme gets 5 stars. Ore server apologized for the wake & we hadn't even complained.  Class! Thank you for the acknowledgement,  the food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for some quick and easy take out and after the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided to give this place a try. Upon opening the box, I couldn't believe how small and thin the pizza was and the quality was average at best. I really wanted to like this place but, wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times so far and have never had a bad pizza. All of their pizzas are are 11' which allow you to order multiple types and share. To date, I have tried the bacon and egg, pepperoni, sausage and pepper ( my favorite one so far), grilled zucchini, mushroom and eggplant pizza which also had yellow squash on it (my least favorite  but a good vegetarian option- would probably add meat to this if I ordered it again) and  broccoli rabe and sausage pizzas( my second fav). But there are many more I want to try and you can also create your own pizza. The salads are good sized and made to be shared. Love the crispy risotto fritters appetizer! They also serve a variety of beers- some of them locally brewed, and wines. And their gelato is nice way to end the meal.  The last time I went there was with a large group. The staff was very  polite and accommodating, continually checking in with us. This is my new pizza place in Ballantyne after having many disappointing meals at a chain pizza restaurant in the same area. Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We have been here countless times this past year and are high-maintenance customers! We order one Gluten-free pizza, one Gluten-free, no cheese, extra veggies etc etc etc, you catch my drift lol and they have always been amazing with us! We've had a few mix-ups here and there but they have been super quick to correct it. The restaurant is clean and their ingredients are always super fresh!   What REALLY put this place over the top for me was when we ordered 10 pizzas to-go. They were all super specific pizzas and when we got home we realized we were a pizza short! We called the store and an employee drove our pizza to our home almost 30 mins away! Without us even asking! That right there is top notch customer service!  This place is my favorite pizza place in the Charlotte area for so many reasons."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and the service was awesome and quick. All of our food came quick and it was delicious. Whenever my drink ran low it was quickly filled up. Their side salads are a great appetizer and was very good but the pizza was even better. Great crust, sauce and cheese. Loved the waiter can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with kids.  The pizza is very good.  The service is excellent, very quick and very friendly.  We were offered lots of drink refills.  It is clean as well."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch today. Pepperoni pizza was one of the best I've had, homemade ranch was a phenomenal addition, but above all else, the atmosphere and in particular our server was top notch. We sat at the bar and the bartender/server (Receipt said his name was Lamont but who knows if that's always accurate) waited on us. He was both attentive and friendly and definitely a key contribution to a perfect 5-Star pizza lunch!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!   We chomped on a caesar salad, margarita pizza and the mushroom w/sweet onions on it.  I love the charred crust, fresh taste, and we had great service."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Apparently if you go with a large group of friends and laugh too much, they ask you to leave. Food was decent, however the service and the way our group was treated makes me want to never go back again. I would NOT recommend going there!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent wait staff, excellent atmosphere. Try the pizza with figs and basalmic reduction!  Grilled cheese is very tasty, salads are fresh and my family loves, loves, loves the restaurant's Italian version of Nis√ßoise salad. Go eat here. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Then atmosphere is nice, but the ordering process was a let down. Service was spotty and I had to get up numerous times to get items for our meal. This probably because the staff does not get compensated by most customer tipping. There was no place to tip on my credit card receipt, so I left cash on the table.      The house salad toppings was nice, but the simple red wine vinegar dressing was not. They should upgrade to a more refined vinaigrette.     The highlight of the meal wasn't the pizza, but the calamari appetizer. It was nicely fried to perfection. The cost of the meal was $50.00 plus my cash  tip. So  not the greatest value for what we received for our meal."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  If you are Yankee transplant looking for a unique experience, you found it.  The food is fantastic, service is excellent, and the wine and draught beer menu are all great."}
{"text":"We randomly stopped in here for dinner on a Wednesday night - ended up sitting at the bar and we had a great experience.  Started with risotto balls, which were cheesy and delicious and a caesar salad - the dressing was great, a little lemony and definitely homemade.  My husband had the bacon and clam pizza and I had a margarita with meatball - highly recommend both of these.  Value for money was excellent, we took home leftovers which were fantastic the next day.  I purposely sat at the bar so we could get full service and the bartender was great.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I ate here once. I didn't want to order a whole pizza, so I got the grilled cheese sandwich. It was fairly good tasting, but greasier than it needed to be. If the prices were good, I'd give it 4 stars. But almost $10 for a sandwich is a bit expensive. Some of their pizzas looked interesting. Not sure if I will try them again. Just a bit too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Service is good. Good selection of beer. Easy menu.  We started off with the calamari with jalape√±os. It came with marinara sauce and a lemon aioli type of sauce. The flavor was bland for the calamari but the sauces made up for it. Would I get this again? Probably not because to me it's not worth $10.   We for the grilled pizza with marinara sauce and pepperoni and mushrooms. Pepperoni had a good spice to it and the mushrooms were delicious. Pizza was good and fresh but gets soggy really quickly.   I checked in Yelp and got a free scoop of gelato. When I showed it to the girl she told me she didn't know how to do that and asked someone for help. I had to go up to the front and get a refill on my soda.   I will say they work really hard at this restaurant. No one was standing around and they were all working or cleaning. You can tell the restaurant runs really well."}
{"text":"Tried TRUE the other night and loved it. The three of us shared a salad and each tried a different pizza...one kids cheese, my husband had something with sausage, and I had the wood fired pesto pizza. It was delicious. I saved room for gelato (and had leftover pizza for lunch). The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I will definitely go back and if it's that good again, I'll give it another star."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the \"hot oil\" pizza with sausage added. If you like it spicy you should try this one."}
{"text":"I love it when you go to a place and it seems even better than you remember it the last time. Such is the case with True which I've always liked. Took the family there for dinner and there was a nice line but it moved quickly and by the time we ordered at the counter we had a booth waiting for us. The staff was great about asking the line about party size and finding seats.   Between the 5 of us and with 2 hungry teens we got 4 pizzas. I had the white pizza and it was refreshing and not as heavy as your usual. The sausage and broccoli Rabe was also great. I think I had two slices of each and we all had a little leftovers for lunch the next day. Service was quick and attentive and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"First time and the pizza was very good. Waitstaff a little confused finding tables but all and all pizza and crust was awesome."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price.  Love the decor change from the previous restaurants thatwere there. Staff very friendly and checked to make sure we had all we neede. Definately recommend this place.  Pizza tasted wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Wife came home with three salads and two pepperoni pizzas last night. Salads kicked ass, but the pizza crust was off, more like moist naan bread than pizza crust, blaah..."}
{"text":"I went on a crafts expedition to Michael's in Ballantyne today. Right next door: TRUE Crafted Pizza. I mean, it makes sense to get a pizza for yourself at 11am... right?  This is one of those places where you walk up to the counter and order. They bring your food out to your table when it's ready. Overwhelmed by the menu (not that it's massive or anything... just a lot of solid looking items), the guy at the counter walked me through options. Traditional, specialty oven baked, grilled. I went with his suggestion of the garlic & clams oven baked pie. Clams, pancetta, roasted garlic oil, parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Delicious combo... although probably not the best for the breath. No vampire stands a chance after this. I had to stop myself from eating the entire thing in one sitting.   The bar area is really nice. TRUE has a lot of local beers on tap. I went with Root Beer. Hey, it was 11am... someone has to be an adult. Workers were all super friendly. Prices are fair. Gluten free options are also available.   I don't venture out to the Ballantyne a whole lot... that parking lot known as 485 frightens me... but I will be coming back here again during my next adventure out this way. There are a few more pies I must try... plus I didn't save room for any gelato today. Such a rookie mistake. I will be back."}
{"text":"Only been here once before however the care and attention of the staff is amazing along side amazing food it creates the perfect pair. I enjoyed a \"dizzy chicken\" special and it was on point. From the moist and flavorful grilled chicken to the toasted whole grain sliced bread - simply bliss. Loved the avocado slices on it too. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love their bacon egg and cheese pizza it is the perfect brunch item. The service was great and the price was right."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 6 star option!   This is our FAVORITE place for pizza and sandwiches,  their homemade fried mozzarella is to die for.  My daughter lives in Dallas and her first destination, when visiting Charlotte, is True Pizza.  The sandwiches are served on homemade focaccia or sour dough with the chef making a creative sandwich daily.   Today I had the fried chicken cutlet on focaccia with house made pesto and arugula.  Folks, it doesn't get any better than this!  Reasonable high quality fresh food.....and that's TRUE!!!!"}
{"text":"The Prosciutto di Parma is my absolute favorite - light but fragrant. The house-made pesto is also amazing if you like pesto, but can get a bit greasy. Get the Grilled Zucchini, Eggplant & Mushrooms if you love zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms - they were VERY generous with the toppings (esp. the mushrooms like wow I'm so used to getting like 2 mushrooms per slice).  One thing I've noticed about the grilled pizzas is that they tend to have slightly burnt edges and bottoms - not a huge issue if you like crispy crust but can get annoying sometimes when you have to peel the burn areas off. For their specialty pizzas, the sausage and peppers and mushrooms and onions are both good choices (again, always generous on the toppings so you feel like you get your money's worth). The Bacon and Egg is drier and has less cheese than the others. The hot oil pizza is actually very hot like very hot like my mouth was burning an hour after leaving the restaurant hot.   Basically, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza is amazing - I do like the online ordering option (when it works) ... This place gets crazy packed/busy on Friday nights.... There's usually a reason for that - Trust where the people are. My son loved their kids pizzas and actually eats the whole thing...(he doesn't do that anywhere else).  Updated review: Quality and consistency seems to have taken a downturn. I've gotten several BURNT pizzas without an apology or acknowledgement - I gave it several tries to pick up, but unfortunately we are done for awhile. It's overloaded with pre-teens on weekends and  the staff seems abrupt, snobby and uninterested. (Except one woman who seems to be the most genuine about helping and caring for the place but she can't run the whole restaurant)."}
{"text":"In a strip mall location. The have Gluten Free  pizza but no GF appetizers.   I had the spinach, tomato, mushroom and cheese pizza. My husband who is not GF has the white pizza with Alfredo sauce.   We both found the pizza to be average and the sauce on mine was a little to sweet for me."}
{"text":"Environment is casual and cool with a bar...we ordered the grilled pizza and it was not what we were expecting. The crust was soft and we could literally roll it up and eat it so that was disappointing ...the other pizza that other customers ordered looked good!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are awesome and the chicken grilled veggie salad good, though too cold. The chocolate gelato was excellent!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night  for our first time. We ordered sausage and pepperoni true pizza and a house salad. The pizza was good nothing to make it spectacular, just a good pie, and the salad was good. We would go back again."}
{"text":"Great place to take family with children. Great atmosphere fairly quick service. Meatballs are absolutely awesome. Pizzas are great as well. I would def recommend."}
{"text":"This is really good pizza in South Charlotte. Freshly prepped ingredients, all cooked in the open (gas-fired) oven. Great balance of cheese/sauce and slightly charred crust. The pies don't have the feel of your typical over-leavened American dough ball.   Add a great tap selection of Char-Meck breweries, and you've got a good evening out."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Friendly Staff, and Clean. We stopped here while in town for a soccer tournament. Perfect for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"TRUE Crafted Pizza is amazing! Food is great!  Atmosphere is great! Service was fast on on point!  Employees very nice and friendly! I live in Los Angeles, CA and was visiting Charlotte, it reminds me of LA pizza. The variety of pizza are great!  Meatball sandwich great too!   Love this place, added to my list of favorite restaurants in Charlotte!     TRY iT!  you will love it and will return every week!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my dad and ordered the garlic and clam pizza, sans pancetta.  The crust was crisp and light, with a slight char from the oven - my fave!  The garlic was present and strong, but not biting - and a great compliment for the clams, which were served whole.    My dad ordered the sausage and peppers pizza, and noted that he likes the tomato sauce because it's simple and lets the ingredients shine and meld together.  Highly recommend for a casual meal or take out!  The service was also great - everyone was so friendly!"}
{"text":"Toggled between a 3 and a 4 star review.  I decided upon the 4 star because it's a place I'd come back to when I'm in the area.  Come to the Charlotte area for a weekend at Carowinds. We wanted pizza and saw the sign off the interstate for it so we stopped. A little disfunction on the set up on the way in bc we needed time to look at the menu but we were blocking the people behind us.  Pizza was good, price was ehhh. I thought $10- $15 for an 11 inch pizza is a bit much. We also tried the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was also amazing but again the price of $8 seems a bit much.  Restaurant was clean and modern. Service was nothing to buzz about,  but nothing to complain either. It was also 915 on a Saturday night so not much expectation. The lady that brought us our plates for pizza was kind enough to exchange the dirty plate out without grumble.  So we'd probably visit again if we were in the mood for a pizza while we were in the area."}
{"text":"We really like this place. The pizza is alway very good. I always get the basic pepperoni and it's been good every time. The pizzas are the size that you order your own, my wife usually leaves one or two slices where I can eat the whole thing. The only downside to this place is that you order at the counter, they give you a number and then the fun of finding a place to sit begins. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night it gets a little difficult to find a table. So far we have been able to find a table before our pizza comes out each time, but it's just kind of a pain in the butt. Other than the table issue if you haven't been here I would say give it a try- it's really good!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!  Super fresh from the oven to your table.  The speciality pizzas are on point, or you can create your own.  The service was excellent.  They also have my favorite pumpkin ale for the fall season.  We have dined in and ordered takeout, but the best is when you dine in.  They salads are pretty fresh too.  Their house made ranch dressing is one of the best I have ever tasted.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing foooood!!!! That calamari is to die for, it has slices of fried jalapeno and freshly made tartar sauce that has a kick of lemon.  The 4 cheese grilled cheese sandwich is superb! It tastes like a crispy calzone and when paired with the homemade tomato soup it is magical. lol  This is not your traditional pizza place it's fresh it's gormet and FULL of Flavor!! The salads put some high dollar restuarants to shame.  LOve Love Love"}
{"text":"I'm from New York and was dreading the pizza disappointment. Well, let me tell you that I was so shocked when me and my diehard Guinea boyfriend took a bite of the True Traditional Tomato and mozzarella pizza! I thought I was home again. The crust was a little charred and chewy, yummo!! The tomato sauce was so fresh and the mozzarella was melted and stringy. Perfection!!!. I order the Prosciutto Di Parma with Arugula, fig preserve, parmesan, and asiago. The prosciutto was sliced a little too thick, tho. OMG!! Theyre killin me!! But, that went home with us, because I kept eating the regular pie. Salad was boring, too much oregano, bland iceberg, but whoda hell cares???  My pizza was the shit!!!! I spoke to the chef who told me he was from Connecticut, close to New York so that explained the deliciousness and authenticity of his pizza. True Crafted are True Pizza Artisans. My fat ass will be back many times!!"}
{"text":"I don't know...There's something about this place I don't care for. I had a flatbread, it was good. Wine was good. But the look just feels kind of...sterile, bright, white, cold. Very uncomfortable and not a relaxing place. The AC was on so high when I went that I had to sit outside. And it's hard to figure out what you're supposed to do. Order at the counter? But then there are waitresses? This place just confused me. I don't understand what it's supposed to be. Takeout-ish or a restaurant and then there is the bar in the middle? Just weird."}
{"text":"To get an explanation of the restaurant, read prior reviews, I will save my fingers the typing in that regard.  This place is where Anzi's pizza used to be in the Stonecrest shopping center.  Went with my GF, we got: -rizzoto cheese balls with marinara as an appetizer -original round pie with pancetta, mushrooms, black olives, sausage, and mozz. -square grilled pizza with pepperoni and mozz. -2 soft drinks $38.xx  Rizzoto balls were awesome.  You could make a restaurant based solely on these!  I would love options to add toppings into these...bacon bits or mushrooms or something.  They are great though.  The marinara was good, needs more salt though to make the taste pop.  Round pie:  Amazing taste, pancetta used very sparingly though (not worth the $2.00), crust too poofy for the size of the pie.  I felt like the slices were 70% topped, 30% dough.  These pie's need to come with complimentary marinara dip sauce so I have something for all that crust.  It's great tasting crust, but I'm hungry for pizza not bread.  Pizza ends up being more of an 7\" pie when you get all that crust outta the way.  Taste was amazing....value just not there.  You basically have a little personal NY style pizza with a bunch of soft poofy crust....I need 2 of those to fill me up...but not at $8.50 each pre-topped...sorry.  Square grilled pie:  Crust lighter and chewier.  I loved it.  Toppings go all the way out to the edge of the pie which is awesome...however the amount of cheese was very lacking.  Note to self; always add extra cheese as a topping and hope that gets you to the perceived amount of cheese that the round one has.  The pepperoni was AMAZING.  I'm fairly sure its the same smoked pepperoni that Portofinos uses....(which is my favorite pizza in Charlotte BTW).  Sauce was nice, had some nice big chunks of crushed tomato.  This pizza is the one to get assuming you order it with extra cheese and a bunch of toppings.  Fountain drinks:  Syrup to water ratio could be tweaked, the Coke was a bit watery and as I've noticed with restaurants who do this...the city water taste is even more noticeable.    Price:  Kinda steep for a novelty concept.    Service:  Awesome!!  The girl at the counter walked us through the concept and the process.  Other staffers would walk around and check on you, very friendly, pretty smiles, showed sincerity and seemed to enjoy their jobs.  This place does not have a spot on the receipts to write in a tip.  I'm sure a tip isn't necessary since they don't really \"wait on\" you, just run your food out and then clear the table (ala Showmars, etc)...so I felt guilty that I didn't even have a dollar on me to give the table clearing staff since they were so friendly.  I definitely plan on coming back here....I feel this place could be amazing if the perceived value was increased by making a few tweaks as mentioned above (less crust size on the round pie, more cheese on the grilled, more syrup in the drinks, complimentary dip sauces for round pie's crust).  Parmesan cheese in the shakers is high quality real cheese also...very tasty.  Owner was there helping out, looks like a nice guy."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried TRUE on a Saturday for a quick lunch. The place is pretty cool but I wasn't a fan of how you pay, etc. They have a small bar but no true bartender so we were left with no drinks for quite sometime. We tried the meatballs as an appetizer and the sauce was delicious! We then just got a regular pie with pepperoni. It was pretty good and really don't have any complaints. I think it was just the service that wasn't that great. But maybe it was because they were slow. Hopefully next time will be different as the food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I visited true crafted pizza last night with my boyfriend and it was a wonderful experience! I food was fresh and flavorful, and the staff were so incredibly nice. The menus selection has something for everyone and the fresh local produce makes it!"}
{"text":"Good pizza great service. Later in the in the evening on weekend crazy busy. Just shows you  great food"}
{"text":"Tried the oven baked cheese pizza which had a crispy crust with just the right amount of char and tasty cheese.  Gelato was a great way to end the meal - rich and creamy."}
{"text":"Came here for a beer event, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food! They have local beers, and they also use local ingredients. We got to try several items off the menu, and I have to say I was most excited about the breakfast pizza and the risotto fritters. I also had some salted caramel gelato and it was yummy! I don't venture out here often as I live close to uptown, but I would come back. Staff is very kind and hospitable, and if you read my previous reviews you know this is very important to me."}
{"text":"First time ordering take out here. Got our order in just under the wire before they closed. They made a great pie. I had the grilled pepperoni pizza and added sausage. It was awesome and I'll be back. We also had the mushroom/onion regular pie and it was tasty as well. The calamari was good but would be best eaten while dining in."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife on a Wednesday night.  Nice deco and cool bar setup.  Cashiers were friendly and efficient.  Surprised that they only offered personal pizza although they were of adequate size.  Both of our pizzas had excellent quality toppings and the dough was very fresh and cooked perfectly.  We had the calamari appetizer which was a large portion cooked and seasoned very well.  The fried mozzarella was excellent and unique in that it was a very gooey creamy cheese.  Price was ok however the waitress's never checked on us or offered to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. I had the Garlic & Clam Pizza. Very garlicky and very good. It was a little tough but still great. Good atmosphere and excellent service. Pizzas are big enough to share. Definitely will go back. Pizza rivals Brixx and Hawthorne's.  Pizza is a little tough for young toddlers."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get frustrated with going out to eat.   It's not because the service is bad. It's not because the food was bad. In fact, it's more frustration in myself, that I can't eat everything on a menu in one sitting. And that the restaurant offers so many tempting dishes that I can afford. That is how my first experience at TRUE went.  The model is order-at-the-counter, they'll bring it to you (a-la McAlisters or something like that), so it's a casual environment with lots of families there. I will say that because the restaurant kind of revolves around their kitchen, it's pretty toasty in there, but it wasn't terrible.   I had never seen grilled pizza before, and neither had The Lady, so we both ordered one. I got the Prosciutto Di Parmi and she ordered the House-made pesto pies. These. Were so. good.  Crispy flatbread, fresh ingredients, and really unique pizzas will keep me coming back. I can't wait to try the other pies, and maybe a few other items too. Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"We have only ever done take out, but the bacon egg pizza is incredible. Pizzas are slightly larger than a personal-sized pie. Just enough for a big eater or enough for 2 if you have a big salad along with it. Outdoor seating is OK, but just faces the parking lot. They also have a mobile unit that you can hire for catering."}
{"text":"Loads of varieties to choose from. Very good crust   We tried Hot Oil Pizza and loved it. Nice \"kick\" with flavor of chilli oil and peppers. Gelato options were limited but worth trying."}
{"text":"I like how this place feels fresh and clean when you walk in.  It definitely has a \"cool\" vibe and the service was great!  We were trying to make an 8pm movie and once the owner heard that he let us know that he put our order in front of others so we could get out on time.  Very kind and thoughtful.  We tried the BLT grilled pizza as recommended by the cashier.  It was okay but not great.  I was a little disappointed because I thought the crust would be crispy but this was more doughy and soft than I expected.  There wasn't enough bacon and the bacon that was on there was more fatty than crispy so that wasn't exactly exciting.  The sauce was a ranch dressing which was very good but it almost made the bread soggy so I'm not sure that was the best route.  It was basically a salad on bread..which I guess I should have seen coming.  I think I would order one of the marina or pesto based pizzas next time.  I will say that I loved the smoky flavor from the pizza being grilled.  I definitely want to come back and try something different!  I also tried the side of house-made meatballs.  They were great!!  They didn't come with very much marinara sauce but they had some mozzarella on top and they had very good flavor.  You could tell they were very fresh.    I think True has a good thing going and I will support them.  They also serve a few gelato flavors, beer and wine.    I wouldn't say it is the most affordable place for \"faster\" food but they aren't too bad.   Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"We tried True pizza for the first time during lunch and it was a big hit with the family. You order first and they give you number card to take to your table. There's ample seating in and outside of the restaurant (covered and on the large sidewalk). We sat by the pizza station so the kids could watch pizzas being made. We ordered the classic cheese pizza for the kids, a white pizza for the two of us and a Caesar salad. They brought us our drinks and food, and throughout our meal multiple staff stopped by to check on us.  The pizzas were delicious and I would say 1 pizza and a salad could easily be shared by two people. The kids loved the pizza but it's definitely a firmer/chewier crust that required a lot of effort for my little one to bite off pieces. My only suggestion would be to use less dressing or have it on the side because the salad was pretty drenched in it.  We would return!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh spinach & arugula salad with walnuts & goat cheese. Pepperoni pizza & mushrooms excellent. The rectangular shaped pizza is pretty good. Salted Carmel Gelato is wonderful."}
{"text":"My wife and I met here on my way back from work with our kid.  Easily located in Stonecrest with plenty of parking and easy visibility in the shopping center.  You walk in, place your order at a counter, then go sit down.  The place is large enough inside to sit and not feel crowded.  A large tree table provides a spot for a large group (12+).    We ordered a Cheese and Pepperoni pizza with an order of fried mozzarella.  The service was pretty good - ordering was the only place where it could be improved.  Once we were seated we were waited on pretty well considering it was a counter ordering model.  The fried mozzarella came out promptly so we could eat it before the pizza came.  It was OK - nothing spectacular, but not bad.  The pizzas came out - they were moderately sized, thin crust that is not crispy, but not soggy either.  Sauce is well balanced - not heavy or too sweet.  Plenty of cheese and pepperoni, and overall a pretty good pie.  A little pricey per square inch of pizza, but not crazy - much better than Inizios for the price point.  They need some better beer prices for sure though!"}
{"text":"Since the Ballantyne Wellness Fair when they had their Food Truck out passing out free samples, i've been craving to return. Today I finally made it in and ordered Take Out. The menu was a bit confusing if you ask me. What's the difference between a Traditional Pizza, a Speciality Oven Baked Pie & a Signature Grilled Pizza I asked. They must get this question all of the time because I was told that technically there are only two types of pizza & he pulls out 2 pizza paddles and says one is round and has a crust, the other is square and doesn't have the crust. Why not just put this on the menu? I'd rather that than receive a presentation every time I forget. But anyway I placed my order, Grilled Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Pepperoni, Calamari no Jalapenos and Cheese Wedges. As I waited I was offered a complimentary drink. The staff is very attentive. I was constantly checked on and assured my order was coming up. Not only by the person who checked me out, but by everyone else as well. I received my order and opened everything to check it before I left, where's the extra pepperoni?!?! One of the staff says \"Are there 8 pepperoni on it?\" I say no there are more than 8. They say then it's extra pepperoni because the regular only comes with 8. ARE YOU SERIOUS???? A complete waste of my $2. What a scam!! As I waited, I saw other pizzas go by loaded with toppings, but they skimp on the pepperonis? I checked Yelp and it looks like I had the same amount of pepperoni as in every other picture. So either everyone only orders extra pepperoni or they are super cheap & I was robbed $2 worth of pepperoni!! I'm going with the latter. I checked in with my Yelp app and saw the offer a Free Small Gelato so I claimed that and chose the Vanilla flavor. Now how did everything taste? Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No complaints. I loved everything about everything. Really the only thing that kept them from getting 5 stars was their pepperoni scam. Save your $2, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem this is!  This establishment would receive six stars if there were six to give.    I went here with a group of 10 moms, each of us brought an infant with us.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly.  The service was amazing and the food was excellent.    I had a meatball sub and I'd order it again.  The pizzas were fantastic and the aromas that filled the air would make someone who isn't even hungry want to eat again.  Even the salads looked appetizing, and I'm not a salad fan!  I cannot wait to go back to this place-- they're doing everything right!"}
{"text":"One of the most disappointing meals we've had in Charlotte! Not only was the crust burned but the sauce just didn't have much flavor. Paying $30 for two small pizzas is ridiculous and so not worth it. I'm usually a fan of mom and pop shops but in this case I'd choose Diminos next time."}
