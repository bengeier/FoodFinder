{"text":"We've ordered from here several times and each time I forget I don't enjoy the food until it arrives. I got chicken chow mien, which comes with some sort of flat on traditional crunchy noodle. The sauce is clear (ick) and my recent order was almost entirely onions, barely any chicken. My husband got hunan beef that he said was ok. We also split spring rolls (mostly cabbage inside) and won ton soup. The food is cheap, mediocre, and they do deliver. I'm writing this review so I remember not to order from here again."}
{"text":"The flavor of their food is above the rest in the area. This is our new go to place for great Chinese food. There are other places that get more business but that doesn't equate to better. Stop by you'll be glad you did. The reason for a 4 star rating is because I ordered shrimp chopy suey, the flavor was fabulous but the presentation of veggies and shrimp lacked a 5 star rating. We've ordered here a couple of times and all other dishes were fantastic!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese in the area. Friendly and quick service. The food is always fresh! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible. We got the spring rolls, won ton soup, crab ragoons, shrimp lo mein, general tso's and donuts for dessert. Wow wow wow! Friendly and on time too. Best Chinese we have ever had!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering deliver from here for about 12 years straight. It is the only Chinese fast food I enjoy. There are Asian cuisine fast food nearer to me but I prefer this restaurant. Their broccoli and chicken is delicious. The chicken fried rice is wonderful. They have great prices and coupons too. And they deliver so incredibly quick to be located a bit far from my home. Never disappoints. Great fast Chinese for one of those nights in watching movies and relaxing. They also have kids menu of chicken nuggets and fries if you need to order the picky ones something."}
{"text":"I will say this is the best Chinese food in the west park area I have had so far. The prices are fair and the food was good. The kung po chicken  was good but not really spicy at all next time I will ask for extra spicy. The hunan beef was good and had more kick to it than the kung po. We did get a order of 3 crab ragoon from the website as they have free food and drinks when you spend a certain dollar amount but they did not include any sweet and sour sauce with not sure if they just forgot or if it's not included with the free order. The sauce is what I expected tasty but had quite a bit oil mixed into to create it.  The delivery time took close to an hour after we submitted our order. So if you are looking for your non authentic Chinese food fix the you will enjoy this place as I did.  Had the food gotten to us faster and they included sweet and sour sauce would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the Westpark area. Good portion of meat and yummy lo mein. The spicy items really aren't that spicy though so I always all for them to be extra spicy."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and decided to place a delivery order. I was very happy with the food quality, fair pricing, and fast delivery.  This was some of the best Chinese I've had in a long time. I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for about 2 years now and the food is great.  They have always impressed me with the yummy food and the quick delivery.  Seriously you order and 20 minutes later - you got it.  That is until today.  Today I placed an order for an employee who has lunch from 11:30 - 12:15, so I called at 11:07am expecting the usual quick delivery which would have been perfect for the 11:30 lunch.  The driver showed up after the employee's lunch was over at 12:20pm, and then the driver didn't speak any english and completely made a scene just standing in our lobby because he couldn't understand that the guy had already went back to work and I wasn't paying for HIS lunch.  Then I called the place to have them call the driver and I got transferred 2x because no one understood me and then finally was hung up on by the manager.. So its safe to say that no one from here will be ordering from Spring Garden again.  Which is sad, we only ordered from them for chinese."}
