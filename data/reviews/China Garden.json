{"text":"I've gotten pick-up orders from here many times. It's standard Americanized Chinese food that hits the spot whenever I'm driving by and get a craving. The food is promptly made (about 10 minutes after I call in my order) and the vegetables taste fresh. I'm a big fan of their crab rangoons; there's lots of filling in them compared to the rangoons from other places. The sauce and meat in my meals isn't as flavorful as other Chinese take-outs have been, but it's still tasty. And my experience with the staff has been fine. Also FYI, it's cash only, and there's an ATM right outside by the door. I've never eaten in (there's a few tables) or in the buffet that's attached next door, so I can't speak on that. But overall, if you're getting a craving for some inexpensive Chinese and you're in the area, might as well give it a try."}
{"text":"Service is fast. Staff is very friendly.  Food is always good. Pleasant atmosphere. Reasonable prices.  They offer takeout too."}
{"text":"Dette er en av mine favoritt spisesteder. Veldig fintlokal med god service og mat. Forreten og hovedrettene er kjempe gode. Eneste grunnen for at de ikke får full pott hos meg, er på grunn av språk kunskapene der. Litt vel vanskelig å kommunisere med servitøren der som tydeligvis jobber hver dag. Så har du noen spesielle allergier eller noe sånt, så ha tålmodighet og bruk god tid til å forklare henne det."}
{"text":"Owner cooks, wife serves and talks a lot. Food is well prepared and they are the nicest people. Plastic forks and tins to eat out of and only a few tables but the food is good for southern chinese food. Never had a bad experience and you can ask the owner to cook it any way you want and he'll do it no questions except to get it right the way you want it."}
{"text":"fucking amazing. this Chinese food opened a can of whoop ass on my palate. I very much appreciated the open kitchen style, it ensured me that there was no shady shit goin on back there. much appreciated China garden, I'll let u fuck me up next time I'm rolling thru. keep it real. *double chest pound, peace sign*"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this restaurant. Its my favorite in the area. I mostly get take out but there are times I will go with my mother and we will sit and enjoy a great meal in a beautiful dining area. The staff is always super friendly and go above and beyond to make sure everything is right. I highly recommend this restaurant. Especially in the new location.  I'm very fussy about my won ton soup and crab Rangoon and this place makes both absolutely perfect in my eyes."}
{"text":"The food is not that good,  don't have a lot of option, when I get there and get to see the food it was pretty dry. It makes me think how long is that food been there. Delivery food was better then the buffet I guess because they cooked fresh. And for the price if I want to pay a little little bit more I can go to mandarin where I have more option to choose. I just thought I'll give this place a try. But, ya 1 visit is enough to judge it. The service is okay nothing that will make me wants to come back.  Sad coz it's so close to my place."}
{"text":"Delicious food with nice presentation. We had the healthy options with sauce on the side. Average portions and on the pricey side. It was very clean and service was excellent. Will visit again and maybe try the sushi."}
{"text":"I am always disappointed with the delivery, yet always try to give people a 2nd, 3rd chance. They used up their last chance last night. We ordered a meal, and some sides at 9:25. we were told 45 min. delivery, totally undestandable. 10:30 food arrives, everything but eggrolls and rice, which might I point out is the main part of the dish. i called before the guy left my driveway, 20 min they would bring my rice and other forgotten items, that i paid for. 11:30 still no sign. i called back and the lady said, were busy. i gave up, at my subpar food sans rice. after midnight i had someone at my door to bring me forgotten items. Horrible service, rude employees and to expensive, since i still never got what i orderded."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out. While the food was good, it took forever to get the food. Also, they don't offer brown rice. They say they do, but then tell you that fried rice is brown rice. However, cheap and easy and tasty."}
{"text":"Only purchased a lg. House Fried Rice. It was so bland and absolutely no flavor. Its nearly $10 for the order, so I'm not going to eat there again if they can't even have good rice. Sorry, but I've never been to a Chinese place that didn't have that delicious, greasy, salty rice."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, I got in and only eat for like 5 mins, everything there was salty and gross."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has dramatically gone down.  They're delivery is less than desirable.   Will take over 1 hour and they are not even sorry.  The food will arrive cold. Don't call cause the English is less than desirable.  They are not even regrettable that you are dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Having tried my favorite Chinese entree from every place that will deliver and a handful of those that won't, I can honestly say China Garden makes the best Beef and Broccoli that I can find. The flavor is spot on. The portion is always trying to burst out of the box. The beef is tender and the sauce is thick, flavorful, and surprisingly low on grease. The price for the quality is absolutely perfect.  I can't say I order a lot of products from them because usually when I want Chinese, I want Beef and Broccoli which these folks do flawlessly.  The only downside of this place is that they don't deliver. If they did, I wouldn't eat Chinese from anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local takeout. Boneless spare ribs are the best thing on the menu. My kids love the sweet and sour chicken. I love the chicken and broccoli and the dragon Phoenix. Decent wonton soup. Decent lo Mein.  Great service. Consistent quality."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!   Waited close to 45 minutes for an order of chicken wings.  This place is not organized!  Sucks!  Now that I taste the food it makes me wonder how anyone can call this good.  It's greasy and horrible.  It all went to the trash.  The only thing that was good was fortune cookie and that's because its made elsewhere."}
{"text":"China Garden does simple standards well and for a great price...my favorites are Hunan chicken and anything from \"special diet menu\""}
{"text":"The only reason I order from this place is that they deliver both beer and cigarettes. Their food is average but decently priced. Would recommend the egg foo young."}
{"text":"Sat to eat and the place was freezing, the buffet was terrible. most food was either left out too long or not cooked properly. Never going back to this place."}
{"text":"WARNING  Stay Clear from this place. Unless your are looking for bad food and service."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and I thought that I attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact I was sooooo hungry. Well my 2nd time and for a Chinese Buffet, this place is fantastic. The restaurant itself is very clean. The buffet is also very clean and even though I showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. The amount of choice is less than just about all the Chinese Buffets that I have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. All the patrons here are American, so this isn't the Asian place where the Asians eat. It's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. I would certainly return. Giving it 7.5 Knuckles out of 11."}
{"text":"Food was never that good but they had a wonderful server named Joyce who had us coming every other week. Now we go twice a year at most.  Hire back Joyce (and mix up the buffet dishes once in a while) and we'll come back"}
{"text":"Had a guy waiter and only came to our table to drop off food had to go to front to ask for drinks and soy and then when we were more then half way done eating he came over and just took the soy without asking if I was done with it. Never will go back again poor service"}
{"text":"Not that bad.  Recipes are a little uninspired but overall decent.  Egg rolls are good, generals chicken is good but not spicy enough.  I get aggravated when I'm standing at the counter trying to order and they take 3 calls from call in orders."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet.    I'm not sure why there are any negative reviews of this place.  We have been ordering delivery from China Garden for the last 7 or so years.  The food is ALWAYS delivered HOT and fast.  The food is very good, tasty and consistent.  I can only think of one time when they screwed up our order and that's nothing over the course of 7 years.    So, if you're looking for very good Chinese Food (Delivery), at a good price, then this is your place.  Done."}
{"text":"Thank goodness I live so close by to such a great little Chinese takeout place! This place has never disappointed me. I've been coming here for 4 years now, and it will continue to be my safe go-to place for some good Chinese food. Yum!"}
{"text":"Aluminum foil pans are a sure fire indicator that Chinese food is bomb and this place is no exception. With dine in they give you complimtetary fried noodles and duck sauce. Food was great, service was great, atmosphere was great and they have alcohol. 2 apps and 2 lunch specials came up to $22. Will highly recommend to anyone in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat so I can't comment on many items on the menu.  But their veggie Lomein has an almost smoky flavor to it, and the chow mein was loaded with vegetables.  Usually it is quick, though on weekends there can be a bit of a wait.  I like the people who run it.  You can see back into the kitchen and it looks clean and it is very reasonably priced.  I have to spice it up a bit, but that's OK with me."}
{"text":"The pricing is good for a buffet style restaurant, but a lot of the food they serve comes from a freezer. But I would say that most of it still tastes good. Some of their deserts aren't very good, as they seem to taste stale. Decent ice cream though."}
{"text":"China Garden appears to be your run of the mill Chinese take out place (standard menu, decor, etc) , but I was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  We had both the cashew chicken and seafood delight, and both were awesome.  Also worth noting they are super fast (food was ready within 10 minutes).  I'd easily say this is the best Chinese takeout place I've found since I've been in Pittsburgh (about a year).  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has really stepped up since it was in its prior location.  Not only has the food jumped to a level of near gourmet Chinese, but the decor is excellent.   Food was great.  I couldn't even wait to take a picture. I had to eat most of it first."}
{"text":"Supersøte ansatte som det er umulig å ikke forelske seg i, de setter virkelig pris på deg og gjør sitt beste. Maten er helt ok og billig. Jeg trekker to stjerner fordi maten kunne vært et hakk bedre, men i lille Moss kan man ikke forvente så stort mye heller så denne plassen har helt klart den beste maten innenfor denne kategorien."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi.... Great traditional dishes. Great service. This is based on eating there over 30 times not just once. They are consistently great."}
{"text":"Take out food was great...good taste...Restaurant needs a good cleaning...wouldn't do the eat in because of the filth....give it a good cleaning then I'll give the 5 stars. ..."}
{"text":"Extremely unhappy with this restaurant. We ordered delivery and they messed up the order. They refused to correct it and deliver the correct item, claiming they were \"too busy\". They also refused to credit my credit card for the portion they erred. Instead, they offered to give me some \"free\" white rice on my next order.  The food itself wasn't good either. I will definitely not order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've tried almost all of the Chinese food places in the Concord area and this is by far my favorite. I'm sad that today was my last order here due to moving. I recommend this place if you love hole in the wall Chinese food. The General Tsos is my to go food."}
{"text":"It's your normal Chinese restaurant. The food is consistently good. The restaurant is normally clean. My family and I have been going there for many years and if you're in the neighborhood and want delicious Chinese food this is a good stop."}
{"text":"Not good I would not go back. I got Sweet and sour chicken . The chicken was soggy and the sauce taste old. Fried rice has pork in it- a warning would've been nice- all around terrible"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant online and thought I would give it a try . I'm from Los Angeles been here in Vegas for 15 years and it's still hard to find good Chinese food here. Ordered the  lunch special Orange  chicken it was good and so was the fried rice I would have given it 5 stars but the chow mein was made with spaghetti noodles and wasn't very good but I will be coming back here"}
{"text":"This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me, that's a no-go signal.  On the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there."}
{"text":"My go to place for chinese food.  It is family owned.  They have some of the best fried rice!  It is better than most take out places in charlotte."}
{"text":"Affordable, above average Chinese takeout fair can be found here.  There isn't anything really unique on the menu, but they do have really good Angel Hair and Lo Mein dishes.  I've never been disappointed with their food, and the prices are right on par if not slightly better than some of the other Chinese places in town."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 chances and both times my lo mein tasted like dirt. I refuse to ever go back. I've never had a place mess up lo mein and how do you make it taste like dirt."}
{"text":"I love China Garden. The portions here are so big, and the food quality is great. Both takeout and delivery are impeccable. Great lunch deals too!"}
{"text":"Just got takeout from here, the main appeal of this place will be huge portions at low prices.  I'm a pretty big eater and I couldn't finish the lunch portion General Tso's chicken.  The taste is nothing special, it tasted like any buffet Chinese food.  I might come back whenever I'm feeling hungover and just need greasy food that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over ten years. My wife and I love this place!  The dining area is... well... It isn't.  A few tables (3 or4) in the \"order\" area and that's it. Don't expect anything from the atmosphere. This is strictly a take out joint!  But... The food is phenomenal! It is owned by a local family whose children all attend the local schools. The help staff are all local high school students and they are very friendly.  The food... It really is great! I usually get the Beef and Garlic sauce combination dinner and my wife gets a variety of dishes depending on her appetite. What can I say... I like something, I stick with it!  Their dumplings were really good up until about 2 years ago. Now they are fantastic! I don't know what they did... But now we have to get two separate orders of dumplings. No more sharing one order, they are that good!"}
{"text":"Food tasted like it's been hanging around for days. Fast service but feels like you are being rushed out of the empty restaurant.  Not a lot of options for the cost."}
{"text":"I ordered for their quick delivery. After an hour and fifteen minutes I called to ask when my food would be here, they hung up on me. Way to keep it classy. I wish there was a way to give less than one star. Fortune cookies good tho..."}
{"text":"Well, all I can say is you have to try in order to find out. I found out and now I know I will not go back, Won Ton soup? They weren't kidding. That is ALL it was won tons and broth, and not a very tasty broth at that. The meat in side was simply strips of beef. Meh. Fried rice? NO flavor, egg rolls crispy but too fishy tasting. I took one bite of the shrimp in lobster sauce and that was all. WAY TOO salty. The boneless ribs were probably the only thing WORTH eating. Definitely a big thumbs down from me!"}
{"text":"China Garden offers good Chinese Food Takeout. There is very limited booth seating inside the restaurant, but they are a nice place to sit while you wait for your food. They have great service, and they take your order quickly, and have your food ready even when they are busy."}
{"text":"Cash only.  Food's pretty good, decent price.  The atmosphere isn't very good though.  I hate that they use the very cheapest plastic forks; you know the kind that can barley support the weight of the food.  A heavy duty fork costs an extra $0.001 per fork...  It's also kind of weird that there are like two Chinese restaurant right next to each other \"China Garden\" and \"China Buffet\".  I sort of assume they have the same owner and probably the same cooks.  But that's just an assumption.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, it's just a little weird.  And just to be clear, this review is about \"China Garden\".  I looked at some of the other reviews, and I think some people left reviews for \"China Buffet\" under \"China Garden\".  Hence showing the confusion.  I'll probably come back though."}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time. It's a buffet, reasonable prices. We stopped going (forever) because we found hair in our food... Not just a little hair... A lot. I'll never return."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  My favorite is Chicken Almond Ding! Has a large portion and nuts are plentiful.  Great delivery time always delivered on time or early.  If there is a problem with order they always make it right. Great pricing and large portions.  Delivery or pick up only.  Moderate prices.  A neighborhood favorite in Lakewood"}
{"text":"Ordered Sesame chicken and chicken noodle soup for delivery. They quoted me 40 minutes, it took a little over an hour to get here. Strike one.   The soup was the best part of the meal; juicy chunks of white meat chicken in a savory broth, mixed with noodles and onions. Yum!  The sesame chicken? Hands down THE WORST I've ever eaten. The chicken was hard, over cooked and over breaded. There may have been a 25% chicken to breading ratio (and I'm being generous). The broccoli was over cooked and limp. The white rice was the highlight of the entrée tasting well, like rice.   How do you screw up a classic like sesame chicken and call yourself a \"Chinese\" restaurant?? I would think twice about purchasing anything that comes breaded at this place unless your into playing hide and go seek with your protein. Needless to say, I will never order from here again!"}
{"text":"Really bummed. I ordered online and they charged my debit card. Ordered because I have influenza and hot and sour soup helps immensely. So when I called I got a machine that stayed they were closed. My estimated delivery time was 1/2 ago :( how did they take my order and my money after 10p if they closed at 10p! The other places on the app wouldn't take my order because they were closed. That's what is supposed to happen. Not this mess. I'm exhausted and hungry with a respiratory infection. Now the places that were open are closed so I can't even order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Koselig kinesisk restaurant som har vært i Moss i alle år!  Stedet er akkurat slik man ser for seg en kinarestaurant når man har noen på samvittigheten. Akvarie, eldre asiatisk personale som smiler og ikke behersker språket bedre enn det som står på menyen etterfulgt av en del takk, kinesiske lamper på veggen med hyggelig asiatisk musikk og hyggelig rolig stemning. Litt som en restaurant som henger igjen fra 90 tallet ( og kanskje tidligere, 86 mod selv...)  Uansett så er dette et sted med ALLTID hyggelig og serviceinnstilt personale. Maten er rimelig og kommer noenlunde fort til en grei pris, og her er dagens rett ( som forsåvidt har vært lik sålenge jeg har vært her) en grei middag til en 100 lapp om du velger å drikke vann.  Maten smaker slik kinamat vanligvis gjør i Norge så ingenting over the top, men et helt ålreit og hyggelig sted og ta en rimelig matbit med gjengen om man skal unne seg litt!"}
{"text":"Look, if you have a hankering for Chinese food at a reasonable price, and you're based anywhere in the general vicinity of Bakery Square, China Garden fulfills the requirement.  I went to the buffet this evening, and it's really what anyone would expect from a Chinese buffet in a strip mall.  Sure, some of the food might taste a little different. Different cooks prepare dishes in different ways. And hot food sitting in steam trays for a little while isn't going to be the freshest. It's but a minor hurdle to get over.  OK, the service might not be great. You have to realize that in Asian cultures, it's customary for restaurant staff to mostly leave patrons alone to enjoy their meals.  And yes, the selection isn't big. It's not that big of a place. It's tucked into A STRIP MALL.  I think it's good. I don't live in the area, so I probably won't go back for a while. But for everyone us reading this, it's worth a try.  By the way, the sleeper hit is the macaroni and cheese. I went back for a second helping. And just try a serving spoonful of the things you like. You can go back for more if there's a particular food item that you like."}
{"text":"Thankfully they stopped by our neighborhood and put there menu on our mailbox. We were in the mood for Chinese take out and didn't know who to try around our new area. We got the General Tso's shrimp, wonton soup and some spring rolls and for Chinese take out it was extremely good. The shrimp were big and perfectly cooked. They had alto of huge wontons in the wonton soup. We will definitely try them out again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, brought to me quite quick despite it being friday! Read all the negative reviews. Some people just need to stop... We all have bad days at times!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered lunch, General Tso chicken that came with fried rice. Big portion just over F6. There was a young gentleman at the front that really made me feel at home.  Food really good. 6 booths and take out available. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We ordered several dishes and unfortunately the dishes with the fried chicken  (general tsao and sesame chicken) were not good at all because the frozen fried chicken pieces they used taste old and are chewy and both were smothered in too much sauce.    The broccoli in the broccoli beef was soggy and the beef was gray and chewy.   Unfortunately, it's another sub-standard, Concord Chinese take-out."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here since they are sooo close to my house for pick up. I ordered family dinner A and my family isn't too big on soups so we opted out on those. But the receptionist on the phone said we could substitute for more egg rolls or crab rabgoon which was very thoughtful! They told me it would be ready in about 20-25 min and they did not fail to deliver with in that time frame. When we got there is was packed and ready to go. We just had to ask for chili sauce. I was also excited to try the boba! I've only tried the Thai Tea.I did see they have a couple of flavors for slushees but i have yet to try them out. Any other drinks they have their basic soda fountain.  We got orange chicken,chicken chow mein, rice,egg rolls and crab rabgoons. The dipping sauce for the eggs rolls was perfect not too sweet. But we had to ask for chili sauce to go.The food is good size portions and 4 of us were able to eat with alittle of food for tommorows lunch. My kids loved the chow mein but weren't too big on the crab rabgoons which if fine. (More for me and the hubs ;] ) And did I mention no MSG is a big win for a Chinese take out place."}
{"text":"This place has everything you could want from a Chinese take-out. Cheap, delicious, and fast.  The combination plates are excellent for the price, getting you a choice from a dozen or so entrees, fried rice, and an egg roll for about $8. It's so much food that I normally get two meals out of it, which is a hell of a deal. Try it!"}
{"text":"Service: 63% D Everyone seems grumpy.  Cleanliness: 48% F The cook didnt where gloves,  and handled my food with his hands, and I did not see him wash his hands.  Food: 72% C The food is okay. Its pretty cheaply priced, so not bad if you want cheap chinese food."}
{"text":"The kids and I like this place. Nice staff, Good general tso and good prices! Probably one of the better Chinese places in town"}
{"text":"Our go-to carry out Chinese place. Great food and super friendly service! The proprietor's young (8-9 ish) daughter is always there and super friendly if you have kids. Our favorites are the shrimp lo mein, veggie fried rice, crab rangoon and General Tso's chicken."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Don't know what people are talking about..... been going to this place for 10 years and it never disappoints. Well, ok, the buffet sucks. Just order fresh takeout and you will be happy."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever visited.  I love all the menu items that I've tried.  The owners are really nice people, who always say hello when you come to visit.  It's a family business, sometimes the kids are helping run the register!  Try the sesame chicken, it is my favorite.  I always try to take my friends here when they are in town, because it truly is the best take-out in Concord!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi. Every roll was full of fresh fish. The service was excellent. Our waiter was ahead of our every need.   The place filled up after we arrived on a Friday night but the service or quality never changed. Good sushi is hard to find in this area. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I give them two-stars for the foods and 1 star for the customer service. I home and clean here because I was getting some dry cleaning. I would recommend another place unless your very hungry. The lady was very rude so I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Lakewood two years ago I never really had a go-to Chinese spot.  The one I used to go to closed so I figured I would give this a try. For what I was expecting as a quick service Chinese spot, my expectations were met.  I called and they told me 15 minutes later it would be ready as expected.  I order pan fried dumplings and a chicken and vegetables combo and what impressed me the most was the price!! The combo included the fired rice and an egg roll and with the dumplings my meal was only $10.  I would order just for that reason in a heart beat.    My dumplings were on the smaller side compared to what you would expect but they were very good, I didn't feel gross eating the meat and the dumpling wasn't too thick.  My food was as it is at most other spots, a lot of salt, lack of unique flavor but the perfect fix to my Chinese craving.    I'd give them my go to call from here on out."}
{"text":"My family comes here after church once or twice a month. We love the cashew chicken and the sweet and sour chicken. The service is pretty quick and we've never had a bad experience. I would recommend to anyone looking for some quick Chinese. Would be awesome if they delivered, though. The only thing is their rating is consistently in the mid to low 90's."}
{"text":"Better than average Chinese take out. Order is right every time and is not expensive. 5 stars because of that AND they deliver!"}
{"text":"I would agree with the negative comments about eating in and the buffet BUT as a take out place this place is really really good!    I've never had a bad meal from this place and the prices are very reasonable. The \"combos\" are always available and include the main dish, fried or white rice and an egg roll all for $8 to $9.   Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this little gem! We grab dinner here often & the service is always good & the food is awesome."}
{"text":"This place only opened about 2 months ago. I have been there twice. The food is fresh and the prices are reasonable. Large portions.I had been looking for a really good Chinese take out for a while when this place opened in my neighborhood. I am very pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Just ate there, right next to GameStop & Google, has 3 small booths, & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). Food is fast fresh & hot, but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. At the end of the meal I was just eating onions with rice, though I hear this is healthy for you. Counter lady was cordial, but didn't reply when customers told her, \"Have a nice day\" #awkward. I know that English isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. Wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (I usually get this feeling eating Asian). This is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (Side note: Food is very clean. Brushed my teeth an hour before w/ Tom's of Maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)"}
{"text":"The absolute best Chinese restaurant in the area. I have tried them all. Others do not compare. Worth the little bit of extra money. Better food, better service. Very clean. takeout is super fast and made to order. Never tried the sushi bar only because I don't like raw fish."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \"krab\", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup."}
{"text":"Fine dining?  No.  Good, hearty Americanized Chinese food?  Yes!  I've always had excellent food and service at China Garden.  The location next to Schnuck's is super convenient, easy to stop by on the way home or for a quick run on weekends.  I almost always get mine to go, which must be the case for most of their business.  Food is cooked to order and is super fast (about 10 min).  Portions are large; I get two meals from a single order.  Unlike many Chinese restaurants, the flavor of the food isn't overwhelmed by generic seasoning or MSG.  The egg drop soup (the large is a quart!!) has nursed me through many colds and it's ridiculously cheap.  I appreciate their vegetarian options and they've always accommodated special requests.  Their vegetarian spring rolls are gigantic.  It's Chinese fast food, but it's fresh, tasty, and a bargain."}
{"text":"I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I love me a buffet.  An excellent price for some good food never hurts.  All the usual Chinese fare is on the buffet with that American flare added for some spice...I suppose it would be to spice it up...  Anyway  I got to taste all my favorite Chinese foods from General Tso's to cheese won tons.  Just in case I didn't want to overdose on Chinese I decided to try some of the Mac n' Cheese and fried potatoes (although I admit I added sweet and sour sauce to the potatoes).    Servers are around often to pick up the plates you are finished with and to make sure your glasses are refilled.  Atmosphere is somewhat comfortable.  Appears to me they tried to squeeze in more seating than they could.    I would have given five stars, but as my friend pointed out while we were there, our waters tasted like it came from a hose you may have used to fill up your backyard pool.  Next time I'll go with the soda I suppose."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 1 star to write this review. This is THE WORST food I've had in my life I promise you!!!!! I'm from New York so maybe my expectations were high  1. the chicken was soft I asked for well done/fried  hard.  2. they gave me two orders of pork fried rice I ordered plain :( 3. their plain fried rice is actually just boiled brown rice.  The customer service was decent and you can tell they were trying. They returned and delivered   2 orders of their plain fried rice (boiled brown rice). ONE thing that defiantly needs to be changed is their phone operator he can not understand English and I don't see how anyone can understand him... although the delivery boy was polite I will never order here again."}
{"text":"China Garden is your basic Americanized Chinese food with one possible exception:  It's got an above average buffet.  Most Chinese buffets I've eaten at range from \"meh\" to \"ick\".  But the vegetables seem fresh and crisp, the chicken here is tender and not rubbery, and the egg rolls are fairly good.  It's worth checking out if you need a quick meal."}
{"text":"This was the first place me and my wife went to when moving down the street to lakewood. Everything we tried that day tasted like a crumbled pack of newport cigs.! If your a smoker then I think you may like this place but if not...I would \"keep it moving\" to many other places to try then to waste one day trying here!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because I'd never had it and it was close to my house. I was soo looking forward to some tasty shrimp and broc..that is NOT what I got. It was awful. So much so, that I barely ate any of it. I feel like I wasted my money. I will definitely not be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible!  It used to be ok, but I was told it's under new ownership.  The buffet barely had anything on it, and what was there looked pretty poor.  My coworker and I opted to order takeout.  The egg rolls and crab rangoons were the only decent part of the meal.  Her general tsos and vegetable lo mein were definitely lacking something.  I ordered pork wontons and shrimp in lobster sauce...those were both absolutely disgusting!  My shrimp and rice were practically swimming in the most disgusting slimy white sauce.  The shrimp were also rubbery.  The wontons barely had any pork and it looked like some kind of paste.  Steer clear of this place!  There are far better options!"}
{"text":"The location is convenient but I was not a fan of the food. I had shrimp and Chinese veggies and crab Rangoon. They cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. I won't go back for food but the crab Rangoon was ok. They didn't give any sauce. You have to ask for it. That sucks."}
{"text":"Don't go to this chinese restaurant if you are hungry. The buffet started at 11 am and we visited around 5 and i am almost positive the food was never changed for those 6 hours. Egg rolls tasted like white bread, rice was hard from being out all day, general tsos was rubbery, and submerged in a sauce that made it soggy and sweeter than chicken should be. Soup was bright neon yellow, not very natural at all, but was lacking salt. lobster puffs were dry as fuck, and the crab rangoon was oddly sweet. Also, the buffet contained many unidentified meats and sauces that did not look at all appetizing. The service was odd and quiet and somewhat depressing. Also did not fit my Chinese aesthetic the place looked like a very run down bomb shelter. Salt and pepper shakers did not match. Would not recommend to anyone who enjoys chinese food. The place was also extremely hot and i dont like to sweat as i eat. The coke machine was good tho."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Chinese food but my vote was unheard among the family.  The food over all was very unflavorful.  The egg drop soup had near zero taste, the egg foo young was oily and the sweet and sour pork was plain (no veggies, fruit, etc).  I did like the BBQ pork was good.  My fam thought it was too chewy but I liked it the best."}
{"text":"Yum! Pleasantly surprised!   Pan-fried noodles mean different things to different people, particularly between me and China Garden. Normally, I have them as thin, chewy, slightly greasy and un-sauced. These are soft, thicker noodles in a brown sauce but the pan-frying gives them a really good grilled flavor. Score.  \"An order of eggrolls\" means one eggroll which wasn't terribly tasty and definitely nothing interesting but you know.... good filler.  The broccoli beef (large order) was fresh, tasty and arrived piping hot. All this delivered for about $14 inside of 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This mainstay has been at the corner of Saxonburg and Rte 8 since at least 2002; it's a pretty good place to get your Chinese buffet fill, and it's also supercheap ($~6 for lunch buffet) - with that said the food is your typical Chinese fare in Pittsburgh, but it's also the only Chinese restaurant for miles around."}
{"text":"The decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good (and fresh). I've gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet. Both good for the price - it's inexpensive."}
{"text":"New China Garden is my favorite place for Asian cuisine in Etna. We eat from here at least a few times a month. Our go-to items include the street worthy Steamed Dumplings, Garlic Chicken or \"get you in the mood\" Chicken Curry, and Pork Mai Fun. Put 'em all in a bowl together...tasty times. Honorable mentions for the Crab Rangoon (there's actually crab!), Short Ribs (which must be eaten with the spicy mustard) and General Tsao's. There's also a reasonable buffet and the pick-up service is fast and friendly. Go there!"}
{"text":"I needed a quick snack before doing errands and heading home and was in the shopping strip where there is a Trader Joe's near Bakery Square.I am usually an Asian food snob having lived for many years in San Francisco / Bay Area but I thought I'd try some Amerasian food.I ordered moo shoo pork which wasn't bad,just kind of bland and not teeming with pork.That being said the vegetables were cooked well with a nice slightly crisp, not soggy texture. I'd sat if you want quite decent not quite Chinese  food  and quickly China Garden wouldn't be a bad place to stop."}
{"text":"I think 2 or 3 stars is accurate for this joint... The chicken is quality meat and its lightly sautéed but the sauce is to blah. It's a nice place to sit down and have Chinese food if you have no other local options.    It's my last resort for Chinese food in the area. Prices are absurd!!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here, very good, reasonable prices and a non descript but pleasant dining room. Excellent service and good is best in area. Much closer than the great Chinese i in Horicon. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! They drop food on the floor and serve it. I have seen it. We used to order from here all the time until one day I literally watched the cook drop chicken on the floor look around to see if anyone was looking (he didn't see me since the drink machine was blocking me) picked the chicken up and put it in the box. The guy whose food it was was in the restaurant waiting so I told him and also tried canceling my food order when the cashier got mad and argued with both of us. I walked out and had to call my bank to explain that I did not receive my food and they gave me the money back not the restaurant. When I left the guy was threatening to call the cops. I Would never go back or recomend."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING, truly does taste like nyc chinese food which is hard to find out here. I love this place it offers fresh food and amazing boba/non-boba drinks the coconut was amazing. You have to try the egg foo young!"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here. I liked it well enough the first time, but after picking up take out and eating at home, I won't be going back. I ordered crab rangoon, fried dumplings, and Mongolian beef with lo mein instead of rice. The crab rangoon looks huge, but in every single piece, there wasn't even a teaspoon full of filling. The beef in the mongolian beef tastes off and it doesn't taste like any mongolian beef I've ever had...just...not good. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the dumplings were decent. I wish I could post the picture I took of the rangoon so you could see I wasn't exaggerating just how empty they are. Very disappointed since I rarely eat out due to budget constraints. This was supposed to be a treat. If I wasn't so tired, I'd pack it up and take it back, but honestly, I never trust asking for food replacements because of the horror stories I've heard from food service people about what sometimes happens to your replacement food.   Edit: I figured out how to add a photo, so added it above..."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but it isn't of better quality of the other Chinese food places around.  The customer service is quick, pleasant and excellent but that doesn't take away from the fact that there are plenty of other decent Chinese food places.  If you want quick Chinese food of relatively decent prices then this is the place for you.  If you want higher quality food then you're gonna have to drive further."}
{"text":"Fast?  Yes.  Friendly?  Yes.  Variety?  Yes.    Quality?  Questionable.  Delicious?  Not so much.    I can see this place being good in a pinch when you don't feel like driving anywhere else.  It's on par with what you'd find in an airport food court, so I know it satisfies something.  Sadly, everything tasted like it had passed through the deep fryer.  So greasy.  Even the dumpling soup was bland."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT LUNCH!!!!   Svc was great!!  Curried shrimp w/onion is awesome!!   Several BIG shrimp!!!   Even after cooking!!!   Must have been HUGE!!!   Pork fried rice, good, hot & sour soup,  and xtra egg roll less than 10!!!!!   You gotta go!!!!   I will again soon!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I never thought to review the China Garden, as my family and I have been loyal customers for 20+ years. This is the Chinese food I grew up on. I've never had a bad meal - all food has come out hot, fresh, and flavorful. Prices are fair and portions are generous. The service is great, and the owners are really sweet. I've lived out of town now for 7 years and always look forward to eating there when in town. The owners always stop over to say hello, and at my most recent visit they brought out a complimentary dessert for us. Top notch restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place cannot be saved by the renovation. First off they make you pay as soon as you walk in. Then if you ask for something like fresh rice because the old rice is hard. He literally just dumped the old rice on top of the new rice. This place is nasty."}
{"text":"Why do all fast Chinese joints have the same exact menu?  Seriously.  It's the placemat sized paper one.  Red and black, meal specials and the same food.  You know what I'm talkin' bout, right?  Everywhere across the nation!  My Tso's Chicken here was sub-par.  Especially biting the nugget in half, and realizing there was a microscopic shred, literally a shred, of actual chicken surrounded by two inches of chicken flavored dough.  Yikes.  That being said, all the vegetarian meals ordered were pretty tasty.  Special request Tso's Tofu looked rockin' and tasted better.  The Ma Po Tofu was a bit on the slimy side, and our party noticed some flavor balance issues in certain dishes.  It's very basic american-ized Chinese food, fairly cheap and large portions, hella quick."}
{"text":"First off, I didn't get sick so that was a good thing.  Stopped in the other day and ordered some Beef Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and an Egg Roll to go. The place looked semi clean but had a very large fly population flying around everywhere including in the open buffet.  The food tasted alright (nothing really special) and the staff were very nice. I don't know that I would recommend a visit, but if you do come, bring your own fly swatter."}
{"text":"A decent storefront Chinese place.  Portion sizes can be large, so we almost always end up with too much food!"}
{"text":"Fried rice is good, customer service is a little lack luster."}
{"text":"I've only ate here twice so far. The first time was great (dining in) but last night wasn't so great. My brother and I ordered out and I was disappointed with my cashew chicken. The chicken was so small I could barely distinguish it from the cashews or mushrooms. Our rice was also over cooked so it was dry and sticky. Our crab meat rangoons and eggs rolls were delicious though! I hope to have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions, good price fast delivery. Friendly staff. Better then Panda Express lol"}
{"text":"Came here on vacation from Hawaii and stopped here for lunch. Had the Eggplant tofu with veggie rolls, very yummy"}
{"text":"For those of you who may not know, China Garden has been a staple in the Irwin area for years....I remember going with my family when I was a kid. I can't say how long they've been around, but at least 25 - 30 years. China Garden recently moved into the old PNC Bank location from Norwin Towne Square.  I enjoyed the old place, because I am a fan of comfort and of sitting at a booth. But, the new location is great as well! It's clean and has a nice atmosphere. Although, the restaurant is much smaller than the old place.  Food is delicious! My husband usually gets their General Tso's and sushi....he prefers the Philadelphia and Spicy Tuna Rolls, although he loves anything he's every tried. I am not a fan of sushi...I've tried it a few times, but just really not my thing. I usually opted for either a Spring Roll or Wonton Soup and the Lettuce Wraps With Shrimp. They're delicious and a (slightly) healthier option, since you're not eating any rice or a heavy cream sauce. Best part? They're wraps are only $7.95. You can also get Lettuce Wraps With Chicken for a buck less.  I know you have to be in the mood for Chinese, but when you are...China Garden is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"I won't be back to this place. It was okay at best. I was excited to try, due to my craving for Chinese and reading the great reviews. I ordered a large sesame chicken with fried rice, broccoli and an egg roll.  I tried the egg roll first, nothing but dough.  I couldn't taste any of the insides because it was so doughy. The broccoli was cold mostly, except maybe two pieces. And I'm pretty sure I got the bottom of the batch for the sesame chicken. It was nothing but little fried crunchy pieces tossed in sauce. I think I actually saw maybe 6 pieces of chicken. The rest was nothing but crispy pieces of whatever it's coated with. The only thing I liked about China Garden was my fortune from the cookie. Oh and the rice was good."}
{"text":"This place is just another regular american-chinese restaurant with nothing special to offer. We got the general tsos, beef w/ rice, and dumplings. It was just alright. I figured that with all the great reviews there would be something special about this place but was a bit disappointed in the end."}
{"text":"The food here is good but it is not exceptional.    I've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. There is the typical Asian fare such as General Tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. There is also American macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham.   When I go to China Garden, I always request a carry out container as I find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. One thing for sure is that China Garden gets plenty of customers.  Definitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!"}
{"text":"I grew up on China Garden. Actually I'm pretty sure my mom was having China Garden while she was pregnant with me, and that's why I love Chinese so much!  My favorite has always been their chicken and assorted vegetables.  I've since branched out since my picky kid ways, to try more yummy dishes from Hunan and garlic chicken to Mongolian beef to their newest addition of pad thai.  Since their move, they've become more of an Asian fusion restaurant.  The sushi roll I've ordered has been really good too.  Their wonton soup is pretty good (I think I'd like the dumplings to be more doughy) and their egg rolls are the best in the area.  The service is great and the owners are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Seems like they have all the food that every other Chinese restaurants has. But this place must really care more. I have ate at others and so far none have been able to match the quality of the food. Be ready for a HOT meal. I have never had a cold one at this restaurant. It must be family owned as I always see the husband, wife, two daughters and the same cook in there.."}
{"text":"Have these guys on speed dial. Their General Tso's Chicken combo is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Yasss oh my , this Chinese Spot is the bomb!! I love this place , Most places offer on lunch specials BUT this places does dinner specials and you get a ton of food for your money. Hope they don't change that cause man what a deal. I order dinner and have enough to eat lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I tried this place out rather randomly after noticing its existence near Schnucks. The restaurant is a very typical eat-in/take-out joint, with a nice lady coordinating the kitchen and taking the orders. As always, my order was the classic American-Chinese takeout standby of General Tso's Chicken. The food was ready in the promised 10 minutes, and I was happy to see that its container was practically bursting with chicken, broccoli, and fried rice. A good start!  Once home, I eagerly unloaded a mix of victuals onto a plate and began to chow down. Unfortunately, the experience from here on was a bit of a disappointment. The meat was not at all spicy (despite the cute little chili pepper next to its name on the menu), and the flavor was more bitter than I'm used to. Maybe that's what they're shooting for, but the peculiar bitter/salty aftertaste didn't jibe too well with my taste buds.  Granted, my opinion here is based entirely on one experience with one style of food. That being said, I've definitely had better. I'll see how the leftovers are after a night of sitting in the fridge, but the next time I have a craving for the good general's fried nuggets of fowl, I'll probably be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite Chinese Restaurant in Sun Prairie. Usually I prefer to call the restaurant for a carry out or delivery order but this restaurant has an easy to follow online ordering process. This was my first time ordering so I was hoping for the best coffee especially reading the previous reviews. I ordered the curry chicken and it was just delicious. Enough for 3 meals for sure. The wontons and dumplings were also delicious. I ordered online and had it delivered and delivery was quite fast. Depending on what your total is, you might be able to get a free order of egg rolls, wontons, etc. I will definitely be coming back for more. Especially with so many different menu options."}
{"text":"I have to start off my review with the questionable customer service we received.   First of all to mark a five and ten dollar bill to see if they are real.  2nd having an attitude when I ask if there are forks in the bag is unacceptable.   I asked nicely, I expect a nice response.  Now as far as the food, it's decent and they give nice Portion for lunch special.  Although the fried rice was good, the orange chicken was watery and don't like the chow mein  noodles . Overall as a new business,  customer service goes a long way with getting recommendations and repeat customers.  I didn't have a good experience"}
{"text":"After a month of long nights of writing, not feeling up for actually cooking, and just craving a bunch of Chinese, this place probably knows me by now. The food is American-Chinese: lots of fried items, Yankee-friendly staples, and everything served with a handful of sauce packets and several fortune cookies. But though you should wrinkle your nose at such an uncreative venue, everything is good. The meat is all decent quality, the noodles and sauces have just the right amount of flavor, and everything that needs a good crunch has it. Plus, your food is always ready in less than ten minutes, which is pretty convenient. A great place to fall back on when all you really want in veggie lo mein and a heaping bowl of sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to my Chinese food. China Garden meets all my needs. They use Chicken broth for their Wonton soup. The Wontons are filled with pork, which some places don't do. I used to get Sweet & Sour Pork, but they make the BEST Sweet & Sour Shrimp! The breading is delicious & the sauce doesn't have pineapple floating in there.  The fried rice has ton of pork in it, some places don't put anything but cheap veggies in their fried rice.  The only downside is that they used to have stale Shrimp Chips. I brought this to their attention & since the chips changed & got much better!! I love Chinese food & tried several places in the area - this one wins hands down. They deliver, are always speedy & friendly when delivering the food."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese food.  Never had a bad experience here--it tastes just like you'd expect take out Chinese to taste."}
{"text":"Really good food! And you get A LOT!! Love this place. Every time we do delivery and they are quick and polite. I order different things ever time as well and it's always really good. Love the fried rice and chow mein noodles, and there egg rolls are way better then China a go go. My favorite place!"}
{"text":"Good (and only to my knowledge) Chinese take out in Stanley, NC. The only place I've ever experienced that uses yellow rice to make fried rice. Surprisingly good. And no, they don't serve cat. The 12 year old already asked. Quick Chinese if you can't drive further. If you can, there are other options that are better in Cramerton."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place. Generous portions, cheap, and quick service. Their BBQ pork spare ribs are amazing."}
{"text":"Decided to get takeout for my family and went with the cashew chicken, hunan chicken, and moo shu pork along with a Wonton soup. If you order a certain amount, you get a free item, so we got the teryaki chicken skewers for free. Overall, this is a solid Chinese takeout spot. The hunan chicken had great flavor, the moo shu pork was close enough to authentic, and the cashew chicken was on par with other places around. The teryaki chicken was surprisingly well made as well. The only sub par item was the Wonton soup as the broth was  lacking flavor. I'd say, of the items I got, this place is just as good as Panda Garden down the street."}
{"text":"I had a delivery of sesame chicken and rice last night. Delivery time was a little long, but I don't know how busy they were. Food was hot and tasted fresh! Will eat again. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for Chinese food! Incredible egg rolls, Chow mien, lo mein, egg fu yung, soup, s/s shrimp, orange chicken, and more....I have tried a ton and it is all amazing! I get dinner from here almost weekly and the portions give me lunch the next day (sometimes even 2 more meals)!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its just ok Chinese food. Its decent but I've just had better at several other places in Sun Prairie and Madison. Parking isn't the easiest."}
{"text":"I love China Garden!  Since moving to its larger, stand alone location the quality has improved immeasurably....and they have added new dishes like Yaki-soba...which I just love.  I am literally unable to order from there for less than 75 dollars, I just want some of EVERYTHING.  I usually get delivery, which is super fast..have never had a cold meal, or even lukewarm.  The containers are chok-full of delishiousness, and sturdy enough for several trips through my dish washer....like you don't know we all reuse them.  I can personally attest to pretty much everything on the menu with the exception of things in the white sauces-just a personal preference, I'm a brown sauce kinda girl.  BUT please try the Mei-fun, any of the Honey, Lemon or Orange Chickens (YUM) and always Yaki-soba...I like my noodles and rice with an extra egg, just makes it even tastier.  I only with old the 5 stars because I have never \"eaten-in\".  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go order Chinese....."}
{"text":"Got the chicken in garlic sauce today for lunch and it was actually pretty good...not as good as my old spot, but still definitely not bad. Don't know what all the fuss is about in the other reviews.   Update***had lunch there yesterday and my stomach hasn't been right since...couldn't even eat dinner last night i was so nauseous"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good compared to some other places in our area. This place is a little bit of a drive for us (just for some chinese takeout) and there are plenty of places close by, but this one is worth the drive. The customer service was outstanding and we could tell the owner was working to get our repeated business. He even threw in a free cheese wonton for us to try. I can't have dairy but my partner ate it and loved it. I got the scallion chicken and it was nice and crispy! Partner had chicken and broccoli which was also good. I made the mistake of going to the China garden on poplar tent, thinking they were the same and I won't do that again."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly staff. Only one in town that we like. Every item we've tried is great. In the picture is sesame seed chicken combo platter w pork fried rice and spring rolls.  They have about 7 booths inside to eat."}
{"text":"Standard Chinese restaurant food, slightly Americanized for white people. Price is about average for average Chinese food. A good place for when you don't really feel like cooking and just want something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! Fats delivery! Even gave us free strawberry cake for them being busy and our order \"being late\". Our order arrived fresh, hot, and even 15 mins earlier then what we were quoted on yelp! Food was awesome! Will definitely be ordering from here again. Best honey chicken I've had since I moved to Vegas 6 years ago!"}
{"text":"The team here is always so friendly and consistent.  I always receive great customer service and good food."}
{"text":"This place has reasonable prices, generous portions, fast service, and is very conveniently located (for me!).  That said, convenience isn't quite enough to make me want to come back here.  I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and some vegetable lo mein.  Granted, I have never had Ma Po Tofu.  I'm not really sure what it's \"supposed\" to taste like.  But what I got from China Garden was SALTY.  So very salty, to the point where I could barely taste any other flavor.  BLEH.  Also, there was a piece of shrimp shell in my Ma Po Tofu....weird.  The vegetable lo mein was pretty good, but honestly that's kind of hard to completely mess up.  My boyfriend had the boneless spare ribs combo.  His eggroll was downright gross.  The insides were a uniform gray.  He asked me to take a bite of it to confirm how weird it was.  I sunk my teeth in and didn't even go any further...the texture and flavor was so disgusting.  I'm disappointed by this place, especially since our food SMELLED so good (well, except for that eggroll...)"}
{"text":"To be honest, I think carryout for dinner on a Saturday was better than eating in for lunch on a weekday. I've had their sweet and sour chicken combo which is just as good as any other place's. Their General's chicken came with HUGE chunks of chicken which I wish were a little smaller. But the fried rice is what earned the place four stars (aside from the service). I'm usually not a fan of fried rice, but theirs is so flavorful and not greasy at all! I could've just eaten it! Also their service is ALWAYS friendly and more than happy to help you, even when they are swamped. I will definitely be back again and likely try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to get Chinese food its good  food fast not too expensive its a great value.The people at the location and the delivery people perhaps one in the same lol all real nice people perhaps family from thier family to yours check them out"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The customer service was blah, and by that I mean the girl taking my order really didn't want to be at work today. When my order of General Tso was ready the cook called it out had it in a bag, I walk up to get it and the order taker ignored me. Finally the cook came over and handed me the bag. I assume from the looks the order taker is the cook's daughter. Maybe the owner(cook) should give her daughter the summer off to do things teenagers enjoy instead of working in a hot kitchen where she has an attutitude and gives poor customer service. I originally got an eat in order but changed it to takeout after noticing there was no air condition and they had the door wide open with flies all around. Hate to see what the kitchen looked like. Cheap is definitely how I would describe the food. I got the General Tso combo, while the egg roll was good and so was the fried rice they really skimped on the chicken. I got maybe 6 very small pieces and some of those pieces were just breading.  I can definitely 100% say I will never return. Maybe this place is good for those of you who live nearby because you don't want to drive 10 miles into Charlotte but you should really reconsider because there is much better not to far away. Out of the hundreds of Chinese places I've eaten this by far is the worst."}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews, I came for cheap and fast Chinese.  Be careful - when they say \"steamed\" they mean \"not seasoned\".   Unfortunately the food is flat and rather boring.  There is an insane amount of variety on the menu to be overwhelming - this is typical of smaller Chinese places in my experience, but still disappointing.  Why not feature several things you do well, instead of an innumerable amount of things you do dreadfully?  Had mixed steamed vegetables with a brown sauce over white rice.  Everything was absolutely scary - I had chicken, but it was absolutely unidentifiable as chicken.  Scary."}
{"text":"We moved to Glenshaw a little over two years ago, this was the first place we called to get dinner our first night in the new house. Ever since the husband/wife remember us and always give us a little something extra! The food is always hot, good and super quick!!"}
{"text":"Ordered General Sous chicken & 4 egg rolls for Cary out , the egg rolls were great the General's chicken was split , some was great and some was hard and chewy it all had good flavor but I couldn't chew most of the chicken. The rice was horrible it tasted like it was a week old. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"After trying their pork egg roll from a friend, I thought their food was quite good so I decided to go for lunch. First the place is definitely a great value and rather fast.   I ordered the Hot & Sour soup and Chicken fried rice. Both dishes had decent seasoning and tasted good except for the chicken. There was a couple pieces of chicken in the Hot & Sour soup which had no flavor as if added as an afterthought or fell in.  The chicken in the fried rice did not retain any flavor either and was actually kind of wet/slimy. At first I thought maybe it wasn't fully cooked but rather I think it is the chicken piece used. I got a bit of fat and almost skin-ish instead of just the standard chicken breast. So I just ate around it.   I'd recommend staying away from the chicken but the dishes were not bad and as previously stated the pork egg roll was good."}
{"text":"I didnt like the szechuan beef it had baby corn in it which is nasty also had a lot of veggies which i didnt like mushroom and cucumber. The sauce tasted too watery and i felt the beef was cheaper than panda and much more pricey it was 4.80 for a small lunch special which is basically just a small entree and rice."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon Chinese in the heart of Lakewood.    Good food-not great, but it's cheap fast, and the service was friendly.  Sometimes that's all you really need."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from Arizona and this is second Chinese restaurant I have tried since I moved here. This is my new favorite place. I couldn't find good Chinese food to save my life in Az and living just a few miles from this place is a treat! I'm so impressed with everything I have tried so far and the prices are great too! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delivery was extremely fast. Very happy with the service."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. DO NOT GO HERE. It's like $11 for dinner which isn't bad for Chinese buffets BUT they only have 2 little rows of food. And it all is so bad. The chicken in the chicken and broccoli was so small and it looked disgusting. The sweet and sour chicken looked like drops of hard, fried batter. The general tsaos chicken was soggy and once again the smallest pieces of chicken. Those were basically the options. Plus corn and shrimp, brown green beans, salad bar, and egg roll..so bad. And the waitress gave us our bill and stood there until we got our card out and paid. Will never go there again. Don't go."}
{"text":"I went here and service is good, the place is very clean, food is good. I ordered Shrimp Chao Mein, and I was not that pleased with the Noodles cause I felt they were too salty!! Otherwise it's an ok place!!"}
{"text":"Eggroll blah. Moo goo gai pan- only interesting now that I am full time eating meat again. When stacked up against any chicken and mushroom dish I can concoct at home, meh. Pork fried rice- not bad. Service is quick(God, that sounds stupid. When have I ever waited more than ten minutes for Chinese in my life?) Location- very close to everything in Lakewood.   The beer and cigarettes delivery intrigues me. Since when is that in the realm of Asian food service? I think they should also offer to do math homework. That would make my number crunching wife extra happy."}
{"text":"China Garden is everything that every Chinese place wants to be. It has excellent food. The spare ribs were cooked to perfection with a little char on them. And they were actually spare ribs! Super tender meat and the service was quality. Only problem was I ordered based on the online menu price. When I got there to pay for the take out, it was more expensive than what they advertise on their website. Only by a dollar or two more, but it's still very good food and service. I highly recommend this place to people with a Chinese food craving."}
{"text":"I'm usually very happy with the food from this place but tonight that wasn't the case! My daughter found a hair in her food. I called to get a replacement meal (exchange  the bad one) and the guy gave me an attitude! He then proceeded to hang up on me. 5 minutes later someone called me back to see if I got my food... He didn't understand what was going on. I had to explain it all again and also tell him they could have the \"hairy\" meal back! I just wanted a new meal not free food! Needless to say I don't think I'll be going back any time soon!"}
{"text":"This place is fucken the bomb food it fresh place is clean n for the amount of food u get for a cheap price so come down n enjoy some China garden baby"}
{"text":"I can't say anything about their General Tso's chicken or whatever, but i will say that the cook here really knows how to cook noodles. Definitely try what they call \"angel hair\" (or mi-fun in Chinese). They cook it very well. You may need to add some salt or hot sauce to adjust the taste to your liking, but the texture of the noodles is always done just right. Many other chinese takeout places (and restaurants) that make mi-fun have it come out soggy and oily, or very dry and sticky. Not here ... the noodles are typically nicely separated and have a bite to them. So, if you aren't sure what to order here or want to try something other than \"typical\" chinese take out, i would recommend you go for their \"angel hair\" items!"}
{"text":"OMG , it is FINALLY OPEN! I waited months for this place to open and I am so excited that it is and it's also freaking delicious!!! I found a new spot and it's right across the street! Big portions, fresh and friendly staff what more can you ask for? I highly recommend this place tucked in the back near an eyebrow place and JTs dollar Castle in the Smith's parking lot!!"}
{"text":"Used to come to China Garden a lot growing up. It was our go to sit down Chinese restaurant. I was super excited when I saw that it was still open. We drove out to Norwin Town Square..where it was located..and umm..it wasn't there. And Norwin Town Square..a shopping plaza btw..was completely different. It was like they tore it all down and rebuilt it..with no China Garden. I was so bummed..but then we quickly realized that they had just moved into a stand alone location across the street.   The new location is nice. Very big and open..very modern feeling inside. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and pretty much enjoyed a private dining experience. The staff here was really nice and accommodating. I felt nostalgia for and missed the old location, but this one, admittedly, is much much nicer.  The prices here can get pretty steep but since we were there for lunch time we took advantage of their lunch specials. They were so unbelievably reasonably priced!  I got the sesame chicken and an egg roll. I forgot how great the egg rolls were here. Very crisp and very favorable. They have the perfect amount of outer won-ton and filling. Delicious.   The sesame chicken was great as well. The sauce had a really nice tang to it and the chicken was really crisp. I don't think I used to order this much (my old obsession was their sweet and sour), but I'm really glad I did.  Again, another old school place from my childhood still up and kicking! I feel very fortunate to be able to go back and visit all these places! I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I ordered sushi for dinner and was so impressed! The quality was fantastic. Very fresh and not fishy at all. Incredible value for the quantity and quality. I'm excited to try the Chinese food if the Japanese food is this good!"}
