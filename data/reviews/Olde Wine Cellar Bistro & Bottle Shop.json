{"text":"With a great wine selection and knowledgeable staff we have become regulars...We frequent attend the tastings on Fridays and Saturdays. This allows us to learn about different types of wine and expands our pallets. The tastings are a must!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grand re-opening of an Olmsted Falls staple. Now featuring food. Chef George has an awesome menu and the wine selection is greatly expanded. Seating is approximately doubled from the old place. Pictures include the menu and charcuterie board."}
{"text":"Great little patio and they do wine ratings every Friday and Saturday for $10 a person"}
{"text":"While attending a wedding, had some down time while they were taking photos and stopped in this fantastic little place for a glass of wine. Sat outside on the \"Front Porch\" and had our wine in an extremely comfortable atmosphere. Would definitely recommend this place for a relaxing evening with friends. Next time will go for the food! The menu looked very interesting!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this little gem after grabbing dinner across the street. Quaint, humble, unassuming... and for $10 bucks, you'll get loaded. Six generous servings of that week's wine selections, plus cheese and crackers for all! It has a warm interior with creaking wooden floors and a few tables-for-two made out of wine barrels. They offer a wide selection of wines from around the world, all jammed packed into what feels like a tiny little barn that was plucked right off of a grape vineyard and squeezed onto the main street of Olmsted Falls. I've only peeked at the back patio area. It would definitely be a good place to spend an evening with friends if you can snag a seat. But if you're left to stand, no worries - you'll be best buddies with the crowd and staff by the end of the night, perhaps even partaking in a spontaneous moonwalking dance-off. It happens.  They do tastings every Friday and Saturday. If you sign up for the email list, you'll receive a tempting heads-up each week as to what they're serving. Always creative selections - one weekend it was a \"blind\" tasting (the bottles were covered, and not revealed until the end. Everyone had to guess at the type of the wine). This weekend it's all about which wines go best with summer BBQs - vital info! They must make a killing at closing time - after getting on a good wine buzz and sitting admits the bottles, I've always left with an additional purchase or 3!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite hangouts. David is fantastic for the wine tastings! I feel that my pallet has improved and I have a better appreciation for wine as a result.  The new location now has a kitchen with a nice menu. We enjoy the flatbreads and the shrimp and farrow.  We are part of the wine of the month club. They have a good selection of bottled wines, too."}
{"text":"Met friends here at their new location, just a short walk north of the previous...planned on getting a glass of wine then going elsewhere for dinner...ended up staying as Mike & Kari now have a much larger space with a new kitchen and a chef! Remember it's a boutique wine shop with food, and not a restaurant with wine but all the choices look outstanding. We had a flatbread pizza...delicious! And the pan seared shrimp was \"to die for\"!!! Seriously top notch. And I'll be in Florida in 3 days. So glad I got shrimp in Olmsted Falls!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS WINE BAR! We are members, and love it! We get three new bottles of wine each month that the owner picks our for us. Can't say that we ever got a bad bottle. The actual wine cellar is beautiful. Their back patio overlooks the metro parks and a small river. It's so nice to sit out there in the warmer months. They also have a cozy inside. Every Friday they have a wine tasting with a different theme. Their tapas are very good as well. We love the sweet nuts!"}
{"text":"The best little wine shop ive ever been too! Warm and inviting, a great selection, and really very reasonably priced.  For $10 you get six huge pours for their weekly tastings, and for another $5 you can buy a whole glass of red or white that comes with a plate of cheese and crackers. Just phenomenal. I love this place!  --- update 2/25/18. This is LONG overdue. And we haven't been back for over 4 years because of this: The owner is a cockknocker. He knows his wine, but he'd though you into traffic sooner than telling one of his buddies to tone it down (or stop blowing cigar smoke in everyones face,  same thing, thats just ONE of the things we witnessed over the two years of going there)"}
{"text":"This place was crazy busy on Friday night. I would go again but at off jours. It was too crowded and noisy to relax. The food was great the wine was great.  We love the gorgeous park right next to it and will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Living in the suburbs can get a little boring. This place feels like you are hanging out in a trendy part of Cleveland but with gorgeous scenery. They moved from a tiny shop to a lil house with tables and food. David really knows his wine. He is honest about prices and is such a good conversationalist.   They have begun their tastings again, but the price has gone from 10 to 15 bucks for 6 pours.  Get there before 530 for a good seat...it starts to get busy around 6.  Get the Big Board to share while you enjoy a glass of wine or sangria on the scenic patio and buy a bottle to take home on your way out!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite wine bar that has something from the novice to the seasoned wine connoisseur. The small plates, salads and flatbreads are wonderful. Mike picks out great wines for the weekend tastings and David will tell you about the wines in the tasting. Everyone there is friendly and makes you feel like family. Bryan can give you a wine recommendation from an every day wine to the one you'd take to a great party. Looking for a nice place to sit and sip on wine or have a beer, check them out, you won't be sorry."}
