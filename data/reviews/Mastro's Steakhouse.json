{"text":"Wow. 
The food and atmosphere here are great. 
The music was a little too loud, but, for a weekend away, this place hit the spot perfectly. 
The wait was rather lengthy, so we stalked the bar until some folks left, then had our dinner there. 
I had the largest shrimp cocktail of my life, some really good wine, and grilled asparagus. 
There are so many delicious options in Scottsdale, but, this is pretty specific in vibe. Check it out."}
{"text":"My go-to place for a special occasion. The seafood towers are incredible, the steaks are perfect and they make one of the best cosmopolitans around!"}
{"text":"Finally I got some time to write this review.... Mastro's,  recommended by friends here in NY where we live. Sept. 2014, on our honeymoon to Scottsdale, AZ.  Gotta tell you, we found a gem of a place, Appetizers, Main course to Dessert, top of the line,wine list endless, atmosphere and surroundings A+, the service impeccable   We met Phil, great host. After dinner spend some time at the bar.  Good drinks, live music , Mastro's menu, here we come ...... We will be back!"}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars for the excellent service. The Meal itself was awful. How does a steak house get away with serving tough filet?  6 oz and my husband didn't even finish it because it was so chewy and tasteless. He also had a giant prawn that was over cooked. I had Sea Bass. A very thin piece that had no seasoning or flavor.
I had raspberry sorbet that was inedible because it was so sweet. No one else at the table could eat it either. 
I asked for a table in the main dinning room but they tried to seat is in the corner of the patio. They were told when I made the reservation it was a birthday party and nothing was done to the other desert to honor that. 
You would think a fancy place like this would make the presentation of each plate beautiful but it's just thrown on the plate. 
All this for a whopping $240.00. Then I had to listen to my husband complain all the home. I honestly could have cooked a better dinner at home. 
So disappointed and feeling ripped  off!"}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant last week for the first time in 4 years and sat in the bar. The food was great and the bartender was really doing a great job. He was all over us and did a great job. We left fat and happy. 
Tonight we decided to go back. We took our son and sat in the dining room.  Our server did not seem right... Like a little out of it.  Sure enough he brought pimento olives instead of blue cheese in my martini.  We moved on to dinner and he brought broccoli instead of brussel sprouts. Seriously!  Please go out and hire people that meet our expectations for the price!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the steak is really good.   The things I would AVOID are the Lobster Mashed potatoes and the lobster sushi roll both of which are boring.   But lobster can be boring without sticking it in butter.  But the other veggies are great. Also, if it's your birthday and you don't specify which desert you want,  they bring you a boring dry chocolate cake that you pay for."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  Cece is our favorite waitress, she rocks!  Food is always excellent & we are huge Marley Taylor fans-so happy she sings in the lounge!  We bring all of our friends in for dinner and to see her perform!"}
{"text":"We came to Mastro's from out of town based on a review that if the person who wrote the review had one last meal request it would be from here and we must say Mastro's did NOT disappoint!! Service was excellent, management was friendly and attentive and the food.....MY GOD!!! If everything in life tasted this good we'd all be more willing to %^#*+ more things!!!   Tim was our waiter and had great recommendations and was funny, entertaining and attentive but not annoying!!  Stuffed Mushrooms, Blackened Sea Bass, Filet, Mushroom side, Gorgonzola Mac N Cheese & Butter Cake that's better than, well almost anything!  If you've already passed it, turn around it's well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been vacationing in the Phoenix area for the past 10 years. Early on, the concierge at our resort recommended Mastros Steakhouse as a special place to celebrate our wedding anniversary so we tried it. We absolutely love this restaurant and we make a reservation every time we are in town. The food is always superb and the service is first class. They make you feel welcome and special. 
Last week our entire family of 24 people gathered in Phoenix for a group vacation. We wanted to start the week with a very special meal, so naturally we chose Mastros. Gina was very helpful in making the arrangements ahead of time and found a way to make all of our requests possible. We were given our own private room with an adjoining outdoor terrace. It rained that evening so we weren't able to enjoy the terrace but we had so much fun that no one even noticed. I had requested two servers who we know from our previous visits. One of them was on vacation and unavailable but Jamie came in to work (on her day off!) to take care of us. She and Giuseppe (and all of the staff) provided service that was above and beyond our expectations. Several members of our group eat fairly regularly at fine dining establishments and all said that Mastros provided by far the best food and service they had ever enjoyed. No doubt, it is expensive but it's great value for the money. 
If you are looking for a first class dining experience in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, give Mastros a call!"}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived about an hour early for our dinner reservation Friday night and were surprised and delighted to see that bar is a piano bar (with singers), which I think is pretty awesome.  The bar seems to be the place to hang out as it just kept getting busier and busier and the dining room remained fairly sparse.  The cocktail menu in the bar is an interesting mix of specialty and traditional cocktails with a twist.  Dinner was good, I always enjoy the cream corn and mashed potatoes with my steak.  I had no room for butter cake at the end, but it is a favorite when dining at a Mastro's."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have dined at Mastro's family restaurants over 10 times including City Hall, and Ocean Club. The last couple times I have dined at Mastro's I noticed hints that the place may be declining in quality, however this last visit solidified my suspicions and prompted this review. 

Note: This review is specific to the Mastro's on Pinnacle Peak. 

Mastro's used to be an amazing food experience complete with outstanding atmosphere and excellent service. The atmosphere and service remain excellent, however the food as it turned out has really gone downhill and quite frankly was alarmingly bad. This last trip to Mastro's at Pinnacle Peak has forever scarred me and I will never return. I am even doubting whether or not to return to Ocean Club as it is part of the same family of restaurants. 

The night started off poorly when the bartender didn't even take our order and there was literally no one else at the bar as we arrived at opening. We were seated for our reservations. I chose the porterhouse, and my friend the lobster. The meals were not brought out together. Inexcusable for a 5 star restaurant. 5-7 minutes later my friend's lobster was served. It was inedible. It was sopping wet and not fully cooked. My friend returned the lobster tail to be more thoroughly cooked. Meanwhile I tried my porterhouse which I ordered medium-rare. It was overcooked, and so dry I had to take sips of water in order to swallow it. When my friends lobster was brought back out it was still completely inedible. Again, raw in parts and sopping wet. The waitress was extremely apologetic, and then Mastro's mafia (earphones intact) soon came to our table to ask what was wrong. We explained the sub par quality of the food, more specifically the lobster, and earphone gentleman immediately offered my friend another lobster tail, however by this time it was already too late and we asked for the check. They again pressed us to let them make it up to us but we politely refused. We paid the check and I have not and will not ever return. I do not know what has happened to Mastro's in the past couple years, however this last trip will be just that. 

Dine at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I have had good experiences at Mastro's City Hall, so we decided to try Mastro's Steakhouse further North.

The escargot and ahi tuna tostadas were very good.  I enjoyed my martini.  However, the lamb I ordered medium came out dry and well-done.  I sent it back and, once the other people in my party were finished eating, received new lamb that was rare.  Our waiter seemed like he was waiting on too many tables, he was very flustered and forgot about our requests.  The tables were also so wide that we were sitting too far from the person across from us, and we were shouting to be able to have a conversation."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steak places and love the scene at the bar!"}
{"text":"What can I say other than they have by far the best steak and seafood in town bar none! I personally feel they are better than their sister location, Ocean Club. Their scallop app is divine! The sauce they use I sewage is the nectar of the gods. Their Chilean sea bass is always fantastic! And what girl doesn't love their petite filet? Top it off with a chocolate martini which is essentially desert in a glass. Love this place"}
{"text":"Completely fabulous ambiance. On the expensive side but worth it because the food is phenomenal and the service is awesome. Live music one night and it felt like a
Concert, completely awesome talent. Very chic and food is perfect."}
{"text":"Well the bread basket was delicious. Our service dropped from decent to deserted. No waiter stopping by to explain why it took over 20 minutes to get our entrees after our salad plates were cleared. We had a partnership of two waiters. We ordered and our waiter told us in great detail how to order our steaks. It didn't matter because neither were cooked to our specification. For sides the lobster gnocchi was raved about. Super super dry! Our dinner included a cocktail, bottle of wine, salad and two sides and a big helping of disappointment. I was treating my husband to date night:( so sad"}
{"text":"Lobster mashed potatoes?  Yes, they mix a whole lobster with mashed potatoes.  Crazy good.

I had the Chilean Sea Bass.  It was ok.  I've had better.  BUT everyone else at the table was very pleased with their steaks.  Other sides, including the gorgonzola macaroni and brussel sprouts were awesome.  Raw oysters were also nice.  

Ambiance was great. The restaurant is divided into several dining rooms separated by glass walls ... very cool.  And, the bar area is even better.  The bar is huge, with great lighting, live piano and vocals. 

Great dinner.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the best steak I've ever had. I've tried every other steakhouse in Scottsdale and all over the country and none compare. Price is a little high but there is a way around that, they have some very large cuts and they can be split and prepared any way you want, you can also do half size side dishes if it's just two of you. I recommend splitting the 33oz ribeye for two it's perfect and I'm not a small guy."}
{"text":"My buddies took me out for my birthday, and it was hands down the most fun night I could have imagined.  We had an awesome server named Frank who knew exactly what to say and kept the food coming at an ideal pace.  I've had him before as a waiter and you couldn't ask for a better guy.  The food was awesome as always, especially the twin lobster tails.  All in all, the best part of the night by far was Frank talking to us about his time playing professional golf as we told him two of my buddies are currently playing college golf, and had other great conversations throughout the night."}
{"text":"Phil and his group are amazing!!! They make every experience worth every dollar spent"}
{"text":"I have to say Mastro's has always been top notch. Delicious food, great atmosphere and service. But we did have one hiccup in years of dining, where the steak was very average and the server was terrible.
But, we returned for a makeup dinner and it was our best ever. Roman helped turn our frown upside down. And Drew our server was exactly what you'd expect at a steakhouse of Mastro's caliber. 
Cocktail & wine perfect. Shrimp cocktail perfect (Huge shrimp & great horseradish sauce!). Filet incredible, best steak I've ever had. And the buttercake was amazing as usual. 
Mastro's met and surpassed our expectations. Because we were treated so well we'll be back again and again for sure. Ask for Drew the next time you're there!
Thanks so much Roman!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant of all time and I've been a lot of places....from the amazing seafood tower with dry ice for presentation to the bone in ribeye,  the creamed corn that is amazing, the succulent mashed potatos all the way to the warm butter cake....OMG...nothing gets better than this....and dont forget a great Dirty Martini!"}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in Arizona!  It's going to cost a few bucks, but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Mastro's is the triple threat...GREAT FOOD, GREAT ATMOSPHERE and GREAT SERVICE!  My husband and I have been coming here from Chicago for years and CANNOT wait to get our bodies into this restaurant when we land!  We just moved here and I am in 7th heaven that I can go anytime!

I highly recommend sitting in the bar/lounge where you can hear the music and I highly recommend the Martini's...they're endless...it seems.  One is like three and more than enough for dinner!  I usually get the Filet and my husband usually gets the Sea Bass....in 10 years...we have never been disappointed...literally not once!!!  

As I said, we are from Chicago- which is like the land of Steakhouses...we know our steak...Mastro's sets the bar higher and we are thrilled to be so close now!  Mastro's, if you read your reviews...don't change a thing...just keep doing what you're doing!!!  A++++++"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and our associate took us to dinner here. WOW!!! Gorgeous setting amazing food and wonderful service. We got to sit in the lounge and listen to live music while Tony took care of us and showed us an amazing time. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Up until main course food was good. Both the bone in filet and salmon were so over cooked. 
Not worth the stop."}
{"text":"Date night.... Ok, lets review some of my prior Yelps. For the past year or so, the wife and I have had the luxary of being able to go to dinner every Tuesday night in the Chicagoland area. Some hits, some misses. Click and you will see. Thanksgiving brought us to my parents house in Scottsdale Arizona - on a lazy Friday night, we decided to have yet another Date night. The Scottsdale area is loaded with swanky places to eat ranging from fussy French to Steak. After a lot of Yelp searches, we decided that Mastero's Steakhouse would be our choice. Leveraging OpenTable, I made an online reservation for 6pm. A few hours later, I received a confirmation call from the staff at Mastero's - nice touch.
Tucked away in a strip mall is a standalone building with very cool looking fire sculptures. The staff greeted us with smiles on their faces and referred correctly by last name. A quick drink order later - Gin martini & Manahtten, we quickly felt our worries melt away.
Appetizers: Escargot - Butter, garlic, puff pastry. Simple, straight forward and perfectly prepared. I don't think I can add anymore. Certainly put this on your list of things to eat. Oysters Rockefeller - Very pretty presentation of the oysters on top of rock salt. For those who like oysters, I too would highly recommend this dish. Personally, I tried one from the wife's plate and didn't like it. I just don't like oysters.
Entrée: 16 oz NY Strip - dry aged for a long time, cooked perfectly to Med rare, seasoned very simply with salt. It is easy to mess up a piece of dry aged beef - not this one. 8oz petit fillet - The Filet is one of those cuts which personally I think you should avoid. It normally is devoid of flavor and because of the very low fat content, can be dry. Quite the opposite for this one - juicy, seasoned and cooked quite nice. Roasted Brussel Sprouts - roasted over high heat and finished with butter. Love these things! Lobster Mashed Potatoes - Oh my god! There was so much butter in these potatoes it was actually funny. The lobster complimented the potatoes with elegance and the \"essence\" from the lobster juice was to die for.
Desert: Crème Brulee - another very simple dish with many complexities. The dish was loaded with vanilla bean specs, caramelized sugar on top was thick and perfect. What a way to end a meal.
Atmosphere: Dark, slow (this is good), inviting, warm. Mastero's truly defines the steakhouse atmosphere. I suppose another awesome quality is the various smells which hit you from the left or right as you walk around. More specifically, butter. Oh wow.
Price - Bring lots of $."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a client at Mastro's Steak House and they rock!  Great steaks, cooked to perfection.  Great tasting sides and prefect service.  I highly recommend Mastro's when you have an important dinner to impress or celebrate."}
{"text":"Came for my parents 59th wedding anniversary, service was great and the food was awesome. Started with the seafood tower, and wished I had ordered more! 
My wife and I shared the wagyu tomahawk ribeye and it had great flavor and was cooked a perfect medium rare. The side dishes were great, appreciated the family style servings, the star of the side dishes was the Mac and cheese and the lobster mashed potatoes. 
For dessert they brought out a butter cake and another dessert for my parents to share which had happy 59th anniversary written in chocolate on the plate, they thoroughly enjoyed it and my dad was asking when we could come back. : )"}
{"text":"One of the top 5 meals my husband and I have ever had.  This is as good as it gets and was amazing.  Beautiful restaurant and amazing food.  We look forward to making this \"our place\" :)  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Dinner with friends 
The ambiance was perfect. Candle lit dinner. Amazing service. The soda was fresh & crisp bottled water. The bread is crisp. My wedge salad was perfect! Ordered the \" surf & turf \"bone in rib eye & rock lobster tail with gorgonzola mac & cheese, scallioned garlic potatoes. The meal was topped off with their house made \"butter cake\" for dessert. I assure you I died & went to heaven. This steakhouse was truly a fine dining experience. A quality at this magnitude make cost completely inconsequential. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had dinner this past weekend and had a fantastic experience. Phil Giangrasso the GM and the rest of his staff provide superior service as well as world class cuisine! We live close by and will be regulars for sure! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but way over priced for what you got!!!!!! Waiter a little over eager to pick up the check!!!
Won't be back!!!! Don't like having to pay twice what something's worth ... that just leaves you feeling regretful about your evening out!!!!! My husband's Pork Chop was dry, the Scalloped Potatoes were very greasy and the cheese had curdled - they were not good and the Bearnaise-sauce the put on my steak cost almost as much as the steak!!!! WE'VE HAD BETTER FOR MUCH LESS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bland porterhouse steak &  rack of lamb. Won't be coming here again. Huge serving sizes but sadly not any good. $216.00 later very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Mastro's has always proven itself to be a classy steakhouse.  Phil the manager makes you feel like family. And if you don't have Radolfo assisting with your table, you are missing out! 

Last night we skipped dinner and came in for just wine and dessert.  As we made the reservation, this was mentioned.  We had a warm welcome and a great glass of wine from our favorite bartender Oscar as we waited for our table to open up.  After we were seated, our waiter- Brent handed over the dinner menu's.  We informed him we were only here for wine and dessert.  Brent proceeded to rip the menus out of our hands, grab the bread basket and shove it to the assistant and threw a huge fit to the manager. I  have never been more embarrassed or treated this poorly in my life!  

Besides being belittled for taking a table near the bar just for \"wine and dessert\" by Brent, the warm butter cake made up for his poor service. If you haven't had this already, you MUST, I say MUST try this dessert. its heaven. 

Needless to say, I love Mastro's and will be coming back but NEVER, I repeat, NEVER sitting at Brent's table again (unless we are just there for wine and dessert!  ha ha)."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the steakhouse very good the steak is always amazing they cook a steak perfect every time medium plus The sides was amazing. Lobster mash is the best highly recommend the seafood tower this is the best Mastro's in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Mastros is always our Go To place for a nice evening out. Great food and excellent service.
Butter cake is hands down the best desert I have ever had."}
{"text":"Little doubt that the food and service is excellent. Ambience is a bit noisy and dark. But it's pricing is over the top. Figure $150 per person without splitting."}
{"text":"i recently went to Mastros with some friends from work. we originally had a table in the dining room, but we asked if it would be possible to move to the bar area to hear the singers! (who were amazing by the way) They could not have been more nice about it! When we sat down at the bar we were immediately welcomed! the food was amazing and so were the drinks! For dinner i had the salmon whih just melted in my mouth; easily the best salmon i have ever had!  It could not have been a better night! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is as best as it gets! When my dad come into town this is where we always go as our tradition. It might be the only time I can get to go (a teacher's salary will not pay the bill here) but I look forward to it every time. The food is amazing, the service is the best in the city, and the atmosphere- especially if you get to sit in the bar area is the best! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to Mastro's last month for a special occasion. The steak was the best I have had in town.  Service was exemplary and very attentive.  I told them I wanted a quiet corner and they accommodated us well.  Great ambiance."}
{"text":"I've GOT to be honest and say I went for their Bread Basket!  Best ever! Went on my Birthday two years in a row.  First year Everything was 5 star. Second year? Must have hit an \"off night\".  Poor service and mediocre food, except for the BREAD!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the true definition of \"fine dinning\". 

This beautiful and sumptuous interior is very social, yet calming. As soon as you walk in you're usually greeted by the lovely piano music and guest singer. Low lighting, very tranquil. Everyone is very sweet, even in the bathrooms! Lol. 

Always a great atmosphere, every request is valued and completed. Some what reasonably priced and top-of-the-line service."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great steaks and sides. If you should choose to try Mastro's, you will be paying a premium for your steaks, seafood , etc but it is money well spent. Also, each side is more than enough to share between four or more people."}
{"text":"Delicious and substantial servings. Could have easily reduced their prices by 15-20% and still been considered a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Went with a party of 8 and everyone's meal was the best.  From the shrimp cocktail appetizer to the butter cake tower dessert; a hint, it's not on the menu, but our A+ waiter Abram created it for us. Our party had it all from fabulous steaks to seafood it was solid across the board! Our server Abram and the entire service team did a memorable job."}
{"text":"Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations. 

We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.

The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating . 

Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint ."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a GREAT surprise. The Bone-In Fillet was top notch - you could cut the meat like butter and it was served sizzling hot. Also loved the live music and how they had one wall opened up to the outside. It was a really nice restaurant but its not cheap.

I liked it so much that I went two nights in a row................."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner- Food, service, atmosphere all home runs.  This is what a steakhouse experience is supposed to be."}
{"text":"There are plenty of steakhouses in this area, but Mastro's (especially this location) is at the very top of the list.  

When it comes to this level of steakhouse you need to split hairs to distinguish one from another.  Consequently, I will give a very few other local steakhouses a \"top of the list\" rating.

The atmosphere is very good-beautiful, a little energetic, consummately professional, yet not stiff or \"stuffy\".

The drinks are very well made and the bar is quite efficient.

Then, the seafood tower of selected premium seasonal shellfish is the best in town.

The steaks here are truly world class (wet aged, prime, grain fed) and always perfectly prepared.

I think I have tasted all of the side dishes and all are wonderful, but if you ever crave fries, this is the place to indulge yourself.

I believe they have the best bread basket in the city.

What more could you want in a steakhouse except maybe a great late-night bar scene--?  Well, they have that too.

Final thought:  Mastro's is consistently awesome."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the Sunday Brunch! I cannot begin to describe the feelings one is overcome with after catching a peak at the buffet! Walking by the dessert room alone will set your dopamine receptors into hyper drive. Mastro's Sunday Brunch is a must for anyone who resides in or is visiting Scottsdale. This was hands down the best overall meal I have ever experienced. I would pay the $75 for just their belgian waffles; they are that good! The server mentioned that the brunch is seasonal and that they haven't decided if they will do it again next year. It would be a tragedy to the world if they do not bring this back next year. If you've been to Mastro's for dinner, but not their brunch, you have to go at least once....so that way you will go again, and again, and again! I work in the hospitality industry and generally work weekends, but I have made it a point to request a couple extra Sundays off! :)"}
{"text":"We love Mastros. We always have a good time. The food is always good. The service is superb. It is a little bit expensive but we love coming here."}
{"text":"This is best steakhouse restaurant in the valley. There are certain places out there where you will find yourself regretting spending money on and Mastro's certainly isn't one of them. My steak is always perfectly cooked and the method of cooking them just melts in your mouth. The service is always excellent. Never, too slow never too fast. Everybody should go here at least once in their lifetime."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the staff was GREAT!  our server was awesome, hostess was great, and the backwaiters were all great!  The food itself was dissapointing.  We started with the smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail & stuffed mushrooms.  The smoked salmon was ok, but barely any smoke flavor came thru, shrimp cocktail was average, nothing special, and the stuffed mushrooms were very bland, just not much to them.  We then had the lobster bisque, wedge, french onion soup & caprese salad.  The lobster bisque was very good, the wedge was also good, the french onion soup was average and the caprese salad was disappointing.  All of the steaks were good, not great, but good, and at $50-$60 a steak, I do expect my steak to be as good or better then I can make at home, but again, wasn't blown away.  The sides were disappointing, the mac and cheese was a big lump of cheese, not a creamy consistent sauce, but a stuck together lump of cheese & noodles.  The crab & Nocchi side was bland, no flavor, tasted like flour & sauce, garlic mashed potatoes were good.  Overall not what I expected from a steakhouse that had been reviewed so well.  As someone who cooks all the time, I may be a little critical, but when I spend over $400 on dinner, I would like to be blown away, and I wasn't, not even close."}
{"text":"Firstly the service was fantastic. It was my anniversary and the waitress was seen but not heard which gave the appearance of a very intimate dinner. Glasses were always full. Steaks cooked so perfect and you could have used a spoon to cut them and the butter cake, the butter cake made me feel like a kid. Thank you for the happy bellies and a intimate dinner all to ourselves."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. The service is fantastic. The staff is always cheerful and ready to help you. 

If you are there during the week be sure to check out the music of Joe and Dawn! The best part is they take requests. 
Worth the trip up there for sure!"}
{"text":"Mastro's has a reputation for being the best in Phoenix and they did not disappoint. I had the salmon (not a big fan of Steak) and it was excellent as were the shoestring fries."}
{"text":"Very good food, had a private room for my business meeting however our server was a \"Bro\" and did not treat us as business class but as if we were at a frat house party. The live music choice was pretty terrible and did not make for a classy dining experience. Overall OK but have had better service and ambiance at Claim Jumper without the high brow expectation. Would not take business clients there again."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit it, I am a bit of a steak snob. You see, for many years I was a vegetarian and now I am making up for lost time- with yummy steak. Long story short, I send a lot of steak back for being over cooked. I don't like it raw, just cooked right. Medium rare- warm pink center. Not a crazy way to order a premium steak, no? 

The worst offender for overcooked beef is Capital Grill, hands down. Not necessarily the Cap grills in the valley, they are actually pretty good. Beware of the Capital Grill in Detroit. Come to think of it, beware of Detroit in general. But I digress... 

Saturday night I had the most perfectly cooked cow I can remember. A chunky delicious cut of meat with a seared crust and a very perfect center. I did not have the sides that night, but they are great. Drinks are plenty big and the bartenders know how to make a perfect Rob Roy which is a plus. 

Finally, I think this location makes it even better. It is occasionaly a little crowded, but most of the time it is just about right. Enough folks around to make you feel like you are out on the town, but not so many you feel like you are at a middle aged college bar. 

To Mastro's- well done! Uh...I mean medium rare..."}
{"text":"This was probably the best steak I have ever had and the pre dinner martini was BIg and perfectly done. We were a table of four and we ordered two sides, and two desserts, which was more than enough since the meat portions are huge. I ordered the petite filet which was more than enough for one person. The regular size is an obscene amount of beef and will leave no room for anything else. The prices are outrageously expensive. We had a reservation and yet we were squeezed into a table that they put in the middle of the noisy dining area in a spot where one could tell there should not have been a table. All the servers kept hitting two people in our party and we had to ask twice for them to readjust the table position. It was not a relaxing dining experience in that regard. The maitre de should have seated us elsewhere when we first complained. We sat in the bar afterward and had fun watching the cougar mating rituals...very entertaining."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful over the top evening at Maextros last night.  We were part of a group of eight.  We were seated immediately, ordered chopped salad, rack of lamb, sautéed spinach and creme brûlée along with a very reasonably priced bottle of Zinfandel.  The waiter inadvertently omitted my husbands entree and apologized profusely but since we had ordered alike he brought a hot  plate and suggested we split mine while they prepared his.  This could have been a catastrophe but was not as they quickly brought his and it did not delay our dining.  But they still immediately comped his entree.  Everyone loved the food and the elegant setting and we cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time, a choice between two types - we picked the Osetra.   Caviar is served with mini toasts,  minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it.  What a treat.  

As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet.

Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in last night for a special New Years dinner and  They made it happen! Strong work! I will go back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service I have experienced at a steak house. CeCe, Monica, Micki, Raul, and the GM Phil. Top notch food, drinks and service. The top restaurant I have dined."}
{"text":"I told the waiter to \"surprise me\" and let him select my entree. He did and brought an unbelievable cut of beef which says a lot since I am from Omaha. Great food and excellent service and nice atmosphere. I need to make a point of going back very soon."}
{"text":"Oh my, it is so good. Prepare to overeat and then some. Sweet potato fries and the can't refuse butter cake dessert served with a bowl of real whipped cream did me in last night."}
{"text":"We went to mastros last night. The greeters were spot on, got right to the table  The food was perfect. Steaks cooked to perfection, just a fantastic kitchen. The issue was the service staff. They took so long to get drinks and last round they forgot to put the order in.  With those prices no fun staring at each other while waiting for drinks and looking for a server. We had to catch other servers attention to clear table to order deserts and finally the same routine. The manager must have figured  it out because he was one of the folks we asked for a server. At $100 plus a plate you expect more than just great food.  Dinner with friends is a social event and should not be spoiled by long interruptions in service.  I hope they take this as a positive as a positive review and get back to their  old standard   I guess the saving grace was the deserts as they were to die for. So order the pecan pie!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at this location ever ! I have been going to this location for years and regularly on my birthdays for 3 years in a row now. Usually you will get great upper class service, but maybe this time has passed. Usually I like to sit at the bar. The bartenders did not smile once. The fit lady that was bar tending did not smile even one second. She did not know the specials out of her head, what used to be normal at this place. She was doing a mediocre job reading of a piece of paper. And by the way we had to ask for what the specials are, they used to just tell you! The other bartender with the Mohawk was even worse. First off you can't understand a word of what he is saying, and then he has nothing short then street manners. If I want to hear things like \"how is it?\" Or \"everything good?\", \"how you like it?\" I go to TGI Fridays. The servers around us are yawning, grouping and talking like they are home rather then at work. They screwed up our order. Forgot all sauces to the main course. Brought part of it outcof what we first ordered, we had again ask for the rest. Mastros used to be American fine dining now it seems to be average stuff. Managers seemed unaware of all this or did not care. The tall short haired manager that seemed to be on duty first, seemed cocky, and not fitted to a place like this. He seemed to not even care a like the other managers later did not make you fell like you even want to complain, because otherwise it wouldn't get to upper management either or change a thing. Some of the serves and bartenders don't seem to get along with him.  Teamwork doesn't seem to exist at all. Overall I will not repeat another birthday at this place! Might will give it one last shot a few month from now but overall I'm disappointed. For top dollar I expect top service and Mastros is officially in north Scottsdale nothing but average Joe BS! Whatever happened in the passed six month it seemed to be a bad choice! I'm looking for a better spot! By the way, nobody ever asked of the occasion of our visit, and so nobody seemed to care anyway. Looks like the Mastros is starting to cut corners and becoming unprofessional. They lost a customer today. Actually 3, and that does not include word of mouth yet !"}
{"text":"The service was excellent! Steaks were cooked perfectly. Fun entertainment live music."}
{"text":"This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top."}
{"text":"Our experience with the front desk and wait service was so appalling, that it outweighed any other sentiments during my dining experience. Several people on staff are openly racist towards regular, well-paying, well-tipping customers. Expected better from such an establishment."}
{"text":"4.5+ stars: talk about service, Mastro's really does a number to make you feel special. While the seating was a little tight as we had a party of 6, the food and live music on a Friday night was great. 

Start with shrimp cocktail, Alaskan king crab legs, and the giant prawns then go straight into bone-in ribeyes and filets (all medium rare). 

Finish strong with the flourless chocolate pudding and buttercake to end the evening on a stellar note!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were ok, main course horrible.  Grilled lobster tails came out raw, they did bring another serving, these too were barely cooked..  The halibut was similar to chewing on a shoe.  For the prices they charge we will not be going back.  It seems like everyone who goes there has been brainwashed to think they are getting a good meal."}
{"text":"Yelpers gave Mastro's Steakhouse some rave reviews.  So, of course, my boyfriend and I had to try it.

WOW!  The food, ambiance, and service were excellent!

My boyfriend had the ribeye steak with creamed spinach, and we shared the lobster mashed potatoes.  I had the clear lobster roll and the New York pepper steak.

Everything was wonderful, and Mastro's high ranking is well deserved.

It's pricey, but you get value for your dollar here.

We shall return!"}
{"text":"Mastro's wurde mir im Hotel als bestes Steakhouse empfohlen und hat dies erfüllt. Es gibt mehrere Bereiche zum Essen, auch an Hochtischen oder der Bar. Der Service war einwandfrei, auch die Wartezeiten gut an die einzelnen Gänge angepasst. Ich hatte ein Chef Selection New York Strip 20oz (550gr) 56$, steamed Broccoli 11$, Caesar Salad 11$, Espresso 6$ (!), Weine im Glas starten bei 10$.
Das Steak Medium-well war perfekt. Fazit, Essen & Ambiente top, Lage: etwas außerhalb."}
{"text":"Usually we hit Mastro's Ocean Club when we're in Scottsdale, but we decided to change it up a bit and try Mastro's Steakhouse. It did not disappoint.  Our party of four enjoyed a family style dinner of Lobster Bisque soup, Chopped Salad, and a 48 ounce Double Cut Porterhouse.  For sides we chose a Lobster Mashed Potato and Creamed Corn. Everything was truly superior including the service. After dinner we headed into the lounge and enjoyed a nightcap while we listened to a talented duo of keyboards and vocals. Enjoyed the dining, the service, and the beautiful high end interior design of Mastro's Steakhouse!  Very pleased. Very impressed."}
{"text":"I see a few reviews complaining but one thing you have to know is that this is a very nice steakhouse and the price points are going to be very different than most restaurants. With that said I love Mastros. As soon as you walk in the mood is set with the impeccably decorated interior. The service is as good as you'd expect for a place like this as well. The food is great but if you're going to come here you have to grab a steak. The sides are pretty good and what you'd expect from a steakhouse but it's one of the best steaks I've had. Obviously not a place most will frequent a lot but well worth a visit for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Came here twice, 30 days apart from each visit. Once as a birthday with family. The waitress rambled on and on for thirteen (!!) minutes about their seafood options after we had already warned about an allergy with the reservation and she talked so incessantly that not a single person out of the five of us could interrupt her- and we're not quiet or shy individuals. 

Additionally, we made the reservations well in advance and we were still crammed so far in the corner that we couldn't get up from the table without the one adjacent to us having to move their chair out of the way. Not to mention we were directly under an AC vent which froze us and our food. 

The food itself was atrocious. Only two of the five filets were cooked correctly, with the worst mistake having a medium-rare brought out as almost well-done. All were overcooked. 

The second visit a month later was with family friends whom had made the reservation after hearing Mastro's was the best in town. I thought maybe the first time was just busy and a fluke. I got the bone-in filet this time around. The cut of meat was so bad that it was split from all the sinews and again way over cooked. It was so obvious that someone across the table noticed and encouraged me to send it back. It was also brought out on the wrong plate, with lobster (??), which we didn't order, and they simply picked it up and put it on a new (cold) plate. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Mastro's is expensive.  The portions are not Cheesecake Factory super-sized.  However, for a special occasion or \"just a drink, dessert, and people watching\", it really is as old-school elegant-glam perfect as one can find.  Regulars include a very dapper gentleman of about 80 always in a beautiful suit and silk tie, a mildly famous cowboy writer in his Stetson, various 30/40-somethings on their third date, and plenty of locals and out of towners celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, and mergers/aquisitions.  Sure, the food is good.  Very good, in fact.  But I think it's really all about the bar at Mastro's.  Sexy martini's (the \"smoking\" lemon drop martini complete with dry ice, the chocolate martini with it's own chocolate covered strawberry, or the quintessential dirty martini), a truly outstanding wine list and great free bread (and the pretzel bread is the best you'll find outside South Philly) make for a good ol' time.  And then there's the music.  Live piano playing, often accompanied by a female vocalist liven things up and are usually quite good at getting the crowd into that warm, buzzy, \"if you can't be with the one you love....\" mindset.  Typical selections include Neil Diamond, Carly Simon, a few Beatles selections.  Most recently, however, I was there with a small group sharing the (sinful) butter cake and drinks.. when the pianist starting playing a medley of WWII military theme songs (\"Anchors Awheigh\", the Air Force Theme Song, You're in the Army Now, etc.) with many of the crowd singing along... and then made an announcement that there were 2 of the only 89 living Congressional Medal of Honor recipients in the room that night.  The entire place, bar and restaurant, stood and applauded for several minutes, several people went over to shake the two (very senior) men's hands.  Now that's just the kind of  thing you would never expect... but you really could at Mastro's."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our 1 Year Anniversary and needless to say she was pleasantly surprised. I've been to this location once before years ago but never Yelped about it and it was wonderful to go back. I had the unbelievable New York Pepper Steak there and my wife the Scottish Salmon. We had the garlic mashed potatoes and also the fresh broccoli as our sides. Our water Jerry really took good care of us from our beverages of choice to compliment our meals and my wife's salad was also very good. I ordered the shrimp cocktail and thankfully Jerry warned me about the straight up nosebleed horseradish! Jerry was just amazing. If you ever go to Mastro's be sure to ask for him, actually anyone there will do well, we just loved Jerry to pieces for everything. He was very down to earth and attentive. It was an extraordinary culinary experience and thanks to him, we had a celebration of flavors wetting our pallets. 

Sadly though the night had to carry on and we were blessed with Matro's amazing Butter Cake after our entrees. I'm glad that we booked for 5pm because around 545 it really started to pack in. We felt we had the entire restaurant to ourselves for a while and just savored how fast the first year of our marriage went. My steak melted in my mouth and my wife's salmon was perfect. Oh and the shrimp cocktail? Well those prawns were by no means thin! LOL! They were a meal unto themselves! I can't say enough about this place. 

We left happy and content and were more than happy to leave Jerry a substantial tip because he made us feel like family. The food could have been absolutely horrible, but because of this good man, he would have made a negative meal experience disappear. Yes, he was that good! He actually said goodbye and thanked us for being his guests. Classy. On Spot. Positive. Thank you so much Jerry and Mastro's we'll be back again another day soon! You made our Anniversary memorable!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night was pretty standard Mastro's experience.  Always warm elegant atmosphere, we started with the Caesar salad it was very good my dinning partner commented that the fork wasn't chilled like it usually is, he is pickier than I am apparently.  Filet was very good cooked perfect medium rare I added three scallops to my meal, at $9.50 a scallop it was a pricey add on not sure I would do it again.  They were fresh I will give them that I got a few pieces of sand after diving into the second one (interesting) they were okay nothing to rave about.  Sautéed mushrooms and creamed spinach of course always good.  Our server was good; however the table assistant kind of had an attitude? We didn't ask him for anything or inconvenience him in any way (everyone has a bad night I guess) I had an espresso with the butter cake, my table mate had an after dinner drink and I am not sure what the delay was but it took over 10 minutes to come evidently they were searching for ingredients.  It was a cocktail on the menu it's not like we invented a new drink.  Mastro's is always good I think I might have hit this one on a bad night (it happens)"}
{"text":"Always reliably good food, ambiance and service. My Scottsdale go-to for Filet (and lemon drop martini's)."}
{"text":"Love this place.  So many restaurants around but this classic is simply the best.  Go sit in bar area share a meal."}
{"text":"Just tried Mastro's for the first time this Christmas eve 2013 with the family. We made a reservation and upon our arrival we were seated right away. The four of us, two adults and two kids ages 11 and 6 all ordered filet mignon from the menu. The steaks were all perfectly cooked to order and the flavor and quality of the meat was second to none. The side dishes and appetizers were also quality. Yes, the prices are high, but in this day and age in order to get a top quality steak it seems one needs to pay top prices. I have tried other places such as Capitol Grill and by far Mastro's is better than the rest. I highly recommend this restaurant for top quality meat if you can afford the check. Plan on spending at least $60 per head and that is without drinks. The only negative I found was that the restaurant is quite loud so it was hard to hear my wife and kids as we tried to speak across the table to one another.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced food with lousy service. My husband took me their for our anniversary and when you enter everyone greeted us. As soon as we sat down the waiter must have been in a bad mood that night but he was rushing us through the menu and dinner. For the price of the food I will not be returning due to poor service."}
{"text":"Normally, I go into detail about a restaurant...but why bother when you know its going to be the same goodness everytime you go!

Great wine list for sure!

Steaks always come out piping hot with the butter jumping off the plate.  Cut into the steak and soak up every last bit of that butter!  It will be a party in your mouth.

Desert...you can't leave without!  Even just to take it home (if you are too full) is worth it.  

You won't be disappointed in this place...guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago and had a very sub par meal, the manager offered me a \"repeat.\"  I took him up on it because a $200 steak dinner with a bad steak is never a fun experience.  Went back and everything was top notch.  Hubby had a perfectly done steak; I had great crab legs, and everything was as it should be for this price.  Thanks to the manager for following up and caring!"}
{"text":"Down hill!

This place used to be great, but now rests on its laurels.

I remember a visit to Mastro' s used to mean perfection, now it is just pretentious.

I have been several times and always loved it, but my last couple of visits have landed this place right in the toilet for me. I don't think I will be giving it another visit after this latest episode:

I took my dad and family for a birthday celebration because my dad just loved the place too. 

We were greeted and asked about the special occasion by our server who took the opportunity to make jokes about age...  All fine. 

Took the drink order for a table of 4 and shows up with 3 drinks but totally forgot the guest of honor's ... Oops!  

Takes our order and serves guest of honor with a barely cooked filet. It was ordered medium-rare, something Mastro usually nails, it came out purple and raw in the middle.  When commented on, the server promptly picked it back up, returned it to the kitchen and brought it back well passed medium... Yikes! 

Pay that much for a filet you should expect perfection, they missed this one on both sides. Not even a question whether it was okay. 

To kick the final door in, the table next to us was brought a nice birthday cake and birthday wish, we were brought the bill... Ouch! 

I suppose being chided about age was gift enough!

I was upset enough to write a letter. I was very happy to get a voice message from the manager saying he'd like to discuss my experience. I called him back and left a message, but did not hear back. I tried again, and have still not heard back for over 6 months. 

Looks like I'm done with this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a thick juicy steak and martini. All the dishes I have had there have been great and the drinks are stiff. I also love the fact that the place is so dark the waiters have to use a flashlight to help you look at the menu. Careful!! Those plates are sizzling hot!! MMmmastros. I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had dinner at the Pinnacle Peak location last night. Everything was perfect and our waiter Drew provided excellent service. My mom is not always the easiest to wait on and Drew handled her like a pro and never let his smile fade. He definitely catered to his audience for when we asked for the butter cake to go, he gave us extra whip cream and made sure our ice cream stayed frozen with a little bit of dry ice! I have never seen anyone do that before and it was NOTED! Good job Drew! You did an awesome job! As frequent guests of Mastro's, everything was spot on for our impromptu dinner tonight"}
{"text":"Food Delicious - - Hidden Costs .....  UNACCEPTABLE.    We ordered a Brussel Sprout side for $13 and was asked if we'd like to add Bacon. We said sure.  Little did we know until we paid the bill it was an additional $14 (more than the cost of the dish).  Then when we received the bill there was a 3% surcharge added 'due to the rising cost of doing business in this location, including costs associated with higher minimum wage rates'.  SERIOUSLY?  Maybe tell your patrons up front there's a surcharge.  And honestly, when a bill for 4 people (including two bottles of wine comes to $400+, you really need to charge a surcharge?   Me thinks not Mastro's!  Come on!."}
{"text":"First off all, the steak was sublime. The best I've had anywhere. Perfectly cooked, melt-in-your-mouth amazing. My only complaint is in the poor quality of the sides. 

The $38 lobster mashed potatoes were extremely disappointing. The potatoes were under seasoned and so runny they could barely be eaten with a fork. The lobster was dreadfully over cooked and rubbery. 

Also, both the lobster and the crab steak topping were so poorly shelled, nearly every bite/piece had shells in it. Both dangerous and disgusting. 

The Gorgonzola mac and cheese was really pretty good, but devoid of any actual Gorgonzola flavor. So, while anyone who likes normal mac and cheese will enjoy this dish, it certainly wasn't special."}
{"text":"Drinks and appetizers were so yummy Had the steak carpaccio amd shrimp with garlic toast. Absolutely delicious! The staff was so sweet and friendly. Came as a tourist but wish I could return!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  Tony was my waiter that night and he made my fiancees birthday so special.  He recommended an awesome Pinot Nior that went great with our steaks.  Environment and the staff were perfect.  A+"}
{"text":"What can I say that already has been said about this epic place? 

I come here for all special occasions. My birthday, Christmas Eve, a special lady. The bar area is such a lively spot and great for people watching. You know you are going to receive 5 star service and food. Then it's just time to sit back, enjoy a cocktail or amazing wine and take it all in...You are living life my friend!"}
{"text":"We live in the area, and had been thinking we should try this place since it would be very convenient if it were good. It's not. Martinis were very well done, and service is very competent and attentive. But, really, we're there for the food, right?

It's basic steakhouse fare, and not great at that. Lobster tails were overcooked and rack of lamb was not properly seasoned. My husband grills better steaks at home...I make a much more flavorful rack of lamb...and neither of us would crucify a lobster tail the way their chef did. Truly nothing special at this place, yet it's priced like it's the best food in Scottsdale...which it, most emphatically, is not. Save your money. There are many better quality restaurants in Scottsdale.

Also, if you're wanting someplace romantic, go somewhere else. This place is dark, but super loud."}
{"text":"Check your bill! Check your bill before you pay!  Just got home, kept the itemized bill, and say that I was charged for over $50 worth of food items I did not order.  Total up charge scam. Food was good, but clearly the waiter was slimy. Too bad, won't go back."}
{"text":"Muk and I recently celebrated her birthday at Mastro's.  So, what did I like about the place.  Valet was very professional and friendly with a sense of humor..Hostesses were effective, letting us switch to a quieter table as we approached the one they were trying to give us. The steak was, without a doubt, the best chunk o'meat I've had in many a year.. We both had the bone-in filet and it was soooooo scrumptious!.. We had sides of steamed broccoli and steamed asparagus, both done to a T.  Along with a nice bottle of wine, the meal was complete.  I had checked with them beforehand about any possible birthday thing they could do and they then brought out one of their buttercake(the name alone tells you this is going to be sooooo baaad and soooooo goood) desserts with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate  and a candle.  Since I have to watch my desserts, after three bits I had to tie my hands together with  my belt so I couldn't eat anymore of it!  And bang my forehead on the table!.  Two buzzkills:  One, the waiter would not stop talking! He oversold everything.  And would not just shut up!  Every time he passed the table there was more and none of it was adding to the service level. I told Muk at one point if he did not shut the f**k up, I was going to jump up and stab him in the neck with that big ass steak knife they'd given us!  I know they are slow this time of year and it was a Wednesday night but please!..To make matters worse,  when he'd approach the table he'd never check to see if we were talking and wait for a break.. He'd just start talking right on top of us again and again.. Where is that steak knife!?  That and the music was way too loud. But great music!

If its a fine chunk o' you're looking for, this place delivers.. Just have your steak knife ready!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite special occasion restaurant! The servers are super attentive and knowledgeable!

Appetizer: Foie Gras, we have never had it much less liver of any sort so we tried it. It was amazing! So delicate in both taste and texture!

Dinner: Ribeye and Peppered New York Strip Steaks. They were both phenomenal! The Ribeye was so tender I had to make sure I wasn't eating a blob of fat! The NY steak wasn't as tender but the pepper crust was amazing!

Sides: Lobster Mashed Potatoes (of course) and Asparagus You cannot go wrong here

Dessert: It was a birthday so we got a (complimentary) warm butter cake! They even wrote on the plate (in chocolate) Happy Birthday and the name of the guest!

Drinks: Stella Artois and Appletini, the appletini seemed to have a bit too much apple pucker, but since they served it over dry ice I was too excited to notice (or care)!

We plan on going at least once per year! If you go here, you will not regret it!

We sat in the lounge and the Pianist and Singer were just divine!!! It's a must do!!!

You can go casual (there was a gentleman in a Hawaiian shirt) or dressed up! We dressed up for fun and super excited for the red carpet at the entrance."}
{"text":"Insanely good. When cost is no object and you're hungry for adult-sized portions, this is the place - no miniature, pretentious little servings here. Easily my favorite Valley eatery and the surroundings are on par with the food."}
{"text":"I eat at a lot of steakhouses in the valley and this was by far the not my fave dinner I have ever had. I ordered the wasabi mashed potatoes and they had no flavor, the steak was tough and overcooked. When I told our server about it, nothing was done. No manager, no apology, nothing. I would much rather have a great dinner and friendly service down the street at Paul Fleming's restaurant.  I am giving them 3 stars because the wait time was minimal and they were very interactive with our kids."}
{"text":"I've lived in the valley almost 10 years and have yet to visit City Hall or Ocean Club...(shame on me!)

So I was pretty excited when some friends wanted to meet up at Mastro's. It was no surprise the food and drinks were divine. I've been to Ruth's a few times, but Mastro's is awesome in that the music is live and FANTASTIC, and it's a little more relaxed of an environment in my opinion. We had Oysters & Crab Stuffed Mushrooms to start off with. Pork Chops and Filet with a Spinach Salad for Dinner. All excellent!

The portions were SURPRISINGLY large, yet so is the price. However, you do get what you pay for and that was by far the best pork I believe I've ever had. 

The martinis were fantastic and just a warning, you order 1 - but they serve it with the shaker and you get a whole second pour. Dangerous.

I will go back for sure, next time I cash out my 401k ;)"}
{"text":"Great new york strip and warm spinich salad!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary and I loved it! The food was amazing the service was amazing everything was great just the way I expected. I heard a lot of good things from this place and it's true, what was supposed to be a great night turned out to be a perfect night!!! By the way the \"Butter Cake\" was like and orgasm in my mouth. Deff give it a try!"}
{"text":"Mastro's has changed and not in any way they should be proud of.  Yes the premium prices remain and yes they do a fine steak, but the new focus seems centered around the up sell.  I realize this is typical of most restaurants but Mastro's hadn't been most restaurants.  Mastro's was a place to share or celebrate a moment; the place to have that special dining experience.  Our recent meal 4 nights ago was the opposite.  Our waiter was tactless and clueless.  He asked if we wanted him to \"drop a seafood tower for the table\" and tried to talk one of the group out of their specific and preferred vodka drink to make a clumsy pitch for a different vodka pushed by management.  Every course presentation was more about selling than serving.  The service had previously been well timed and unobtrusive but on this occasion we were simply quick served in an attempt to cycle the table.  We even had a birthday in the group, told the waiter who asked the name and specific spelling of the birthday guest only to do absolutely nothing with that information....no song, no cake,...nothing.  Apparently a $700 tab for 6 doesn't merit such gestures.  Truly a disappointment in all regards.  If our experience represents the new Mastro's style, you would be wise to give some extra thought to where you chose to dine and celebrate.  We certainly will."}
{"text":"Ended up here for our 10 year anniversary after we discovered our original choice had a set menu for the night.  Overall fantastic experience with great service and even better food.  Do yourself a favor and ask for Frank.  He found out it was our anniversary and couldn't have treated us better!  Go Calvin Knights!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this 5 star restaurant? Well it should get 10 stars!  First off, Tobias our waiter was fabulous!! He has been there since 2007 and knows the menu backwards and forwards.  He had great suggestions.  Gotta recommend starting with dessert first.  Cause if you don't save room for it you will be greatly disappointed.  All I can say is get the butter cake!
Come hungry because the portions are ridiculous!! I don't think we had any idea what we were ordering.  The side dishes are huge!!! We even ordered the small portion and it could have easily fed 3-4 adults...
Had the 12 oz bone in filet.  Comes out sizzling on the hot plate.  The steaks are very good.  So many options it will make your head spin!
Give this place a try and you will thank yourself later!"}
{"text":"Best steak and service I have had in Phoenix! The filet is about 2 inches thick and you thinks you are cutting through butter. The service is impeccable an and the atmosphere is fantastic. I believe Mastro's food and service are a cut above Morton's and Ruth's Chris. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone. The price is about $100 a place which takes into account a salad and side dish but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is the best \"premium\" restaurant in the Phoenix metro area. Every item on their considerable menu is flawless and memorable. Yes, it is expensive. However, they deliver high end value without cutting corners. Steaks are great as is the seafood. However it is the sides that are exceptional. Fabulous."}
{"text":"This Mastro's was recommended to us the first time we came to Scottsdale 10 years ago.  Now we MUST dine here every time we visit.  The bone-in ribeye is the best steak I've ever ate.  And even the vegetables are supreme.  For an appetizer, try the snow crab - it is out of this world.  Make no mistake, you pay for this type of excellence.  But it is well worth it.  Per the General Manager tonight, the Chicago location will open early fall."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple Mastro's Steakhouse's and I have never had a bad experience. The food was amazing as was the service. This is a beautiful restaurant and I would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious... We got the chef's cut ribeye, lobster potato salad, and one of the fish. The lobster potato salad had PLENTY of lobster in it. The chef's cut was very flavorful. We asked for it to be sliced so we can share it. It was big enough to fill 2 very heavy eaters. This is the first time we over ordered at an expensive restaurant. The fish was not necessary at all. None the less we finished everything because we were afraid that the meat would go bad if we took it home. It is on the pricy side. And I forgot there was tax Lol... Coming from Oregon that's very annoying!"}
{"text":"One of my husbands and I all time favorite restaurants! Cece is the best server! Bone in fillet it beyond delicious, and the butter cake will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Visited here on Monday, April 26, 2010.

This was my 2nd time to this location, I am a frequent visitor to the Thousand Oaks spot, and have been to the Beverly Hill location once.

As usual, we grabbed a high top table in the bar area.  We find we like to indulge as we split plates, have a few drinks and enjoy the music and bar scene.

First the food:

We split a caprese salad, had the wonderful bread basket (love the pretzel rolls), split a chefs cut (20oz.) NY Strip, Lyonnaise potatoes.  All was top notch as we expected.  Reason for 4 vs 5 stars was, they brought a bone in rib eye in error, which went back.  The Strip they brought was a bit rare but cooked on the plate.  The potatoes were very thick and dry, not sure if I remember them always being that way.  I would not order them again.

In fairness, they did give up a complimentary dessert - warm butter cake with fresh creme.  Bad news is we ate it and both felt over indulged.

The Bar:

Was 6pm when we arrived, and very quiet.  By 7:30 the younger woman / older men crowd started to take shape.  The music was very nice and rounded out the Bar scene.

Overall a fun evening out."}
{"text":"Food was fairly good to be honest. VERY rushed to turn tables and get rid of our group of 15. Tried ordering a ride home and was told not to. Ride provided cost over 5 times the Uber cost. Wouldn't suggest large groups or using their \"shuttle\" service."}
{"text":"This steak house is probably the best I've been to in the Phoenix area.   I had the Ossetra caviar, seafood tower,  Filet Mignon,  Lobster Mashed Potatoes,  and Brussel Sprouts.  Every single dish was PERFECT.  In most steakhouses I've eaten at,  there is always the dish that I didn't care much for...but here they nailed everything.   Perfect amounts of salt and seasoning,  fantastic presentation, phenomenal atmosphere.   I don't think I'd ever tire of coming here."}
{"text":"Travelled from California with my son for ready and willing to splurge. Filet was what I'd expect for a very high end establishment like this: excellent, juicy, flavorful, and perfectly prepared. .  Don't bother with the \"bone in;\" I really don't think it makes a difference, and especially for the extra $15.  Love the cream spinach.  I felt like the garlic mashed potatoes could have been a lot more garlicky, but then I like it strong.  Servers very attentive but not overly so. Very expensive: two persons, no wine, no dessert, one cup of coffee: $210 including the tip.  For me, it's a once a year extravagant experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, awesome food, great atmosphere. Overall good time since the 3 others I was with make the best out of everything however was below par for the dining experience in itself. Coming from out of town and made reservations over a month ago for 8:30pm. We were seated in the dining room area. Very comfy, table perfectly set, again atmosphere perfect... However, we have never felt so rushed out of a place. It was quite apparent that the room was closing and the server was ready to get out of there shortly after we were seated. Two of us are in the industry so we get the cues... Sadly the two other who are not, picked up on them as well.  Finally we paid our tab and relocated to the bar just to get out so the server could relax and get out of there, clearly his only concern.  Upon moving to the bar and politely asking if it was okay if we sat or if the bar was closing (now 10:30), another server comes over and vents about wanting to get out of the place.  Perhaps we should have made our reservations earlier or if the host knowing one side of the dining is closing at 9 don't seat a table at 8:30. Not sure where the paths aren't meeting but for $700 being pushed out of a place, someone might want to brush up on some service skills. Or not since it is clear lousy service still makes bank. I wish could rate the food and the service separate."}
{"text":"Dined here in March 2013.

Top-notch food, wine list, environment and service. i thought i was the pinnacle of class, sophistication and elegance prior to going here; a new bar has been set. Speaking of which...sit at the bar...and rub shoulders w/ the once-weres of the midwest and pacific."}
{"text":"Mastro's made our anniversary special!! Our server Monica was excellent!! Very warm , friendly and had perfect timing checking on us between appetizer, salad, steak and dessert ! They seated us in a corner table which was romantic and cozy. The restaurant was a little on the loud side with the background live music from the bar and the full restaurant. The live music was nice. I didn't expect this on a Tuesday night.  There was a big selection of bread to start with I was careful to not over eat. My lemon drop Martini came with a tiny piece of dry ice in it that made it look very impressive! It was also perfect! I haven't had a decent one in awhile ! I ordered a vegetable roll to begin which I enjoyed. Presentation was nice. I then had the chopped salad  and 6oz fillet. Their fillets were perfect! My husband said it was like having dessert!!  They were excellent!!! The reviews did not exaggerate their steaks are wonderful. We shared his twice baked potato, it was huge! Monica then surprised us with a butter cake with a candle in it and happy anniversary written in chocolate on the edge of the plate! Very nice touch !!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last week for our anniversary.  It was absolutely fabulous.  Our dinner highlights were the bone in filet, lobster mashed potatoes, shrimp cocktail.  We had the butter cake for desert which I will order everytime that we dine there.  The service was the best!  If we thought about it our waiter took care of it.  Everything came out timed perfectly, finish one course the next one was brought out.  If you want a very special evening I can't thing of a better place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here visiting my brother, his fiancé, and her extended family.  Her family I guess are regulars.  It was a special family occasion as well.  As a group we started with a custom seafood platter.   Being from the Pacific Northwest and currently living on the California coast, I'm hesitant on eating seafood in a land lock state (horrible past experience), but it was not to disappoint.  It was all fresh, not over cooked, not rubbery, and not waterlogged.  I even ate a few raw oysters and they tasted very fresh.  All the steaks (because why would you eat fish at a steakhouse or bring a vegetarian here?) were cooked perfectly.  The plates were hot.  The waiter served the sides to each individual at the beginning.  I had the creamed corn, asparagus, and sweet potato fries; all were cooked properly and came out hot.  We had a dessert platter of every dessert they had to share, which of course was fantastic.   Key lime, chocolate covered strawberries, and every type of yummy goodness.   Every little detail I would expect in a high-end restaurant that most people might not see was there.  Not one drink went below half full.  It did start to get a little loud but that was due to the table next to us.  When they reached a peak and the entire dinning room looked, they realized this and quiet down.  My husband and I are about to go back for a visit with my brother; we're going back for dinner."}
{"text":"My fiance and I are at Mastro's Steakhouse Scottsdale and she orders a bone in ribeye so I order the bone in filet figuring we can share for variety.  Our orders arrive and while the filet was tender, the ribeye flavor was out of this world.  So, I was bummed and when the waitress came back and asked how my steak was, I expressed my \"ribeye envy\".  They immediately took back my filet and brought out a ribeye!!!  That is the most amazing service I have EVER experienced in a restaurant.  I took one bite and it was awesome (at this point, I'd already ate half of my fiance's ribeye), so I asked them to wrap it and ordered the Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  It was amazing and highly recommended!!!  I'd go back just for the dessert!  Walking out of the restaurant, I couldn't fit even a wafer thin mint.  A truly great experience and highly recommend Mastros Steakhouse Scottsdale!  I won't go to another steakhouse while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best steak you can find anywhere.  I travel the world extensively and have never come close to the taste of a bone in ribeye at Mastros."}
{"text":"Same as my review for City Hall, this is another great Mastro's restaurant.  This will not disappoint if you enjoy classic steakhouse fare and are willing to spend a good amount of money to do so."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.   
Perfectly cooked  food ,  great service  attention to every detail.  

We had steaks and seafood at our table and everything was great!!!  ( note:  they didn't have wild salmon , and to me it had a bit of a fishy taste, but the person who ordered it liked it a lot so I can't complain... Ps ya go to a steak house get a steak. :). .

For special occasions or doe those that don't have to worry about money you can't go wrong with mastros."}
{"text":"I would like to thank our server and the staff for an impressive job well done! My date and I went to Mastros tonight and received superb service and cuisine! My date ordered us the Rack of lamb, medium, which was cooked to perfection, with a mountain of sweet potato fries and jumbo asparagus. The service never slacked considering my date...my five year old daughter. She chose the restaurant based on the fact that they served Rack of Lamb and sweet potato fries. She specifically asked for a \"fancy\" restaurant and Mastros delivered in ever way! They completely catered to us as normal and went above and beyond playing along with letting her \"pay\"! This was her first true \"fine dinning\" experience and I feel I've given her a taste too early she wants to go back tomorrow! Thank you again Mastros staff for accommodating my five year old an I this evening!"}
{"text":"As close to five stars as it gets. All the dinning aspects are covered. Every staff member is passionately dedicated to your dining experience. The training is evident and  obviously extensive. There is not a misstep anywhere. The wine glasses are polished. The place setting are aligned like soldiers. These are not subjective observations, but factual. 
  Now, IMHO, the very best shrimp cocktail anywhere is at Mastros. Yeah, surprising at a desert restaurant. Gargantuan U7 shrimp are cold, shinny and snap crisp every time. Add the knock-your-sox-off Atomic horseradish to enhance the experience. Finish with Mastros perfect twenty buck mega Martinis. Yeah, you get the shaker with and other pour. It's really two drinks and a value."}
{"text":"I'm going to enjoy this review.  

Let me first contextualize this review by giving you some background information:

-I have been to Mastro's, at least, over 50 times (very conservative estimate)

-I have had EVERYTHING on the menu

-I know nearly every employee there, from valet to kitchen.

So...let's begin.

I started going here about 8 years ago.  People I know and associate with make this their destination of choice on a nightly basis and I frequently join them.  This has given me the opportunity to try the entire menu and experience many nights of service.

SERVICE:

The service is great.  No doubt about it.  From the hostess to the bussers, their is a professional, cordial and attentive quality to the entire staff.  

FOOD:

The appetizers are all great, but nothing innovative or spectacular.  Any horseradish/shrimp fans should definetly try the shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp are massive and the horseradish is the best you'll EVER HAVE.  The seared ahi app is great too.  Also, the mambo salad is great, as is the chop. Avoid the french onion soup.

The food is archetypal steakhouse fare.  Sizzling, obnoxiously large, buttered steaks that come on an oh-so-hot plate.  Sides that are decadent and come in huge portions.  

The steaks are fantastic.  Some of the best meat I've ever had in my entire life.  My all-time fav is the Bone-in Kansas City strip.    BUT you can't go wrong with the ribeye, porterhouse, new york...etc.  I have been to Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Mortons, durants, donovans...and I still think mastro's has the best cuts in town.  

The sides are a true treasure.  You must absolutley get the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  Decadent and rewarding.  The creamed corn is also excellent.  The potatoes au gratin is also stand out.  I'm also in love with the Gorgonzola mac and cheese.  So creamy and rich its amazing.  Heres a secret too, you can request to add, say, onions, tomatoes, bacon, jalapenos, into the mac n cheese...delecious. 

The deserts are extravagant as well. The butter cake is hands down the best desert on the menu.  

I could go on and on, but eh...i'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"I wish I could slam down 5 stars, and some day I may, but for now, I have to ding them for overcooking my $45 steak.  In the tradition that Ruth's Chris started, Mastro's brings out your steak on a 1000 degre plate (or something like that).  All that does, other than provide sizzle when the steak is delivered, is continue to cook your steak until a mid-rare ends up mid-well.  Too bad because the flavor was great.  We began our night at the bar, which was extremely slow, given the fact that it was not even busy.  We sat down and our server was very good at trying to upsell everything.  We had the seafood tower since there were five of us, and it was pretty good.  Their lobster mashed potatoes are a must have.  The wine list is priced very high.  Most bottles are a minimum of 3x retail.  I miss California and corkage.  I have excellent bottles in my collection and would gladly pay $20-30 to bring them to a restaurant.  The 2003 Margaux ran $3,600 a bottle, and it released around $899.  That's crazy to me.  Overall, I think I would go back and give them another shot, but I can't say this is the best steakhouse I've been to."}
{"text":"My girl & I went to Mastro's on 05/19/18 for our anniversary dinner. I previously made plans with hostess - Victoria who was wonderful in helping me get a nice table and set us up with the best waitress' Cece and Monica. Our dinner was fantastic from start to finish. We started with martinis, before moving on to some absolutely terrific French Onion Soup. We both had Filets which were cooked to perfection and came out on a sizzling 400* plate. After dinner Cece helped us get a spot at the back bar in the lounge near the piano. Besides getting us an anniversary card and rose on the table, they brought us out some Rum Butter Cake & Ice Cream with a candle on a happy anniversary plate. I then took this opportunity to \"Propose\" to my girlfriend and the people in the lounge went wild as did my girl! All and all we had a great night, and will now make Mastro's a yearly tradition. Thank You!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience. Highly recommended. The NY steak melted in my mouth. And the Creme Brûlée was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start. Let's start with the positive - the steak is top-notch.

Now - on to the service. Horrible from the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out. We arrive and I give the hostess my last name... she stares at her computer for 90 seconds before telling us \"oh you can have a seat we will call you in a few minutes\". Ok...

We get seated, it takes 5-7 minutes before water is  poured. During this time one of the waiters bumped into the back of my chair twice without any acknowledgement that he did so.

Waiter gives us me menu, no mention of specials ever... table next to us got a full run down of the menu / specials.

Water now being refilled every 2 minutes.

Finish appetizers (scallops were burnt) - dirty plate sits in front of me for 15 min. Had it not been for the steak being ready, that plate would have sat another 15 min.

Appetizer plate finally taken, and no one scrapes the crumbs / food off the table (standard in classy restaurant).

Glass then hits me in the ankle from waiter who drops dirty dishes off his tray.

Eating entree - waiter bumps into my chair twice more, no acknowledgement.

Finish meal, ask to box half of the 20oz steal my father ordered (no human should order a steak that size). Waiter asks if we want dessert, I politely say no.

20 minutes later our check arrives (we weren't drinking alcohol / finishing our drinks... we were drinking water). 

For a place with $200 wagyu steaks on the menu, the service is not where it needs to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to get Mastros to-go (we didn't have a babysitter so we put the kiddos to bed and pretended to be having a nice dinner out). The process was super streamlined and easy to use. The food was tasty (yes, even to-go). Tried the bone in filet, cream corn, wedge salad and garlic mashed potatoes. Steak was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful. The sides were good but nothing to write home about. We would probably do this again, in the future, and found the price to be pretty reasonable. Overall, a good experience!"}
{"text":"Really not much to say other than you get what you pay for and that being said the food is always amazing and on point. Service is impeccable. Steak cooked to perfection. Lobster gnocchi was mouth watering. We usually have the warm butter cake (which is always the go-to at any of the Mastros), but someone at the table ordered the pecan pie and holy moly was it good."}
{"text":"Great food and portions.  
The banquet booth seating and tables are too close together where is almost not comfortable that the neighbors are listening to your diner conversation.  Take out a couple of tables please."}
{"text":"OMG, this is my all time favorite steak house. Pricey but usually always worth it. They have the best bone in filet I have ever had. I wish I could go more often. Good wine list, great sides, fun bar area with live entertainment."}
{"text":"Great place is you have a very thick wallet. Steaks are beautifully cooked. NY peppercorn is my fav. Wassabi mashed potatoes, garlic snap peas and au-grautin potatoes round out the top sides for me. You can also enter the bar before 5 pm and order a house salad and ask to split it they are so large. Great way to save $$$ and enjoy the quality food. They are very accomodating. Butter cake for desert chocolate or vanilla bean are so rich you will need to share."}
{"text":"Due to the high prices here, I probably would actually rate this a 3.5 stars. Bumping it up to 4 because there was nothing really wrong with the food or experience-- just pricey. 

It really was a great meal-- but honestly, I find it hard to shell out $100/meal in general unless it's something really extraordinary. 

A group of us ordered some raw oysters-- $3-4/piece. Great & plenty of condiments to make it just how I like it. Fresh.

Shared the tuna tower appetizer-- which was just ok. I was not impressed because the majority of this dish was a cracker crumb bottom. Very little actual tuna proportion wise. 

Bone-in filet cooked medium rare. They got this right on! Delicious. Added a tiny bit of salt to some pieces but otherwise perfect! 

Creamed spinach & snap peas were awesome! Big enough portions for 5-6 people. Snap peas were cooked ever so slightly so that they still had a bit of the raw crunch to them. I liked that, but some people might not prefer it that way. Creamed spinach was what we called \"spinach dip\" because it was so fatty and delicious. 

The part that disappointed me the most was the dessert. Carrot cake was good but I wished they put more cream cheese in the icing. The icing was too sugary. Chocolate cake also lacked a rich chocolate flavor-- it was also a bit too sugary. Butter cake was delicious, but I've had better. 

Service- excellent. No complaints. Very attentive
Ambiance- very romantic. VERY dim lighting-- I personally prefer more light because I like to see my food to enjoy it even more, but this is great for a date."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years....we have had special food, service and atmosphere...our last experience was horrible! My husband made reservations for our favorite table....when we arrived they told us that we had to wait for them to set up a different table because they had a large party that came in and took ours. They sat us at a table that was right in the pathway of the guy bringing in the ice and a member of out party was getting bumped constantly from the other people at the bar. The waiter was not what we were accustomed to..service has always been excellent
They have my McCallan  15 which a major reason I come lol but I always ask for a chilled glass and they didn't have any. The special was supposed to be an extra marbled steak and it was full of gristle....I was disappointed. My husband says we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent as always!  Far superior food and service than any other steakhouse in Scottsdale!!  Kudos to Frances, Cody and Drew!  Thanks Lance and Beth Table 201"}
{"text":"What an amazing 50th birthday celebration my wife and I had!  Solomon was our waiter and we can't say enough about his service and integrity.  Best Ribeye we ever tasted!! The Lobster mashed potatoes were to die for. Thanks again for a fantastic night..."}
{"text":"Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's."}
{"text":"Mastro's Steakhouse is a great place if you like dark and noisy restaurants. Needed phone lights to read the menu. When asking our waiter to go light on the seasoning when we ordered, they acted like we didn't know what we were talking about. The steaks came out so seasoned and salty that you could not taste the steak flavors. Like other \"high-end\" steak houses, they flash grill the seasoning to form a thick, hard crust on the outside. For a much more enjoyable experience, buy steaks at Costco and grill them yourself at home with a nice bottle of Cab."}
{"text":"Outstanding eatery. I ate in the lounge which had a comfortable and lively feel to it. The service was excellent (and easy on the eyes). The food was delicious.  The only issue I had was my Kobe was cold when it was brought to the table. But that was quickly and appropriately remedied."}
{"text":"We live in North Scottsdale,  it is the closest steak house to us.  The steak and sides are average...don't care for the staff and management 's attitude.    Dominick's and Eddie V's are worth the drive for us - for both the food and service.  Especially Eddie V's bar and live entertainment."}
{"text":"Always phenomenal.  Steaks and seafood are great as are the sides.  Great selection of wine and service is alway exceptional. Just $$$$"}
{"text":"My husband & I have heard rave reviews about the Chicago location and so we thought we would check out the sister location here in Scottsdale.   The ambience is nice however I would definitely recommend staying out of the bar if you want to have conversation.   We enjoyed the music however, the piano bar singers were very talented.  Our waiter was extremely professional and very prompt and attentive.  We ordered the Earthquake cab (we had it before so we knew it was good).  My husband orderd the bone in Fillet which was cooked to perfection and amazing.  I ordred the petite fillet and was disappointed with the texture.  It was cooked perfectly to medium well but it was chewy.  I had my husband try it and  he agreed with me.  He quickly called the waiter over and we explained our issue.  He originally thought we were complaining about the doneness which was not the case and then when he realized it was the texture he was very apologetic and said it may just be a bad cut of meat.  He offered to pay for it himself if I wasn't satisfied after he brought the replacement.   While I waited for the replacement I indulged in the mashed potatoes that we had chosen as a side.  They were amazing and so I wasn't too upset that I had to wait for a new fillet.  Not too long later I was brought out a new steak with a group of staff to verify that it was suitable. (I was a little embarassed to have so many people watching me eat my steak).  In the end it was SUPERB and what I was expecting the first time.  After we finished our meal our lovely waiter brought us a complimentary dessert - the Butter Cake and it was trully amazing!  I had seen the rave reviews so I new that it was going to be good but OH MY :) 

One more thing...the day after our visit to Mastro's I received a phone call from the restaurant checking on our visit and making sure that we were satisfied and that we would come back.   This is the effort that this establishment goes through to provide an exceptional dining experience!  

In the end, I would definitely go back...in fact we already have a plan to bring some family in for dessert only so they can try the Butter Cake  - Yum!

If I didn't have the cut of meat issue I would have definitely gave them 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 10/5 stars. It is a wonderful restaurant to attend for a special occasion, as it is certainly on the pricey side. The final bill for 4 people came out to about $550 (including tip), but oh my goodness was it worth it! 

Drinks:
Elderflower martini - very refreshing! 
Cosmo - they do an awesome presentation with the cosmo by having dry ice in the martini glass so when they pour the actual drink in, it froths over the glass lid. 
Yacht 27 Sangria - also very refreshing, more on the carbonated side then typical sangrias. 
Skinny Diablo - very interesting blend of flavors, the jalapeños were very hot! 
BEX Riesling - a very good sweeter white to pair with dinner 
Trefethen Cab - very smooth and perfect to pair with a steak 
Malbec - A nice fruity blend. Remarked very smooth and good from someone who does not usually like Malbecs. 
Cade Sauvignon Blanc - very nice, not to dry, quite refreshing.

Appetizer:
Raw east coast oysters - I did not eat any of these, but everyone else at my table raved about them (and we are from the east coast) 
Shrimp - the shrimp cocktail was probably some of the best prawns I have ever ordered at a restaurant. They were HUGE. 
They also provide this horseradish, called atomic horseradish, and it certainly gives you a rush because of how spicy it is! 

Main course:
8oz Filet - to date I think this is the best steak I have ever had. It was cooked to perfection. They also offer a style of medium rare plus, for those of us who prefer it a little more done then medium rare, but not quite medium. 
Arctic char - this one was one of the features of the day, although I did not try it, my step dad said it was delicious and scarfed it all down. 
Porterhouse - this kind of steak provides both a New York strip and a filet. This steak was also ginormous but eaten entirely, and also won the award of best steak they had ever eaten. 

Side dishes: 
 Scalloped potatoes - these were really delightful, very cheesey, so if you do not like cheese I would stray away. 
Sautéed asparagus - perfectly cooked in a garlic butter sauce. 

I would also like to highlight the attentiveness and helpfulness of our waiter, Tobias. He had a suggestion for every course and tweaked it around food restrictions. He also was kind enough to bring me two samples of wine before actually picking the type I wanted to order. I would definitely ask for him again when I return."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place that I finally convinced the husband to take me here for our 37th wedding anniversary. I could easily give them a five star bit they failed on the background music department.  It was annoying!!!!
Lets forget the music issue and focus on the service which was superb!  There were 4-5 people catering to our needs and they were most attentive. Our server was knowledgeable & talked  me into trying  the bone in steak which was as tasty as he described. The filet was very tender, almost melting in my mouth and perfectly cooked. My husband had a couple glasses of wine which he truly thought was of superior quality.  And then their signature butter cake...  Hmmmmmmm. That's all I have to say about that!!!  Our server found out that it was our anniversary and comped the butter cake!  Now that is what  I call excellent customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"What started out as a problem turned into a lovely evening. There was a problem with our reservation that the hostess could not have cared less about. She looked bored and disinterested. Luckily, one of the managers, Garrett, intervened and helped sort it out. He quickly made up for the hostess behavior by resolving the issue and making us feel welcome. This was our first time dining here and could have just as easily been the last. But thanks to great service (and phenomenal food), I will be back"}
{"text":"I have dined that Mastro's at well over 100 times. And no that's not a misprint well over 100 times.  High praise .  North Scottsdale has its fair share of luxury restaurants. This one's the best. Not only does it have terrific food but it has the best staff. Monica and Cecilia are terrfic."}
{"text":"We have always gone to Mastro's  for special and not so special days. 
Alway enjoyed our dining experience. 
We were there for my Wife's 60th birthday on April 26th. 
As usual the food was great. What was not was the service. 
I brought a party of 12 people. So needless to say it was an expensive evening. In the past we would have 2 sometimes three servers attending to our needs. This time barely one. It really made for an unpleasant evening. 
Masto's if you are trying to cut staff to save $$$. It will kill your reputation."}
{"text":"I really like to think that dining at Mastro's is like dining in heaven. I'm lucky enough to be in a family that comes here for special occasions. We just got back from one such occasion. It was glorious.

I'll start with the food. The quality of ingredients is fantastic. Everything is amazingly well prepared. The seafood is always fresh, served in large bowls of ice or gigantic dry-ice laden towers. The salads are, well, salads... But again they're fresh and well executed. Good if you're into that sort of thing. 

Then there's the stars of the show, the entrees and sides. In SAT analogy terms, Best Actor : entree :: Best Supporting Actor : sides. You arguably need both to have a cohesive meal (or movie for that matter). And Mastro's is like Steven Spielberg. Whether you choose a steak, chop, or fish, it'll be cooked to perfection. Steaks come out on the famous 400 degree plates. The lamb chops come portioned in 2 large four chop racks. The chicken is an enormous double breast and could easily serve two (for the kids?). There's a limited fish selection but they generally have 6-8 lbs lobsters and the crab legs are pretty crazy.

There is, however, an extremely large selection of sides. I have had quite a few of them. They're all good. I do prefer sautéed greens (broccoli, asparagus) over steamed. They use garlic. It's wonderful. Also, you wouldn't expect it, but try the the creamed corn, it's delicious.

And oh Holy Jesus I almost forgot to mention the desserts. The warm butter cake is their signature dessert and is quite good. But try the chocolate pudding cake. That little gem is my fav. And really, just order something to put their homemade whipped cream on. It's amazing.

So... yeah, it's expensive, but you get an experience that's phenomenal. Do you need a black napkin because, God forbid, you don't want white lint on your black pants? They'll handle it. Need someone to hand you a towel and turn on the faucet for you in the bathroom? There's a guy for that.

There are a few other steakhouses in Phoenix but they just don't compete. Ruth's Chris may have been cool 20 years ago, but it's kinda run down now. And Morton's food just isn't as good (although they do have soufflés... I'm a sucker for soufflés).

To paraphrase one of my heroes, if you have the means, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I wish I could be giving a better review... We waited at least 10 minutes to be greeted at our table and once we got our drinks it took almost 30 minutes to have our order be taken. I wish I was exaggerating but my boyfriend and I were ready to get up and leave. The food itself was phenomenal and that I would rate as five stars. However, the service didn't improve as the night went on. The support staff was very attentive to my boyfriends drink and making sure or table was cleared quickly. However, our server most of the night was nowhere to be found. Once we had gotten everything boxed up, it took another 20 minutes just to receive the bill. Sadly, I was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a truly incredible experience.  It's not often I refer to having a meal at a restaurant as an \"experience\" - but this truly was.  Beautifully appointed, excellent service, everyone  - and I mean everyone - was so friendly and accommodating - and not once did it feel like it was because they were just \"doing their job\".  It felt like they were truly enjoying serving my partner and I as we celebrated our anniversary.  

I had the double cut pork chops.  Cooked perfectly and a most incredible flavor.  The side dishes were great - we enjoyed the scalloped potatoes and the green beans. 

Simply a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I have been to Mastro's before, but had one of my BEST dining experiences EVER last night!  Estery was out server and she was amazing!  Food is amazing, as always and it was great to have a server who was as informed as she was.  And plenty of food lest over to enjoy it all again today"}
{"text":"I went to Mastro's last week for the new Sunday Brunch, very good selection on the food. Excellent Service, you can also order their Lobster Bisque and Omelet, Belgium Waffle and the famous butter cake from the kitchen at the brunch!Very good and attentive service, nice ambiance.  It was an awesome dinning experience! I will defiantly come back again!"}
{"text":"Grew up here, lived (steaked) all over. Most recently moved from Chicago, the city of steakhouses.

I will say, without a doubt, Mastro's is my hands down favorite. Get me a ribeye, creamed spinach, and some butter cake and I will die a happy man.

If you're looking for a traditional steakhouse this is the place. You will be hard pressed to find anything better.

Can't wait to go back (just gotta save up!)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for\" exceptional service, food, atmosphere. Delicious food and the service is always amazing! Mastros never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Ate at the bar with live music. The band was awesome and the open seating in the bar area is a cool vibe. Great drinks and big pours! Love it!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that we knew prior to going here that the prices were extremely high so we knew what we were getting into .  We read the reviews before we went so we knew we had to get the butter cake for desert and the lobster mashed for an appetizer.   We had never been there before so we had high hopes after reading the reviews..  However, we were SO EXTREMELY disappointed.  We have been to some very high-end restaurants and, after going there; we have no idea how they are pulling off such good reviews.  

So, both my husband and I ordered the specials that were not on the menu.  I ordered a special kind of salmon that was $46.00.  My husband got the Tomahawk steak.  When my husband ordered the steak the waiter came back out and whispered in his ear the cost of the steak to make sure he really wanted it.  It was a ...drum roll please......a whopping $110.00.  He was going to change his order but after the waiter said how wonderful it was and we were celebrating his birthday we said \"what the %&$#\" and ordered it anyways.  We got the lobsters mashed, which are raved about, online.  This is a SIDE item and it costs $34.00.  We also got onion strings and Brussels sprouts.  So, already we have spent $56.00 in just side items.  We also ordered the French onion soup and a Cesar salad.  Now the reviews on the food

The French onion soup was amazing.  It was by far the best item we ordered.  I highly recommend getting this.  

The Caesar salad was awful.  I am a huge Caesar fan and this was one of the worst dressings I have had.  It tasted like it was mayo based.  It was gross.  The best Caesar in the valley, is hands down, Houston's.  

Salmon was plain and was just okay.  It was not $46.00 good and needed to have sauce or something.  All their fish and meat come without anything done to them.  It is just a plain piece of meat on a plate.  I get that it is a \"high quality\" piece of meat but show some culinary skills and make it a great dish.  For example, I would say hands down the best salmon dish in Arizona is at Elements.  It is out of this world!  I could not finish this salmon.  I ended up taking it home and doctoring it up myself and it tasted fishy the second day.  

The Tomahawk steak....for $110.00 it should be the most amazing piece of meat you ever put in your mouth.  My husband said it was just okay.  He said he would never order it again and if he could do it over he would not have ordered it at all.  My husband has a thing for getting things that you cannot normally get.  So, if the waiter tells him it is a special hard to find item then that is what he will get.  However, this time it was not worth the cost.  

The lobster mashed were way over hyped.  They were garlic-mashed potatoes with lobster on top.  Whoopie!  They were not worth the price tag and not that good to boot.  

The onion strings were mediocre.

The Brussels sprouts were great.  I never thought I would like Brussels sprouts but the waiter said they were wonderful and we would have to agree.  

Now, for the raved about butter cake.  We have heard about this cake from so many people and the reviews said it was the best desert ever.  So, I think it was way to far on that pedestal and could never live up to the hype.  There is no one out there that loves desert more than me but this was so average I can't even tell you.  It reminded us of a cake version of a bazookie but not as good.   It is just a very sugary piece of cake with ice cream on top.  However, they serve it with a huge side of whipped cream...now that should be the desert.  The whipped cream was delicious!  We actually did not even finish the cake but we took home the whipped cream.  

Anyways, the total bill was $328.00 (with tip).  This is officially the most expensive restaurant we have even been to.  Unfortunately, it was definitely not the best.  We both agree we will never return to a Mastro's and not because of the price but because the food was just not good or worth the price tag.  

Seriously, if you want a awesome meal that is still high class go to Houston's.  Houston's is still my ultimate favorite restaurant.  The menu at Mastro's is clearly hit and miss but at Houston's you know with certainty that no matter what you order it will be awesome!  They have a small menu but so everything perfectly.  Sorry, I am digressing.  

Bottom line...I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend and we will never return."}
{"text":"I have had a great relationship with Mastro's and sent them many many customers as a concierge.  When people looked for fancy and/or great steakhouse I would send them over and they always loved it.  I personally like the place and I'm reviewing and rating based off of one main key thin - the steak that I ordered. (But I will touch up on other parts about my visit)

So the steak was good but it just was not great for me which anyone would expect paying such a high price.  I got the rib-eye and it was a bit too dry for a rib-eye and it did not have the flavor I was hoping for.  Most of the flavoring seemed to come from them buttering it up so much rather than a rich grilled taste I was hoping for. So with that said I personally would simply rather go to Texas RoadHouse for their bone in Rib-Eye for half the cost for the taste that I enjoy.  

The sides.  Mashed potatoes and asparagus for me.  The asparagus was very buttered up too and not cooked enough to my liking but I can't really blame them because I liked my asparagus burnt and I did not specify cooking instructions.  The mashed potatoes was also very buttery like everything else my brother and I ordered.  I do like my mashed potatoes buttery and rich so I actually really liked it.  The side portions are pretty huge and can easily be shared.  

For dinner we were offered their famous popular butter cake.  This thing was huge and just too much for the two of us but guess what...we ended up finishing the whole thing.  It was delicious and probably addicting is the best way to describe it.  

Few other things worth mentioning besides food before I opted out.  There is valet service and the service is good.  The interior is fancy as one would expect and it is more on the quite and dark ambiance.  The middle sections closer to the bar in a bit more bright and lively feeling.

All in all, this restaurant is a great treat for a special night with friends and family and they are very good at accommodating special needs (sent over many many wealthy and high profile guest)  I'm just mainly disappointed with my steak option and perhaps maybe in the future I need to try different options or re-try my rib-eye option. Until that day may come, I'm leaving this as a four star restaurant."}
{"text":"The Mastro's institution has been raising the bar in service and quality over the years.  Its pretty darn hard to beat.  It qualifies with the best studs in the industry.  Our experience was superb.  Our group is still talking about it.  Know and order what you like and expect quality and service.  Hold their feet to the fire if there are any issues.  They always come through, from Newport Beach to  Costa Mesa  and Scottsdale the consistency is spot on!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Impeccable service, wonderful meal! My absolute favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and always have a good experience. I am giving this review 4 stars based on the past and not this experience. This one wasn't bad ... maybe the previous ones just spoiled me. ? Anyway - dinner for 4, 2 birthdays. 

Service - Our Server was good, but not as attentive as I have had before. (Brent is the best btw, but he wasn't working that night) Let me be clear - the worst service here is better than you would get most anywhere else - so this is a total first world problem. My husband had to walk up to someone to ask for a steak knife for me and it took a long while to get a couple of sodas. Lastly, the bill. I know at Village Inn the bill is placed on my table the minute I start eating. At Mastros, I don't want to see it till I am done. Unless I mention that I am in a rush - I don't want to see the bill while I am actively still eating. Out bill was placed in the middle of our eating desert. Didn't like that at all.

Food - Excellent as always. The mushrooms were a little chewy in the Crab Stuffed Mushroom appetizer, but that was all I would say negatively about the food.

One thing I wish they would do is not make it so dark in this place. They provide flashlights so you can see the menu, but I want to see my food too! I couldn't see what was fat and what was meat on my steak, till it was in my mouth. That's just a personal preference I guess.

Still love this place, but mildly disappointed this time."}
{"text":"We were in AZ for our anniversary and decided to eat here at Mastro's.  We love the one in LA and Newport beach.  We love the seafood tower.  It is pricey, but so good and very cool with the dry ice.  LA is still our favorite Mastro's but this comes in a close 2nd."}
{"text":"Went to Mastro's to celebrate birthday with friends. We knew that this was a high end steak house, and for the over the top price of everything -  perfection was expected.  3 out 4 of us had really good meals, but the New York strip was not a quality piece of meat. Entrees, salads and dessert were all great. Most disappointing was the very slow service - once we had ordered it was like we became invisible. The dining experience was 3 1/2 hours long on a very busy evening. Finally, while the special event was mentioned by our waiter at the outset of the evening, there was no celebratory drink or dessert offered by the restaurant. For a bill of $500+, we expected perfection on all fronts."}
{"text":"Culinary bliss.  It's been a couple of years since I was last there so time might have embellished my experience to epic levels.  I've done a lot of steakhouses in the Valley (Ruth's, Donovan's, Durrant's, Flemings, etc...) but the Filet I had at Mastro's was in a completely different league.  It was like all of those other restaurants were toiling away in the minors compared to the major league taste that I experienced at Mastro's.  The steak literally melted in my mouth....literally!

The price is up there it is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for the true red-blooded soul who wants to experience what steak should taste like."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Mastro's general manager, Phil, called me today to reach out and thank me for my honest review, particularly regarding the surcharge put on my bill.  He told me that they have now ceased adding the surcharge to their customer's bills, which is the right thing to do.  

The food is good.  My steak was better 10 years ago, the last time I ate here, but it was still good.  And still outrageously expensive.  But you know it's ridiculously expensive before you come.  The low rating is not because it's expensive.   It's because Mastro's tacked on a \"surcharge\" that I didn't notice had been added until I got home.  This surcharge is ostensibly to cover their increased costs due to the increase in minimum wage.  So instead of raising their food prices, which are already mind-numbingly high, they throw in a surcharge that they don't tell you about.  Not cool.  Maybe their regular customers don't mind."}
{"text":"Great place for a relaxing night out.  It's a little more pricey than the average place, but worth it in my opinion.  The service was impeccable and the food was just as good.  They take time to treat you well and you feel valued."}
{"text":"Excellent steak. Poor service due to waiter flirting with hostess and not attentive to table. Had to ask for water even. Asparagus dry and tough. Bathroom attendant is so early 90s nightclub. Seriously?"}
{"text":"\"You're not allowed to have more than 3 martinis.\"  

That was our rule for the bachelor, which we reminded him repeatedly during the 2 hours we were at Mastro's.  We were in Phoenix for his bachelor party and didn't want to relive his last Mastro's experience in Beverly Hills which consisted of four martinis, little memory of the evening, and an $80 cab drive back from Beverly Hills to Pasadena.  

This Mastro's is, like the ones in BH and Costa Mesa, dark, swanky, modern and upscale.  But, there's something a little different.  The Costa Mesa one is a little too hip for its own good, but the decor here fits the clientele.  It's Scottsdale for Pete's sake - it's not THAT hip.

The martinis are HUGE.  They'll fill your glass to the rim and give you the shaker which has almost enough for another full martini.

The steak I had here (bone-in ribe eye) was much better than the one I had (bone-in NY strip) at Costa Mesa.  It came a little underdone - I asked for rare-medium rare - but that's much better than even a hint overdone.  Still, it had good flavor, was well marbled, and came with a nice crust.  

The sides are nothing home to write about.  Don't get conned by the lobster mashed potatoes.  It's a gooey mess of potatoes with overcooked pieces of lobster.  The other sides are fine.  

We had 3 bottles of the 2004 Chateau Montelena Cabernet  (Napa Valley).  The mark-up was about 100% of retail, but the wine was good.  Rich and vibrant, solid fruit and nice acidity.  

Most of the us (there were 10) were very happy with the food and the service was very good.  

If I could give 1/2 stars, I'd give it 3 1/2."}
{"text":"SO the other day I was having a crazy salad craving and couldn't figure out where to go to make it happen.  I remembered being a fan of the Mambo Salad (Wasabi caesar) and since Mastro's is both in my neighborhood and has been one of my favorite restaurants for the past 9 years, I called ahead and ordered one to go plus grilled shrimp.

Arriving at the restaurant, I really wished I had time to dine with the and enjoy a full meal but i'd had a long day and really just wanted the salad and my couch.  As always, all staff members I came into contact with were friendly, neatly attired and welcoming.

My mouth watered all the way home at the prospect of tearing into the cold, crisp green, plump grilled shrimp and the hint of sharp heat from the wasabi caeser dressing but when I opened the container, what I saw shocked and saddened (yes, saddened...I AM a foodie after-all) me.  In the box were the usual mixed greens and container of dressing (key that it wasn't already tossed with the greens ensuring their crispness) and perched proudly atop said greens was one SINGLE grilled shrimp....I couldn't believe it.... At ($11 for salad greens and $7 for the addition of shrimp there should have been at least a COUPLE).  

I dug around in my greens looking for my shrimp's buddies but alas, it was truly alone.  I didn't know what to do. I ended up calling the restaurant to ask (which I had not initially) what adding grilled shrimp to my salad consisted of and was told by the manager on duty that there should have been a whole or half shrimp as well as chopped throughout the salad and that he would reverse the charge and I should ask for him when next I dined with them.  

Prior to calling the restaurant, I did what everyone does, I posted a picture on Facebook: http://tinyurl.com/cn73btc 

Anyway, I ate my salad and savored that shrimp (Actually quite a large shrimp, looked to be a U10 and it was actually QUITE tasty).  Nothing more would have come of it had I not received a call the following day form the General Manager who'd been informed of what had happened by his shift manager and wasn't about to let things end there.

Mark N. Let me know in no uncertain terms that my experience wasn't what he expected of Mastro's restaurants nor up to his standards.  He explained what he though had gone wrong and what he intended to do to prevent it happening in the future.  He reiterated that the charge would be reversed and that he wanted to send me a $100 gift card for the trouble.  I told him i'd been dining in various Mastro's restaurants for 9+ years and had never had anything but great food and service and that the gift card wasn't necessary but he insisted.  

Bottom line here is this is what customer service should be.  Mastro's and their General Manager are leading from the top down and setting an example to their employees that customers are not disposable.  Not only will I return to redeem the gift card (while leaving a few extra of my hard earned dollars in the process) but I will continue to dine with and recommend them to anyone looking for a great meal and superior service.  
My Facebook post regarding my conversation with Mark resulted in 30 \"likes\" and 13 additional comments, I'd say this is a \"win\" far in excess of $100 for Mastro's.  If you haven't been, GET.IN.YOUR.CAR! (and whatever you do, don't miss the warm butter cake of dessert)"}
{"text":"Best steaks around!!! Always sit in the bar area never had one complaint in almost 10 years. Entertainment and good times always."}
{"text":"We were initially seated in the back room and hated it-table for two jammed against the wall/curtain, but our waiter Guiseppe offered to move us to the bar area (also a table for two) and it was a totally different and much better experience.  Our new waiter Seth was very attentive and took great care of us. 

The breakdown is - over priced wine, great starter soups (huge!). Great steaks. Terrible overcooked asparagus and the twice baked potato was a huge \"cheese whizzy\" disappointment. The live music was very good, and the dessert was AMAZING (warm butter cake). 

We will be back (hold the vegetables)."}
{"text":"Sorry, not what it used to be. . .
Mastro's used to be in out regular rotation for favorite places, this last visit ended that.  

First in general, if you have kids that can't shut up and stay in their seat, get a baby sitter and leave them at home.  All you are doing is p@##@*g off the other customers.  Well behaved children are always appreciated and usually thanked.

Now to the meal, crab cake appetizer, tasted like fish not crab.  Yecch.
Bone-in Ribeye, tough and gristly, obviously bad cut and not premium quality.
Wife's fish, over cooked

Go down the road and find another place. . ."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Mastro's! This is hands down my favorite steakhouse in Phoenix and one of the restauranst I pick for a special occasion. Mastro's is the triple threat with excellent service, ambiance and food. 

Be warned that reading this might put you into a food coma. The food here is delectable and delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu but just be warned that it's very easy to fill up on the pretzel bread and salads before your entree event comes out! My favorite salad is the Mastro's House Salad and Wedge Salad. Both are tasty and both are very filling so be prepared that you might be stuffed! As for entrees, of course the steak is the best way to go but only if you are ok with getting it cooked medium well or less. It practically melts in you mouth! Other musts on this menu are the Gorgonzola Mac N Cheese, Lobster Mashed Potatoes and Warm Buttery Cake. If you only come here and order the sides and dessert, you will leave a happy person!

Service here is always excellent and it's always a lively, yet romantic atmosphere. The bill will add up, so be prepared to pay for this experience but if you are looking for a dinner to celebrate a special occasion, make a reservation here!"}
{"text":"So my friends and I decided to try a new steakhouse that was closer to our house for our annual golf trip to Scottsdale Arizona. It's always on a Sunday night around 5 or 5:30. 

For the last 2 or 3 years we started a tradition where weed utilize a private room. We get privacy we're able to talk as much as we want and usually there's a TV in it so we can watch college football considering it's Labor Day weekend and the season just started.

The service was wonderful. The guys who took care of us did a great job. Because of the amount of people we had we were able to create a menu it was $115 per person. Off of that mean you I got the 18 Oz New York strip steak along with the various assortment of sides and appetizers and desserts.

I asked for my steak to be cooked medium rare. This steak did make my top five of all time. Perfect crust and perfectly cooked. It was delicious. We all had creamed corn,  asparagus, grilled brussel sprouts, macaroni and cheese. The butter cake with vanilla ice cream at the end made the night perfect. If you are ever in this area please go check them out. I'll also say the two-way mirror was a nice touch. Watching the ships prepare the food and being able to see the various things they offer made you want to come back for more."}
{"text":"We just popped in for appetizers and martini's

This is very close to us and a friend recommended we try it - I am glad he did.  We didn't sample much of the food, but the French Onion soup was amazing.  Not crazy about the crab stuffed mushrooms. 

The Martini's were among the best we have ever had.  As well, they kept refreshing them with an ice chilled glass.

The staff were all most attentive and friendly (especially Iris).  Even the GM Philip Giangrasso came over to say hello.  Would definitely go back, and even bring a group."}
{"text":"The finest steakhouse I can ever ask for.   

Everything they do, from linens, to pork loins in perfection. 

I've had the pleasure of visiting this establishment a few years back in LA and that location didn't disappoint either, however the Arizona location has an ambience that LA did not. 

The steaks are just perfect. Nothing more to say or add. 

The seafood is succulent. For example the seafood tower you can't go wrong with. The shrimp appetizer is so tasty it will leave you thinking about it for days on end. 

The sides. Oh my the sides!

Lobster mash, creamed corn, sautéed spinach, grilled asparagus and many more.
I'm now starving!"}
{"text":"It SUCKS...

That I can't eat here at least 3 days a week.  I would gain too much weight and probably have a heart attack.  

 And the drinks were awsome.  Expensive, sure, but they didn't skimp.

I had the bone in ribeye.  Wow.  

The warm butter cake.  YUM.

I will be back. again. and again..."}
{"text":"I'm saddened to write this review. We had reservations here for Mother's Day brunch but had to cancel because the chef wasn't willing to make my daughter who has a brain cancer diagnosis one a la carte dish. The brunch is a buffet and she has been strictly advised by her doctors against buffets to ensure her safety. My daughter is immune compromised from chemo and clearly a small dish of French fries was too much to ask. I hope that in the future this business shows more compassion towards their loyal patrons. Luckily the Westin which is also serving buffet style has graciously agreed to accommodate our family."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened.  It has been sold and is slowing going down hill.  Prices are WAY to steep now.  This takes away from them good food and service.  Chef REALLY needs to pay attention to steak temperature.  WHen someone orders Med. well,  don't cook it rare thinking that when they send it back you can cook it some more.  Very Irritating!!  How this gets better.  Prestons is right across the street and it is GREAT.  Best happy hour in town over there."}
{"text":"Good, but they need to update bathrooms. 
The food was as expected from every other review on here. Steaks were good and so were sides, sea bass was really buttery but still alright. But. The problem comes around when my brother went to the restroom and came back with lollipops but when i went to the women's room. no. lollipops."}
{"text":"Best steak ever!  Daughter took me there for my birthday dinner. Wonderful classy atmosphere, great martinis. Waiter was perfect. Chop salad, lobster bisque were fabulous. Steaks cooked to perfection. Did I mention how great the tenderloin steaks were? Ha!  Garlic potatoes and almond green beans completed the main course. Butter cake is a must have....and one more martini!! If you haven't been here, you need go soon! It's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Its official...thee very best Prime Steak House in the West!  Our second visit and was it ever a masterpiece.

The bread they serve is just not fair!!  How do you conserve valuable stomach space when they tempt you with the very thing that most corrupts the valuable space you are trying to conserve?!?!?  The pretzel bread is remarkable.

Mastros signature salad is a perfect salad and you must give it a try.  The Mac-n-Cheese is simply the very best I have ever had....and the only way to improve on it would be with lobster!!

We had the Bone-in Rib-Eye and the Wagu Tomahawk Rib-Eye both were world class and both gave us virtually no chance of completing!  Hurray for left-overs.

Aurie was our server and he was just unbeatable!  The restaurant is a shrine to meat eaters and every aspect of this operation reeks of perfection.   This morning we paid homage to our last nights meal by quickly sauteing thin slices of the meat and serving it with the pan re-fried Mac-n-Cheese covered with a poached egg.......mmmmm gotta Love Mastro-Leftovers!"}
{"text":"BEST STEAK OF MY LIFE!

I'm actually not a steak girl.  I like fish, chicken and am even starting to experiment with tofu.  But at Mastros, even the most avid vegetarian is making a major SLIP by not trying the steak. 

 You walk in and are immersed in the beautiful aroma of delicious steak (I almost cannot believe I just typed that but it seriously was a great smell!).  We had a reservation and sat in a lovely dark room with really interesting decorations and lovely jazz music playing.  The dinner was a celebration of the beginning of my school year and the end of my boyfriends summer semester and I really do not think we could have had a better meal to celebrate.  

 I began with the most amazing cantaloupe martini on the face of the earth-so cool and ooh so refreshing.  We were then greeted with our bread basket full of a variety of lovely starches- pretzel rolls, olive bread, sour dough bread and crackers were all nicely arranged for our viewing and eating pleasure.  Believe me; it is hard to not get carried away! 

 We each started with salads.  I had half of a chopped salad and the bf had half of a Cesar.  We were both very pleased!  After the salads I had the salmon (SLIP SLIP) which was wonderful but nothing anywhere near as amazing as Brian's bone in fillet (recommended by the server over the fillet).  For our sides we shared steamed broccoli and creamed spinach.  I loved both although Brian claims that Morton's has better creamed spinach (but not better steaks).  Between the two of us we had plenty of food and I even took half of my delicious salmon home-leaving no room for dessert.  

 The service was the best I have had.  The valets even gave us bottled water for our drive home.  

 If you want to reward yourself or others with an amazing meal and all around perfect dining experience, this is your place!  Where it lacks a view (like Elements) it makes up for in premium service and food!"}
{"text":"Steak was great but I find the place too noisy. Very difficult to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Run by the same folks who operate the Ocean Club, all I can say is Wow!!!!  By far, the best overall dining experience I've had in Phoenix.  The service was exceptional; the ambience reminded me of how you used to see people dining back in the 50's and 60's in the movies at a swank restaurant.  

The escargot were wonderful, the shrimp perfect, the french onion soup was one of the five best I've ever had anywhere.  And that brings us to the entrees and sides.  My mouth is watering just remembering the meal.  The steak I had (porterhouse) was done to perfection, the sauteed mushrooms were flawless, and then (and I'm not a mashed potatos person) we had the most amazing mashed potatos I've ever had... called lobster mashed potatoes, they were a side which was more expensive than several of the entrees, but I will have them every time I go back, and I intend to go back quite often.  

Make reservations, this place is always packed.

There is a seperate more casual area with live piano music which we sat in briefly after dinner, but will definitely go back to."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of taking my kids here.... they are ruined. Any other steak just will not do.  I've eaten at steakhouses all over the country and this is the best steak I've ever had.  The seafood tower is crazy and the desserts are to die for. Bring your gold card but it is sooooo worth it"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here. Much heralded by reviewers and by my two dining companions, my expectations were high. I am glad to report that the food was superb and maybe even exceeded my expectations. So 5 stars for food.
However, in my book, dining experience is much more than just the food. Taking care of the guests through impeccable service and not making them feel that they are in some way less important than the \"regulars\" is an art that is not practiced well at this restaurant.
We arrived  at 7:20 pm for an 8 pm reservation. We had no expectation that we would be seated earlier than our time. We ambled up to the bar and ordered beverages. Great atmosphere, great conversation. From the time that we sat down at the bar to a few minutes after 8 pm, a table for 4 had been empty (there were 3 in our party). I asked the maitre d' why we could not be seated at that table. I was told that there were 3 tables that were about to be vacated and that very shortly we would be seated. Another 15 minutes to by and I went to see my friend Drew (the maitre d') and asked what was going on. He let me know that the table for four that had been empty for over an hour now was reserved for people who come to the restaurant every week and always want that table. This was much too much for me. Holding a table for an hour while people with reservations are kept waiting, must be a very Scottsdale type of crap. I travel all the time all over the world and get the opportunity to eat at holes in the wall as well as at Michelin star uppity places but have never been given this type of BS. So zero stars for front of the house!
By my math the average of 5 stars and 0 stars is 2.5 stars.
BTW this group of 3 diners dropped over $460. Not a bad showing for being treated like second class citizens."}
{"text":"Some of the best steaks around and always consistent which sounds much easier than it really is. If you want excellent service and an even better cut of beef, you must get here!"}
{"text":"Made reservations, table location was awful.  Service good. Steak was returned to be cook properly, overpriced
Won't go back"}
{"text":"my sons 21 birthday...16 of us...we were treated like royalty..  The food was off the chart amazing..gotta save room for the warm Butter Cake...but first have the tuna for your appetizer and then the house salad, and there is not one cut of beef that you can go wrong with...lobster mashed potatoes....that you for making the evening unforgettable"}
{"text":"I have been going to Mastro's literally since the day it opened. For the most part I can say that for well over a decade I did not have a bad meal. It was the go to place for the best steak. 

The staff was always uber professional and accommodating. Five star all the way. Unfortunately since they were acquired (by Landrys) everything I just stated has gone right into the toilet. The waiter that served us treated my wife like we were at a Denny's at midnight. We were a party of eight and he forgot to take her order. But to make matters worse when he came back to the table and she mentioned that he had forgotten to take her order, he said \"hold on a minute while I put these appetizers in\". Then there is the food. As I said, it used to be that they had hands-down the best steak you could get anywhere at any price. Now I could do just as well at any mid level chain restaurant. Clearly the new corporate culture is to cut costs and save money no matter what. But they're missing the big picture big time and this place sadly just sucks now...we will not go back. Interestingly our friends have told us the same thing about their recent experience there so we are not alone. Not surprisingly the best servers that have been there for years are all gone too. So sad, the end of an era."}
{"text":"Yuh remember my review of Hidden House & their $6 steaks?

Well, this ain't no six dollar steakhouse!

Mastro's food is excellent!  Their service is excellent!  The staff is very attentive without being intrusive.  

HOWEVER, (and this cost them a star) it is NOISY!  If you want to carry on a conversation over dinner, or you want a quiet romantic meal, DON'T go here.  It's a loud as some rock concerts.  If that's your thing, fine.  But, be forewarned."}
{"text":"Not worth the Experience.

Service 3 Stars

Food 5 Stars

Value 1 Star

I just ate a Mastro's Steakhouse with my Girlfriend.  I have eaten in many of America's Finest Steakhouses and after receiving the Bill I felt moved to write an honest review.  The Food as noted above was excellent.  The service was average with our waiter being attentive most of the evening but seemly loosing focus at times.  I was most disappointed in the value as a number of other reviewers have noted.  I understand this establishment is a premium Steak House so the charges reflect premium pricing.  I find it a bit ridiculous that they upcharge $13 for a baked potato which are often included in the price at other fine Steak Restaurants.  I find it even more ridiculous that they upcharge $15.00 PER PLATE for Truffle Butter they claim to import from Italy.  As a former business owner I understand the unique selling position.  Note: this Butter tastes no different from other Butter in my opinion.  My Lady and I both ordered the Filet Mignon, we both shared a Cesar Salad, I ordered a glass of the cheapest Merlot on the Menu while my lady ordered a lemon Zinger.  I later ordered a glass of the cheapest Mascot for an after dinner drink and the Creme Brûlée for Desert while my lady ordered a glass one of the least expensive Champagnes with Saint Germaine and the signature Butter Cake.  The Bill was $325. For the above out the door.  Good food but the price & way this establishment nickels and dimes you for the above it leaves a bad taste in your mouth at the end of the meal.  I would avoid this place and spend your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am certain that this review will be surprising to most who read it when viewing all other posts. My boyfriend and I decided to try Mastros for the first time last night, 2/4/15. We were happy with the ambience, the atmosphere, the greeting at the door. Unfortunately our time there was cut short when we found 2 molded pieces of bread served in our bread basket.  The unacceptable molded bread that was served to us made my stomach turn. We didnt notice it until we had already eaten a few other pieces of different bread that was in our basket. Fortunately we didnt get sick but I couldnt sit in that restaurant and enjoy what was supposed to be a 5 star meal. The manager was appropriate with his apologies but I wanted to share this experience, so other patrons are aware of what may be served at Mastros. At such an upscale dining establishment you would think they would monitor the items being taken out of the kitchen and brought to their customers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. I have the lobster bisque app, which was very good, with some of their pretzel bread which was also great. As an entree I had a 12oz filet, which was definitely one of the best steaks I've had in Phoenix! Every bite was better than the previous. Amazing! The only thing better than the steak was their signature butter cake dessert. OMG, amazing! If only my stomach was bigger, for more. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that while this kind of restaurant is pricey, as expected, the sides weren't anything to write home about. I had the twice baked potato, I tried the lobster mashed potatoes, and asparagus, and while all were ok, none were worth their premium price. But the apps, steak, and desert more than make me want to go back for round 2!"}
{"text":"The interior is nice - rich looking and decadent.   The food is expensive.  I don't mind paying for a great meal but this one had some highs and lows.

The seafood tower is definitely a high point.  It's very impressive with the smoke from the dry ice cascading over the tower.   

I had the rib eye which was surprisingly a little tough.  My husband had a bite and he definitely agreed with me - just not tender.   For sides we had the snap peas (ok) and lobster mashed potatoes (ok).  Dessert (large group) was a variety including butter cake, cheesecake, and key lime pie.   They were all good but none were memorable.   

A final comment - Mastros' has employees working in the bathrooms, handing out towels to dry your hands.  This is definitely something I do not like.   It's very uncomfortable having someone stand there while you wash your hands, waiting for you to finish so they can hand you something and maybe get a tip.   Ugh!"}
{"text":"We won't go back.
A group of 10, we went here for a business dinner. 
The waiter was so pushy, it was like dealing with a used car salesperson. 
Food was ok, gorgonzola Mac and Cheese sounded fantastic, but was the cheese was stringy, the sauce runny, and the pasta hard. 
Truffle gnocchi was oily, and you couldn't taste the truffles.
Roasted Brussels sprouts appeared to have been deep fried, but were good.
All the other sides were outstanding:
Lobster Mashed Potatoes, creamed corn, sautéed mushrooms, asparagus, even the spinach was good.
I had a prawn from the Indian Ocean that was the length of a small lobster tail, but sadly, it was over cooked and quite tough. 
Our waiter insisted we get the seafood tower, many of us said we didn't want any,  some said they would just try one shrimp...She told us to leave it up to her because we thought she was writing down what everyone said they would have. This pushy waiter surprised us with two very expensive 4 plate towers that went to waste! The presentation was quite a show stopper. Dry ice fog misting out beneath the seafood selections and ice was impressive and beautiful, and it is BIG.
Some of the crab claws and Dungeness crab were soggy, like they had been recently thawed out. 
When it was time to order desert, again, our pushy waiter placed plates in front of all of us, even those of us who said we didn't want to order any. Which I found obnoxious. We had guests who were trying to follow medical dietary guidelines, which is hard enough without someone putting it in front of you when you've already said no!
The butter cake is fantastic, one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.
It's big though, probably 7 inches across..four people could quarter one and still have a cupcake sized portion and a scoop of ice cream, but of course our waiter didn't share that with us, even though we asked, she showed us a portion size smaller than was actually the case, so that we would order more. 
There are nice restaurants out there that treat their patrons better."}
{"text":"Be prepared to surrender the keys to your Tesla if you forgot your credit card. Had occasion to visit Masro's this past week. Why anyone would spend $200 for two people for food that is only average, is beyond me. Hubby had the 7 oz filet and I had the 16 oz pepper steak. Both were good, not great but good. For sides we had au gratin potatoes and onion rings. The portion size (for $13 each) was not as large as I expected.  The drinks were so overpriced. The atmosphere was clubby. The décor, of course, was a definite plus. I loved the etched entrance door and the chulily lighting was outstanding. The service was attentive. That being said, I have had steaks that were as good, if not better, at Flemings (just down the road) for a lot less money. We won't be back. It just isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mastro's for years with my family and friends. I would like to thank Tom my server and friend as well as the other staff for always receiving the presidential treatment. Not to mention you can't get a better steak anywhere!"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND

I'm a HUGE fan of the \"DINNING EXPERIENCE\" and Mastro's delivered!

THE STORY

I had a business colleague in town who wanted a mix between fancy and fun, that would be guaranteed to be excellent. We decided Mastro's would fit those requirements.

Upon arriving, there was a gentleman who assisted me out of the car and into the restaurant, which I greatly appreciate. 

The entrance is impressive and sets the stage for a lovely evening.

There is a gorgeous bar area and inviting dining room section. We were seated at a lovely table overlooking the North Scottsdale desert, where we could watch the beautiful sunset.

We started with Mastro's Lemon Drop Martini's. They are served with dry ice, that gives a theatrical vibe to the drink, which is SUPER FUN! Not to mention DELICIOUS!

One of our appetizers was the daily catch fresh oysters on the half shell, served with all of the accoutrements. SUPERB!

I had the fresh lobster entrée which was a complete home run.

The wine list was impressive, of which we partook, and finished the evening at the bar, listening to live music.

SERVICE EXPERIENCE

The service was excellent, albeit a tad too obtrusive and too quick to want to remove everything. We had to tell the waiter a couple times to simmer down. But too much attention is not a horrible problem to have :)

CONCLUSION

You know the saying, \"You get what you pay for?\" Well in this case, that saying is 100% accurate. Nothing but FIRST CLASS all the way!!

I can't wait to go back!!

{"text":"It's about the \"Up Sell!!!\"  

We have been coming to Mastro's for years and years, so of course, Mastro's was The Choice the other evening, for my Birthday!!

Unfortunately, in my opinion, the waiter spent the majority of the evening trying to Up Sell us on this, and that.  We know what we want!  We know what we like, so please, leave us in peace!  It was so transparent hearing, \"The Chef insists I tell you about 'this and that.'\"  Of course, it wasn't for anything moderately priced, it was always for higher priced items, all in an effort to \"UP\" the percentage of his tip!  Extremely Fake!! I've had numerous Sea Food Towers, but that wasn't on my list for the evening!!  I had my heart set on a Filet!!

Perhaps the icing on the cake, so to speak, was when we got the bill!!  Our waiter went on and on about the \"butter he recommends on a filet,\" so of course, we let him choose.  After all, he should know right?  Well, when the bill came we had a $30.00 charge for two (basically pats) of Truffle butter.  Hilarious!  We said nothing, but I am still pissed!!  If you are going to charge $15.00 per pat of butter, I suggest letting your guests know!!  It doesn't matter how wealthy the staff thinks we are, this is utterly ridiculous!!  Again, I was pissed, and still am!!  

My husband didn't want to bother talking to the Manager, so YELP is the Only Way I can vent at this point!!

So Buyers Beware, Caveat Emptor!!  

The Next time we will be heading back over to Donovan's or Mortons!  Don't play me like a Fool!!"}
{"text":"I don't quite get it. Am I naive, not part of the \"in\" crowd or not tipping the right people? Our experience at Masto's started off a little rocky, but wound up being okay. 

We arrived 15 minutes early for our 6:00 PM reservation Sunday evening, no problem because the place is dead, right? Not so fast! We get taken to the worst table in the farthest corner of the restaurant while passing by 80% of the tables that are empty. Luckily we noticed right away the table would be a good fit for 12 people not a party of two which we were. They graciously reseated us at a small table for two which was much better.

Now, after that you may think, why'd this guy give them four stars. Well they redeemed themselves a little later. My partner ordered an ice tea which they were temporarily out of. How does that happen by the way? Out of Ice Tea? But I digress, they wound up bringing him a complimentary Ice Tea once they had brewed a new batch.

I guess you probably want to know about the food. I started with the Beefsteak Tomato and Onion appetizer which was excellent, my partner loved his loved his French Onion Soup. We both had the Bone-In Kansas City Strip his was a little undercooked and mine was just perfect. We shared the Au Gratin Potatoes and Creamed Spinach...both were excellent.

We'll give it another try sometime when we're in the mood for steak so hopefully we can have a Five-Star experience."}
{"text":"Top notch.  Great service..... Maybe too good.  I call it \"over service\".  What I mean is the waiter and support staff hover over you to a fault.  One sip from a water glass and a refill is coming.  Barely a bite is consumed before the manager with the ear piece is asking if \"everything is OK? \" I am willing to pay the outlandish drink and food prices for the quality and atmosphere....a few times a year but, I am always on edge and can't relax because I am being inundated with affirmation requests and offers for another drink when mine is still 1/2 full.  The amount of forks knives and plates used must make the dishwasher cry the sink full of tears.  NY strip is the best there is.  The amount of butter served and used in every item would make any cardiologist quiver.   Still always a great time.  Just be sure to hit the gym for a week after."}
{"text":"This is it: THE best restaurant I've ever been to. Service is impeccable. The steaks come out piping hot on 300 degree plates. The portion sizes are excellent.

It's pricy but worth every penny. 

I recommend the French Onion Soup, I get it every time!"}
{"text":"Mastro's was just ok. I had heard that this restaurant had the best seafood in town, but If his is true, I experienced it in heavy-handed sauces and with poor service. For the price, I would not recommend. We dined with a group with a total bill of about $1500, and I think that money would have been better spent at Steak 44.

I started with the lobster roll from the sushi menu. The sushi pieces fell apart and the sauce covering the entire plate like a soup was not appetizing. My husband's lobster bisque seemed to consist of cream soup with two chunks of over cooked lobster. 

My sea scallops were smothered in heavy sauce - this may be what was intended but the menu is so bare bones I had no idea in advance - and ultimately I felt like I had to force the food down. My husband's main course was also lackluster. Although the big eye tuna sashimi was cooked perfectly, it lacked flavor. 

Most disappointing was the service. Our waiter repeatedly reassured one of our dining partners that dishes could be modified for a food restriction and two times dishes were served with no modification. The woman pouring our water glasses kept referring to me as \"honey\" and this was not appreciated at this type of establishment. We also ordered two drinks that never arrived. 

The bright spot of the dinner were the desserts, which were generous in portion and delicious. 

Overall, a disappointing first visit to Mastro's."}
{"text":"This place is easily one of my favorite Steakhouses in Arizona.  They blow me away every time I visit.  I'm a creature of habit when I find a great Steakhouse, so I tend to order the same thing every time.  Here's what I order here:

Wedge Salad w/Blue Cheese Dressing & Crumbles
12 oz Bone-In Filet, $38
Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese, $12

The Wedge Salad is a big portion and I have to be careful every time I order it not to get full.  I usually split it with The Better Half.  I wish they had a 1/2 order available.

The Bone-in Filet is simply magnificent.  It's juicy and full of flavor.  The right amount of marbling and the bone gives this Steak unbelievable flavor....my mouth is watering as I'm typing this.

The Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese is a big portion for a side dish...plan to share or take home.  It's very creamy and rich....delicious.  It compliments the Filet well.

The servers here are top notch and always go the extra mile to ensure you have a good time.  If it wasn't so far from civilization (it's in Pinnacle Peak), we'd come here more often.

PS - this is not a cheap restaurant.  If you can't afford to spend the money, don't come here....you'll be disappointed.

{"text":"My wife and I are in Scottsdale on vacation and we wanted to have one dinner at an area steakhouse.  After much research we decided on Mastros. We were promptly seated and started with drinks. They have an extensive wine list by the bottle and 10 or so by the glass in each category (red, white, etc). I was torn between a couple of red wines so the waitress (we had a team of 3 serving us) offered to bring tasting samples of each. That was nice and allowed me to make a good wine choice (Beuhler estate cab). Warm bread was delivered immediately including parmesan crusting and pretzel bread. 

For appetizers we ordered a half dozen kumimoto oysters on the half shell and the seared scallops. The oysters were succulent and slightly sweet, presentation was on point. The scallops were presented in a garlic cream sauce that was rich but not too overpowering. 

My wife ordered the bone-in Kansas city strip medium rare. I ordered the bone-in ribeye (my favorite cut) also medium rare. The KC strip was savory and had a nice crust and was flavorful. The ribeye was over-the-top with intense flavor running through the entire cut. It just melted in your mouth. I preferred the ribeye over the KC strip but my wife still liked the strip. Whatever you order be sure to order BONE-IN, the flavor is more intense that boneless. 

We ordered an obligatory vegetable, the string beans. Tasty but hard to eat those when the ribeye is on your plate. 

We managed to save some room for desert. Like many other posts recommended we tried the warm butter cake topped with vanilla ice cream. The cake was moist with a sugar crust that was divine. The vanilla ice cream was super rich, you couldn't have too much of that but it was a good combo especially topped with homemade whipped cream :). I ordered the NY cheesecake (without the fruit, why mess with a classic?) with a dusting of cinnamon. The portion size was at least the size of 2 slices elsewhere so I brought half home for a snack the next day. 

In summary the service was impeccable, food was stellar (did I mention the bone-in???), setting was nice and we had live piano music in the background from the bar. It's not cheap, but definitely worth the trip for an over the top dinner."}
{"text":"Having a house nearby, we have been to this Mastro's several times and have enjoyed the food every time.  Being from Chicago, we know a good steak and they surpass any of the steakhouses in Chicago (Morton's, Gibson's, etc.).  We had the prime rib at Mastro's for the first time last week and my husband and I both agree that it was the best prime rib we have ever had anywhere!  We would give them 5 stars accept that the service can be inconsistent.  On a couple of occasions the servers and hostesses came off as rather arrogant (like they were doing us a favor by serving us).  This last trip we were given the option of being seated in the lounge right away or waiting 10 minutes for a table in the dining area.  We elected to sit in the lounge, but it seemed that they only had one person servicing the entire area.  It took a very long time for her to take our order.  However, the food totally made up for this.  Don't forget to have the butter cake!"}
{"text":"Dined with Mastro's this weekend. Don't think they hit their usual mark last night, but still a good meal.

Sat in the back dining area, not as fun as the bar or the front dining room. It's mainly for families or larger groups.

Wait staff seemed a bit off tonight, more so just our waiter. Seemed rushed or overwhelmed a bit. The support staff is always great and many faces we have seen for a while there.

They had a few items wrong on our order, didn't steam the asparagus and put butter on the brides steak and never caught it. First time our order has ever been wrong in years so not a big deal.

The waiter didn't come often enough to refill our wine glasses, not like them.

Still a good meal and aside from the waiter, it was as good as we remember."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse hands down.  I live in Denver now, and still have dreams about the Sea Bass.  It literally melts in your mouth.  They also serve the best steaks...they are like butter.  I have eaten here dozens of times, and always go when I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Always a great place for a special occasion, but we go because we get hungry for the amazing food that always impresses and satisfies.  Steaks and fish and all the sides are so delicious.  It's almost always pretty busy so you know they are a quality place.  It's relatively near us in North Scottsdale so we go there several times a year.  I have kids so don't visit the bar area, but that looks really nice too - for relaxing drinks and usually live music.  Great atmosphere and a little dressy - as much as you want it to be.  Of course the service is pretty much impeccable."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant. It is my absolute favorite steakhouse in Scottsdale, and favorite of all the Mastro's concepts. The food is always perfect, service beyond wonderful, and the atmosphere/ambiance perfect. The manager Eric is phenomenal and personable, and always on the floor to help the employees. HIGHLY recommend this location for your next special evening or date night. Order the filet, green beans, potatoes, and butter cake!"}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner at this Mastro's location. We had some confusion on our reservation time on a very busy Saturday, yet the Hostess was able to seat up cordially. We had a wonderful high top table by the piano bar. The singers they had played all the popular Top 40 songs; it was a blast! The seafood tower was amazing and our steaks were some of the best I've had. The hot plates they serve them on ensure a warm piece of meat. The crowd was very great for people watching; tons of older gentleman with young girls! I guess that's Scottsdale for ya."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Matros Steakhouse and would highly recommend. Great food, Great drinks and great service. My wife and I liked it so much we visited their seafood place the next night...same as above. we plan to vacation in Scottsdale again in about 6 months and will be back to Mastro's."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Mastro's!! The service is amazing and the food is delicious. I'm usually not a fan of high end franchise restaurants but this place really made me think twice."}
{"text":"I'll never go here again. The food was excellent. The service supreme, and the decor to die for. Who cares though.

$120 Stone Crab appetizer, because once they are out of season you  can't get them again! This fish plate is $30 because a diver coaxed it out of its home and invited it to be your meal...seriously.

If you enjoy masturbating while looking in the mirror and need to pay a ridiculous amount of money for stuff in order to: impress a client, mistress, or friends who hate you...this is the place to do that. There are plenty of places that also have fine food but do not have $17 Macaroni and Cheese.

The shear quality and tastiness of the food make it impossible to rate this place less than 3, otherwise its a bunch of douchebaggery.

Note: This is the first time I saw a note on a menu that told me that the restaurant was required by state law to inform you that eating raw, undercooked...etc foods could be bad. Most other places just inform you of that, Mastro's lets you know that they are only telling you that because they have to, the group that I went with were absolutely convinced that it was because no one would ever get sick from eating there.

I did not get sick from eating here (see my Filiberto's review for reference)"}
{"text":"Exceptional service...great food...love the atmosphere....seabass...chocolate covered strawberries...and Louis Xlll...what more can a girl ask for????"}
{"text":"Everything here is the best of the best. You can't go wrong. My favorite restaurant of all time.

The catch?
Price.

However, if you're in the mood for something delicious and amazing without a worry as to cost, go get yourself Mastros. Now."}
{"text":"Their Bone-In-Filet is AMAZING! It ruined every other steak that I have had in the past. The outside was crispy & salty while the center melted in your mouth like butter. The Lobster Mashed potatoes were creamy with huge chunks of lobster. Asparagus was cooked to perfection.

Finish dinner off with a Butter Cake. I often will skip desert from other places just to grab a cake to go.

When you go there, ask for your waiter to be Tobias. He was wonderful and did a wonderful job with A++ service."}
{"text":"We have had one top meal after another at this superstar restaurant. Our \"go to\" place in Scottsdale (we are from Philadelphia half of the year) for special occasions."}
{"text":"Okay, it was good.  Actually, it was kinda okay.  Actually, for the price, I've had a lot better. 
Service is a little overbearing and hard-sell on the up-sell.  

Wine list is well rounded and extensive, but they are really proud of it.  We have been in the area for about a month, and have been to 6-8 higher-end restaurants.  Definitely the highest multiples you will see, at least on the Captain's list.  

On the food -- which is why we went, of course, for the steak.  I had the rib, and my wife had the filet.  Neither was cooked spot on, and there was nothing exceptional about either.  They upsold my wife on the foie gras glop on top, and it made it so rich it was difficult to eat.  So, well . . . she didn't. 

If you are trying to impress someone with how much you are willing to spend on dinner and wine, and are okay with \"okay but overpriced\" food, then this is your place.  But for me, the value proposition just isn't there."}
{"text":"We had a group of five for a business dinner. We had reservations and had an excellent server. We ordered a bottle of wine, two appetizers, two salads, three sides to share, and dessert, in addition to our entrees. We ordered shrimp cocktail, escargot, Caesar salad, chopped salad, Bone-In-Filet, creamed spinach, scalloped potatoes, steamed asparagus, and Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake. Everything was exceptional and we all left happy! It was one of the best steaks I have had."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been better. Our waiter, Tobias, was genuine and helpful. Being in my mid 20s, I will admit I may not be the most profitable guest, but he even offered the half side of garlic mashed. The steak, served medium to my liking, was the best in the valley. Hands down. Inside was an older crowd and had a bit older feel, but the overall dining experience couldn't have been better. I have high expectations with Mastro's and they have never disappointed."}
{"text":"Mastros has always been a solid ***** and if/when they slip up (rarely) to maybe ****, its promptly corrected without question. Generally stick w the 22oz bone-in ribeye (med rare), mushrooms OMG the dam mushrooms (I'd be happy w the bread basket n mushrooms), green beans, one of the best wedge salads, shrimp cocktail, grilled salmon, lobster mac, crab gnocchi, seafood tower, lamb chops .. Tried quite a bit over the many years I've been going n so so good, my #1 spot when I feel like dropn a few Franklins for a tasty meal, great service and many heinekens."}
{"text":"This is my favorite special occasion restaurant. Yes, it is pricey, but the food and service are wonderful. The side dishes are ample enough to share. Our steaks are always cooked perfectly to our liking. When they have stone crab claws, they are the best I have had outside of Florida. The creamed corn is delicious. I prefer the dining room to the bar area, as the bar can get a little noisy. But if you like high energy and music, the bar can be fun. I like that they had a team of servers, as you always seem to be able to get assistance if needed.  I just wish we could go more often."}
{"text":"I went there to eat with my family and the food was perfect. Everything was great from waiters to food. The light were a little too dim. There was certainly nothing to complain about the food however the ratio to expense and quality was certainly unbalanced. I went there with my dad who owns his own restaurant and he told me they make a 2000% profit with the food they sell. Which is fine if you want to have a guarantee that you are going to eat awesome food and be ok with paying for it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this more stars! My son brought me here for my birthday and all I can say is, I. AM. LOVED. we started with Lemon drop martinis, then one with fresh pureed strawberries. A-mazing. Then we had a bread basket, very nice selection. I ordered a filet my son ordered the chefs steak; a slightly larger portion. Both were Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. My son added frois gras butter to his I tried a bit on my mine and it was fabulous. We also shared lobster mash potatoes and sautéed sugar snap peas. Very nice, fresh flavor. They brought a slice of cake with whipped cream for my b-day and I was blown away at the freshness, creaminess and silky flavor. MINDBLOWN! I'll be back for sure....right after I win the lottery...tee hee."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a better review. It's quite insulting when your party of four, which had reservations, is seated at a smaller than average table, while other regular sized tables remained empty for an hour, and even once someone was seated at those tables, they were parties of two. Waiters bumping into you and reach over you all night, cheesy gorgonzola mac & cheese string on your shoulder because when they served you there was no room between the tables. Not what one, or anyone for that matter, would expect for a 500.00 meal for 4."}
{"text":"Always good, top notch steakhouse food and service, the cream de la cream in the steak house world.  I like the creamed spinach, chop chop salad, prime rib, and to die for pound cake dessert!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best melt in your mouth filet ever! I was visiting my Aunt, cousin and her husband and on my last night there we dined at Mastro's. At first I was put off by the the ala carte menu....everything is purchased separately. So, I ordered a Caesar Salad, which was great, the 8oz filet, again, it was melt in your mouth DEVINE, and the grilled asparagus, that was good, too. UNFORTUNATELY, I was way too full for dessert. Next time I go, I'll remember to save room for the butter cake. All in all, it was FABULOUS, service and food was well worth the high prices!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of seafood options if you're not a steak eater..... and of course there was a wide selection of steak options up to 48oz.... My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary. When we were seated there was a Happy Anniversary card on the table for us... so sweet! Our waiter Kenny was on point. He was super professional and accommodating. I can't imagine being serviced by anyone but him. 

The food was awesome. I'm a light eater, so I ordered off the starter menu which allowed me to have more variety considering everything is a'l'carte. Great pick!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in the UNITED STATES!  There is nothing here that I don't LOVE!  My husband and I came to visit recently for my birthday. We had 10 people in our party and it was phenomenal!  I always get the filet and my husband gets the NY Strip.  I heard they cook their steaks in an oven that is way hotter than normal to really wear the outside and leave the juices inside the steak.  Whatever they do, it works.  You know that place below your ears in the corners of your jaw that starts tingling when you bit into that perfect juicy meat and the juice explodes and causes that seratonin release in your head?  That's mah jam right there!"}
{"text":"Top quality place. Great for special celebration or occasion."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant. The lobster mashed potatoes were extraordinary!!!! The service is over the top!!! The steak is perfect! Even the bathroom attendant is a sweetheart. I would go back in a heartbeat. Do be prepared to spend $ though as every item is a la carte, our bill for 4 was over $500. Don't miss out on the butter cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Had the bone in filet. Overpriced I think. Had better tasting regular filets at half the price. Presentation was good but as in most restaurants in this chain it was hard to see the food since the lighting is so low. Tried a bite of the \"Chilean\" Sea bass, it was as expected, it could have been a flounder."}
{"text":"Celebrated my last birthday of my 40's and also our good friends 10 year anniversary. CeCe and Monica made our experience on point... The food incredible, we started with the cheese plate and the bacon and scallop appetizers... So AMAZING. Of course we all had steaks and seafood... But more than the food, the service was impeccable... I have been to many fine dining establishments, but this location and staff are seriously the BEST."}
{"text":"We had drinks and appetizers here before moving on to dinner at another restaraunt when we were in Scottsdale on a corporate event planning trip. We had the seafood tower, and the presentation was outstanding and the seafood itself was excellent and I thought enough for all of us (we had six at the table). The drinks were also good, we each tried something different and there were no complaints. I can't speak to the steaks but saw some coming out for other patrons and they looked delicious. I would definitely return to try a steak, and you cannot go wrong with that seafood tower..."}
{"text":"Amazing.
Me and my fiancee's favorite restaurant.  Probably the only place I would spend 36 dollars for a side of mash potatoes. The drinks were amazing and strong and plentiful.  We had our drinks on top of the grand piano until our table was ready.  It was such a beautiful atmosphere / ambiance.

I had the filet and my fiance had the bone in ribeye.  (she wanted to give her spoiled dog the bone.)  My mouth is watering as I type this.  Both were cooked to perfection.  

Warm Butter Cake.  Get that for dessert.  Great with dessert wine if your inclined to imbibe more.

Mastro's nailed both things we love.  We've been to Mastro's Ocean Club several times and now the Steakhouse.  This one is my fave and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Mastros!  The way they cook their steaks and serve them on super hot plates is awesome. The sides are delish but the butter cake is ridiculously good. You really can't go wrong here. The steaks are top notch."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with some friends on Monday evening.  Mastro's was an absolute treat, put simply.  This place is a classic steakhouse in every sense of the word.  The service (Mark was our waiter) was excellent and attentive. The atmosphere was comfortable and enjoyable, and the food was superb.

We started with the Seafood tower, which is as fun to look at as it is to eat.  The dry ice accents made it a great conversation piece as well as a lovely appetizer.  The salads were very good as well, but I can truly say I have never had a better steak. I ordered the bone-in filet and the flavor was absolutely remarkable.  I have been to a lot of good steakhouses across the country.  This was a step up from anything I've ever had. the lobster mash is insane. Period. We were so stuffed by the end of the meal that we opted out of the butter cake, instead choosing a creme brulee for the table. This was served with a grapefruit-sized bown of fresh qhipped cream, just for good measure. Delicious all the way around.

Only two (small) negatives come to mind.  Our table ordered a round of decaf coffee to cap the evening. Mine was actually lukewarm.  Of course, the staff quickly rectified that problem with a fresh cup, and steamed it a bit to ensure it was hot. The ample wine list was a bit more expensive than I'm used to, even in other metropolitan areas.  Equivalent selections in Seattle were much less expensive than I found here. That said, you're going to pay a bunch to dine here, and you'll enjoy every minute.  Given my two (albeit minor) issues, I was going to give a 4 star review, but I din't want to leave anyone with the impression that the place was less than exceptional."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my 24th bday celebration ! It was really nice! I loved the ambiance and they allowed me to get my balloons delivered as well as my cake. They had a big a bough fridge to bring it out and cut it and served it to everyone at the table as well as bringing it to the back, boxing it up in plastic wrap and different boxes so it would be easy for us to take home. They were great about taking pictures for us and just over all great service. My one complaint is even though I brought my own cake they usually bring out a free desert if there's a special occasion which I would have still enjoyed. I got the shrimp seafood tower that came out with dried ice on a beautiful display. And I had the gnocchi and salad for my main course and it was plenty of food. This place is obviously very pricey but I believe it's the great device, live music and ambiance I was paying for as well as the great drinks and display of the food. Very good. I will continue coming here on special occasions"}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday party, and I was very impressed.  The steak I had was delicious and perfectly cooked.  All the sides were good.  The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  The music was good and there were a lot of good looking people and fancy cars there."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Mastro's last night for his birthday. As we are new to the area, it was our first visit and we have heard great things. Our greeting by the hostesses was luke warm at best, however once Jordan was given our table number she was very nice and welcoming as she escorted us through to our table. She was also very quick to remedy an error when she realized that we were being assigned to a table that was set for 8-10 people and there were only two of us. We were seated at a table along a very long continuous bench seat, where the tables are very close to one another (enough room to walk in between but too close if you want to have an intimate setting). 

Our server was fabulous (can't remember her name for the life of me!) and she did a great job making us aware of the offerings and what to expect, as there are a few nuances that are unique to dining with them. 

As the table next to us was seated,  the first thing we heard was one of the guests telling a story about a woman in a tube top followed by a curse filled description of the situation. Lovely. We continued on, trying to have a conversation and enjoy our meal. As time went by, we learned entirely too much about the details of our neighbors lives. Everything from their vacations, children, occupations, pets and a few more bawdy stories. Truthfully, they could all learn something about inside voices, but they were having a nice evening out with friends and had the table configuration not been ridiculously close, we would have had enough space to enjoy our evening and our own conversation. We noticed the people seated on the other side of them glancing over a few times obviously bothered by the situation and proximity, but they also politely soldiered on with their evening.

Our cocktails, appetizers, and main course were delicious, but I must admit that we were rushing a bit to get away from our neighbors. When it came time for dessert, we were very excited to try the butter cake as we have heard it is amazing. We never had the option though, because our server showed up with a beautiful piece of chocolate cake with berries, a birthday candle and, literally, a plate full of whipped cream with a very sweet \"Happy Birthday\" scrawled in chocolate sauce on the plate. So we decided to roll with it and give their generous offer a taste. I took one bite, and my husband took two or three. It was similar to most other prefab chocolate cakes in restaurants that claim to be sinful but wasn't the least bit tempting. The whipped cream was the star of that show, but I'm not sure how it would look to eat an entire plate of whipped cream and ignore the cake. 

By this point, my husband could sense that my annoyance meter was topping out, but he sweetly offered to stay for another cocktail and order the butter cake that we came for. I recommended putting the AMEX on the table and wrapping the evening up before I leaned over and not so politely sampled my noisy neighbor's french onion soup. It also felt awkward to order the butter cake and reject the sweet gesture of the birthday cake. When our waitress inquired as to the practically untouched cake, we passed it off as being full from our meal because we didn't want her to feel bad after doing a great job for us. 

I'm giving a three star review for the lack of hospitality upon arrival, the table configuration and the dessert. This entire debacle literally only took one hour and eleven minutes. So far from the romantic evening we had in mind. The best part of our evening out at Mastro's is likely going to be lunch today with the leftovers we brought home from our hastily eaten two hundred and fifty dollar meal."}
{"text":"Been here many times, but tonight was different. I was with two others and it was packed. Reservations for 8:45pm. We didn't get sat until almost 10pm. The hostesses were rude or less than apologetic & the waitstaff kept telling us they'd grab us another drink...never did. The bartenders were cordial and the busser; Issac was awesome...he later solved the issue and got us sat...the busser!!! It had been 2 hours, we'd had one drink and we weren't happy at all but we were never rude-just couldn't believe the terrible service we were getting. At this point I'm handing out a 1-star review, however, Issac and our new server Mark were amazing...they knew what our last two hours were like and they took good care of us. They comped a round of drinks...we were going to come back again nonetheless because this experience was a first but they still took care of the round. I think most people would have given this a 1-3 star review but Issac (21 yrs old I might add) and Mark (a seasoned vet) made all the difference. You recovered...you get 4 stars...always room for improvement."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night for the first time for his birthday and I have to say that it was simply FANTASTIC!

First, this place has a very romantic feel. We were seated in the bar area in a booth. There weren't many people there so it seemed like we had the whole room to ourselves. They also had live music which was a plus! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I forgot our waiter's name but he was great...he knew when to interrupt and when not to. (I am bad with names!) Now, the food...wow! We had the vegetarian roll to start (I don't eat seafood) and it's big enough for two people and it was delicious! Then my boyfriend had a steak and I had the chicken along with mashed potatoes and sautéed broccoli. My boyfriend absolutely loved his steak! He said this was one of the best steaks that he had in a long time and we have been to other upscale restaurants in the valley. Plus it was a huge steak! Took up the whole plate. My chicken was phenomenal. I only took a couple of bites because I was so full from the assortment of bread and the vegetarian roll that I just couldn't eat all that chicken! There were 4 big pieces of chicken and it was cooked perfectly! We had plenty of left overs. Next is my favorite part...dessert! We had the chocolate pudding cake and it was soooo delicious. It's also big enough for two.

Overall, the atmosphere, the staff, the food and just the overall experience we had was great! This place is definitely pricey but totally worth it! We will be back!

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak and lobster tail.  Very attentive staff.  The bartender was great...made a drink to order. Will be back!!!  The warm butter cake outstanding"}
{"text":"Pretentious waiters whose main goal is to upsell. 
Ordered the 16 oz steak. Waiter: \"Oh, I strongly recommend the 22 oz\" 
Ordered two sides. Waiter: \"Oh, you are going to want at least four sides to share\".
Said my budget was $90 for a bottle of wine. Waiter: \"Oh, I recommend this cab for $140.\"
Waiter: \"What will you have for dessert?\" We: \"No dessert. Just the check.\" Waiter: \"You really should order just one dessert and share it. They are all wonderful.\"
Meanwhile, the steak was okay, probably not prime. The vegetables were overcooked.
Just not worth the high price. Many fine steakhouses in AZ. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"The experience is just as amazing as the food. One of the best steakhouses you will ever go to. From a towering seafood platter with dry ice to perfectly cooked steaks on 409 degree plates, highly recommend."}
{"text":"PERFECTION PERSONIFIED!!!!! My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Love, the food, service, atmosphere, decor."}
{"text":"I had the Ahi recently and it was absolutely buttery and delicious. I come here every so often and have yet to leave a review but each time is amazing and the staff is more than accommodating. I absolutely love the butter cake they gave to us for my birthday, it is truly addicting and leaves you wanting more, even though I was already full to the brim."}
{"text":"My first trip to Mastros was awesome. Our waiter in the bar was very gregarious and I wish I could remember his name because he is defiantly the reason they get 5 stars from me. We had a great bottle of wine, a red blend and started off with the lobster bisque soup. Plenty of lobster and filling. Then had the bone in filet. Delicious! Sides of sweet potato fries and Brussel sprouts (which I normally hate but loved.) finished off with lemon cake dessert. Truly the dining highlight of my trip."}
{"text":"I will start with the decor and atmosphere of Mastro's is everything you expect in a high end Steakhouse. Plus, Service was very good.  I wanted to give more than 3 stars, but the food did not deserve it, in addition to how expensive it is.(8 oz filet $51). The high light of the meal was the Filet. One of the best I ever had.  The rest of the meal was disappointing, due to lack of flavor.  The bone-in Filet was not as good as their Filet.  The warm spinach salad was overly oily and needed some acidity and salt.. The Yelp reviews from other people convinced me to order Brussels Sprouts.  They were overcooked to the point that I had to remove some outer leaves because they were on the verge of burnt. We asked for Lobster Mac N Cheese, which they made.   It was good, large chucks of lobster, but on the spicy side and yellow cheese(cheddar & Colby???) was too dominate and overpowered the lobster. If I was to order again, would as for a white cheese sauce and less spice. Hope this review is helpful."}
{"text":"If I were to give this establishment anything less than 5 stars, it would be because of the uncomfortable feeling of truly being waited on at one point by F I V E separate servers!! I mean pleasant but wow!

Excellent quality, service, wine list, etc. Pricey but worth it!
Special occasion place."}
{"text":"Quite simply, one of the most amazing, over the top dining experiences. We've dined at so many steak houses - as I have a meat loving hubby and 2 teen boys. So we've had our share of Flemings, Ruth's Chris, etc. but this was one of our first trips to the Scottsdale area. I can't believe this is a chain, as everything about it felt so personal.

Stand outs:

- Their signature Cosmo: made with orange vodka, shaken at the table and poured into your glass with dry ice. This drink bubbles! Ooohhh I heart this.

- lobster bisque: shell based stock, giant bowl with tons of chopped lobster. If you want the heavy cream based, this isn't it. It is a delish real deal bowl of heaven.

- shellfish tower: giant shrimp & king crab legs. Believe it or not, I'd say it was very good. But I'd rather have the other unique items.

- sides: Mac and cheese, French fries (enough to serve 10 people) and garlic mash. Kids and hubby declared the Mac and cheese the best ever.

- peppercorn crusted ahi - very very tasty (spicy)

- bone in aged filets: this is the stand out bad boy on the menu. Any sauce you want, but awesome enough to do without. 400degree plates. These are the most flavorful filets I've ever had.

- butter cake. Just bring an insulin shot, and jump off the edge to one of gods creations. Can't even describe it. 1 cake is enough for everyone. It's like a giant, sugared pound cake ring with some fresh fruit. I will NEVER come to AZ without eating one of these.

Basically, I think the chef thought \"what is the most sinful dessert\". Then found an angel, ripped off their halo, rolled it in sugar and torched it to make it even better. That's all I can assume. Sinful, delish, and one of the best things I ever ate.

Also - 5 star service, live music.... If I run away from home, I will live here."}
{"text":"Horrible Steak, Bad Fish (tasted Fishy and Over Cooked), Good Sashimi, Great Wine, Boring Service.  I found Mastor's to be grossly over rated. The steak was not very good (Porterhouse), in fact it tasted old if that's possible.  They need to go to NYC and try Smith and Wollensky, Peter Lugars and even Jocko's in California, all of whom do a better at steaks.

So I wouldn't go back to this place and my date said the same thing.  The cost for our dinner was $220. Certainly not anywhere worth it!"}
{"text":"Mastros is a staple in our family for birthdays and special events. There's nothing on the menu that isn't fantastic and the service and atmosphere is so nice! They have so many special personal touches that make the price point worth it. We of course love their steaks but don't pass up on the onion rings (best in the whole world) or the butter cake!!"}
{"text":"UNACCEPTABLE Service!! It is not acceptable to leave finished plates in front of your guests, empty bottles, or to leave your patrons waiting to order for 25 minutes after slapping a menu down in front of them without any explanation of menu items. It is further unacceptable to never ask your guests if you'd like another drink when their glass has sat there for the entire meal empty. This would not be acceptable at a chain restaurant, so I cannot fathom how this could possibly be deemed acceptable for a restaurant that is supposed to be \"superior\". I frequent the top steak houses in Chicago which have earned their superior status and an experience like this would never cut it there.   

Furthermore, whether or not it is a la carte or not, to place a 12 inch platter with nothing on it besides a filet which was clearly not 6oz for $45 is laughable. The sauces were brought out 10 minutes later after we suggested them. They could not even get our coffees right without our instruction. To add insult to injury the music was obnoxious and loud and everyone was complaining about how dark it was. 

It is  not acceptable to show up at the end, make small talk and expect a good tip when you have clearly not treated  your guests with courtesy when they were spending $300 on a meal. While the food was fairly good, this was an Anniversary dinner and it was ruined by the abominable service. Please teach your waitress(yes, waitress) some basic restaurant etiquette."}
{"text":"My wife wanted great seafood so the concierge at our hotel recommended either of the Scottsdale Mastro's. Their seafood restaurant didn't have any availability, so we went here and I am SO glad we did. First, I hate to admit that I had never heard of Mastro's. I have hit all of the other national chain steakhouses...but never Mastro's. I had the bone-in filet and while I have had a bone-in filet before, this one was the best steak I ever remember having. The sides were wonderful and the dessert was provided by the concierge at our hotel and it was great also. Just GO!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, 2 for the service. The food was completely amazing, but our server just seemed 1) not excited to be waiting on just the two of us, when we were surrounded by other, larger parties and 2) not terribly concerned about the timing of our courses or getting us the bill. The wait for our mains after our salad course was at least 20 minutes, and it was another long wait for our bill after dessert.

When you're spending around $100 per person, I expect service to be just as transcendent as the food. Too bad. The ambiance was great (they opened up the blinds upon sunset so we could watch the sky), although the noise from the bar got super rowdy towards the end of our night. Not a big deal for us, but we were seated on the opposite side of the dining room from the bar, and could still hear the raucousness. I can see how other people might not appreciate that.

Again, food was delectable. (Gorgonzola mac and cheese! Perfectly med-rare filets! Butter cake, oh god!) Our waiter just seemed more concerned with literally everyone else in the dining room. Too bad."}
{"text":"We had never been here and decided to try, because it's close to us.
We spent almost $300.00 here and ended up getting sick. Everything was coated with oil/butter.
We both had steaks, sides,lobster ,  cocktails  and  butter cake, which was horrible. 
I will not be back."}
{"text":"When you go to a very high-end steakhouse like this one (on your birthday) you expect pretty much everything to be perfect... Especially your steak!

My steak was SEVERELY under-cooked (like blood dripping out) and after taking three bites, they should've taken it away and replaced it with a new one (it's was only a 6 oz filet for God's sake)!  Instead, they just heated up a little bit more and brought it back with an apology from the chef.

OK, at least a free birthday dessert would've left me with a good last impression, but all I got was this crappy little birthday card signed by a few members of the \"staff\".

Compare that to my experience at Flemings, in which I got 2 free birthday desserts, also a birthday card signed by the staff, and even a small box of chocolate truffles to go as a small birthday gift ...not to mention the food was cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe,  because of that I do think I prefer it over Ruth's Chris.  We started with a cocktail, we had mojitos which were really good.  For dinner I had the large cut of filet, ordered it medium well but it came out a little closer to medium but it was really terrific.   My husband had the 22 oz ribeye and really liked it as well.  For sides we split a baked potato and the fantastic creamed spinach.

We didn't do salads or appetizer because we weren't quite hungry enough.  We both had more than a meal leftover to bring home.  Next time I will get the smaller filet.  We had a great server and I am annoyed with myself for not writing this two weeks ago when we went because now I have forgotten his name.

It was my birthday so they served the butter cake, it is definitely worth trying.  The fresh  whipped cream is totally yummy.

We had a really nice time, it was relaxed, fun and the food was really good.  We are looking forward to going back and will probably try the lounge.

Two entrees, two sides, two cocktails and a bottle of wine was about $250.  It was a good value for the quality, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We dined with Mastros last Friday night to celebrate our engagement and 2 years together.  We were served by a wonderful man named Frank.  Of course the food and atmosphere was great.......when is it not?  that is a given.  The special thing about this night was Frank himself.  He treated us as if we stars from Beverly Hills.  Just an amazing experience with a wonderfully kind and knowledgeable man.  We made sure that next time we dine here we automatically get Frank as our server.

{"text":"The best restaurant in Scottsdale!.   We love this place.   My wife ordered the AHI on the appetizer menu.    It was very large and flavorful.   Next time, I'm ordering that!"}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club - Scottsdale was the most amazing dining experience we had during our week long stay in Scottsdale. Their service is unequivocally the best; from the hostess to the server, Duke, and server assistants, very nice, professional, knowledgeable and efficient. The wine list is great. If you can't find something you like, have a martini....they are delish. The food... OHhh the food!!! We had lobster bisque that is to die for, King Crab legs were super yumm. Because we couldn't decide on what entree to have my husband and I shared the Chilean Sea Bass and a New York Strip - Oscar and both were perfect! The steak was buttery and so flavorful and the bass was so rich and savory. One son had the Clear Lobster Roll, the other had crab legs. Very Good!  We finished dinner with a great cup of coffee and cappuccino accompanied with some warm butter cake. We will definitely be dining there again and are looking forward to trying Mastro's Chicago."}
{"text":"Although our meal was amazing - Diner beware - we had dinner there a year and a half ago and we were home our credit card was compromised - we
used it many places in Scottsdale so we had no idea where the numbers were stolen from - we are from out of town but frequently travel to Scottsdale.  9 months later we were back at Mastro's with another couple - had a great meal - 4 days later their card was compromised in the same exact manner ours was 9 months before - Mastro's was our common denominator - they had not used their card except for that evening.  When we called a week later to express our concern - nothing - not even a call back or we're sorry, we'll look into in - NOTHING!  If you want to go there and from out of town - use cash!  We no longer dine there and have not had CC problems since.


SINCE POSTING THIS 6 MONTHS AGO - MASTRO's attempted to contact me - I gave them information requested - and again - NOTHING!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day with my boyfriend. It was VERY crowded and we were sitting pretty close to the table next to us, but that is to be expected for Valentine's day. I was just happy to get a reservation! This place is pretty in demand for holidays. So I ordered the lobster bisque to start and then for my main course I got the Petit Filet 8oz and my boyfriend ordered the Pepper Steak 12oz. We also got the green beans, mashed potatoes, and gouda mac and cheese and the butter cake for dessert. Let me start by saying we got waaay too much food. The food here is very filling. 

The lobster bisque was one of the best I've had. It had whole lobster in it and the stock was very creamy. I ordered my meat rare and it was sooo good. They didn't overcook it and the meat was so tender and juicy. All the sides were seasoned perfectly even though it was very crowded for Valentine's day. 

Then dessert came. We were pretty full but we felt like we HAD to try the butter cake. BELIEVE ME IT IS WORTH IT! It was so moist and delicious. Topped with delicious berries. yumm. The dinner was pricey, but it was definitely a night I won't forget."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best steakhouses I've been too. Everything is sooo good. Starters, salads, sides especially lobster mashed potatoes, steaks, lamb & bass were all enjoyed by my party tonight. If you are looking for an upscale steakhouse I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best seafood & steakhouse in Arizona.  Pricey but great service.  Yearly, we take my whole family for Christmas Brunch and we all love it!!  Make sure you double check your bill.  Soup was charge extra.  I highly recommend this Mastro restaurant than Ocean Club (same owner)."}
{"text":"Words can't describe the service and food
It met all my expectations 
Especially restrooms lol
Very clean"}
{"text":"I had a petite filet (8oz) medium rare $40 Cooked to perfection. I got a small potion of the lobster mashed potatoes $26 instead of $40 still good portion to share for two people! The mashed potatoes are great because of the large chunks of lobster but once you eat those pieces the potatoes are average. I had the butter cake for $16 it comes drizzled in raspberry sauce with fruit and homemade whip cream! Honestly, one of the best deserts I've ever had. I was in a rush to catch a flight home but had to eat here before leaving. My server was super attentive and friendly got me in and out perfect timing! I would recommend this place for special occasions and when u have time to enjoy the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G! N ever miss.... Always spot on! Best filet money can buy.  Tuna was so fresh it was scary. The cocktails were perfect. I can't say enough good. If you get the chance you HAVE to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Chopped salad amazing. Scottsdale money joint.  Amazing selection steaks. Carpaccio and Wagyu NY strip great.  Butter cake dessert the bomb"}
{"text":"Excellent Service, Excellent Food, Excellent Ambiance. The Oyster Rockefeller was great, the house salad (has seafood in it) was huge and can be split for two, the Prime Steaks were great and the Carrot cake with whip cream could feed 5. This is a fine establishment. Only thing is out of the way if your in Phoenix and it is expensive. But this is the best Steakhouse in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I was down in Scottsdale for a conference for work. We had Saturday night to roam free. I was in a t-shirt, jeans, and flip flops after a long torturous day of stuffing binders. Definitely not dressed to impress, but dressed for a Ho Down at the BBQ place a block from the hotel. 

My co-workers and I ended up driving to around and exploring Scottsdale where we decided to have steak at Mastro's instead. I have to admit I felt a little intimidated to go in at first seeing I wasn't too glammed up. However, once we were seated, the waiter was super nice and didn't intimidate us at all. I had the the 8oz porter and we ended up trading in our spinach for deep fried onions."}
{"text":"If I had one meal left on this earth; I would come here. This is our fancy go-to spot for special occasions (anniversaries/birthdays) and we order the exact same food every time. 
Let me break it down for you.

Always start with a martini. The martini's here are like Nectar of the Gods. And once you finish one martini, make sure you have another (and contemplate a driver to take you home).

If you're a raw oyster fan, don't let the MKT price scare you, these little babies are worth their weight in gold.  The cocktail sauce is the bomb, literally, use a whole spoon full of the horseradish and your mouth will be on fire. If you get heartburn later; it's totally worth it. 

You don't need to look at the menu, just order the 12 oz. filet. Don't wimp out by ordering the 6 oz. When that sizzling hot plate of steak is presented, you can almost hear a choir of angels singing. I'm serious... listen for it.  This steak is so juicy and tender you could use a spork to eat it. Everytime I take a bite my husband looks at me like I'm crazy because there is a very audible MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm. 

When it comes to sides I only have 3 words.  Lobster. Mashed. Potatoes. I could literally dive into these and swim in the butter. When the waiter asks to spoon some onto my plate my only response is \"Oh, hell yea\"... while I try to keep the drooling to a minimum. 

Don't forget your veggies! No steak is complete without a heaping side of sautéed mushrooms. Delivered IN THE PAN! 

Complete your well rounded meal with a serving of butter cake. Seriously, like melt in your mouth sweetness of butter, brown sugar and everything else delicious that you could ever think of in a dessert. Bonus... it's served with an entire plate of whipped cream.  (I'm starting to drool again)

The wait staff always deserves 6 out of 5 starts. They go above and beyond the call of duty.

At this point you're so full you can't breathe and may require assistance (or a wheelbarrow) to get to your car, and your server may just be kind enough to help you with that too!"}
{"text":"Really great food! From the Apps to the after dinner mints. Steaks were perfect of course (every time) and had so much flavor. Lobster mash...good gawd!!! The Butter Cake we had even when we were stuffed was truly amazing. Great Staff, great ambiance, lets just say great everything. Must try for everyone....no excuses what so ever. Just go!"}
{"text":"This review is for Oscar behind the bar.  He is simply the best and hardest working bartender I have ever seen and believe me I've been in plenty of bars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale, everything is always perfect. I love the seafood tower with lots of oysters. Another favorite is the butter cake and they even make a gluten free one. Can't wait to go back for a date night."}
{"text":"Went last night , golf tournament and Super Bowl crowd had the place pack. Great entertainment and the staff was hustling to make sure drinks and food were flowing!! We had an amazing time , great wine list and food was perfect. High top tables in the bar are tight and first come first service but are the way to go.  It's always a great spot but with all the events in town it is the place to be. All that was missing is my buddy Jack!! And my beautiful wife. Stop by if you can get in and have a great time. Have the butter cake on the way out....."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit to this restaurant, however, we have visited
Mastro's in Chicago.
Our dinner this evening was outstanding!
Our hostess Jaime, was the best of any
establishment we have ever visited, including 
The Phoenician's J&G Steakhouse.
Jaime was very attentive in every way, making our Father's Day dining with friends a very pleasant experience. Jaime's close attention
to every detail was impressive.
Prior to our dinner, the lounge bartender was very professional, and attentive.
Mastro's entire staff demonstrated very high standards that are obvious and commendable.
We have added Jaime's name to our reservation portfolio for our next visit.
Thank you.
Larsen/Allison reservation 4:15 PM, Sunday June 18, 2017."}
{"text":"Ever since Landrys bought this chain the prices have increased and the quality has definitely gone down.  Now on a high $$$$ dinner you are assessed a 3% surcharge? With all the other choices in AZ this will be my last trip to this establishment. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Mastro's is a classic steak house with expectations of classic service.  I went there to order my favorite drink, a classic Manhattan.  However, I was taken back when the bartender started shaking my drink like a Margarita at a sports bar.  It was completely watered down and not blended.  $22 for a poorly prepared drink where I have to instruct the staff in how to make it properly leaves me feeling ripped off.  The bartenders need more training if Mastro's wants to maintain their image.  Also, the onion rings were large hunks of onion with a doughy batter and no flavor. For the price point, there are much better restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This was literally a gem in the desert.  While it was a classic steakhouse, there were subtle differences that made it a great place.  I, unfortunately, was dining alone so ate at the bar.  Had brought  my book with me and was going simple.  I know the side dishes a la Morton's etc are massive and for one person way to much food.  So I typically only get a salad and a steak.  The one disappointment was the 1/2 dozen oysters on the half I had as an appetizer.  Wow, for that price these were the tiniest oysters on the planet.  (Course I was in a desert so...duh).  I ordered the the bone-in cowboy rib-eye.  It was phenomenal.  Cooked perfectly.  I almost licked it off the plate.  The wine list was pretty extensive and while many were way beyond my budget there were some good finds for less than $50.  Overall a very satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal.  My wife and I went to Mastro's to celebrate our anniversary.  Highlights include the scallops appetizer, shrimp cocktail, bone in filet, creamed corn, lobster mashed potatoes, and the famous butter cake dessert.  We were a bit disappointed in the Caesar and chopped salad, but everything else was absolutely wonderful.  Great wine list and perfect service."}
{"text":"Mastros Scottsdale is one of the best steakhouses in the entire country.  Recently visited the North Scottsdale location for an anniversary dinner.  The service was perfect. The drinks were generous. The shellfish was incredible and the steaks perfect.  The bill was expensive but fair given the high qualities of the meal.  Also, they now offer a gluten free butter cake.  Hooray!!!"}
{"text":"Any review for Mastro's must be qualified by the phrase \"its not cheap.\" Because if you are looking for a good meal for a decent price, this isn't the place for you.  Be mentally prepared for a large check or you won't enjoy.

I ordered a vodka martini, thinking I would have a red wine with dinner.  My $18 martini (including the extra in the shaker) ended up lasting through dinner and refilled my glass twice (last one was mostly water, but still...).  Doing some advanced math, one $18 martini is approximately... $2 cheaper than a $10 martini and a $10 glass of wine.  What a bargain!

Once every couple weeks I go to AJ's and overpay for some good filets, and despite my ineptitude with a grill they are awesome every time.  The filet I had at Mastro's BLEW AWAY my attempts at steakery.   I broke one of the ten commandments, I can't remember which one, and ordered it medium instead of medium rare, but it didn't matter.  I  savored every bite, in that way you can only savor a really really good steak.  And for $40 bucks I should be savoring.

The sides are all good - I''ve never had one I didn't like.

Two minor complaints - 1) maybe we were too close to the live music, because I couldn't hear a word my tablemates said; and 2) my wife ordered a house or chopped salad, but was brought some weird salad with crab. Probably because (see complaint #1) the waiter could not hear her.

Anyway, if you want a restaurant to enjoy a special occasion, head to any of the Mastro's places.  Or if you make a lot more $ than me, make Mastro's part of your regular restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"There are a few mastros in Phoenix- based on location we should have gone to mastros city hall.  The Uber ride from the royal Palms hotel wasn't too expensive only 20 dollars.

They have a great cocktail list- Bloody Mary was great and I had prosecco. 

Portions are HUGE- we shared the burrata mozzarella, Cesar salad, filet mignon 12 ounces and small lobster mashed potatoes! For desert we shared cherry crisp- big enough to share for like 6 people!!

Ambiance is great- not too loud and they don't rush you.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Mastro's has a classic American Steak House atmosphere. I always get the bone-in filet and love it. Yes it is expensive but it is worth the money every once and a while to have a truly spectacular steak."}
{"text":"Our Cow, who art in cow Heaven, Meat be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in cow Heaven.  Give us this steak our daily Meat, and forgive us our slaughter, as we forgive those who slaughter us.  And lead us not into vegetarianism, but deliver us from hippies. For thine is the fields, and the Meat, and the glory, forever and ever.  Amen!

The Meat Gods had really shined upon me this time. An all expense paid trip to Arizona with Mastro's as my first dinner. Sweet!! The hotel had called ahead to get us a table for 7 in the bar area, oops, they called the wrong Mastro's. Not a problem, as the staff here quickly made us a table. 

Once seated our CEO ordered bottle of wine #1 and I got a Grey Goose tonic as well. That's when I notice the lounge singer! There was this guy in the corner of the bar just butchering every top 40 song from 1970-1990. Total American Idol first round reject, but mildly entertaining with his wretchedness. Our server was also a fun kooky guy, I wish I could remember his name to give a shout out, oh well.

We then got down to the nitty-gritty, the food. I smelled a few sizzling plates as they passed by and new anything I ordered would be top notch. I opted for the ever fatty and best cut of meat in my opinion, bone in ribeye. 22ozs of wonderfully marbled meaty goodness. Along with that our table ordered a half dozen oysters, giant shrimp cocktail, I got my own Caesar salad with anchovies, and there were some veggies that never made it to my end of the table. 

-  The oysters were spot on. Just a dash of horseradish, lemon and hot sauce perked them right up.
-  The shrimp cocktail contained some of the largest shrimp I've ever seen! Just eating three of them would have filled up any mere mortal. 
-  My ONLY complaint with Mastro's was my salad. I love anchovies in my Caesar and they were happy to add them, but they gave me whole, oily fillets. The little guys needed a quick rinse and then should have been shredded in my salad. Oh well.

Next came the meats. Behold the power and the glory that are lumps of flesh sizzling on a 400 degree plate!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bdCByYMU8ZZhvhqfGo_UVQ?select=ORYu-cLe0SxineXThaNuYA

Our server saw me trying to take a picture and he was gracious enough to shine a light on my prize so I could better document the momentous occasion. 

The ribeye was as good as steak can get. The fat had rendered into the meat and made it extra tender and delicious. The edges had nice little crusty bits and just the right amount of seasoning. Oh lord it was good. Along with the meats, CEO man had ordered bottle of wine #2, I ordered vodka tonic #2 and servers were heaping portions of spinach, asparagus and mushrooms onto our meat plates. 

As I neared the end of my hunk of sizzling love, I felt massive meat induced coma coming on. Thinking I would have no room for dessert, I ordered a white Russian to top off my meal and to send me into a tipsy meat sleep. But oh no! CEO man ordered 5 desserts for our table! And damn they were good! The chocolate cake was so good that we ordered a second slice as we finished the first one. Along with dessert, Italian CEO man felt that we should all have some Tuaca to top off dinner. I ended up having two since someone did not like theirs. 

I left happier and slightly drunker than I've been at dinner in a long time. An absolutely spectacular dinner!"}
{"text":"We had another great dinner at Mastro's last evening, hosted again by Jamie our server.
The entree selected was a \"Tomahawk Ribeye\",
with sautéed mushrooms, and a baked potato.
This selection was recommended by Jamie,
and it was phenomenal!
The cocktails consisted of \"Lemondrops\",
and \"Chocolate Martini's\", which were very 
enjoyable. Your bartenders do as great job!
Thank you.

{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants :( We noticed that right after it changed hands the service wasn't as good as it used to be, but when we went recently it seems to have improved.

The food has always been superb- even if you aren't a steak eater, you are going to love their steaks (aged in-house)! I am also a fan of the spicey Mambo salad with wasabe dressing (Mastro's salad is also really good, topped with a big shrimp, mmmm), the chilean sea bass, and my all time favorite sinful splurge has to be the gnocchi side dish with cheese, lobster and truffle oil. Oh yes. The Mastro's potatoes are also nice and cheesy and one of my favorite sides.

The butter and lava cakes are also a nice way to top off the evening. Don't even think about getting a seat at the bar if you go on a weekend night at 7pm (and you will probably need to call in your reservations at least a week in advance during season), but you can do some good people watching- twenty somethings that think they are all that, ladies of the night looking for sugar daddies and sugar daddies abound! My father in law even ran into Jenna Jameson there (yes, it was an akward conversation :)

They have a really nice private dining room that looks in on the kitchen (really fun to watch them hoppin' in there!), but it has recently changed- be prepared to provide a credit card and commit to a minimum for the room these days. This is a great place for a special night out, a big celebration, or a fun place to have a nightcap after a crazy night."}
{"text":"The good:

The service is top shelf and the staff treats you quite well. In the Restaurant area.

The Scallops dish is amazing!

The atmosphere is fantastic

THE BAD:

The steaks should have some seasonings on them. They were VERY plain and had very little taste. Which is fine if you like to add your own seasoning at the table. Unfortunately you only get pepper and Iodized salt. Iodized salt at a restaurant of this caliber is shameful.

The Bone Marrow. Same issue. No flavors.

The price! Holy cow at $60 a steak I don't feel like its a good value when my $15 steaks at home are much better.

The Lobster Mashed Potatoes. We got this because so many people gave it great reviews. $25 and it was a whole bunch of flavorless mashed potatoes and a small handful of lobster that you really had to hunt for.

Conclusion:

I'd prefer for the steakhouse experience going to Capital Grill or if you're on a budget even The Keg. Way more bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I ordered the 22oz ribeye (medium) to share with the garlic mashed potatoes, cream corn, & green beans and almond side dishes. The side dish portions were bigger than expected and even sharing with three other people, we were unable to finish them. I think it's all because of the two baskets of bread that we chomped down before the food was out. The service was great and the food was amazing. I gave it four stars because it was really loud. I found it hard to make conversation with my friends even though they were right across the table. The band was really good though but would prefer it to be a little softer. I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Arizona. Whether for a martini at the bar or a dinner for a special occasion! Gorgeous interior, service is always wonderful, food is delish! Highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Certainly High-end quality all round with a rich atmosphere.  Service doesn't get any better than this.  Understand you will be paying for it.  In turn, I think you can count on it.   \"Food Sex\" is how my friend described the Headwaitress oral presentation of the prime items on the menu along with the rare specials this visit.  I took them up on an item that had been out of the line up for weeks - the Australian Tomahawk.  Of the many sides, I have most enjoyed the Lobster mash and the grilled asparagus.  Their signature warm butter cake is certainly a great closing selection.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Dining at Mastro's Steakhouse is always an expensive proposition. However, after considering the superb quality of the food and the flawless service, I conclude the overall experience is nearly worth every penny.

My favourite item on the menu...?...Actually it's not a streak and anything but. The dish that wins my most acclaim is the herb roasted chicken. The tenderness is a melt in your mouth experience....and it's crust and crispness is just legendary....on top of that it is perfectly browned and juicy. Couple the roasted chicken with a side of creamed spinach and you've got a winning combination that will leave your taste buds moaning the rest of the evening.

Service was warm, friendly and very efficient. ...Mastro's remains an excellent choice for any occasion!"}
{"text":"I've waivered close to vegetarianism in the past, but after having a filet at Mastro's I know I could never give up beef. What a delicious night!!! I had the Petite Filet - it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I enjoyed every bite! Their gorgonzola mac and cheese is amazing... Try it even if you're not a big gorgonzola fan (I'm not). We shared the butter cake, which is a little too rich for me, but everyone else at the table loved it. 

Atmosphere-wise, it was great! Our party (me and 3 other girls) sat at a table near the bar and listened to great live music. We had a nice view of the bar scene - a lot of fun to watch. The waiters were so friendly and so much fun. We were so entertained by the waiters and other patrons, we ended up staying for hours! 

I think it was the most expensive dinner I've ever bought myself, but it's totally worth it for a special treat. Can't wait to go back to Mastro's!"}
{"text":"Worst steak I ever had,I had the New York strip,my wife had the fillet mignon, we shared a lobster bisque ,asparagus,and cream of spinach. Great place atmosphere servers all the way down to the barbacks.  The next morning I had stomach cramps,and sick as a dog.i couldn't e,at for two days,just starting to feel better.i hate you MASTROS."}
{"text":"I used to come here often with my family, and haven't been back in years. We decided to go back for a friends birthday, and I quickly realized why this place does not live up to the standards of a very nice steakhouse. We went on a Monday night, and the place was empty. They had live music, which would play for about 10 minutes, and take a 30 minute break and talk to people at the bar etc. The music was subpar, and Mastro's could have done without it. The food was also subpar. The filet was bland, and didn't have necessary char, or was seasoned properly. We also ordered the asparagus, and the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were bland as well, and definitely not steakhouse worthy. The asparagus wasn't cut properly, so you could only eat the very tips of it. The waiter was nice, but unprofessional. He seemed that he wanted to get out of there, and took the signed bill off of the table before we left. He then seemed to have forgot about us immediately, even though we paid a nearly $500 tab. The whole experience was strange. The staff was kind of awkward and would come out of the kitchen making a lot of noise, singing, etc. I would definitely recommend Capital Grille over this place all day, any day. If I were to give this place a positive, it was that the waiter did recommend a nice wine, that we loved, and the decor was nice."}
{"text":"Although the food is very good and service is solid, my opinion is that this place is overrated and overpriced.  It seems either to be a tourist trap or a place for older rich people to go.  It used to have a bit more of a younger crowd when I started coming year 5 or so years ago.  It also feels a bit strange going into a restaurant that has no windows.  You could really be anywhere and I think it takes away from the overall feel of the place.  If you want very good food at very high prices, this is the place.  I guess it's novel to have a restaurant like this in Scottsdale, but I think there are better steakhouses around that offer better value and ambiance."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time for our tenth anniversary.  It was a good decision.  The service was impeccable..and the food was fantastic.  Just make sure you have a very full wallet when choosing to dine here. It certainly will be a special occasion place.
The ambiance and decor is great.  The only complaint we had was the music being played was too loud and not very relaxing.  We did say something to the waiter about it, and he said if he could make those kind of decisions, he wouldn't be a waiter!  
The waiter was informative and made some great suggestions, which we took and were glad we did.
We were served a fantastic desert that had Happy Ten year Anniversary written on the plate in chocolate! It was delish and so nice of them to honor us and our special time.  
The only other down side for me was visiting the restroom.  There was an attendant in there, which makes me uncomfortable.  And I did not take my purse with me so was unable to tip and I could see the disappointment on her face.  I don't need any help in the bathroom.  Thank you!
You can't go wrong here.  The steaks were fantastic and everything was taken care of with great service. Almost too much hoovering by the staff!  But we are not used to dining like this.
I would recommend for any special occasion, but take lots of $$ with you!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE favorite restaurant for excellent food with unbelievable \"spot on\" service that makes you feel welcomed and comfortable each and every time you come in to visit.  Every aspect from the valet, to the hostess stand, to the bar/wait staff, and management, to the restrooms cleanliness and friendliness.  Living less than a mile from this location on Pinnacle Peak/Pima we frequent this location as often as we can.  Even if to stop in for a quick night cap just to say hello.. it feels like home.  Our most recent experience was on Easter Sunday 2018.  My fiance, not feeling well with back pain for a couple of weeks decided this to be our first real outing.  Requesting a place at the bar or hightop, on our OpenTable reservation so he could periodically stand was the start of our  wonderful visit.  Not knowing they did a 'brunch' at all, Easter Sunday and Mother's day, we learned that theses are the two days of the year.  WoW!!!!  

Upon our arrival of always smiling faces and happy greetings, including the host staff (and happened to catch Roman, the GM..) we were given options as it was early to where we wanted to go exactly.  Then continued to the bar area where all of the friendly faces are there to greet.  A personal and shake as he walks from behind the bar, is the ever fabulous, Nick.  He spots everyone and everything and doesn't miss a beat.   ALL of the bar staff are AMAZING, paying attention to every detail, from shined up and clean glasses, to knowing what you prefer to drink if you're a 'regular' visitor.  As well as topping off your water, or drink. ( martini's or soda bottles on side )  Always a clean surface awaits you or it will be as soon as someone leaves.!!!

Easter Brunch was beyond description.  Silver chaffing dishes lined up with smiling staff behind to serve as you walked along this delicious, delightful and decadent choices of luxuriously displayed nourishment.

From a simple toasting bread station to the iced seafood selection, as well as desserts,  you couldn't ask for anything else. If you did, it was sure to be provided. The Mimosas and Bloody Mary's were included in this indulgent treat of treats.  It's not for the faint of heart when it comes to your wallets, but a very exceptional experience and worth every scrumptious bite."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Very funky, eclectic atmosphere.  You step into something that looks like it came from the 40's.  Dark, rich, classy.  Everything you read in previous reviews is true.  I ordered a Cosmo that was ok..too much orange flavor but the presentation was crazy.  Dry ice that made it bubbly over.  Our waiter, Tobias was wonderful. Very knowledgeable about the restaurant, wine, steaks, menu.  He was funny and friendly.  They really treat you like someone special.  I had the 12oz. Bone in filet and my husband the 16oz.  One of the best steaks ever!  Unbelievable flavor.  Delicious Brussel sprouts and green beans as sides.  Because they knew it was our anniversary they comped us a butter cake.  You're so stuffed but you do manage to shove a few bites of the decadent cake and whipped cream down your mouth!!!  Super dining experience..wish they had this restaurant in Northern California.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I cannot imagine why this Mastro's does not have a full 5 star rating.  It just does not get any better than this!!!  I have eaten at most of the top steak houses in the country and none come close to Mastro's in taste and quality.  Plus, the atmosphere is perfect!  Add to that the top notch service and you have a perfect 5 stars!  
I have eaten multiple times at this Mastro's.  Never once have I had a bad experience and the food is always perfect!  Although I also like Mastro's City Hall and Mastro's Ocean Club, somehow the steak always tastes just a little better at this Matro's location.  Is it just me?
Do yourself a favor... Take your favorite guest to this establishment.  If you have a boss to impress ... here it is, made to order!  Trying to wow a date?  Look no further.  
What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Visiting a friend in Scottsdale and she suggested we go to Mastro's for a nice dinner. I'm so impressed- our waitress, Lindsey, was the sweetest and so helpful and patient with our indecisiveness. The portions are huge and she made sure we didn't over order. For two of us, we got an app, a salad, and a side and it was the perfect amount of food. The tuna was amazing and I'd highly recommend. We also got a free dessert for our first time there and I'll dare to say it was the best dessert I've ever had (some type of crispy butter cake with ice cream and a huge serving of homemade whipped cream omg). Highly recommend. For all we got, our bill was $50 (we didn't get a fancy entree though). Well worth a visit"}
{"text":"We love this place. Who doesn't love this place. Elegant. Excellent food. Live music. Delicious steaks & shrimp. Beyond excellent service. Delicious deserts."}
{"text":"If I could transcribe the sounds of a happy stomach to written word, it would probably be spelled, \"Mastro's\".  I would classify Mastro's as the ultimate of steakhouses, with cuts so prime and tender that they will still fall off the bone the next day when you take your leftovers out of the fridge.    

From the insanely good assorted bread basket (don't eat too much or you will spoil your dinner) to the shrimp cocktail that are so big you'd swear they were on the Barry Bonds regiment of steroids, to steaks that come out on 400 degree sizzling plates...there is happiness at every turn here.

Live a little, eat at Mastro's!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant ten stars! This is the most fabulous restaurant I have been to in Arizona! We had an unbelievable meal and evening. Everything from the drinks to the appetizers through to the dessert was prepared perfectly with the attention to flavor and presentation. This restaurant is comparitve to the Palm in D.C. or some of the 5 star restarants in Las Vegas. The ambiance and waiter added to a delightful evening. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Celebrated Easter with the family , great service delicious food and very nice atmosphere, just a little dark. My daughter picked the wrong time to go vegan, I enjoyed the $60 Ribeye and wife the $55 filet while my daughter had the fish. The waiter was very helpful and told us when we had enough side dishes and offered his handy flashlight . Joshua was the bus boy who was right on top of things and offered to take photos. Of all 3 surrounding high end steakhouses we noticed that the presentation of the food was nicer. For example several of the staff came with the food and one at a time they served the side dishes on our entrees. Other restaurants just place them on the table and leave. Cheesecake was delicious. Can't wait for the next occasion"}
{"text":"At first I had sticker shock. At the end of the evening I had no buyers remorse. I had the ribeye and my wife had the filet. Both were tasty and cooked perfect. Surprisingly the sides were above all expectations. The scallop potatoes were the best i have ever had, the texture and flavor were amazing. I would recommend the sprouts as well. With that being said the service was better than the food!"}
{"text":"Food, service, and atmosphere were amazing...5 star all the way!  I have to say it was the best steak I have ever had, we were treated like royalty and went home with a lot of food.  We had Giuseppe as our waiter and  he completed the experience."}
{"text":"Staying the in area for several times over the past several years I believe I have noticed this place before but kind of thought at the back of my mind how good can a steakhouse be in this location when I know I have trouble finding one who's value matches what they charge in NYC.

Well, pretty much from start to finish I was surprised. A good beer, a great steak (from the special menu of the day), good service, overall a wonderful experience that I would certainly go back to. Also, the menu was wide enough to make everyone at the table happy -- and this included some that would not find a good home at most traditional steakhouses that at least I know of."}
{"text":"Long time City hall fan. It was our anniversary yesterday and we decided to try the mother ship. 

It's definitely a little more grown up here. I'm probably saying this because we always eat in the bar area at city hall. The people watching is better than the airport, wal mart etc lmao. 

Service, food and everything in between was dynamite. We received a nice congrats card from the staff for our anniversary. 

My steak came out a little rare to my liking but they fixed it right up. Great steak, and bomb buttercake. 

If it wasnt so far from home, we would definitely come back often. We'll stick to city hall but same quality of service and food. A++"}
{"text":"We were staying at The Boulders and wanted a serious steak place. Could they recommend one? The concierge was so excited to send us here. 

We walked in and what surprised me was how BIG this place is. There is a glassed in bar in the center of the steakhouse. And then there are booths for regular diners around it, creating a square of feasting. So the atmosphere is a weird mix of nice dining with a noisy bar in the middle and live musicians singing Billy Joel songs. All I could think was oh boy what have I gotten myself into? So even though we could hear the noise, even the regular diners were boisterous happy folk. So just in and go with the flow. 

The service was excellent. We asked for a recommendation on the wine and the waitress didn't try to gouge us. We feasted on lobster bisque with chunks of lobster in it large enough to be a while claw. 

Our waitress also recommended we try the filet-in-bone, which, to be honest, I had never heard of. But now I'm asking, why haven't I heard of this before!!! The filet-in-bone puts any other filer I've ever had to shame. The meat literally pulled apart it was so moist and it melted in my mouth. Not sure how I can go back to Chicago and eat steak the same way again. We also did the sweet potato mash was excellent. At the end of dinner, we literally couldn't eat anything more. And trust me, the offered desert but I think we may have exploded if we had given in."}
{"text":"Been to this Mastros several times now and am consistently satisfied witht he food, drinks and experience overall.  Steaks done perfectly, sides huge but still well-prepared, and drinks perfectly made.  We are never rushed to order or throught he courses and can thoroughly enjoy the evening there.  On this occasion we were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary.  The restaurant comped us a ginormous dessert - flourless chocolate cake (heavenly), chocolate covered strawberries (ripe, not green like you get at other places) and mountains of house made whipped cream.  Amazing!  Between the dinner and dessert we had 6 boxes of leftovers!  The consistent quality and service make Mastros my continued favorite."}
{"text":"A recent visit to Mastro's had been a disappointment and I voiced my opinion on Yelp. The biggest surprise I received was a call the very day I posted from the General Manager, Mark, at Mastro's. This gentleman was adamant that they wanted us to return and give them a chance to redeem themselves. What was more amazing was that they insisted on sending a limo! Fast forward to the big evening and Dave, the friendly limo driver, arrived right on time and whisked us to the restaurant. The staff at Mastro's treated us like royalty. The service was spot-on. Cece, our wonderful waitress, was a real pro and took the time to thoroughly discuss the menu. My husband ordered the lobster cocktail and it was perfection. The presentation was gorgeous.....a whole split lobster on a bed of ice. Somehow  one of those lobster claws ended up on my plate. Mmmmm so tasty, brimming with  briny sea goodness. I had a classic spinach salad that was excellent. My husband had the heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese and that cheese just oozed with lusciousness. For entree we chose the bone-in petite filet again (the last time it wasn't very good) and it was superb. Melt-in-the-mouth the way a prime cut of beef should be. I did not care for their french fries, which when done right (with a touch of duck fat especially) can be so delicious. I thought they were overcooked and tasteless but my husband  liked them with both catsup and ranch. Who was I to carp over such a detail when the entire evening was comped by Mastros? Also, that's the restaurant business - what I love you might hate and vice versa. It's hard to please everyone but Mastro's comes very close.The piece de resistance was Mastro's famous butter cake and the description really doesn't do justice to the artful presentation of rich butter cake, ice cream, supremes of fruit and a lovely sauce. It is a scrumptious dessert and the perfect ending to a wonderful evening. Our feelings about Mastro's certainly changed back to our orginial good opinion of this great steakhouse after this evening. The food was so much better, plus the service was impeccable. This was our fourth or fifth visit to Mastro's and we've only had one disappointing meal. Knowing that General Manager Mark and the entire staff of Mastros are so committed to customer satisfaction, I can definitely say they are one of the best steak houses in the Valley."}
{"text":"Food is top quality, atmosphere is pleasant, staff is well versed in the menu and attentive.  We had a party of four adults and one child, never had an empty glass, and were thoroughly impressed by the flavors.  I do think many items are over priced.  

Drinks:
We had the lemon drop, Aviation, and the Elder Flower martinis.  Lemon drop was by far the best, highly recommend.

Appetizer:
We had the lobster roll and crab cakes.  Lobster roll was the best, crab cakes were good but nothing innovative here.

Main Course:
We had the surf and turf, the filet was one of the best steaks I\"ve had, lobster was good, truffle butter was a nice touch.  Has the bone in Kansas strip, excellent.  And the petit filet, also excellent. 

Sides: Lobster mashed potatoes, au gratin potatoes, sauteed mushrooms.  All excellent.

Dessert: Carrot cake and cherry crisp.  Portions are HUGE!  One will feed at least 4 people.

Having been to many top notch steak houses, I put this in my top three, just a little over priced.  Be prepared to spend!

I used Open Table to make a reservation.  I will say hostess staff were a bit snoody, young ladies, was impressed by our servers and wait staff."}
{"text":"A week ago, my husband and I got a sitter for our 4 month old and went to Mastro's for my birthday. Ten minutes after being seated, just as the server was decanting our wine, the power in the entire restaurant went out and the fire alarm went off. The server said if was just a power outage.  They hoped it would be resolved soon. He took our order.

Twenty minutes later he came back and asked us to write our name, telephone number and credit card information down on a slip of paper. They would not be serving any food and the manager would call us the next day to talk about how they were going to \"take care of the situation\".

They said we could drink our wine there (with the fire alarm blaring) or they would recork it for us to take home. We opted to take it home, believing it would be discounted? Comped? Maybe we would get a free appetizer the next time we went back?  A reach-around?

Mastro's never called, no one took care of any situation.  They DID however charge us full price for the bottle of wine they sent us home with.

Really? We did not go to Mastro's to buy a $60 bottle of wine (that retails for $17 at our local grocery store) to drink at home. We didn't take a sip in the restaurant.  Had we known there would be ZERO follow up to the situation, we would never accepted the wine.

Forget the wine altogether.  What kind of restaurant has a full power outage on a Saturday night, sends home everyone and doesn't even have the courtesy to contact them after?  We would have gladly gone back the next night (or ever) if someone would have made a simple phone call like they said they would."}
{"text":"This is fine dining at its best. We made reservations thru Open Table, and made note we were celebrating a Birthday. Upon arrival the Hostess asked about the Birthday and picked up a red rose and handed it to my wife. Great touch!  Throughout the evening the service was 5 star all the way. My wife finished most of her dinner and pushed the plate toward the end of our table, and within a minute the restaurant Manager stopped by to ensure everything was alright. Puzzled, we asked why?  He said it usually is not a good sign when someone pushes a half full plate to the side. We had a laugh and ensured him that all was good, we wanted a box to take it home. Had to leave room for dessert of course. The warm Butter Cake is so good. We even received a follow up call the next day to thank us for choosing Mastro's. If you are looking for a first rate dining experience, put this one on your short list."}
{"text":"Great stake house love the consitency here...always busy. Love it!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to this location. I must say, the service is not as attentive as previous visits. I feel like the staff has been cut back. I ordered Wagyu Tomahawk chop.   It was littered with stings of silver skin which made it difficult to eat. I've ordered this cut before and it was fabulous. Not sure what's changed but I'm disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband, in-laws, and I decided to go to Mastro's as a last minute, casual dinner with not much expectations. We were in love- the meat, sides, service, and the warm butter cake. 

Note: Mastro's surpasses Morton's in comfort, food, and just about everything else.

When I had a bite of the warm butter cake, I had a Ratatouille moment, and reminded me of eating my mother's cake as a little girl. 

My husband and I will be back next weekend...This will be a more frequent spot for us. Enjoy and fast before Mastro's!"}
{"text":"The smells from the kitchen are just amazing, great quality steak selection, intimate wine room for a group, and the BEST dessert in all of Phoenix. The service is a little fast for my taste at this price range, but the butter cake...you just can't say no to..."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere sizzling plates hot food awesome place to go .The steak was great and seared tuna is the best out of all of them ."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar tonight.  What an experience.  Nick was the bartender, and he's awesome.  Great drinks, of course the food is awesome. 

Never underestimate sitting at the bar at Mastros.  Got a new favorite hangout in Scottsdale.  If you're here, sit at the bar and ask for Nick."}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life!  There was way too much food served, but the leftovers were just as good as the first time!  Lobster mashed potatoes and snap peas were SO good.  I ordered the Sea Bass and it melted like butter in my mouth!  The seafood tower over dry ice was very exciting and delicious as well.  This is a great place to celebrate something special or splurge BIG time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there for dinner on Sunday April 29th, 2018.  We were greeted by Manager Mike Skubisz.  We went to my favorite booth 305 near the bar, music, etc.
  We started with excellent wines.  I had an Italian Pinot Grigio to go with my appetizer Jalapeno Ahi Tuna Sashimi.  It was better than great.
  My wife had a French Bordeaux Red wine to go with her Chopped Salad and Filet Steak.
 I also had the Filet Steak with Twice Baked Potatoes  The steak was super tender, tasty and great.  The Baked Potatos was large and very delicious!  I would order it again.  I had some of the French Red wine to go  with my steak.
 Our server Eddie was sharp,,quick to our every request,  ie extra ice, etc. He was most professional.  I would ask for his tables again.
  For  desset we had Warm Butter Cake.  It came with candles, etc.
This is a well run, GREAT restaurant, that all should try.

sincerely,

Ed Altman, Jr."}
