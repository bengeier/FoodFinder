{"text":"That Place is tucked in between a Fraternity house and the Arabica on the Case Western campus.  Featuring a $5 burger and fries entree at the bar, this is almost all I ever get.  I've had the French Onion soup, as well on cold nights and it's hit the spot.
The newer management has taken a shine to nice import beers, and their bar manager is very knowledgable about these beers.  Everyone I've met there has been friendly."}
{"text":"it's ironic how \"that place\" neighbors case western university, the cleveland institute of music, and the cleveland institute of art, the point being that it is not the typical restaurant you'd think would belong in a university area where broke college students would be the primary source of business.

however, \"that place\" offers a classier ambiance and the food is not bad. the $5 burger at the bar is now something like $6.74, but it's still a nice break than what you'd have to pay from the menu."}
{"text":"Good moderately priced restaurant.  The ambiance is nice, and the desserts are great.  We ate there for dinner, and while my salmon was pretty good, other people didn't like the quality of their meal for the price they paid.  One person had the pork chops and he said they were a little dry.  

If you sit outside for dinner on a mild summer night it's nice because you get to see the fireflies flutter around as it gets darker."}
