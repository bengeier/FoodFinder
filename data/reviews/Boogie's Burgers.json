{"text":"This is the best burger I have ever had in Calgary hands down the regular burger with the special sauce is so good it was amazing. The prices are so great basically 5$ for a huge burger and so many choices of side dishes. They have ton of milkshake options but I will have to go again to try them all out. It's a hidden gem for sure in Calgary I would recommend going again an again soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"I had the burger with mac and cheese on it and added a hot dog, it was phenomenal! Also their fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I get an urge for a good burger and fries, and hustle over to check em out. That is why finally went to the 'new' Boogie's in Marda Loop ('a-next-of' upscale neighbourhoods that is still home to many post-war dwellings and more condos going up all the time).

The interior is somewhat retro, and the wire that they fire the orders along is pretty cool. Otherwise, not much to say...

The burgers. 
Yes, they start at $6, but those only have what poses as a patty of beef: before going further, please combine 2 or 3 'patties' so that you can actually get your teeth into some meat?
I had their mushroom burger for $6.50 with a side of yam fries. 
Guess what claimed most of my interest?
The fries. Comparable to The Rock's, they were quite good.
Oh yes, the 'burger.' Just can't get up for a pattie that is so thin that it almost melts into the plain boring bun. The fried mushrooms and onions, and the accompanying mushroom sauce, were just about as absent in flavour and quantity as absent can get. The aftertaste, usually a good indicator of quality, was neither good or poor, but just so-so. All in all, definitely not worth returning for.

The staff were friendly and engaging, and certainly part of its draw...

If I want a burger in Calgary, will still go to The Rock or to Naina's. Just so much more for $12-15! And the flavours are just so much more noticeable. But to be frank, still looking for that really special burger place!

I know why so most are not great, but that may be a personal secret.

Ah, folks, pass on Boogie's?"}
{"text":"If you have been to their other location you will find that the food in this location is of the same quality. The burgers are thick and juicy, the fries are thin and crispy and the milkshakes are fabulous. Two burgers, two small milkshakes and one small fry will set you back about $35. 

The restaurant is clean and bright with a fair amount of comfortable seating. You can bide your time waiting for your food playing the old-school video games located around the restaurant. 

I can see this location of Boogie's being successful."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Boogie's since... 2003? This was the one on Edmonton Trail of course. I don't remember the details but our experience was negative and we never made it back, no desire to do so.

Fast forward 15 years to 2018 and my decision to throw Boogie's a bone and check out their new-to-me location in Marda Loop.

I got the \"boog mac,\" a spin on the Big Mac obviously, which comes with two patties, thousand island dressing, cheese, shredded lettuce, onions, pickles, a sesame seed bun and ... tomatoes, because apparently all Boogies burgers come with my most despised of all burger toppings. More on that in a minute. I just got the burger, no sides. and the very nice woman working at the counter made me a half fanta half soda water because it's an amazingly refreshing less-sweet combo and should be done everywhere.

I get my burger. Holy Hell this thing is big; it comes with a steak knife so you can, as I did. saw it in half to facilitate fitting it in your pie hole. It's also effing DELICIOUS. Mesmerisingly delicious, one of the best burgers I've ever had in Calgary. All of the toppings are beautifully drippy and the meat is done on a flat top thank you very much (charcoal grilled burgers are dried out garbage) and is perfectly juicy. The bun is majestic, soft but not weak. That tomato? Barely noticed it was there.

I meet the chef who recommend swapping tomato for banana peppers. Done and done. They have pickled beets too- I see a burger with pickled beet in my future.

Fries look excellent but I absolutely did not need any. 

It's good to be back."}
{"text":"Never really thought to give this place a try I had seen it while driving by it but never really gave it much thought. When they decided to go in and try it and man am I ever glad that I did. Some of the best burgers I have ever had in my travels. They're a good size have lots of toppings I would definitely suggest coming in and giving one of their burgers a try. They're shakes are actually quite good as well. And I'm not sure if they still have the special but on Tuesdays you get a burger you get a small fry for free so Tuesday's might be a good day to go. Definitely highly recommended"}
{"text":"Been a regular at the location in Edmonton trail, but wanted to check this one out.

Same great experience as the original. Fantastic burgers (some of the best in Calgary), great milkshakes, and happy/posit be vibe to the place.

Will continue to be a patron of Boogies for as long as I am in Calgary."}
