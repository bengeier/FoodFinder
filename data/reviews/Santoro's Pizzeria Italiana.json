{"text":"We went for lunch and got there about 11:30.  No one was there except the owner Dan. Since we were early he was able to tell us about his business and his passion for making great pizza and other pasta dishes. He kept us mesmerized with his story of starting his pizza shop and his passion of making award winning food. Great food and an enjoyable owner. I live in West Newton so it takes awhile to get to Castle Shannon.  I will be back this time on Sunday when his mom makes her  gnocchi. Dan said to me when we're out we're out. So get there early. To bad he is not in Westmoreland county. Love Franco's."}
{"text":"I tried their blue pig pizza and Italian hoagie. The pizza had good flavor but I'm pretty sure the Gorgonzola cheese was missing or there must have been very little. The hoagie was good, not different from most places. Something to keep in mind is that their prices are a little high! Their pizza is more expensive than Il Pizzaiolo and in my opinion Il Pizzaiolo is a better pizza.   They have some other specialty pizzas that sound really good, so I think if I were to try them again, it would be for that."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza here a few times. This past time there was a little mix up with the pizza. I ordered a white pizza and it came plain. Where ever the mistake happened Daniel  [the owner] offered to fix the problem without hesitation. His generosity and genuine concern is what makes Santoro's so great. As long as the doors are open, we will keep coming back. Thanks Daniel!  Ps always get a meatball. No matter what. Get. A. Meatball."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and we've loved it both times.  The food is fantastic, everyone is incredibly welcoming, and it feels like home right away.  We'll definitely be making it a regular stop from now on."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Franco's last night...I'm sorry I haven't been here sooner. The pizza was awesome. Ordered a large pie...1/2 with onion and ground pepperoni, the other with mushroom, onion, and hot pepper rings. The ground pepperoni really made it tasty!!!! It is put on the pie after the sauce but before the cheese so it cooks into the sauce making it taste that much better!!! I thought the quality of toppings was good and the quantity was perfect. The crust was good and just chewy enough.  We also ordered some of Nonna's gnocchi and a couple of meatballs. The meatballs were big and had a ton of flavor, and the gnocchi were killer. No question that either was homemade!! We were walk in customers so we sat at the counter top while we looked over the menu and then waited there for our food to be cooked. It is a small dining room, most of the tables were full and phone orders and pick-ups kept coming in. The owner was the pizza maker and he talked to us while cooking along and so did some of the other employees. Everyone was friendly. I would recommend trying Franco's if you haven't made it here yet!!!"}
{"text":"I just ate the most wonderful gnocchi I've had in years! Even though they were made with potatoes, they were light  and so delicious.  The sauce was scrumptious and  light.  The meatball I ordered to go with the gnocchi was authentic - made with beef, pork and veal!  It's a BYOB and with just a few tables to eat inside.  My friend got the Blue Pig pizza- it was a delightful surprise  - the crust was crispy, not chewy - and had a wonderful flavor!  the toppings were very savory and included pine nuts and spinach.  Don't overlook this modest family run eatery in Castle Shannon - either to order take out, delivery or eat-in.  A bargain with authentic Italian food - I'm planning on coming back to experience more of their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! The meatballs are to die for and they are always friendly and the food is always high quality! Worth the wait on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Good, not great pizza,  unbelievably expensive like other reviewers have noted.   $25 for a single large specialty pizza (16\" not 18\").  I had to check one of the pizza boxes to make sure a pizza was even in it because it was so light.    The specialty pizzas were good but lacked on toppings to the point where we had to look for toppings vs. what the menu said was supposed to be on it.   Will find other places to go in the future."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their pizza. I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza for take out. $9.99 plus $1.49 for the pepperoni only to find out when I got it home that it had no pepperoni on it. The crust was sooooo SOGGY it tasted like it was soaked in water. I called the next day and spoke to the manager. She told me they use ground pepperoni (NEVER HEARD OF GROUND PEPPERONI ON PIZZA). I told her it had NO FLAVOR and perhaps they should advise customers of the GROUND Pepperoni when ordering and also show that it is ground on their menu. She was not at all apologetic about the terrible pizza I recieved. She did however offer me  a free pizza but I declined. Why suffer again. This is the THIRD pizza joint at this location in the last 10 months and if they keep making pizza like this, They'll be gone soon too."}
{"text":"The Pizza is amazing! This was our groups first time being here. We tried the Blue Pig, The Don and Meat lovers all great!  Great little family owned restaurant everyone is so friendly and they make you feel at home. I wish all restaurants were this great."}
{"text":"We went for a walk from our Castle Shannon apartment looking for dinner.  We happened accross Franco's.  It was our first visit there.  The owner 's mother took our order and chatted with us about our impressions of the area, having moved from Jersey City.  The owner entertained out 6 year old with his pizza making skills.  We ordered a medium pie, half plain for the boy and half with meatballs.  It was amazing, by far the best pizza we have found in these parts.  Momma brought us a meatball to try to honor our first visit.  My italian wife may have slipped and said that Mama's meatballs are as good as her Nana's."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza joint. Super friendly staff, fast delivery, excellent prices, and the best pizza I've ever had. I don't know what magic they put in the crust, but instead of being the usual cardboard delivery system for the veggies that most places have, it's flavorful and delicious. This is the only pizza I order anymore.   Once, I ordered before their driver was on duty, so one of the other employees delivered rather than telling me I'd have to pick up. How cool is that?  In short: great pizza, good prices, nice people."}
{"text":"I looked everywhere online to find a menu and couldn't locate anything so I called to order. The girl on the phone told me that they have no pizza and topping deals and they don't have wings. So I ordered a large 2 topping pizza for pickup, went to pick it up and the girl rings it up and the total was 21.37. Are you kidding me I can get an xtra large three topping at pitzarella for 14.99. The price is outrageous and the toppings were scarce. I never leave reviews but I thought this one was exceptionally disappointing. I won't be going back and if you do ask for the price cause I was stone cold shocked."}
{"text":"This place has the  best meatball  calzone  ever!!! I can't wait to go back and try more of the food there.So far nothing can top  that calzone . The Calzone was huge , fresh , and delicious."}
{"text":"Great family-owned restaurant. Amazing food, friendly and prompt customer service. We tried the Mediterranean pizza and pasta with meatballs. Both were delicious and very generous servings. Must go and try."}
{"text":"Three words summarize our experience at Franco's:  Best. Pizza. EVER.  That's a bold statement, I know; believe EVERY word. Danny & family have something incredibly special going on here, and you owe it to yourself to get your catoosh out to Castle Shannon to partake in the passion, hospitality, & culinary perfection that only a TRUE Italian pizzeria can deliver.  I've been all over this green Earth and I've never had pizza like this. I'd put Danny's work up against anyone's, including those I've sampled in the mother country, Italy. Crust? Flaky, light, perfectly textured, and delicious. Danny's technique for doughraising should be patented. Sauce? Perfectly portioned and balanced; marked by notes of both sweetness and spice. Cheese? Ooey-gooey melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Toppings? Highest quality; the hand-ground pepperoni reduces greasiness but adds flavor to each slice. Together, these ingredients and techniques work in concert to finish in a symphony of flavor; in short, the perfect pie.  To top it all off, Danny, his mamma Elvira, and staff couldn't have been more hospitable; they made us feel like we were \"famiglia\". We'll be coming back as many times as they will have us!  Please. Go to Franco's. Make the trip. Bear the traffic. Burn the extra gas. You'll be glad you did.  ***UPDATE***  We visited Franco's again a couple of weeks ago - everything I said above is CONFIRMED. Danny, Nonna, & staff treated us like royalty...like FAMILY. This WILL be our go-to place for Italian cuisine in western PA until the apocalypse or Danny runs out of ingredients, whichever comes first.   I'll say it again:  Best. Pizza. EVER."}
{"text":"We tried the pizza this past weekend it was great. The sauce... ....the crust my wife and I loved it and it the next day it tasted great re-heated"}
{"text":"I entered this business to request a donation of pizza for volunteers for a local non-profit event. The owner was rude and dismissive. I'm a local resident and by the attitude expressed to me, I will never order pizza from here."}
{"text":"What a great place ! The staff here are super  nice and the pizza is the real deal I got a large pepperoni me and the wee-man. We loved it he eat 3 slices and I just about eat the rest. The crust is made to perfection and the sauce, cheese is to die for I enjoyed eating this pizza. My wife got a meatball sub and she loved it the meatballs are so good Mmm ... Will be back just found my new favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Franco's many times since I moved nearby in May 2015, I have never had a bad meal from there.  I definitely recommend this to anybody within driving distance and I know I'll continue to go as long as they are there."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible either. Just average. The middle of the pizza was pretty greasy and not cooked completely through. The crust was good and crispy. The sauce and cheese are flavorful. They use ground pepperoni which is pretty unique. Like I said, you won't be completely disappointed, but at the same time you won't be wowed. It's just ok. Probably nothing I'd go out my way to order again."}
{"text":"I am not one to leave reviews, but felt the need to share my experience on this one. With all the good reviews, I was really looking forward to something awesome, and I figured for how expensive it is, the food must really be something spectacular. I have never spent $50 anywhere for a large cheese pizza with three toppings, a plain small cheese pizza and a whole hoagie...but, I was hoping to get my money's worth.  I ordered delivery which arrived within the time specified,  but the pizza to me was just awful.  The crust was so soggy and the toppings just slid right off...it was a mess. Also, it was so salty I could barely eat it. The hoagie was OK at best, but nothing outstanding. I can honestly say I've had better experiences at Papa John's and Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Traveled from Virginia to try Franco's. Thank you Daniel for a delicious dinner! Best garlic knots I've ever had!!! Everything was homemade and delicious. The meatball calzone was outstanding and the pizza so cheesy!  Daniel, Vera and everyone were so friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't even get to order pizza. I tried to call in to order a pizza, and there was a message playing that they were closed due to weather...from three days ago. Okay, no matter, I have to drive by there anyways. I stopped in and asked to place an order to delivery. Someone behind the counter, who I believe was the owner, gave me a \"really?\" look...when I clarified delivery, he said \"well, you're here\". Obviously, but the pizza was for a friend who has been laid up and I didn't have time to stay. When I asked how long it would be for a pickup, he pointed to the tickets and said \"that long\"....okay. When I told him that I tried to call in, he told me that he intentionally had both phones off the hook.   At this point, I realized that he had enough business to not need mine and left. I work in Castle Shannon and had heard good things about this place, but I will not be back to order for a myself or a friend."}
{"text":"New favorite pizza place!!! So delicious and the people that work there are so sweet and grateful for loyal customers.  Great homemade wine too!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat, here at least 3xs a week.  Blue pig is amazing.  Gnocchi is awesome and meatballs are a must order!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place near me, though I don't eat much pizza.   I sat at a table and had a meal inside. The owner was very friendly and multitasked as he took care of guests and cooked the pizzas. There was a young guy also working there but I think he was mainly a delivery guy.   I decided to get a hoagie sandwich. They have a half sandwich and a whole. I got a it meatball style sandwich. The half size was plenty big and the sandwich was filling and hearty. The price was a little on the high side, $11.95.   They don't have alcoholic beverages so I got a flavored San Pellegrino.  This place seems a little more of a take out place than an eat-in place. I'd like to come back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"Pass here all the time but usually on mon, when they're closed FINALLY was in castle shannon today & ordered, got an italian & WOW, just found my new hoagie spot, best i've had in a LONG time. Can't wait to go back & try the pizza, don porco, blue & green pig look AMAZING, will be back soon for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered blue pig and stix. Pricey pizza at $22.99. Wasn't good at all, I don't know where all the hype is coming from. Pizza was tasteless and stiff as a board. Maybe it was an off night for them. I dunno. Second star is for the stix they weren't bad."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome and the meatballs are better! First time there and would recommend to those in the south hills."}
{"text":"I tried Franco's for the first time recently and, no doubt, will be a customer for a long time to come.  The pizza was awesome...but I feel like that has already been established in most of the reviews I have read.  That being said, I would like to put a spotlight on the HOAGIES.   One word:  Unbelievable!  The weight of a whole hoagie, alone, is unbelievable.   I ordered The Godfather which was described as a mobster of a hoagie.  What the menu failed to mention was that The Godfather weighs 7lbs. and you may put your back out trying to lift it to your mouth (small exaggeration on my part...but not that far off).  Every bite was loaded with meatball, sausage, onion, peppers and bread.  Delicious, delicious, delicious, delicious.    Some people may complain about the prices at Franco's, but you get what you pay for.  And what I got was an amazing meal, made with quality ingredients, prepared by the friendliest staff I have ever encountered at a pizza shop.    I'm already looking forward to my next visit...when I will try the Drunken Pig with a side of Don Capo :-)))))"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery - a couple pizzas, bruschetta, salad and meatballs. Delivery was quick and the food was DELICIOUS! My family is new to Mt. Lebanon and have been on a quest to find \"our\" pizza place. This is the best for me so far."}
{"text":"Same owner different name! It was called Franco's. The pizza is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! I was disappointed I didn't get a bigger size pie. But I'll be back. It's nice and clean and the owner takes pride in his food! Give it try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of pies and half Italian hoagie online, quick , easy , tasty, damn ...so happy! Food was delicious, delivery guy was like... sup, here's your food, Go Pens ......nothing to sign, top already taken care.  And the food was great , God bless Merica  Order Santoros' and be a good American"}
{"text":"I frequent Franco's Pizzeria Italiana because their pizza is so good! Everything is made from scratch! And their meatball hoagie? To die for! 10 star rating in my book."}
{"text":"We ordered a large plain cheese pizza there the other night  and it was just....okay.  Not good, but not bad bc how badly can you eff up cheese, tomato sauce, and pizza dough?  Our delivery was 45 minutes and it took them 50 min, but we live really close to this place and i dont know why it took so long, but the pizza was lukewarm when it arrived.  however, this is one of the few pizza places that deliver to us (we live behind Caste Village), so we might try them again.  it wasn't horrible, adn it wasn't terribly expensive.  It was just very, very, meh.  Compared to our other option, Dominos, they were okay."}
{"text":"Oh, my dear Franco's, why must you be alllll the way in Castle Shannon? You know we Yinzers don't like to cross bridges and go through tunnels!  But for you, Franco's? For you, I will both cross a bridge AND go through a tunnel. For your perfectly-seasoned pizza crust and giant juicy meatballs, I will even sit in traffic on West Liberty Avenue AND Route 51. It is that serious.  This is the cutest pizza shop. Incredible service, and workers/owners who truly care about the business. They put their hearts into this shop and it shows.   The pizza is delicious. The crust is just the tiniest bit salty, and pleasantly garlicky, and the sauce is so well-balanced. I'm picky about my red sauces, but Franco's hits it out of the park with balance. Not too sweet, not too salty, not sour in the least. It's everything a pizza sauce wants to be.  The meatballs are also noteworthy. They're meaty, gigantic, and juicy as can be. And unlike that dish your Baba made for you your entire childhood that you just couldn't replicate at home, Franco's masters the old family meatball recipe as if Granny herself is hard at work in the kitchen six days a week.   They do takeout and delivery, but I recommend going in and sitting down at one of the tables to enjoy your meal. You'll get to chat with the staff, hear their stories, and feel like one of the family.  So cross the bridge. Take the tunnel. Embrace your road rage at that intersection-that-might-actually-be-a-portal-to-Hell on 51. Do whatever it takes to get to Franco's and get yourself a meatball."}
{"text":"So happy I finally got to try this place.  I drive by it all of the time, but with so many pizza options in the area I never got around to trying it.  The Yelp reviews that raved about this place made me decide to give it a shot and it was just as good as everyone made it out to be.  The owner of the place was extremely nice and friendly, as many of the reviews note.  My wife and I ordered a large pizza and breadsticks.  The breadsticks were some of the best I have had.  Very fresh and had a great garlic taste.  The pizza was also great.  It is a thinner crust type pizza.  The crust was crispy and had a great flavor.  The sauce and cheese were balanced perfectly and topped things off perfectly.  I will definitely be back to have their pizza again and try their hoagies."}
{"text":"Ordered the don and picked it up about 15min ago.  Probably one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. The crust is perfect and the ingredients go together perfectly. The young woman cashier and the man making the pizzas are extremely friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the burgh! Try the blue pig and ask for the XXX pepper flakes if you can handle it :)"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza hands down. Breadsticks are also amazing. Carry out special of large pizza and breadsticks is an awesome deal. Great owner and service- and quaint atmosphere to sit down and byob. Tried the Nutella pillow for dessert today- OMG soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Family trip for the Ducks-Penguins game but decided to try this place since Yelp gave it such rave reviews and it was across the street from the ice center where the kids could work out some energy.  Well, all I can say is that the Internet was my friend today.  Thank you Yelp app for coming through.  The boys and I shared a large pizza with ground pepperoni, bacon, and black olives.  So, so flavorful and the crust was a little crispy.  Perfect.  My wife had a hot veggie hoagie and enjoyed it, as well.  Add to this that the owner and staff are super easy going and friendly, you can tell that they enjoy doing what they do and that they take pride in what they serve the public.  If you're hungry and you happen to be in or near the Castle Shannon area of Pittsburgh, don't pass up a chance to give Santoro's a try.  Four thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times. This time instead of dining in, I got it to go.  I also decided to try a meatball after reading the reviews.  The pizza was fantastic! Everyone who had a slice said so (and we eat a lot of pizza which makes us experts.)  The surprise for us was the meatball.  I just got one so we could sample it.  It was delicious, as well as the sauce that it was in.  So much so that next time we may order 6 or so and make a meal out of it. Or we may try one of there meatball menu items.  This part of Castle Shannon reminds me of Mr Rogers'  Neighborhood.  Mr McFeely could walk in at any time. Its part of the charm of the place!   I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Make some dough.  Im from out of town. Pizza sucks where I live. I'm always on the hunt for the next best pie. We were camped out in our RV across the street for a hockey tournament when a nice lady brought 2 pizzas over.  \"We didn't order any.....\".   \"I know but its slow and thought you boys might want some pizzas\".    HELL YEA. free pizza, no mater how bad is 3 star material at least.  Marketing genius. The pizza was A+ so we went across the street (12 pak under arm cause its BYOB) and killed 2 more larges plus left a fat tip for the nice folks. This is my kind of joint. Doesn't look like much from the outside but is a hidden gem.  Why the pizza is the shizz: crisp brick oven style crust that actually has flavor. You will not leave pizza bones on your plate. The secret : these guys use cold filtered water and make fresh dough every day. The ground pepperoni was a nice touch .  Bottom line: do your part to help get this country out of its recession.  Spend your hard earned cash at a mom and pop shop like this."}
{"text":"The drunken pig is my favorite pizza anywhere. Ever.  We visit Pittsburgh every year or so, and stop by at least twice.  Also, the meatballs are for real real, not for play play."}
{"text":"Hey! You wanna meatball?  Good meatballs and pizza.  This use to be Franco's Pizzeria Italiana but the owner changed the name to his name but still has the same good food.  Stopped by and had a meatball and small pizza.  good taste and good cheese on the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was some of the best I have had. The sauce really made the difference on this one. I've recommended it to numerous others by word of mouth but bottom line - try this place out. Ask for the owners if you aren't sure what to get on the pizza, they will make you a special pie to die for!"}
{"text":"why didn't I try this place sooner? I've lived just up the street from it! what a fool I am! this place has the best pizza, hands down! I will order no other local pizza again! so we finally decided to try it. took a nice bottle of wine(yep, it's byob). it's not  a huge menu, but that is not a problem! we went with a 8\" aioli with black olives, mushrooms & spinach for me, & an 8\" red with dan's ground pepperoni & sweet sausage for tom. after a moment, 1 of the guys came over & suggested just getting a 12\" & they could halve our toppings on it for a little less! yes please! now, normally, tom & I eat a large pizza, plus a side. we only got, like, a medium. as we tore through the pie like 2 people who hadn't eaten in weeks, & as we got down to the last 2 pieces, we realized-we must have more!!! we ordered a 2nd! AH! when we finally left, we were full & happy! the guys thought we wouldn't finish it! silly boys! they don't know us....yet!  the guys were super friendly. they even came over, & we bs'd about their delicious pizza & our tattoos! lol! we have to go back soon! actually, they deliver! heaven brought to my door! MMMMMMMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Had two hoagies and garlic knots.  All was excellent.  Plan to try the pizza next time we order."}
{"text":"Franco's is a decent establishment and it is clear that they take extreme pride in their craft although their product misses the mark a little bit.  The inside is very small and if you dine in you will leave smelling like pizza for the rest of the day.  The prices are a bit more than they should be, clocking in at $14 for a regular large sixteen inch cheese pizza.  They do use really high quality ingredients but it still a bit much for a pie from a little shop like this.  The store is very small and it decorated poorly in the standard dirty pizza shop style.  The menu is printed on a piece of paper from Kinko's.  They use regular pizza boxes and then stamp their logo on them really small on the box, which is pretty funny and kind of ghetto.  I get the impression that no one that runs Franco's really knows what they are doing on the business end.    I was happy to see that they use a conventional brick oven as opposed to a conveyor oven.  Unfortunately, they make their pizza on screens so the dough doesn't get the direct heat that it needs to get fully crispy and cooked.  When the owner is making the pies he takes his time and makes them pretty well.  The one time I came in and there was another guy making pizza and it was noticeably worse than usual and most of the sauce had drooped into the middle because he didn't account for it by putting the majority of the sauce on the outside so it can drift into place naturally while cooking.    The dough: The dough is pretty flavorless.  It has a somewhat typical Pittsburgh taste, a bit on the sweet side and lacking any real signs of fermentation.  The dough is fairly moist, a bit too moist to be using with screens.  Because of the screens the pizzas don't full cook to where they should be and even though the bottoms of the pies are cooked and done the dough right under the sauce is still a bit raw and doughy.  After each pie comes out of the oven they brush the crust with oil and hit it with some herbs not unlike Domino's.  Some people probably have little mini-orgasms over the herb crust but I would much rather have a crust that taste like good crispy crust.  The dough is definitely the weakest link of the pie.  The cheese:  They use Grande cheese (aka the best).  I think it is 100% grande but I can't be totally sure.   The sauce:  Franco's uses Stanislaus tomatoes which are among the best tomatoes you can buy.  The sauce is pretty good but could use work.  The flavor is very herby with a decent bit of garlic.  The sauce is borderline bitter at times but not exactly in a bad way.  It has a bit of spice that I think would be nice if they toned down the herbs.  The consistency is in the middle of the road, not too chunky and not too watery.  I do think they use the old fashioned stingy pizza shop recipe of using crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and than water so save money.  This is probably part of the reason they are overcompensating on the herbs also.  They are using herbs and garlic to disguise the fact that the sauce is probably at least 20% water.  It still isn't a bad sauce by any means and is still better than most in the area.  Like many Pittsburgh pizza shops they tend to go heavy on the cheese and skimpy on the sauce which I dislike.  Also sometimes it seems as though the sauce isn't distributed well across the pizza and you end up with one of those bulls eye dart board looking pies where there are big portions without sauce and big portions with all of the sauce.    This place makes a really excellent marinara sauce for their pastas as well, although there are some things on the menu where they say they are giving you marinara sauce (for example Breadsticks with Marinara) and what they actually give you is just cold pizza sauce (which is terrible for breadsticks).     Overall its still a pretty solid pie.  If they were to ditch the screens and make pizza the old fashioned way it would do them wonders.  Less cheese and more sauce would be nice also.  This place is definitely worth checking out and I imagine people than aren't as picky as I am would love it."}
