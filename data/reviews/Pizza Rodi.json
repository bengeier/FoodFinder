{"text":"Great independent pizzerias are a dime a dozen, but the Rodi on Queen-Mary has by far the best pizza in the area. A lot of it is the dough, with its slight hint of garlic and excellent texture. It's also dirt-cheap, and the standard-issue combos are good deals as well. Great pizza."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. First it was a complete nightmare to communicate while ordering on the phone, they kept messing up my address, once they finally got it right I thought everything was going to be alright. I was wrong, 50 minutes later I still didn't have the order and called to make sure it was on it's way because I had to leave soon, they told me it was on its way...but it never arrived. So I called back and told them I had to leave and that I would like to cancel my order. The person with who I spoke was extremely rude, and finally just hung up on me. Seconds later I received a call form their delivery man, this guy had zero class, he accused me of not knowing my own address and even insulted me on the phone. I have never be harassed so much in my life because of a 12$ pizza. There pizza might be cheap but so is their service."}
{"text":"I have to admit the food here is pretty good...when it is delivered hot and your order is correct...However I am so disappointed in the incompetents that work at/own this place...ordering on the phone is a nightmare as they speak neither English or French...the delivery time is often too long leaving the food cold, they don't take down your address/phone number correctly and they get your order wrong frequently. The fact that it's so cheap used to make me overlook this but no longer can I be bothered to deal with the troglodytes that answer the phone. NEXT!"}
