{"text":"This is OK Chinese food but if you EVER want delivery service ... GOOD LUCK!!! They always have an excuse for not having a driver available...either they don't come in until after 5pm or they are missing a TIRE on their vehicle!!!! GEEZ!!  If you want to take the trip out to them, again, it's OK...nothing spectacular about their food.....  SORRY!  :("}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for almost 8yrs now. They have very good food and they don't skip on the portions. They have dining in, take out and delivery. Their also all very friendly and nice people. This is my go to place when in Parma, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has severely dropped over the years as it was once my favorite restaurant. They have a new name and ownership and I was hoping that would help fix things up. Maybe get a new supplier for your food or something but that never happened. It's the same food with a different name at this point. They changed the hot and sour soup that was amazing and now it is almost uneatable. I know the great wall could become a great spot once again however it might take some serious thinking and a game plan!"}
{"text":"Great pepper steak & rice. It has a great flavor & always comes steaming hot, even when it's a call-in. I've been coming since I was a kid & cannot find another place that tastes as good."}
{"text":"The small is about as big as a regular at comparable places. The prices here are so low that it's cheaper to order takeout than it is to cook for myself. The inside is always very clean."}
{"text":"Beware! This place is the worst Chinese take out restaurant I've been to, ever. Very filthy and dingy looking - shouldn't have ordered when I walked in but I was hungry and in a hurry. The food I ordered, orange beef and an egg roll were absolutely awful - the beef was simply a clump of deep fried breading covered in red liquid, the egg roll was an oily pocket of unidentifiable filling. Stay away - places like these should not offer items for human consumption."}
{"text":"This place used to be a great Chinese restaurant.  They have some great recipes like Hot Braised Chicken and Hot Braised Pork.  The problem is the food tastes STALE.................not fresh, like it's been sitting in the refrigerator for a week.  They would be doing all of their customers a huge favor if they got back to basics and put an emphasis on serving FRESH chicken, pork, shrimp, and vegetables."}
{"text":"This business replaced the Einstein Bagels at this location. It is close to where to we live but due to the fact that I never see customers in their parking lot I had been skeptical of giving this place a try.   I was surprised by the overall high ratings from other reviewers on Yelp (even though there are just a handful of reviews) so I thought I would give it a try in hopes of finding good Chinese food that is close by.  I ordered  dinner for pick up last Friday. When I walked into the restaurant it was completely empty other than the employee behind the pick up counter. He seemed caught off guard by the arrival of a customer as he was drinking out of a bowl when I walked in.  The food was ready and the employee was friendly overall. As I was about the leave I noticed another employee in the kitchen washing her eye glasses in the sink, she made eye contact but did not greet me. No big deal.  The food, however, is not good. At all. Completely bland, with little to no flavor. Not even the taste of salty-ness one might expect from Asian food.  The hot and sour soup had no flavor whatsoever. Nor did the cashew chicken or garlic shrimp - both had a bad after taste of stale grease. The spring roll tasted awful, like it had been deep fried in oil that has never been changed.   Needless to say, we took a few bites and couldn't finish our meal the food was that bad.  I don't often rate restaurants with one star but the food was that disappointing."}
{"text":"I've ordered General Tao's chicken at a lot of places and this might be my new favorite place. Good portions and great taste!!!! Took a chance and it paid off!!!"}
{"text":"Average food for vegetarians.  Had to fix it up when I came home.  They won't deliver either."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out a few times. The food is not expensive at all, portions are large. I always get my food sooner than promised which is a plus. The food is very good and always arrives piping hot.. There is a small delivery fee of $1.50 but worth it as I don't drive."}
{"text":"It was the worst service and food ever...  The food was a recycled mess mixing different dishes together to make complete dish.  The egg drop soup was gelatinous and hasdly edable.  They don't apologize for there lack of professionalism l, but only make excuses.   Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and finally decided to give this place a try. For $7.91 (super cheap) my wife and I split the Sesame Chicken dish. The plate was loaded! There was enough food for the both of us and then some. I loved the sauce on the chicken and the fried rice was delicious. The egg roll was huge and did not disappoint. I'm so happy with this restaurant! I'll definitely be visiting again! Move over Chang Jiang, there is a tastier Chinese place in town!"}
{"text":"Food was good. When I went to pick up, there was actually a fairly long line (5 people in front of me) so that impressed me. It's fairly standard americanized chinese food, nothing outstanding. The place was clean."}
{"text":"I don't get to order from here often, but I've always found that it's enjoyable. They've got a large menu, even for a Chinese place and the food is usually pretty well cooked. I do wish they'd add a bit more spice to the spicy dishes though. I always like an extra kick."}
{"text":"I was told they have a new owner (on 4/3/16). I placed the order for delivery and it took 1:40 hours...that's right over an hour and half!!! I called several times and was told that the driver was on his way (for 45 min???). The driver said he had come directly from the restaurant and that the new owner did not know what he was doing. I suspect that both the owner and driver lied. DO NOT EAT HERE, and DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY. The food was average at best and COLD. It should not take more than 1 hours and 30 min to deliver Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight as we were too tired to go out after work.  The Sesame Chicken was just not good.  It tasted like ketchup.  My son had General Tso's his wasn't bad but not spectacular by any means.  Caveat Emptor........."}
{"text":"Sadly, under new ownership and the food isn't nearly as good. Will search the North Hills for a new Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The food quality is decent but they charge seemingly random prices. I order the same thing around the same time of the day and sometimes it will vary by $3 or more. Also, there is an up-charge for tofu as well even tho tofu costs less than the meaty counterparts it replaces. Overall fine quality but this place does have it quirks... it is currently the only Chinese restaurant in Monongahela."}
{"text":"First and last time I'll come here.  Extremely slow service. They weren't busy, just slow.  Pork fried rice was cold and lumpy... Probably left over from yesterday. Chicken was more fat than meat. I left here hungry looking for a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend last week, and was extremely pleased. I agree with Jenn T. The staff here was very pleasant. They automatically start you off with hot tea, which is wonderful. Unlike many places which serve regular (like Lipton) tea, or green tea, these guys served us black tea, which was very nice. We actually wanted to take some of it home!   The prices were appropriate for dinner, but the servings were much large than expected. When you find a good chinese restaurant, there's nothing wrong with having some left over to take home! I started out with wonton soup (which is a must for me!) and it definitely made my top 2 list of best wonton soup I've ever had. I'm actually not a fan of the green onions, and typically eat around them, but this wonton didn't have it \"standard\" which I thought was great.  I then ordered the chicken and brocoli, which was ready as soon as I had finished my soup.   The bottom line: The service was great and prompt, the price was right, the portions were huge, and the food was tasty! I'm upset that I don't get to the City more often, just so I could frequent this place."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is another story.  I was told I could not make any requests with the food.  I AMA vegetarian and asked to have tofu instead  of chicken on a meal,  I then wAs told I could choose from 2 tofu selections, the one I got was delicious.   However we were the only ones here, and u think one would be accommodating ? Try sesame inn or empire palace instead."}
{"text":"The dishes I ordered turned out to be bland. I ordered vegetable lo mein, vegetable chop suey, and french fries (needed a cheap, vegetarian option to meet minimum order $$). What surprised me is that the french fries were the only thing I couldn't stop eating. They were salty and well cooked but needed ketchup.  The veggie lo mein was the next best dish. It had nicely sized pieces of broccoli but I was let down by the rest of the veggies. Canned mushrooms and barely there snow peas. The dish wasn't bad but it was majorly lacking flavor. The sauce could've made it better but there was just so little of it.  The chop suey was just odd. Again, lacking in taste. I added two packets of soy sauce which helped a bit. The sauce was strangely... goopy? It was sort of thick, sort of slimy, sort of oily. Mixed with rice the texture is a bit better.  I had plenty of leftovers and intend to keep them, and I look forward to working in the kitchen and doctoring them up a bit to add flavor."}
{"text":"So delicious! First time visiting, cashier was very nice and friendly. We ordered, pork lomein, chicken lomein and beef and broccoli combo. Food was fresh and hot...and I will definitely visit again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've ordered twice. Once for take-out, call ahead so you don't have to wait 10-15 minutes, and one dine-in. The lunch menu is cheap, usually under $6 an entree.  The first time was takeout. The fried rice was hard and stale, but the entrees were good. My friend noted that there was chicken in the fried rice and usually other locations don't add a meat. Takeout didn't include napkins, utensils, or sauces.   On my dine-in experience, the restaurant was clean but the floors were sticky and I could see wash cloth streaks on the tabletops. Service was good and the lady at the counter was able defuse a fussy customer who questioned the price differences in beef vs shrimp meals.  My favorite lunch item so far is the shrimp in garlic sauce. The quantity and size of shrimp was impressive for the cost of the meal. The portions are just right for a one, maybe one and a half, meal.  The fried rice was much better during this dine-in experience.  If coming northbound on Verona Rd, take the Frontage Rd exit to get to the restaurant. When leaving, you can exit to northbound Verona/Midvale Rd or if heading southbound, you'll have to take the roundabouts."}
{"text":"I got my delivery fast (25 min) and it was very hot and fresh! It is your basic Chinese take out. I enjoyed my wonton egg drop soup so much. Very nice favor and texture. I also got crab Rangoon (ok) and orange chicken. The orange chicken sauce was great with slices of orange zest in it. I thought the breading was too much for too little chicken, but anything fried still tastes pretty good haha."}
{"text":"Crispy General Tso chicken! One of the better versions we've had in the area, although it could have been a bit more spicy. Pork fried rice was good - not too sticky and flavorful. Chicken with broccoli (spicy) was also tasty and broccoli cooked evenly, not too firm or mushy.  Egg rolls were crispy and tasty! Only negative comment, it seemed like the inner part of the egg roll wrapper did not get cooked completely and it partially unraveled.  If you are calling your order in, you can use the \"Beyond Menu\" app to look at their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I felt like ordering Chinese food on NYE, and our normal delivery place is a bit of a drag. Via the Yelp app, we found that Great Wall was listed as an alternative, which was very surprising since it's a bit of a distance from our home. Ordering online was easy, and it mentioned we could have up to a 70 minute wait time, but they ended up delivering about a half hour later. The food was still so hot that I burned the roof of my mouth! Definitely a good thing when it comes to delivery. The crab rangoon was the best I have had in the Madison area, and I've been searching for good crab rangoon for years. I ordered the chicken chow mein with cashews, and my husband ordered sweet and sour chicken. Both dishes were delicious! I couldn't believe how good the food was for a place I had never heard of before. The only complaint I have is that they only gave us one small container of rice, which was definitely not enough for two people. We will be ordering from Great Wall again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I order from here all the time. It's quick and they get the stuff ready fast. Just make sure you remember your total for carryout because they never take a name and ask you based on that. We haven't order a single item that hasn't been good. Their egg rolls are delicious and food tastes fresh. And it's definitely affordable. Glad to see a small business in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Ever since they updated their menu the chicken on a stick isn't as good. Was the best thing to get there, now it's disappointing. But still way better Chinese food than most places in town."}
{"text":"I'm old, so I've eaten Chinese food at hundreds of places across the U.S. Since my wife and I discovered Great Wall, we have eaten there 4X. Each time has been 5 stars. Tonight's food was spectacular - best Chinese I've eaten anywhere in the past few years. We like to mix and match, and we had the chicken and broccoli, chicken and garlic, and the beef and broccoli. We also had an order of shrimp fried rice...this was amazing! I've never seen such large shrimp in shrimp friend rice before! As for the rest, everything was fresh.   I also appreciated the \"proportionality\" of the food. For example - there is a Chinese place near where we live in Mount Horeb, WI, that I refuse to go into anymore - because when I order peppersteak, there is hardly any beef, and it's all onions. I hate it when Chinese restaurants overload you on vegetables, and cheat you on the meat. There was plenty of beef and chicken in each of the three entrees we bought. If they keep this up, we'll be eating here a lot, even if we have to drive from Mount Horeb to Fitchburg to get it."}
{"text":"Seems like this place changed owners in the last week.  Seems like they took their cook with them, because the quality dropped quite a bit. It's pretty standard now - not bad, but nothing special.  Disappointing given how good they were just a couple of weeks ago."}
{"text":"My 89 year old aunt says this place leaves the chickens hanging out, outside for some reason?! Ew I'll never eat here again. How gross. I can't believe how disgusting. I am vegan so I would never eat the chicken but that is very unsanitary of them to do such a thing. I can't imagine what else they do with the other food. How sad."}
{"text":"Best place to get food in Monongahela.  Great portions and good food.  Better than any other Chinese I have eaten anywhere.  What a nice family that owns the place as well too."}
{"text":"Menu has been expanded greatly, recently. Was so happy to find Mongolian beef as an option that didn't require ordering it in quart size. Specified it to be extra spicy, and well, we all  know I've yet to have that happen at any restaurant. Crab rangoon is amongst the best in the area still.  Food is still very good, and the delivery still takes about an hour. Prices are still quite cheap, compared to their competition."}
{"text":"If Cheers was a Chinese restaurant instead of a bar, it would be the Great Wall. Barry (the owner) and his staff go out of their way to make you feel at home each and every time you come in. My family has been going here for years, and our regular waiter, Leo, doesn't even have to give us menus anymore, just starts bringing out our dishes as soon as we sit down!  First things first, make sure you start with a wonton soup and shrimp egg roll. This is hands-down the best wonton soup in the city. It's just salty enough, hot, and filled with yummy wontons. Since the green onion scare in Pittsburgh several years ago, Barry no longer has his chefs put green onions in automatically, but you can ask for a little side dish of them (which I recommend - really adds to the flavor).  The egg rolls are huge, crispy, and full of big pieces of shrimp. Along with your appetizers, you get a bowl of crispy noodles with duck and hot mustard sauce for dipping (although if you don't like the hot mustard, Leo will bring you a double order of duck sauce instead). Oh, and you get all the hot tea you can drink, thrown in for free.  In terms of entrees, I have sampled only about three of the options here because.... they're amazing. Super amazing. So why change, right? We used to get moo goo gai pan consistently until we met the amazing chicken. (Amazing chicken is General Tso's, but using only white meat chicken.) The moo goo gai pan is awesome though, lots of water chestnuts and snap peas thrown into the mix. And it's delicious cold the next day as a leftover.  The amazing chicken is so perfectly breaded, just crispy and sweet enough, but not too heavy. And the Mongolian beef.... oh my. Oh my  my my. You can ask to have it made 'extra sweet', and I recommend that. It's so juicy and seasoned with sweet sauce and onions. (I am about five minutes away from just deciding to go here for lunch, now that I'm writing about this place.)  Oh, and even though you're going to *want* to eat everything in a single sitting, the plates are so huge that you probably won't be able to. And that's good, because everything at the Great Wall makes a terrific leftover.  I've been coming to this restaurant for more than 20 years, and as long as they're around, I'm going to keep coming back. Don't be afraid to drive out into the suburbs for this one - it will be well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is always great, and its amazing how fast they deliver. Crab Rangoon, bourbon chicken, and boneless spare ribs are always so good."}
{"text":"I love this place, though I can't get food there very often. I love the orange chicken and also the general tso's. The portions are great and the prices are good. I've had nothing but good experiences here and the family that owns the place is really nice!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for Chinese food.  We usually get take out which is always ready in 20 minutes.  It is always packed well and hot.  We did dine in and it was fantastic.  They seat you right away and the service is great.  They start you off with some great tea and a little appetizer.  They have generous helpings of food and it is always hot.  They will wrap your food for you to take home your leftovers.  They have great general t'so, hot and sour soup, and egg rolls.  The restaurant is decorated with pictures of the Great Wall and some other crazy pictures.  It is mainly done in the color of red.  They also take the entertainment card for buy one get one.    Great place for Chinese dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Just ordered the sesame chicken and Mongolian beef, and it was good.  The sauces were yummy and the veggies were crisp.  I've had terrible Chinese delivery luck in Madison, and seems like that's changing now!"}
{"text":"A typical Americanized Chinese fast food restaurant, but pretty good for what it is. The place seems very clean and the staff seemed friendly. Food was pretty good. I got a combo platter with an egg roll and fried rice. The egg roll was good and I was impressed with the fried rice. My sesame chicken wasn't my favorite but still better than at comparable restaurants. Overall seems like a good choice if you want some Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Great Wall Not So Great After All!  I went in one day to place an order to eat in. When the order was done I was called over to the counter. They made it to go instead. I yelled over that I am eating in, not taking it to go. Do you think they would have brought it over? Hell no. I had to go get my food myself. Pathetic. So I unpack all of the unnecessary crap that I should not have had to and there wasn't any silverware either. Did they respond to me asking for it? NO! I had to go get it myself. Pathetic.  To make it worse the food was only mediocre at best. I have definitely had much better. On top of that they are one of those Chinese places that are really super ultra stingy with veggies. I love my fried rice and low meins when they are packed with veggies. So many places hardly use any at all and this is one of them. So sad they can't do it right."}
{"text":"Always hot and delivery time is amazing. They went under new management about two years ago and these guys have stepped it up! Larger menus than normal and the majority of it still so good! Definitely recommend eating here and even the few times we've got delivery even the delivery boys were so nice."}
{"text":"THIS is what they mean by BAD  CHINESE!! Get ready for diarrhea, and maybe vomiting. Food is HOOORRRIBLE!!! Greasy, old food mixed to make 'new food', rude service, poor examples of recipes we americans have come to love and rely on in americanized chinese food!!  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Nothing we ordered made us make ANY 'yummy noises' or smiles or head nods...instead...wrinkled noses, trips to the toilet and bitter memories!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Great Wall for a couple years as an average place, but they're under new ownership and now I'm happy to come here more and more. The staff is so pleasant, and that can surely make or break a nice meal.   Beautiful presentation, great service, and the food did not disappoint. There is a \"light fare\" section on the menu for healthier options i.e. low oil, no MSG.   BYOB so stop at the greatest liquor store in the North Hills a couple stores down in the same plaza to complete your dining experience."}
{"text":"Stick to the basics and it's a good meal in a pinch. Egg rolls are skimpy. Not my first pick when craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend for lunch with a dining companion.  I have been here many times in the past and it is always one of my favorite sit down Chinese restaurants to eat at.  Upon entering the restaurant it has quite a distinctive Chinese feel with many different pieces of art that Americans would associate with China.  After being seated in a booth, our server came over almost immediately with a pot of hot tea and fried crispy strips with both spicy mustard and sweet and sour dipping sauces.  I always love getting them so that I have a little something to munch on while waiting for my meal.  For my entree I ended up ordering the Szechuan beef extra spicy with both fried rice and hot and sour soup.  The hot and sour soup tasted decent with the expected bit of sourness.  Whenever the server brought my entree, he also brought out some extra hot sauce for me in case the extra spicy was not hot enough.  It was a nice little touch and I would end up using some of it.  The beef ended having quite a bit of spice and was plated with a random assortment of vegetables.  It all tasted good and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal as did my dining companion.  The best part of it was that each meal was under $7.  I will definitely be coming back here again in the future. The food is always a great value for the prices and they never seem to disappoint me."}
{"text":"I was suggested to come here by my mom 2 weeks ago and we have literally been there 3 times since then. I've had the orange chicken which they made special since I can't do spicy foods, beef and broccoli which was yummy, crab rangoon which was so good, they pack lots of crab in the pocket so every bite tastes great, and teriyaki chicken which was also great as well. It's become my favorite Chinese place. My fiance loves their egg rolls and wonton soup."}
{"text":"My family has been eating at The Great Wall for many years.  It is hands-down our favorite Chinese restaurant in the North Hills.  The staff has always been friendly, accommodating, and very quick to fill orders and refills.  Even when I dined in with a large group, both the service and food were top notch.  The food has never let me down, either.  Serving sizes are easily enough for two meals, especially when you throw in the unlimited crisps served with the meal. There is also a kids menu that includes more conservative dishes.  Even my brother who dislikes most Chinese food enjoys eating there."}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery. I was given an expected time of an hour to wait, which seemed long. Food actually arrived forty-five minutes after that! After an hour fifteen, I called restaurant, who lied to me about when food would arrive. Total time for delivery: 1 hour 45 minutes.   When I pointed out this delay to the delivery driver, instead of an apology, I got a rapid-fire stream of excuses that came so fast I couldn't even understand what he was saying.   Of course, food arrived cold, so I can't really comment on taste. Presentation was nice for takeout - that's about the only good thing about the experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for dirt cheap Americanized Chinese food (no pork intestines here...) that is not too greasy this place might hit the spot.  Lunch for 3 was about $15, and each lunch came with choice of either soup or soda.  Not sure how someone can stay in business at these prices for the quantities of food provided!  Food is cooked to order so it took about 10 min for our carryout lunch to be made, which was not too bad.  Place was clean and lady at the counter was friendly.  I thought the food \"met expectations\" but my friend did not like his egg drop soup (my won ton soup was fine)."}
{"text":"I am a flight attendant so I get the chance to try Chinese delivery from all over the country, and have been disappointed in many a place, especially recently. So when I ordered from Great Wall I felt compelled to share my great experience!! I was SO impressed with their food. I'm a big fan of Singapore Rice Noodles, and these may have been the best I ever had. They made them extra spicy for me. Their orange chicken also had a yummy tang to it. And their egg rolls soooo good, as well as wonton/egg drop soup. I may order from here on every Cleveland layover. And they went the extra mile and delivered it directly to my hotel room (as delivery services rarely do). Also their lunch specials are super cheap!! Seriously, highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. They are so nice and friendly here. They also deliver if you live close which is great. Its not very expensive. They have great customer service and good food."}
{"text":"Excellent delivery service. Very fast and the order was 100% correct. Food was tasty* and the prices were reasonable.   My sesame chicken was well flavored, the crab Rangoon were awesome, and my egg roll was good.   My friend ordered the general tso's chicken, and asked for spicy. I guess the spice level wasn't quite high enough for her, but she still really enjoyed it. So for those of you who hate your tastebuds and love spice, be warned.   Husband ordered Szechuan chicken and he didn't complain, so I'll have to assume he was pleased. I liked that it looked like it came with a good assortment of veggies.   *I will say that the fried rice was over cooked and tasted a bit like dirty grill. That was the only real issue that I had. I wasn't amazed with the dumplings, but I think that's a personal preference."}
{"text":"Two words food poisoning!!!! Stay far away unless you want diarrhea and vomiting for days.   will never go back. Horrible."}
{"text":"General Tso's chicken was amazing- best I have had for chinese takeout. Fast and awesome service. Made right when you order. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This spot has really stepped up lately.  Probably order delivery 1-2 times per month and the last 4-5 times were all conistently good.  Delivery is super fast, 25-30 minutes, the food is always hot. The menu has gotten bigger as well I've been enjoying the schezuan tofu & general tso tofu a lot.   He lets you add/remove items from things and just overall much better lately than years past."}
{"text":"We dined in. Food was fast, really really good and reasonably priced. The menu had a huge selection. I had the chicken pad Thai, boyfriend had orange chicken and broccoli. it was as awesome. We were really impressed and we will be back."}
{"text":"Lived in Mon City for 8 years now and I just tried this place for the 1st time and it was really good the portions are big enough for 2. Combo lo mein is huge. Great place food is good and they're quick. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and, while it showed up promptly, I wish they had kept it. To be frank, it was not good. Not at all. First, I ordered crab Rangoon. It had the weirdest flavor-- I'm trying to put my finger on it. I think it was grated turnips. I had asked to purchase extra crispy noodles for my wonton soup and was told I couldn't, they had only one bag. That was the one for my soup. Okay. That tiny, stale little bag could also have been left behind. The fried dumplings were also....odd.  By then, I gave up. The egg Foo young went into the trash. I don't think I'll be trying this place again. The food tastes weird. If you decide to give it a go, good for you. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"My trip to Great Wall started out with a convo after derby practice where everyone was talking about how starving they were. I was hangry. And someone mentioned that they were ordering takeout from Great Wall, since it was nearby and quick, so I jumped all over that.  You can order online, which is super easy, and your order is usually done in about 10-15 minutes, which is super quick.   Now, I don't have any delusions that I'm getting authentic Chinese food here, or anything in the same galaxy as gourmet. What I am expecting is American style Chinese food, and that is what was delivered. Sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, pork with broccoli and egg rolls. The chicken was good--real chicken inside that breading, folks! The fried rice was amaze--pork fried rice was good, and the veggie fried rice was chock full of veggies, not greasy and very delicious.  The pork egg rolls are the absolute best. I could eat myself sick on those...and I may already have once or twice. The shrimp egg rolls were kind of meh. Imagine boiled shrimp and sauteed cabbage inside a fried wonton wrapper. Not super flavorful, but not bad.  And the pork and broccoli was good as well.  I'm always happy when I get an inexpensive meat dish at a restaurant, and it isn't made with garbage meat. You know the kind of meat I'm talking about--tough, gristly, dried out, of questionable origin--like maybe there's a USDA class F stamp on the package? Not the case at Great Wall.  I was really happy with my first meal here, and I've ordered a couple times since then. I recommend it for a quick, inexpensive bite."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was great.  The food was a different story.  I had their lo mein and it was heavy on the garlic and pretty oily.  My wife had the kung pao shrimp and the shrimp were small and it was heavy on celery, pretty low on shrimp.  All in all we were disappointed in the food.  The hot and sour soup was the lone bright spot for me.  It was tasty with lots of nice heat to it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered Chicken Chow Mein....which is stir fried noodles and chicken. I got chicken in a gloopy white sauce. I ordered cream cheese ragoons, and got imitation crab in them. In the description there is nothing about crab, I am allergic to fish (I don't care if it is imitation, I also hate the taste). I called the restaurant and asked them to make the correct food which they said I had to come up there. I paid for delivery. The refused to re-deliver the food because it is too far. 5 miles? too far? Why should I have to inconvenience my night and go up there when I paid for delivery? Fix it. So my husband had to take back the whole order and interrupt our night to get a refund from them. Their food looked nasty anyway. They argued what Chicken Chow Mein is....that it is chicken and vegetables. Google it. It's chicken and noodles. Horrible customer service, shouting in Chinese, do not eat here."}
