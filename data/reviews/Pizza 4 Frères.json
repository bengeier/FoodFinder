{"text":"Pizza 4 frère j'appellerais plus ça pizza 4 halo remastered. Les pizza argentées goûte la pisse. de la mousse à raser dans ma croute. Quand je manges j'ai les doigts un peu engourdis.la madame que la pizza a fait goûtait la photo. Riposte après attaque la pizza a manger les 3 serveuses on lui a donc accommodé un tel vagin. Finition pourri de l'ail dans mon anus et du basilic sur mon ailier droit. J'ai remarqué une statuette de minecraft dans le coin gauche de la graine au ptit nain assis à côté de moi."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza place in laval. Who gives you 2 large all dressed pizzas with 3 cans for 28.85?  They have amazing prices. They also have halal salami and halal chicken(for pitas etc).Their delivery service is fast and don't charge for paying debt or credit. Be sure to give them a try, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The pizza here is decent but nothing that really stands out. The crush is good the toppings a bit spare, I think I need to eat more than a 10' inch to truly know if it's better but at it stands, it's average.

You can order online which is pretty nice but it's definitely not a perfect experience as they will call you back informing you that the toppings your chose aren't available at the time you order, which happened to me. Kind of pointless and inconvenient to have such a huge menu when toppings/drink aren't there.

Price tag is good, particularly the 2 for 1 pizzas. The delivery was very fast."}
{"text":"Needed a quick fix on the way to my parents house. Slice of pizza was 2 dollars with tax included. Pizza guy was friendly. The place was clean!! Which was a pleasant surprise since all pizza by the slice joints are caked in oil and sadness. 

The pizza itself was decent, fresh and a big size."}
