{"text":"I went there for the first and last time last night. The food was ok.The service was very bad. We were a group for a b-day dinner. We brought a cake with us and They cut the cake before singing happy birthday, if that's not bad enough, they tried to charge us 2$ for each piece of cake for cutting it!?!

They tried to convince the birthday girl that her meal was the entree size rather then appetizer even after she told them about her doubts. It took the manager to convene to get her the right dish. When asked for an empty wine glass they brought a filled one and charged for it.

There was also very few choices for the vegetarian guests.

The manager was nice enough to try to fix everything by giving shots to everyone but it was far from smooth sailing all night! Good thing they have wine for Saq prices."}
{"text":"French Bistro Ambiance! Aznavour song as I am writing this post. Superb food and service. Fresh salad topped with blueberries. Sympathic!"}
{"text":"Inconsistant!

Nice place, good service and friendly staff.  Wine at SAQ price + small open charge.  Reasonably priced overall.

Nice menus, it would be great if it was predictably good or bad but it is pretty random.  I have been there more than 20 times and I would says that about 30% of the time I was quite disappointed (50% of the time It's ok, and 20% is very good).  Last time I had a veal burger (lunch special).  It was horrible!!  

So this place is a hit or miss.  I will probably go back again, it is conveniently located and suited for business lunches (assuming that the food will not suck that day)."}
{"text":"French bistro with flair. The duck foie gras tourchon was spectacular, followed by a spicy beef tartare that was both generous and downright decadent. California cab \"mustache\" was a dead on match. Nicely done - and the other diners with me had similar comments."}
{"text":"Le vin au prix de la SAQ est un sérieux plus!

Ceci étant dit, j'y suis allée avec un groupe et tout le monde a pris différents plats. Tous étaient satisfaits de leur plat. Le goût, la présentation et la grosseur des assiettes étaient parfaits. 

Je vais me pencher sur les tartares puisque c'est ce que j'ai commandé. Ils étaient succulents :)

Vraiment un resto à essayer au Centropolis avec une belle ambiance, un bon service et de bon plats!"}
{"text":"Je fréquente cet endroit depuis quelques années déjà et je ne suis jamais déçue. 

Pour un bon repas et du bon vin à prix plus que raisonnable, au pays du beurre et de la crème, on y passe toujours un bon moment. 
La carte bien rodée contient des valeurs sûres de la cuisine française qui sauront certainement vous satisfaire. 
J'opte souvent pour la table d'hôte qui propose des variations de celle-ci pour un repas complet. 
À ma dernière visite, j'ai succombé pour un duo de boudin (blanc et noir) à tomber. Mon conjoint choisi généralement la bavette, le tartare ou l'agneau qui sont toujours excellents. 
Vu la richesse des plats, nous passons rarement au dessert mais la verrine au 3 chocolats est sublime. 
L'accueil est chaleureux et le service toujours impeccable pour une soirée réussie."}
{"text":"We stayed in Laval during our recent trip to Quebec and had a chance to sample the food around several places in town. This restaurant was by far our favorite--most of the other places were no better than an Applebee's. Meh. Here, service was excellent, kind, welcoming, friendly. Spoke English to us with no attitude whatsoever, and they were kind and receptive to our poorly-accented smattering of French we attempted to speak ;) 

The food was absolutely delicious and a mix of traditional and modern bistro fare. We had a range of appetizers and main courses and sampled quite a bit of the menu--all of it very good, no complaints. We had a range of diners from ages 11-83 and all were happy and satisfied here. Highly recommend and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Average restaurant at best. Private room available.  Waiter arguing about why my friends flank steak shouldn't be cooked to his well done taste. Some free advice to all waiters, give the customer what they want, you aren't the one eating it. Pork was like rubber, couldn't cut it with the butter knife. No steak knives provided.  Service was quick and efficient. Manager shows up and states that they will make an exception and allow us to order from the regular menu but it will take very long.  What is the difference if a group of 12 order from the a la carte menu versus 3 tables of 4 order the same? Never seen a restaurant go out of their way to educate how their food should be eaten or what to order. Will not return. Over priced and tasteless food served by arrogant people."}
{"text":"First time here for me and probably my last.
Service was good but no effort to speak english to us....This to me is very important even though my french is perfect. But my guests did not speak french and unlike Steak Frites St.Paul they were more than happy to speak to us in english in a french area.
I also felt this place was a bit of a knock off of Steak Frites. 
We ordered the mussels and these were excellent. So were the fries(SF knockoff). My main meal was Dore Amandine and this was not good...very disappointed as it was totally tasteless mostly and when I did taste semething it was not good. Rice seemed uncooked but veggies were fine. 
My party had veal which seemed OK along with the steak. 

Oh well so much for Paris in Laval!!!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant ou la qualité des produits est au rendez-vous. Tout ce qui est possible d'être fait maison l'est comme les frites, la mayonnaise ainsi que le beurre et c'est très appréciable. La viande est de très bonne qualité pour avoir essayé la bavette. Le café est un vrai expresso et c'est assez rare pour être souligné. Les prix ne sont pas du tout excessifs et le service est irréprochable. J'y retournerais sans problèmes."}
