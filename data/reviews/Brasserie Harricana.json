{"text":"I have sort of adopted this spot: 1) they make a consistently excellent burger; 2) they are open at lunch, not just evenings; 3) the staff are friendly and attentive. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but the list of artisan beers is fairly impressive. Very popular weekend evenings, even early."}
{"text":"Went for some pre-dinner drinks. Great draught beer selection and reasonable prices ($4). Was warm out so ordered a refreshing bourbon lemonade. Atmosphere is nice with great decor. Has outdoor patio area. Will plan on coming back as the food people were ordering around us looked good."}
{"text":"Awesome microbrewery!  Staff is great and fantastic selection of beers.  Beer flight and fromages...superb!!"}
{"text":"I always approach a new place with zero expectations and an open mind.  This being said, I arrived at Harricana ar 18h50, well in advance of meeting a friend at 19h15. By the time he showed up, slightly late, I was tired of the chaotic din, and I still did not have a beer in hand. In fact, between my sitting down and our skipping out, over 1/2 hour had gone by, with slow service and NO potables. Rather inordinate for a bar.  To the personnel's credit, they did seem extremely busy (place as full), and the hostess had a sense of humor.  I thought about what struck me as odd, and may finally have put a finger on the crucial factor: Harricana attemps to be a \"wine bar\" or a beer theater, if you will. This means waiters in white shirts and aprons, stem glasses (best used for wine), and a crowd not apparently intent on really having a beer. The whole is pretty, but inefficient and ineffective. so they might reconsider and reposition themselves as an actual wine bar, which might better fit the crowd.  We elected to drive down to Vice&Versa where the crowd may have been less upwardly mobile, but the noise level was toned down, a little live jazz eventually started, the food was good, and the pints DID arrive, with a good selection and timely, sympathetic service."}
{"text":"Great beers, nice atmosphere, but the service could be improved. I wanted to host an event here and called the manager several times before getting a hold of him. He gave me a wishy washy answer and told me to call back later to see if he could do it. I called back, and he told me to call them a couple of hours before the event. I wanted to tell my friends where the event would be in advance, obviously, and the manager made this impossible, so we went else where."}
{"text":"As we were still adjusting to Canadian portions (back home they're about half), we almost made the mistake of ordering the steak from the family menu for one person. Luckily the waitress was kind enough to point out it was meant to be shared and suggested we take two sides with it. We went for the carrots and the fries. The meat was lovely and tender, with a great taste. The carrots still had some bite left to them, so you weren't just eating mush. And the fries were also very well seasoned. They have some (to my mind) hipster soda's, like lime and cucumber. As I enjoy trying something new, I went for this and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there on Friday. It was pretty good! The design of the restaurant is beautiful. My bud ordered the selection of 4 different beers, along with a burger with monk fish. I had a couple of drinks myself and a burger too. The beers are really good. You can taste their quality. The only reason that I wouldn't give it a 5 star review is that it was so busy that we had to wait a while until we got our bill after having asked. Really good experience though!"}
{"text":"I been here twice and I loved it each time. This place has a nice laid back charming brasserie vibe. It has long big bar and retro style chairs for seating. It's a great place to get drinks and snacks or even a complete meal. The prices are very reasonable and they have a huge repertoire of beers.  My personal favourite dish on the menu was their spaghetti. It was simple and comforting with a homemade sauce that tasted like it was simmering all day."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The atmosphere, the service, the insightful staff, the delicious beer and the FOOD!  I ordered a burger and it was perfection --cooked perfectly, moist, flavorful, and was a decent portion (not massive like we have here in the U.S.).  I honestly still think about that burger to this day, 2 months after I inhaled it.  Highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area; one way or another, you will not be in for a letdown."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the prices are more than reasonable.   My friend had the oysters and I got the poutine bun. We were both satisfied with our plates."}
{"text":"Bon choix de bière. Menu traditionnel québécois. Salade de chou frisé un peu décevant."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers. For $4 each, what's there to complain ? They also have a few delicious cider options if you're not into beer.     As for the food selection, I tried their lobster roll and fries, which are both delicious. They also have a lunch buffet which includes appetizer, main, dessert and a beer for $17 + tax.     For the atmosphere (which is absolutely gorgeous) and price, I honestly wish Brasserie Harricana was closer to my place. It's an awesome place for 5 a 7 or just to grab a drink with some friends."}
{"text":"We went there not knowing what to expect. I'm sure that we heard about it but not sure. Excellent old school leather pub chairs.  Huge beer selection, something for everyone.  We had the cheese plate that comes paired with their old house brewed beer. Its our new place to go. @sundaypubbrs"}
{"text":"What do you get when you mix old tavern furniture in a wide high ceiling loft right in the middle of a low key industrial part of Montreal, not too too far from the Marché Jean-Talon?  Brasserie Harricana.   This newly opened old world tavern has new flair, attentive and great service along with  an impressive line up of world, domestic and hard to find beers on tap and in its Well stocked \"cold room\".  The place gets humming for lunch where they feature an efficient business buffet for $17 usually two hot items, vegetables, salad and beer!  The hustle and bustle starts after work at 5pm where people come in for drinks and comfort food.  A definite welcome addition to this up and coming neighbourhood.   The menu is varied and is set up family style, for example, you can order a beer battered whole chicken with several sides and more beer for the table, to share and enjoy.  Today, we stopped in for a quick meeting and we had Steph's Fattoushi salad with chicken, which was out of this world.  Chunks of shredded chicken breast, romaine, mixed leafs, cabbage, carrots, arugula, feta, baked pita chips and many other vegetables I forgot about as the list is too long to be able to recall them from our tastebuds, amazing flavour!  The burger with fried oysters was also huge and satisfying, comes with house made fries with plenty of skin left on them and mayo (very local way to eat fries with mayo rather than just ketchup).  The coleslaw is traditional and citrus vinegar, healthy and light amongst all this indulgence lol  A gimmick for the table was a poutine bun; really? For $5 you can have a laugh as it is fries, cheese curds  and gravy in a hot dog bun.  From the menu description, I thought it was something elaborate: say like binded and flattened fries, cheese and gravy baked like meat loaf and cut up like banana bread but... Wishful thinking..:all it was, was a poutine in a hot dog bun served in a cardboard container like at the ball park! Funny. Yeah. For that first minute as it arrives to the table lol"}
{"text":"Went to Harricana on jean talón. Great place with nice vibe. Staff was kind. I had the best bitter, red hop bomb and the cid rose. The best was the cid rose. It was great. We also ordered a club sandwich with fries and the frittata. Everything was great except that the fritta was too too hot and it had huge  pieces of salt. Other than that it was treat and I recommend others coming back. I'll definitely return despite the frittata demasiado caliente! Ouh too hot for my tongue papi They also have a terrace outside and you can sit and eat out side. To have a drink it's okay but to eat in can be a bit messy. They also have some small tasters for 3 dollars  I you want to try different beers."}
{"text":"Avant-dernier arrêt du Passeport en fût et comme nous n'avons pas été déçus! Des 12 microbrasseries, c'est celle qui s'est démarquée le plus avec son immense choix de bières maison. Nous y sommes allés alors qu'ils fêtaient leur 2e anniversaire alors nous avons eu droit de choisir parmi toute leur sélection, ce qui a fait changement avec d'autres endroits où le choix était très restreint et peu diversifié. Nous avons goûté 3 bières chacun, toutes plus différentes les unes que les autres. Les serveurs nous ont vraiment bien renseigné sur les différentes bières et nous avons été charmés. Nous avons aussi pris un club sandwich à deux qui était excellent, les frites aussi d'ailleurs! L'ambiance est un peu plus chic que dans une microbrasserie habituelle sans pour autant que le personnel ne se prenne trop au sérieux. J'adore! Coup de coeur pour le papier peint dans les toilettes et pour les chaises basses au bar! Sympathique endroit, je recommande!"}
{"text":"Je ne peux pas commenter sur la bouffe n'ayant pas mangé mais je peux dire qu'il s'agit d'un bon spot pour aller boire de la bière ou du cidre. L'ambiance est bonne, le design intérieur est bien réalisé: mélangent de matériaux, éclairage, disposition du bar et des tables. Le bar est long et large avec des sièges confo et nous donne envie d'y rester longtemps. Il n'y a pas de place dispo? Pas de problème, donnez votre nom, allez dans les estrades boire un peu en attendant qu'une place se libère. Service chaleureux. Pour ceux qui aiment le cidre, plusieurs choix s'offrent à vous, notamment un cidre de miel. Une place à essayer entre amis ou entre amoureux!"}
{"text":"I went to Harricana for the first time last night. I was looking forward to trying it out since I'm always very happy to see new spots open in the neighbourhood.  All in all it was a good experience - the place looks really nice, the staff is friendly and the food was good. My biggest issue revolves around the beer. First, I find it interesting that a brasserie would only serve beer in 8oz format. When I go for beer, I like to at least have the option to order a pint. Also, the beer is very expensive. I'm generally all for higher prices since it's locally brewed and very tasty, but $4 for less than half a pint is frankly a bit much. I can't think of anywhere that charges $10 a pint (that's what the math adds up to for the equivalent of a pint at Harricana), especially a local neighbourhood pub.   I'll happily come back if they solve this issue and offer a more decent format at a more decent price since my overall experience was really good."}
{"text":"C'est un très bel endroit situé à l'entrée du quartier de la petite Italie!  C'est bondé tous les soirs et à toutes les heures... Pour ma part il s'agit d'un endroit fancy un peu trop bruyant et beaucoup trop cher pour les mets qui sont servis! Le service est appliqué mais beaucoup trop de musique empêche de profiter de la chaleur du lieu, pourtant très accueillant!"}
{"text":"Super endroit! C'est beau, c'est calme, c'est grand. La choix de bière laisse parfois à désirer mais il est changeant. Bière en format dégustation seulement. Le buffet du midi, en semaine, vaut vraiment le détour!"}
{"text":"Wowwww pleins de bières en fût à 4$ :o On aime ça :) Belle place, l'ambiance est super sympa. L'hôtesse, qui est aussi propriétaire, qui nous a acceuilli était très aimable ainsi que les barmans. Attendez-vous à payer 25$ et plus pour bien manger :) J'ai mangé des frites et une guenille au homard...Super :)   Je vous recommande cette place...!"}
{"text":"Bel endroit, spacieux et agréable, bon service Par contre, au niveau du brunch, le menu n'est pas très varié, il y a seulement 4-5 choix, tous autour de 14$, ce qui n'est pas donné pour une crêpe, une omelette ou du pain doré J'ai pris le sandwich déjeuner, qui vient dans un pain burger (surprise!) avec un genre de galettes de pommes de terre en accompagnement ultra grasses!! eurk, ça m'a un peu levé le coeur.. Sinon, le jus du jour était: betterave, pomme, carotte et gingembre... très fort en betterave je dirai, mais quand même bon.. Bref, j'essaierai en mode dîner ou souper pour voir si c'est différent..."}
{"text":"Beau menu mixte végétarien et viandes. Le vendredi midi un buffet à volonté végé et viande pour moins de 20$ incluant une demi-bière. Le personnel est très sympatique. La place est vaste et bien organisé pour les solo, duo et groupes. La clientèle est mixte de 25 à 70 ans. Une belle place pour dîner."}
{"text":"This is the best brewery that I have been to in Montreal so far! Definitely recommend coming here based on beer, food, atmosphere, and service.  My husband and I sampled a variety of beers, with our favourites being the imperial stout, cognac sour, and a belgian beer with brett. The only one I wasn't that fond of was a smoked banana beer which was much more smoky than banana.  We split the Plateau for two which came with a selection of the restaurant's delicious appetizers, including fairly large pieces of fried sturgeon, celery sticks filled with a whipped blue cheese and topped with spiced nuts, and deviled eggs. Many items were house made/local and, based on how tasty everything was, I am sure the rest of the menu follows suit. I thought the platter wouldn't be enough for dinner but, combined with the beer, we left very sated.   The place had a classy but relaxed vibe and was quite packed on a Thursday night. We sat at the bar and were continuously attended to by the many servers working the bar. I will definitely be back and encourage you to check it out!"}
{"text":"So yes, I finally tried this just-around-the-corner place! (\"About time!\", I hear you say!) I am one of those lucky person that has a birthday right after the new year, so finding a place to eat is never easy! But luckily for me, the Brasserie Harricana seems to never close! The decor and the atmosphere are both warm and welcoming. The place can get very busy and therefore quite loud but on the plus side, they kept the music onto a bearable volume so that no one has to shout in order to be heard. We tried a few beers - they were okay - mainly, they are good beers if you want a beer with a twist (smoked, infused, etc.), the basic ones can be a bit pale. Buuuuuuut... we also ate! And there I have to say, it was delicious! We had the lamb shank and the classic burger. Everything was really good, even down to the home-made coleslaw and the mashed potatoes (and the fries, and the green beans and... everything I tell you, everything!) A nice experience! I will surely again walk around the corner to this place!"}
{"text":"Où boire des bonnes bières complètement inconnues ?! Clairement, c'est ici !!  Une très belle place, ouverte, lumineuse, agréable. Les bières sont vraiment au top, et la serveuse s'y connait, ses descriptions sont exactes. Coté cuisine, la guédille de homard avec salade césar été super !   Certain que j'y retournerai si je repasse dans le coin !!"}
{"text":"Harricana has a pretty good selection of nice beers and ciders.  They have plenty of seating inside, and some cool wooden bleachers along the sidewalk outside.  There was a group of about 10 of us and the bartender was more than willing to answer any questions we had about the beer list and about what types of beers they had.  We had a couple rounds and moved onto the next place, but we were happy to get our evening started here."}
{"text":"dropped by for a drink with my fiance and we spent a lovely evening in this fine new establishment! kudos to the managers of this establishment - feels like a great addition to the area. wishing it great success. had a lovely rib eye steak and fries - Simply spot on! place also runs as a micro brewery with delicious assortment of local beers. would definitely return and highly recommend to all"}
{"text":"Great beer chicken, amazing string beans, delicious steak, super French fries, very good and friendly service. The waitress was having a hard time cutting up the chicken, so she went to get the chef who very much enjoyed cutting it up for us and entertaining us at the same time. The decor is modern, classic and comfortable with a split level concept. The warmth of wood in contrast with the coolness of the white painted brick gives it an interesting flare that stands out for most other Montreal restaurants."}
{"text":"Je suis passée près de la brasserie Harricana en me baladant près de De Castelnau, je trouvais que ça avait l'air d'une jolie place. Puis après un bon resto, j'ai checké sur Yelp pour trouver un bar près de là où je me trouvais.  Le Harricana était dans la liste, c'était une belle opportunité de découvrir cette place. Nous y voilà avec mon homme pour boire une bonne bière. On choisi une première bière dans la liste des bières brassées par la maison. Je me lance sur la bière au miel, et je suis ravie de mon choix ! Elle est vraiment à mon goût ! Mon ami prend une IPA, il est vraiment très satisfait également ! Notre serveuse est hyper sympa et sait de quoi elle parle. Le bar est juste un peu bruyant à notre arrivée (vers 20h30) mais l'est beaucoup moins vers 22h, ce qui le rend encore plus agréable ! Un vrai endroit chouette où je suis certaine qu'il y fait bon l'hiver par -30°C !"}
{"text":"Possibly the best restaurant I have ever visited.  The atmosphere is relaxing yet energetic; the staff, attractive, engaging & knolwedgeable.    The beer I had (Best Bitter), accompanied the lamb brilliantly.  It's refreshing to visit a microbrewery skilled in its craft, especially as the lamb was braised in beer...phenomenal flavor!  I cannot say enough good things about Brasserie Harricana.  :)"}
{"text":"Just wanted to update this quickly because I've been drawn back to this lovely, comfortable, cool, friendly bar like 3 times this week and the beer menu has been updated with some personal favourites, and even better: they launched a full food menu! Great big Caesar salad to share between two people for like $14. Amazing. Whole roast chicken, sharing sampling plate with oysters and pickles and homemade chips, all kinds of filling and affordable edibles. I am so so so happy this place is so comfortable and smart and making a fun little strip up here on Jean Talon."}
{"text":"Tres bien comme brasserie! Nous y sommes allés un jeudi et c'était bondé de monde! On a du attendre pendant 45 minutes pour avoir de la place, je suggère donc une réservation :)! La bière est bonne, nous avions les plateaux de dégustation! Je vous suggère celle au coco ! Délicieuse et originale !   Nous avons aussi séparé des entrées à deux! La bouffe est bonne, mais je trouve les plats dispendieux pour ce qu'on sert!   En gros, l'endroit est bien, les serveurs super sympathiques et la bières vaut le détour !"}
{"text":"Awesome brasserie that is just W of Jean Talon Market in an area I'd have no clue was there if not for this Yelp Elite event! Seriously...in Montreal there are many places that are tucked away, non descript and easily missed if not knowing where to go. You either need some local knowledge or a very good search engine to figure this place out!   Harricana has a homey clean and modern feel to it. A place where  beer lovers can get comfortable and indulge in some serious beer drinking, sampling food and deep conversation. The draft taps on the bar describe that this place is not to be messed with because of the wide selection and choice of beers.   We had the opportunity to sample two kinds of beer :   1) the brune de Labrador - very rich malty flavour but smooth  2) a blonde beer that was more hoppy and slightly more bitter (forgot the name)  With the beer we sampled a poutine in a small bowl that was a bit soggy but was made with a beer sauce also (go figure). So it was slightly bitter as well but very good none the less.  I don't mind sampling beer in smaller glasses and it reminds me back to drinking beer in the south of Spain at tapas bars n Sevilla where you would be using a very small glass. It's actually better in a smaller glass as the beer will stay fresher!   Overall with only a small sampling and the fact that this establishment has much more beer to discover definite warrants another visit with some other beer appreciative people."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to go for a beer night out. Great food menu which is also vegetarian friendly. Had the fattoush salad - amazing. Will definitely be back even though I'm not a beer fan."}
{"text":"La bouffe est un peu chère pour ce que c'est, mais on s'en fout, on y va pour la bière. Il y a toujours un vaste choix de bonnes bières locales à prix raisonnable. La musique est juste un peu trop forte."}
{"text":"After so many excited reviews from notorious yelpers I had to try Harricana myself. The pub is worth the trip to a foreign neighbourhood. The list of beers is not huge, but carefully selected. I managed to try four as they offer a tasting size of the glass. Their own Hefeweizen brew is delicious and fesh. My friend was excited to see also Beau's beers presented in the list among the brews of some strong local Quebec producers. I would agree that having only a glass format of the beer is a little bit disapointing, pint and half a pint are indeed my preferred options after I have identified my favourite brew for the night, thus the price of the reciprocal glasses may look a little bit steep. On the other hand you get to try more beers and sip your choice with appreciation, finally the different pubs have the right to be diverse and unique. The food menu is definitely interesting including nice options for salad lovers and alternatively the poutine bun may be selected as a non healthy meal. The personnel is extremely polite and attentive. The chairs and bar seats are comfy, inviting to stay longer. What was not completely to my liking was the noise level, the decibels of the sound system went above my tolerance level after 9:30pm and we kind of got tired of shouting at each other. I would be definitely back if I'm strolling in the area and in need of a glass of fresh brew. Nice addition to the extremely colourful brew pub scene in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Very nice resto/bar in an area that apparently is part of Little Italy, so now I know!  I found the wide selection of beers interesting, though I'm not really a drinker, it's always nice to have interesting options.  Bonus points for serving Scotch Ale, my favourite style, one which I find rather hard to come by in this city.  I came by on the evening of the 2015 Canadian Federal Election around 11:30 PM, the place wasn't packed, there were a few others like me catching the post-election results and analysis on the big screen (projector, literally a big screen ;) ).  The atmosphere was very nice, and not too loud.  The service was very attentive, and the wait staff were eager to help me decide on some good eats.  Bonus points for the kitchen being open for food until 2 AM! Bonus points too for the comfortable upholstered chairs!  As others have mentioned, you can write on the walls of the restrooms.  They're wallpapered with text balloons that you can fill in.  I found it quite endearing.  All in all, a very pleasant experience, but bear in mind this was a quiet night."}
{"text":"As always when you hear so many people saying such great things about a place, especially people you know and trust, you have high expectations.   And I was not disappointed. Well. Maybe juuuuust a little bit.   First surprise, and I could have seen that in other reviews : no pints.  Ok that's surprising but not such a big deal, you get a decent fancy glass for 4$.  10$ would buy you an interesting \"tasting menu\" of three of their own cask beers with a little treat to eat with. I guess they have different treats and casks through the season.   Honest selection of beers, all locals, and interesting menu.   Sometimes the best thing are the simple ones, so trust me and try their fries with homemade mayonnaise. They are just amazing. I could eat two plates by myself.   Really good and friendly service too, cosy atmosphère, overall a really good place.   I would definitely go back if I'm around. And maybe try some of their other food next time."}
{"text":"I only came for drinks on a Friday afternoon and they were all amazing, the beer and cider selection is great and the cocktails are perfection."}
{"text":"Went here for after work beers today; dope selection, great service, and amazing servicd"}
{"text":"This is an awesome brewery/restaurant. 5 of us enjoyed 5 different flights and the waitress was more than helpful with our bad french and multiple orders. She suggested some different beers from the list based on what we were looking for. She also suggested a few appetizers to compliment the beer. The jerky was delicious!!!!!   But the beer! There are some fun, creatvive ones: aged in chianti barrels, aged in tequila barrels and so on. Very cool stuff!"}
{"text":"Spacieux avec de multiples espaces permettant d'avoir un peu d'intimité ou être dans la foule. Ça me fait pensé à un Billy Kun plus grand.  La carte est intéressante avec un menu de bar plutôt distingué et de haute qualité. Le prix est un peu dispendieux.  Niveau carte de bières, c'est une très bonne place avec une carte changeante et des bières vraiment bonne lorsque j'y suis allé j'ai pris la Gose de LTM, une Scotch ale de l'Hermite. une Pilsner ambrée de Mabrasserie et quelques autres bières intéressante. Bon endroit pour les lunchs du midi, ou les groupes ou simplement une bière ou deux après l'ouvrage."}
{"text":"Harricana is awesome and if I lived in the area I would be there all the time.  The owners have done a great job with decorating the joint and it has a nice intimate feel to it.  My only complaint was that the noise level was too high for my liking.  Apart from that I had a great experience here and would jump at the opportunity to come back.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable.  Just a heads up though that they don't do pints.  You still get a decent-sized glass and if you're interested they have a tasting menu that allows you to try three different beers for $10.  They also have a honey cider worth trying if you're a cider fan.  They also serve an hors d'oeuvre for each beer that you taste if you get this option.  The only other food that I tried were the fries but they were amazing.  They season them with salt and sugar and serve them with a homemade mayo.  That makes for a dangerously addictive combination!  It certainly makes me want to try the other items on the menu to see if they're as good or better."}
{"text":"Imagine that your sport fishing grandfather bought a loft space in the city, and invited you over for esoteric draft beers.  That's the vibe I got when I entered this chic brew space on a Friday around 5 pm.  Soft hues and warm tones draw you into this hip yet comforting space.  Mounted fish taxidermy and retro lounge chairs are a creative juxtaposition against the cool, minimalist lines.  The beer and cheese plate perfectly pairs unique and unusual beers with their cheese soulmates.  A tad on the pricey side, but you gotta pay for the staff and the space as well.  The lobster roll was not great -- all you really need is lobster and mayonnaise.  No need to mess with that winning flavor combo.  I dig trying new things, but this lobster roll was over-adorned with non-essential herbs of some sort, which masked the natural perfection of the lobster flavor.  Also, the kale salad should be called, \"romaine salad, with a little kale\".  But alas, this is a four star review.  Great space, very friendly service, off-the-beaten-path beer choices, and good (but not amazing) food are the strengths of this fine establishment that will definitely see this customer again."}
{"text":"Très bel endroit, parfait pour les groupes de 20 et plus mais aussi pour les sorties à 4 !! Le tofu frit est un incontournable ainsi que les salades! Je suis du type cocktail et je n'ai pas été déçu!!"}
{"text":"Bonne brasserie de quartier ! le choix de bières (servies au verre) est important, et la cuisine est savoureuse pour un prix raisonnable."}
{"text":"Un de meilleurs endroit en ville pour boire avec de la bonne compagnie. Les cidres en fût sont léger et pétillant et se rapprochent d'un bon champagne.  Les accompagnements sont frais et santé, cuisinés sur place sous vos yeux.  Le choix de bière en pression brassés sur place est impressionnant. Vous en aurez pour tous les goûts et tout est orienté dégustation. Il y a 3 tailles de verre pour chaque bière : pinte, demi ou quart.  Le service est EXCELLENT. Rien à dire c'est irréprochable. L'ambiance sonore est parfaite ainsi que l'éclairage. Les chaises sont ultra confo.  Je recommande absolument."}
{"text":"The terrasse is now finally OPEN! I sat out here last night and had a lovely chill time on their very cool bleachers. The only down side? It was hard to see the tv showing the playoffs from there, but whatever: it's still an awesome option and the service is still fantastic."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood needed a good hang, and I went into the brasserie with no expectations, and ended up spending most of my day there.  I shared the steak with a friend, and it was the best steak I have had in a very long time, I've been craving it ever since!  Great beer selection and cocktails, good prices and good, attentive service!"}
{"text":"I popped into Harricana for a night cap a few weeks ago and was really impressed. At first look I was a little worried that I was under-dressed for this really tastefully designed, dimly-lit urban pub, but after further inspection I realized that everyone else in the bar looked like they were taking it as easy as I was. The rest of the experience followed suit as great- the house brews et al. were all wonderful and the service killed. I'm looking forward to going back and trying the food menu.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, it's quite affordable as well.  By-the-by, as a queer-kudos to the establishment at large, the multiple private gender-neutral bathrooms are a really nice touch. A restaurant design approach to be emulated, folks."}
{"text":"HOUSE FRIES: SO GOOD! Seriously! They're seasoned, so I guess if you're a fry purist (I don't know if those exist but it seems like they would..?) you may not like these. But the seasoning is so good! It's not super spicy but obviously there are spices in the seasoning but there's also something sweet about the seasoning too, but not too sweet. Like you might not even notice the sweet really. This is one of those times I wish I was one of those superhumans that can taste something and tell you the name of every ingredient contributing to the flavour. And they're so well fried! Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. (I'm literally drooling as I write this) Note: They will give you ketchup if you don't eat mayo. And they're not annoyed about you eating ketchup with the fries either, so that's cool. I think these are $7-$8CAD, but you get a HUGE plate of them. Definitely worth sharing.  BEETS&SPINACH: This is a GREAT side! It's sauteed beets and spinach with some salt, I think also olive oil. But the balance of savory sweet is so nice and the spinach is perfectly cooked and not mushy.  All the sides are about $7-8CAD. You don't get as much as you do with the fries, but this is really good.  COFFEE: I've only ever had the regular coffee here, which is your standard filtered coffee. Definitely not bad but my mind was not blown. I think about $2-3CAD.  BEER: There's a huge selection of beers on tap here, which is cool. And you can see the brewery in the back behind the bathrooms which is also cool. Speaking of bathrooms, THESE BATHROOMS ARE SO NICE!! There's about 4-5 individual bathrooms that are kept very clean.  THE PLACE: This place is super nice inside. During the day, it feels very open but not too bright. And at night, it feels very cozy but not too dark. It's juuuust right. The decor is cool too. There are these wooden beams that go through the whole place which make the place feel super long, and there's obscure artwork on the ceiling above them. The staff there is really great and helpful and always happy to answer any menu questions you may have. They speak both French and English too, which is nice for French beginners like myself."}
{"text":"Oh Brasserie Harricana,  I want to like you; I want to understand you. I had so much hope.   The beer scene in Quebec can be a touch myopic, and tends to be a bit behind the beer scene in the rest of Canada and the States. Brasserie Hurricana has made a couple of choices that are decidedly internationally oriented.   First of all Basserie Harricana participates in the Mikkeller Beer Run. Mikkeller is a prolific Danish \"gypsy\" brewery that makes an extremely wide array of beer in collaboration with other micro breweries. They particularly tend toward doing many variations on the same beer. Paying attention to the international beer scene and participating in this way is definitely a point in Harricana's favour.   Of greater note is the fact that Harricana has a very fancy beer system known as a Flux Capacitor. This system allows the beer lines to be micromanaged individually, and is present at only at a handful of places including the excellent Torst in Brooklyn.   In the space between the potential of the flux capacitor, and the reality of its use, is where we find disappointment.   Brasserie Hurricane has 40+ beer lines, at least when we visited they were only using 9. All 9 beers were house beers and the two we tried were disappointing.  For now Brasserie Harricana is a bit of a disappointment.   There is one brewery in the country that has really succeeded, in terms of its beer, as a brewpub, Central City in Surrey BC. I hope in the future Harricana decides to stop trying to be everything to everyone, fill the lines with beer from other breweries and focus on making 1-3 of their own."}
