{"text":"I came here for a Sunday brunch in a large group of about 10. We had made a reservation, however, had a few extra people join us last minute who were easily accommodated for by the restaurant staff. The waitress was very helpful and attentive. 
I had a bloody mary which tasted for like tomato juice. I had the carbonara frittata (which I've never had before) that was pretty good but I didn't necessarily love it. Others had the omelette of the day, tiger shrimp and polenta, crab cake benedict, and blueberry lemon ricotta pancake.  The big winner that everyone loved was the tiger shrimp polenta and ricotta pancake. 
One person had the breakfast pizza and she did not like it at all. 
It was a nice way to wind down from the weekend, would come back here again."}
{"text":"Unique menu, creative combinations which sound kinda weird but actually tastes really good. 
I like every things I have ordered , blueberry sausage , Waffle with eggs bacon and syrup. Carbonara frittata."}
{"text":"Delightful!    Fun, funky, colorful spot - yes - \"next door\" to Dante's in Tremont.   Had a tasty Friday lunch.  Dining room is lively with color and interesting art.   Not crowded at all, but I suspect that will come.

Try the Bianco Pizza ... very good.   Eggplant parmesan was very toothsome.   Complimentary birthday slice of Nutella pie was to die for - rich, decadent and delicious.    So nice of our waitress Sarah to provide that \"on the house.\"

I'll be back ..."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! I had no problems seating a party of 6 and the staff is very efficient and friendly. The waffle was sooo good!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch not too long ago. Was very happy with the food, the service and the d√©cor. I would recommend to friends and family for a nice quick lunch."}
{"text":"The staff is personable and extremely friendly. Have never had a bad meal. From the pizzas to the shrimp and grits. I recommend you get a few things and share. Outstanding edition to the Dante Family!"}
{"text":"I went for Sunday Brunch with my family to celebrate my sister's one year anniversary. We all enjoy our drinks and meals. I had the Everything Bagel and Lox pizza. It was absolutely amazing! I will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"I'm not kidding - this place is amazing.  I ordered the lox pizza and they smoke the salmon there.  It was everything I could have hoped!  My date had the steak and eggs, and he said it was the BEST HE'S EVER HAD.  EVER.
The service was great and the fact that we had brunch on a Monday was perfect.  This is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here today with work friends.  The food and service were perfect, exactly what we needed for our break from downtown and birthday celebration.  Nice selection of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of Chef and his food.  We've enjoyed his Akron location (DBA) a number of times and couldn't wait to try Dante Next Door as soon as we could.  Today was that day and I can't wait to get back as soon as possible!   The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with.  We split the Gnocchetti alla Bolognese and also the Next Door Pizza.  Exactly what I would have expected based on my DBA experiences!  Both items were unbelievable!  My wife insists the pizza was the best she's ever had - and she was comparing it to our experiences in Trastevere (Rome) and their wood fired ovens.  How can you argue with lobster, arugula and truffle?  The Gnocchetti was wonderful, too!  Chef Bocuzzi is a master at his craft!  If you're from Cleveland or Northeast Ohio - you HAVE to get here!  If you're visiting - welcome! - and do yourself a favor, get to one (or all) of Dante's locations.  You can't go wrong!  Can't wait to try Ginko next!"}
{"text":"Paradiso (Lobster pizza), Maple Syrup Black Pepper Bacon, an \"On the Rise\" ...AWESOMELY DELICIOUS!!! Melissa at the bar - always kind, attentive and knowledgeable of specials and menu items...

Best brunch in Tremont!!"}
{"text":"Go for brunch on Sunday. So great for a group. You need to get the crab cake Benedict! So yummy. We left happy and full."}
{"text":"I had heard great reviews from some friends that went to the soft opening and had brunch, so I recommended it for a girls brunch. Any time a new restaurant in Cleveland or opens I usually wait a month or two before going to get what I think will be \"the best experience\". My friends and I went about a month into opening and we were the only people in the restaurant for the first half hour we were there, it was Saturday at 11:30am. 

I ordered the pizza of the day (Shrimp & Arugala). The flavor was good but nothing about the pizza stood out to me that would be different from other places with wood fire grills. The service was okay but I thought it could have been better for being so empty while we were there.

**I have since been back and found the food much more flavorful!"}
{"text":"The best service that I have ever received in any restaurant in Cleveland. The food was great too and I left the restaurant happy. It was my second visit today, and I had a very good experience both times. I keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Oh my god how spectacular. So good we almost decapitated the waiter for trying to remove our plates before we'd licked them clean. Had the steak and eggs - the sauce on the eggs was like a hollandaise which I loathe but easy to scape off - and the omelette of the day with a side of the blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes and everything was outstanding. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the service overall was really slow - still waiting for the syrup and we've already left! Anyway, the food was delicious and we'll definitely come back! We'll bring out own syrup and ketchup next time so there's no room for error."}
{"text":"The menu has great selection for everybody from 86 years old to 6 years old!!!! The waffles were delicious. The baked basket was so yummy, we ended up taking them home."}
{"text":"Gotta give it 5 stars...well deserved... Nice to see brunch given proper respect in terms of decor and service and not some slapdash treatment. First off they open at 10:30am on Sunday but they don't start serving alcohol until 11am... Zoinks.  The food... Incredible. My crab cake Benedict was delicious with a capital D.  Side of maple glazed bacon...yum.  The carbonara frittata is same pasta as next door at Dante which is amazing.  Roti potatoes are fab. Tiger Shrimp and polenta was rich and tasty.  Cocktails hit the spot.  Service was every bit as good as Dante.  Fantastic Brunch experience.  My eat and drink before tax and tip?  $34."}
{"text":"great breakfast and brunch.. Atmosphere nice.. great service and very clean but menu a bit pricey but def a must try.."}
{"text":"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Dante. The food, ambiance and service were impeccable. I also want to add that I had major surgery (total knee replacement) 2 weeks before going to dinner there and everyone was so nice to me.  Making sure I was comfortable and taken care of was a priority to them, It meant a lot to me.  Even the valet service was great. I can't wait to go back!  Thank you all for your kindness."}
{"text":"I would eat brunch here every weekend if it were a perfect world!

Next Door's service is on point and they'll go out of their way to make sure you're comfortable. Their espresso is perfect, the cocktail list is well rounded (yay daytime drinking!), and their omelettes are the best I've ever had. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. 

Also... NUTELLA PIE!"}
{"text":"Between the atmosphere and the food, I almost wish I lived in the neighborhood to be able to go whenever I wanted! Duck fat potatoes were beyond fantastic and the pasta carbinara frittata was one of the best hangover remedies ever, ha. It definitely helps that 90s hits were playing the entire time, and that the cocktails were strong and delicious."}
{"text":"I was here in between the holidays before the new year for brunch with friends and I must say that I felt at home between the atmosphere, the staff waiting on us and the food was pieces of heaven on a plate as they came out.  The Crab Cakes Benedict that one of my friends had looked amazing while I was completely mesmerized by my own entree which consisted off Cinnamon Bread French Toast and Maple Syrup Black Pepper Bacon!!!   Which was also paired quite well with my Peach Mimosa!!!

Now I like to dabble in the kitchen and I've played around trying to recreate that memorable meal but nothing says love like the first time that you experience that type of flavor bomb so not only will I be back but I hope to bring more friends to experience what Dante's Next Door has to offer!!!"}
{"text":"Just ok. For a $90 brunch for 2 i expected to have my sock knocked off, but socks remained firmly on.  I guess this is the kind of place that survives on its reputation. It was packed. Our wait staff changed about 3 times over the course of the 90 minute visit. They took the time to point out with much excitement that Dante himself was in fact in the building. The Bloody Mary was fantastic. The French toast was tough, and just underwhelming. The potatoes were overdone and under seasoned. One of those meals where I wish I had just eaten breakfast at home."}
{"text":"We love Dante and love that there's an option for lunch and brunch. Dante continues to excel at pasta, bringing to the table the best lasagna bolognese I've ever tried. That includes those I had in Bologna. Italy. His pizzas are top notch - I heartily recommend anything with a tomato sauce, it's fantastic. Also the Bianco, with the drizzle of truffle-infused honey is a lovely starter. (Yes, pizza is a 'starter' for us, ha) The burger lives up to his high standards for quality was super juicy and served on a Parker House roll.
DO NOT MISS THE NUTELLA PIE. I will say it again, do not miss the nutella pie. It's lovely. I think I'll be dreaming of it.
The space carries through his design aesthetic from Dante but keeps it casual and unintimidating. The bar seating at the pizza oven is a great spot to dine.
Love having an excuse to visit one of Dante's fine establishments on a Sunday morning...like we needed one!"}
{"text":"Great lunch option in Tremont but certainly not the quickest! I was patiently waiting for DND to open because I'm getting bored with my lunch options. This is a wonderful addition & I'll be back. I definitely recommend a patio seat, if available. They gave us this cool little your of the kitchen & chefs table (which convinced me to reserve if for a friends 30th birthday). 

For lunch I ordered a blanco pizza & it was amazing. I never thought goat cheese, honey, pistachios & onion could be so delicious, but it was. The only problem was the bread was SO good I filed up on bread & had to take my pizza home. (Yea, tough, huh?!) 

Service was good & pretty fast. Nice ambience, decent prices for tremont & a must add to your list."}
{"text":"Dante quality food at half the price in a casual environment = Brunch heaven. That and the four different kinds of Bloody Marys on the menu! My friend and I split the crab cakes \"Benedict\" (sans ham) and the bagels and lox pizza. These combos of dinner and breakfast items (bagels and bennies with pizza and crab cakes), were so good! The crab cakes killed it; so much so that I ordered an additional one to go! The hollandaise sauce was perfect, the portions spot on, and the crab cakes were more crab than filling--always good news. We also ordered the potato tart which ate like a hash brown pie, crunchy on the top and bottom and full of cross hatched hash brownie goodness in the center. Since it was my birthday, I scored a free dessert that I don't know the name of but will be back to find out (and eat) more of! Way to go Dante. What a great way to rep brunch."}
{"text":"Have been here twice before and always enjoyed the food and service.  Today was a different story however by a long shot.  Having a late lunch I called in advance to find out what time they served until.  Being glad to find out they serve until 3, my guest and I got there at 2:10.  Our order was taken promptly enough, but then the wait began  Almost 15 minutes to get the salad I ordered and the lunch entrees were not served until 2:40.  This and the place was empty!  The long wait was only made worse by the horrible, and I mean horrible and way too loud background music."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual meal.  I was in town for a wedding and being my birthday, my family wanted to celebrate with brunch.  The 9 of us started with coffee and drinks.  My white peach bellini was the perfect start to the day.  

We shared a variety of items: banana nutella pancakes, omelette of the day, broken egg pizza (so good that we ordered a second), granola with fruit and yogurt, frittata (second favorite after the pizza).  Everything was fresh and delicious and I loved that we shared as a big group to indulge, but not overdo it.

My family informed the waitstaff of my birthday, so they threw in a complimentary pie which we each took a bite of to end our meal.  Our waitress was great and handled our large party perfectly.  Dante even came out to say hi and see how everything was.

Overall, great little gem in this cute neighborhood."}
{"text":"With a group of friends and we ordered pasta, oysters, pork chips, and champagne of course. 

This place is always so busy and I am glad we tried it out!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 7 for Sunday brunch and we were all so impressed! Great food, cool atmosphere and not overpriced. I got a bellini, the Bianco pizza (garlic, goat cheese, red onion, ricotta, truffle honey and pistachio nuts) which was AMAZING, and blueberry sausage links.  If you haven't been, add this place to your Cleveland brunch list! Oh and call ahead for reservations."}
{"text":"Time and again, visit after visit, Next Door never disappoints. This time, we were a little worried. The menu seemed to have fewer pasta dishes. Not to worry. What was available was of course perfect. 

The calamari was light and delicate. The special shrimp Alioli was buttery. The Nutella cake was never too sweet.

Dante Next Door is only open for lunch. There are clear reasons why I occasionally take a day off of work...so I can eat here. One visit and you'll be playing hooky too!"}
{"text":"Made our road trip from Columbus to Cleveland for the Rock & Roll HOF.    But 1st stopped at Dante's newest place Next Door.  Mary & I stopped for Saturday Brunch and loved the menu.  We sampled a pizza with Goat Cheese, egg, peas asparagus and morels. It was great.  Had to ask Chef for the pizza dough recipe as it was lite and crisp on the outside, but just a little chewy on the inside.  Also tried the Brulee French toast and it was just plain good.  But the killer was Dante's bacon!!  OMG!  I would sell my granddaughter into slavery for more of that stuff.  It's like crack!  Service was good as always, saw some regular faces from Chef's Flagship restaurant and we had a newbie.  

Chef has hit another home run here."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Melissa was the best bartender/server. Whenever I visit Cleveland this will be my first stop. Very impressed!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Next Door with a friend for Saturday brunch after hearing good things about it for some time. The place was much busier than expected, but we were able to be seated immediate even without reservations. 

Being a fan of all things pizza, I was excited to see several varieties of breakfast pizza on the menu. I should have been wary of being seated without wait, as we ended up waiting on our meals for more than 45 minutes. 

The bianco pizza was a good meld of flavors, but disappointingly greasy and heavy and the duck fat potatoes were indistinguishable form any breaded, fried breakfast potatoes. We had great service to balance out the slight disappointments in food, and given the interesting menu I could see myself going back."}
{"text":"We had a most wonderful brunch yesterday. The crab benedict was perfect. Such a light hollandaise sauce. The vegetarian omelette was huge and the potatoes with bacon and cheese were crisp and plentiful for 2 people. Our server Kandace was very good as were all of her fellow workers. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed that atmospher as well. Dante has done it again."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, delicious food and a great atmosphere. We went for brunch and can't wait to get back there for dinner soon. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Fabulous brunch atmosphere. It's refreshing to see a pretty spacious floor and big windows which bring in lots of light in the morning. Delicious food and appetizers, great service."}
{"text":"My gf and I came here for a Sunday brunch. The restaurant was packed with people around noon. Luckily we were able to sit at the bar without wait.

The restaurant has an Italian/Spanish vibe. Has some nice Italian finishes, but the colors on the walls remind of a Spanish restaurant. There's a few original artworks of some vegetables and fruits. And of course lets not forget those \"unique\" looking chandeliers (aka condomliers). There are two bar areas in the restaurant. One of which faces the brick pizza ovens. The restaurant ambiance is quite different to Dante. Next Door feels more casual due to its open layout. 

Anyhow, we ordered the crab cake eggs benedict, smoked salmon pizza, and duck fat potatoes. We also had a mango iced tea.

The bartender/server Victoria was very cheerful and attentive. The iced tea was light and refreshing. It was nice to see that it wasn't overly sweetened. The food arrived rather quickly and the portions were very generous. There were two eggs benedict in the order. The crab cake was nicely done; flavorful and moist. The soft english muffin was lightly toasted. There was also ham. All of this was topped with lemon hollandaise sauce and a poached egg. The runny egg and hollandise sauce combined beautifully. The hollandaise sauce had a bit of tarty lemon flavor which the egg yolk balanced out nicely. 

The smoked salmon pizza was also very good. The pizza was topped with smoked salmon, hard boiled eggs, and onions. The salmon had a nice smokey flavor and the crust of the pizza was very good. The pizza here are all made in the brick oven. The potatoes were also very good. These little potatoes absorbed all the goodness from the duck fat. The potato add on was definitely a good choice.

We left the restaurant with one whole eggs benedict and about half the pizza. The leftovers were still very good the next day! Although prices are a bit high for brunch, it makes up for quality (an even quantity). I'll definitely return another time!"}
{"text":"In a dream world, I would enjoy Sunday Brunch at Dante's Next Door every weekend! I dined solo at the bar on a rainy Sunday morning, March 13th. Melissa was very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about menu items. She knew I needed the \"On the Rise\"  in my life! The Paradiso was  baked to perfection (Lobster pizza with Truffle cream, mushrooms, and arugula)!! My Duck Fat Fried Potatoes were so herby, earthy and fragrant that diners around me inquired about this decadent treat! I'm looking forward to returning for so many more intriguing dishes on the menu. Thank you to the team at Dante's Next Door for helping my first experience to be awesome!
~QB"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Service was great-Thank you Tia! Also, there is a small parking lot right next to the restaurant. 

I had the cinnamon waffle with caramelized apples. We also ordered eggs, bacon, home fries, and pastries our table, to share. I really liked that you can order family-style sides for the table. It gives you the freedom to order something specialized (burger, waffle, etc.), while not missing out on those classic comfort breakfast foods (eggs, bacon, etc).

My only complaint is that the music was suddenly cranked up really loud a little after we arrived. I believe it was to cover the sound bleed of a band in another part of the building. But, the result was that it took away from the calm, welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Went to Dante Next Door this morning for brunch (note - they are not open for dinner).  I had a fantastic meal. They sell French press coffee by the pot, enough for 4 people to share for $8, with a variety of options. The Brazilian was great, had a hint of cocoa to it. I ordered the Banana Pancakes with a side of pork sausage patties. All I can say is they were perfect. The pancakes (3 for $8) have a drizzle of nutella between each pancake and on top which really gives it a rich but not over the top flavor. Perfect texture. And the sausage was delicious. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The weekend brunch has some good choices and the kitchen was willing to make changes.  The place lacks acoustical buffers and is very noisy.  Our server was terrific and the blueberry pancakes I had were the best.
This is a welcome Tremont neighbor."}
{"text":"Won a gift certificate through the radio.  $25.00 - went to Dante's Next Door today, Saturday.
Party of Two.

Two double Espresso's $5.50 each.

Two latte - $5.50 each.  (Mostly foam - very little coffee).

Ordered the Crab Cakes \"Benedict\" $16.00 (Soft poached eggs, ham, lemon Hollandaise sauce) and the Breakfast Calzone $12.00 (ham, hash browns, peppers, onions and cheddar).  Husband wanted  1/2 of each plate.  We also got a Duck Fat Potatoes $4.00 to share.

We walked in and did not have reservations.  Was told that we could sit at either bar because every other empty table in the place was for reservations.  We were told when a table was available, they would seat us.  We decided to stay at the bar & sat down next to another couple. 

The woman I sat next to was RUDE!  She was a friend of the waitress, Melissa.  They talked and talked and the customer never shut up even when we flagged down Melissa and started our order.  All through the meal, the other customer was rude - flipping her hair on me, playing with her hair - hitting me with her hair, etc.  NEVER SHUT UP WITH THE WAITRESS EITHER.

Talking about other people, who was doing what, when - etc.  (Mostly the customer, not the waitress).

Food was tasty and a decent portion  EXCEPT the bottom of the calzone was burned - one half more so then the other.  Cook must have been in a hurry to fix it also - because the burned side was all dough  1/2 way through.  My husband who never leaves a crumb behind left about 3 bites of burned dough.

Melissa the waitress made sure to tell she ordered a side of b√©arnaise sauce for our potato's.  I don't know if she was just letting us know or hinting for a larger tip.  It struck both of us odd the way she said it and the way it came out - her tone, etc.

So, after the $25.00 gift certificate, the bill was $35.00.  NOT happy with that at all.  Way to much money for a Saturday mid-morning breakfast.

Also - just a note:  We saw other people come into the place - but there was still 2-4 tables empty the entire 1  1/2 hours we were there and no one came to seat us at a table.

Not going back.  Just too expensive.

Oh - almost forgot:  the friend of the waitress bumped into both our seats when she was leaving.  Hard enough that my husband almost spilled the last of his coffee."}
{"text":"We just stopped in to take a break from walking around. What a treat. The bellinis were refreshing and Melissa, our bartender, was terrific. We ordered the olives and they were delish, but we couldn't eat them all. So she found a leak proof zip lock bag and we were able to put them in my purse and eat them later back at the hotel. A wonderful place."}
{"text":"I had the best brunch for the year at this place. I got omelet of the day and it was so delicious. The side salad is good too. The french press coffee is great too. I recommend sitting outside on the deck when weather permits. It's in a young neighborhood. The people next table were taking shots with brunch...."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite brunch restaurants in Cleveland. Dante Next Door has great service and even better food. My go to menu item is the bloody Mary's and the Everything Bagel Lox pizza. The bloody Mary is spiced to perfection and the pizza is so tasty and unlike any other breakfast pizza that I've had in the past. The staff are always super friendly and accommodating. Lastly, the restaurant has a cool vibe with ample seating. 2 thumbs up and looking forward my next visit."}
{"text":"This review is for their BRUNCH service only! We just left brunch service. We absolutely adore Dante's, Next Door and D.C. pasta as well as an occasional wine dinner downstairs. Hands down some of the best restaurants in Cleveland. We were really looking forward to today's brunch and figured as usual it would blow every other place out of the water... sadly, it was a big disappointment. We sat out on the patio, beautiful day and perfect setting for brunch. So far so good. We ordered French Press coffee and a Bloody Mary. Had to wait on the Bloody Mary due to liquor license until 11am. Totally understandable. French Press came out and had to steep 5 minutes. Also understandable. We only received one cup. Requested another as well as cream and sugar. Waited over 15 minutes for cream and sugar!!! No second cup was ever brought out and we didn't bother asking again since the coffee was lukewarm and nearly wasted at this point. Not happy. Our four top ordered the basket of pastries that were brought out quickly and were delicious. We had about an hour wait for our main dishes. Normally understandable, but the restaurant was not that busy yet. The Pasta Cabonara Frittata was the best item ordered. Absolutely delicious and the type of unique and delicious dish you expect from Dante. The burger was good/average. The charred logo on top of the bun was a nice touch. The Paradiso pizza was just ok. Had an odd sugary sweet flavor and only 3 potato slices to be found on the whole pizza. The steak and eggs was just disappointing. The steak was gristle and fat, over cooked and had to be sawed through with a butter knife since no steak knife was provided. The server did not come back to touch the table until removing plates, so one could not be asked for. The eggs were ok. The fries were good as well as the Bernaise.... but we didn't order it or come to a Dante's restaurant to pay $22 for good fries and sauce. Definitely sub par fare from one of our favorite chef's establishments. Our server was friendly and polite but was inattentive and forgetful. Water service was on point. Over all not an experience that was on course for what we have come to expect from any of Dante's restaurants. We will of course be back to every and all of them, but we will not be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Whoa. Best brunch I've had in a long time (maybe ever??)

Super friendly service, amazing menu with so many great options, and the food was even better than I had hoped. 
The Bianco pizza was light and savory/sweet with truffle oil and crushed pistachios . It surprisingly paired well with the salmon Benedict croissant special we had. 

My son had the plain waffle with raspberry compote (on the side because he's a picky 3 yr old). He slammed the plain, yet fluffy and delicious waffle and we enjoyed his compote ;)

French press coffee was a great addition to the meal. Next time we'll have to try the bloody Mary's.

Stop reading, just go! 

...and they take reservations too! Ok, now go"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

This restaurant is literally next door to Dante, and in order to eat in the patio you basically walk right through Dante to get there.

The restaurant has some very good options, and some things are just okay.  The pizzas are fairly large, very creative, and pretty tasty.  The crab cake benedict was also very good but somewhat small for its price.  The carbonara frittata is overwhelmingly heavy and should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome brunch spot. I've been a few times and each time it has thoroughly impressed. The steak and eggs are delicious and the pizza's are a great option as well. The restaurant itself has a great feel and the staff is always friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Saturday 2 weeks ago.  Had a reservation and was seated quickly despite the rest of the party being a bit late.  The service was great, food was amazing, and they had a whole list of cocktails for brunch.  The decor was really cozy too.  5 of us ate/drank for 145 dollars total.  I originally thought it was a little pricey but the food, portions, and service was worth it."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars
I am not sure if I have been to a place quite like this...

Dante Next Door is only open for a few hours a day (10-3, varies by day) and pretty much is just brunch and lunch.  Yet seems to fit a need for the area still.  There are several bars and dinner restaurants in the area, but not as many that specialize in the meal that you have subsequently after a long night.  

A big, open space which has a full bar, brick wood-fired pizza ovens and a nice dinning space.  It feels like you are dining at a fine restaurant but only at 11am.  They have various cocktails and coffees to choose from so depending on how you want your day to go DND has you covered.  

The food is generally very savory...they have a pizza with spaghetti on it...that you can order in the morning.  Like i said, I'm not sure if I have been to a place quite like it.  I ordered the crab eggs Benedict and it was delicious.  Well constructed, well seasoned and perfect presentation - it had everything I was hoping it would have and then some.  I also shared some of the homemade granola with the wife and that was also quite good.  The greek yogurt was a perfect complement and the dish was really filling.  

There used to be only one place I wanted to go for the morning after meal after a long night but DND makes two.  I would say the only thing that was bothersome in the least was the ticket times.  It took a bit more time that I would expect for the meals to arrive, but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Tremont for date night. Romantic, trendy, and the drinks are great. The menu isn't too off-the-wall, but still inventive with some of the main courses. Of course, I tried the dessert--- not my favorite but worth a try if you're still craving something after your meal is over. I usually take at least 6 pieces of candy on my way out"}
{"text":"Would give a 3.5 if i could.
Came for brunch and  split 2 things. 
Tiger shrimp and polenta was amazing! Highly highly recommend it. 5 stars for that. 
Everything lox bagel pizza was not amazing. Way too much cream cheese and no flavor. Could make it better at home. Highly recommend against it. 

Other people really liked the pancakes and frittata. Service was decent, drinks were fine. A little on the pricey side with some of the dishes worth it. Would be back!"}
{"text":"Good service! Had appetizers at original Dante's, quite awhile, ago.  Had sweet potato pizza, and a salad. It was different. I am all about ambiance and service in restaurants; both were supreme here. Dante Bocuzzi is class all the way"}
{"text":"What a great place for brunch! It was cozy and charming, and they had some nice, quiet music that gave it a relaxed vibe. Our server was extremely nice and helpful.

I had the omelet of the day (tomato basil), and it was great and fresh tasting. Didn't feel too heavy and it came with a nice salad. I also got the duck fat potatoes to balance it out (can't be too healthy). Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Brunch!  John was our server and he was great! Funny, knowledgeable and helpful. Our first time here and the drinks were made wonderful as well as the specials for the day. Music was on point for Sunday Funday brunch.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We came for brunch but didn't have reservations so we grabbed the last two bar seats.  I was expecting a more innovative menu but there was still plenty on the menu that grabbed my attention.  We split the Next Door Pizza which was good, but overpriced.  The lobster was tender but the pizza was pretty bare.  I expected a bit more substance for $23.  We also had a side of the Blueberry Sausage Links which were perfect and a fun twist on a standard brunch item.  It wasn't a heavy brunch but I left satisfied.       

Overall, brunch was fine.  The crowd was energetic which is always positive for the neighborhood.  I'm not in a rush to return for brunch but I will be back to check out  their lunch items."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Had the Salmon special with crab cake mashed potatoes and asparagas.  Some of the best salmon i've ever had.  Really good, but $16 + t&t is a little pricy for lunch.  There are less expensive options and a good pizza menu to choose from. Good atmosphere too.  Open for lunch Wednesday - Friday is a plus."}
{"text":"I've stumbled upon a new brunch spot and one that does a Saturday brunch no less. 

The drink menu was full of delicious offerings. There are four Bloody Mary options on offer. The first (Giardiniera) was lightly spicy, contained various veg and was served with tasty garnishes. I love a Bloody with heat. Heat normally translates into a whole mouth back of the throat experience that can be a bit overwhelming. Dante's spicy Bloody however was nicely balanced out and something you could sip and sip without being overcome by heat. It may be my new favorite Bloody in CLE! 

The brunch menu offered a large variety of options as well. The carbonara frittata was new to me and tasted great. The egg was thick and fluffy and the sauce really good. 

I think the Crab Cake Egg's Benedict won me over though. I'm not normally a ham fan, but the ham used was really good and the crab cake was delicious and a substantial part of the dish. All the flavors combined were wonderful and refreshing. 

This is definitely a spot that I will stop in again for brunch and surely for another Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Came in for late lunch in Tremont, which is a special treat for us, since we live in the burbs and work downtown, so don't make the trek out on the weekends because we are SOOOOO sick of the drive by the time the weekend rolls around....

The restaurant was empty bc it was was very late and almost the end of lunch time, but we sat at the bar and ordered a fantastic bloody mary and vodka drink to start (it was almost 3, so no judgement!).  I was not in the mood for eggs or breakfast food, but they weren't serving lunch menu yet.  However, they made a slight exception for us, since what I really wanted was the charcuterie and cheese plate (also amazing at Dante!)  and the chef from Dante was able to make it for us!  

It was overflowing with proscuitto, duck, chicken liver mouse, speck, homemade sausages, several kinds of cheese, including a fantastic blue cheese that was heaven, and pickled vegetables, mustards and sweets.  I couldn't have been happier!

We will definitely be back and try at least some of the regular menu items!

{"text":"Food tasted great .I really enjoyed the maple pepper bacon. Pretentious place in crappy Cleveland. Way over priced. I hear it's suppose to be some big deal so you're probably paying for the name but Grumpy's down the street is way better and cost less and the staff is friendly. But hey, if you're in the neighborhood check it out. Be your own judge. Again, foods good I just didn't like the cost and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite Sunday brunch locations in Cleveland. Their breakfast pizzas are outstanding and the carbonara frittata is absolutely delicious. They have a great spicy cucumber bloody mary, which typically aren't my first choice. If you aren't in the mood to drink Sunday morning, try their iced tea! You can choose from a number of flavors and they infuse it!! So refreshing...you can even get more than one flavor if you can't decide!

Also, I'm all about sides. I definitely say get a side of bacon - no matter what you get. It is perfectly cut and cooked! Also, the two different types of potatoes as well as the fries are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Growing pains or confused identity?  Note - I went during the Soft Opening where the full menu was not available.  Since then, I've walked by and the tables are set.  Honestly it makes for a different appearance.

The pizza - Dante himself was serving up the pizza.  Each pizza was \"personal pan size\" but fire roasted in their amazing (and hot if the A/C isn't on) wall of pizza ovens.  The chefs worked in sync with one another, putting on toppings, putting pizza in the hole, switching it around, out and then slicing.  It was a pizza version of a Model-T line.  

My favorite pizza was hands down, the seafood pizza.  I tried to try a little bit of everything and even the \"plain\" Margarita pizza was very good.  All the pizza's had quality toppings, were very flavorful and the dough had just the right Italian crisp, that they felt unique against the traditional Edison's pizza across the way.  

My biggest complaint was with the space itself.  Next to Dante, which is parceled out and feels cozy no matter where you sit, Next Door is the antithesis.  It's open with self-painted art up on the walls.  It seems almost thrown together.  The same chandeliers (or at least similar) hang from the walls, but they're hanging over a vast and identity-less space."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. The service, recommendations, drinks and food were amazing. Not a single complaint, just a really good, reliable place to relax and enjoy Dante cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Sunday brunch at Dante Next Door with my boyfriend and another couple. Parking was a breeze, as there were many spots open in the lot behind the restaurant. We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation, but were warmly greeted and taken to our table. 

Our waitress came to the table in a matter of minutes, and shortly after we had mimosas in hand. They were very good (and very light on the orange juice). After placing our order, we were able to chat amongst ourselves, while enjoying the 90s pop music playing in the background. I ordered the \"Morning After Waffles\" which I really enjoyed. The sicilian tomatoes gave it a different kick, and I also substituted the sunny-side up eggs for scrambled. My boyfriend ordered the Pasta Carbonara Fritatta, which one staff member shared was the best item on the menu. It was a unique dish, with the combination of egg and Italian flavors. The other couple had Dante's Inferno Pizza and Crab Cakes Benedict, which they both enjoyed. Our waitress stopped by frequently to ensure that our drinks were full and we were taken care of. Overall, the service was great and the food was tasty, but the check added up quickly as we each had two drinks."}
{"text":"Quite literally next door to Dante's Restaurant, Dante Next Door serves up a limited menu and limited hours to cater to the brunching crowds. Personally, I'm not a huge brunch person, but my friend wanted to try it out so I agreed. We were the first to arrive at 10:30am and we were the only guests in the restaurant, but things certainly started to pick up after 11:00am. Our server was friendly, and was able to describe the specials and answer all of our questions. I ended up trying the margherita pizza while my friend got the omelette special. I found the prices to be a bit higher than I expected for brunch... the margherita pizza was decently priced at $10 but all the other pizza options were $13 and up while the other more breakfasty options were between $10 and $13. My friend was happy to find that their orange juice was freshly squeezed, and we were satisfied with the quality of our meal, but the pizza was pretty similar to all of the other wood fire oven pizzas I've tried. Good, but nothing unique. 
The saving grace was the nutella pie... I'm not a huge dessert person, but this definitely wowed me. It's definitely more creamy and rich that straight up sweet, which I enjoyed. I would definitely order this again if I returned, but on the other hand I don't really have a desire to brunch here again. The ambiance is a little too modern for my taste and somewhat eclectic, but not in a very thoughtful way. It definitely feels like an \"add-on\" rather than an actual conceptualized restaurant. Overall I wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here, but I could say you'll probably be decently satisfied with your brunch here if you don't mind paying a little more than average."}
{"text":"Melissa at the bar is wonderful. From making recommendations to just being friendly her love of service clearly shows.

Food was delicious and portions were large. We had the butternut squash ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs. Both were perfect.

Stop in for a treat!"}
