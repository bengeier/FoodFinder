{"text":"Great take out sushi! Don't let the simple counter fool you, John Lee serves up the best fish and is very creative in the flavours he brings together.

As with and trusted chef, I simply give him a budget and ask him to make what's good that day. Always something new on your plate, or at least, at the end of your chopsticks.

I don't honk it's good value when you look at the quality."}
{"text":"John is generous with his servings, and the fish is always fresh and sweet. Sushi Marche is one of my favourite places in the city, and I love that it's in Leaside now because I used get it all the time when I worked near the Leslieville store. 

I've ordered from him for parties for years, and the only thing I don't like on the menu is the smoked salmon sashimi. Everything else is fantastic, especially the Kamikaze rolls."}
{"text":"I really have my doubts when I drove by this Sushi Marche's Laird Dr location! It is located beside used car dealership, mechanic and body shops..... and it doesn't even have proper store signage.... looks more like a temporary location than something permanent!! 

Inside the deco is minimum..... like empty?? like nothing?? You would never know it is a sushi take out joint or a Japanese place when you walk in. 

The Sushi Chef/Cashier/Phone Order taker is super nice. 

Marche Roll ($10) is pricey but nicely done. I still cannot get over the price point at Sushi Marche....... As a take out place, it is really overpriced... it has no service, no ambiance, no nothing and charging a premium price! 

Nice Sushi Chef asked me if I would like Miso Soup which cost $2.50... I was worried for a second that he was trying to up sell me.. like waiter asked if you would like cheese and bacon with your burger, but he really ask if I would have it for free... Free is good! :P And the miso soup was quite tasty!!"}
