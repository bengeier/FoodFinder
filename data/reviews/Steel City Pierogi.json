{"text":"I just visited the Steel City Pierogi food truck and the heaping portions of deliciousness that I brought back into work caused major jealousy. I ordered pierogis and kielbasa and it could not have been more delightful. The folks working at the truck were very friendly and went over all the offerings. Just by itself, the pierogi is excellent and savory, but once you add the sour cream, kielbasa, onions and bacon all in one bite, it really gets amazing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food --east european yum yum food--they got rough start due to sucky traffic from Mesa but produced food that lays gentle hands on your soul and does bruceleesubzero dance on the heart. Cooked,seasoned the way I like pierogie and golumpki but I'm an Asian adopted by North Cacalackians, what do I know from Polish food?
Gonna find these guys in Mesa hope yo see yinz there.
Only reason not a 5-star is I like my dumplin's  with about 45 seconds to 1 minute more pillowing---pierogie good .----- 1 minute  from greatness? Just being picky...  me likey"}
{"text":"9 bucks for 5 small perogi's and a little bacon??? I could have gotten a package of about 15 perogies and a pound of bacon from Frys for about the same price and made better at  home!! @ $9 they are Gouging you wallet !!! I won't make that mistake again !!!"}
{"text":"Being from Pittsburgh I absolutely had to find this truck! This is the food I grew up on!
I was a little hesitant at first because I didn't think anyone could ever top my grandma's haluski or stuffed cabbage. I was SO surprised and happy at how delicious the food was here!
Zero complaints!
I had the combo plate: stuffed cabbage, pierogis & haluski. I ordered the lemonade to drink. If you're from Pittsburgh, think old school Kennywood lemonade :)
I need to track this truck down and get my fix of home!"}
{"text":"Not only the BEST pierogi I've ever had, I thoroughly enjoyed chatting all things Pittsburgh!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a pierogi or stuffed cabbage until now. They taste amazing and for such a good price. I could eat the stuffed cabbages all day long.  The guys are so nice too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"You get 5 pierogis with choice of toppings for around $9. If you asked me... not worth it. Tastes like pierogis from the grocery store.  Nothing special. Add 5 more pierogis and maybe worth the walk to the food truck.

Response to John S.:
Thanks for your reply. Clearly, customer satisfaction is not a priority for Steel City Perogis.  Instead, your response to my HONEST review was a bit sarcastic and your defensive reaction was quite immature.  I have no interest in buying a food truck with a reputation for poor customer service and mediocre food. Like I said in my review, nothing special.

My intentions are not to \"Trash small businesses\".  I am sharing my experience on Yelp.  This is what people do here."}
