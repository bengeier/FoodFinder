{"text":"Pretty average.  Fries were packaged frozen as were chicken tenders.  We were only people in the place on a weds afternoon.  Burgers were grainy."}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast on 6/28. Had an honest, home cooked breakfast for 2 that only cost just a little over $10. We ate outside, service was fast and adequate. Cannot say anything negative about the experience."}
{"text":"Very average diner.  Breakfast is my favorite meal for dining out, and since we were new to the area I've been wanting to try it out.  Booths were torn and repaired with blue duct tape in several spots to match the blue vinyl upholstery. Hot chocolate for my kids was cold; not luke warm...just cold. Our server was surprised when I brought both glasses to her asking for them to be warmed up.  A few minutes later she returned to let me know that none of the workers knew \"how to make the machine make the hot chocolate HOT!\"  So I requested them to be microwaved...she obliged.  The potatoes were burnt yet cold as well, and the French Toast that my son received have might as well been run over in the parking lot before it was served.  It was thin and very dry.  I didn't know this was possible for French Toast.  My Greek omelette was hot and mostly tasty but it was loaded with olives and I couldn't find any evidence of the feta cheese that was supposed to be there.  The only redeeming quality of this joint was that it was cheap.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The food was so bad that it made me angry- kitchen is full of kids who are more concerned with feeding their buddies than cooking a decent egg- hollandaise was broken badly, homefries were way way under cooked and there were kids in tank tops hanging out in the kitchen. Atmosphere is good but if you are looking for good food this isn't the place- seriously bad and bland food- get it together guys


1 week later I just drove by and remembered how bad the food is, I truly hope that this shit hole goes out of business- also I want my $20 back"}
{"text":"Actual date of visit was 3/2/12.  I ordered Sirloin Noodle Soup, side salad and a fish fry friday dinner (cod, fries, slaw).  First let me say that the Sirloin Noodle Soup was good.  The soup was the highlight of the meal.  I'm hoping I can upload a photo with this review, just so you can see what I was dealing with.  I couldn't believe when I open the to-go box with the 'fish fry' dinner - 2 small almost medium size of greasy fish.  The biggest shock was the small handful of fries, when can you actually count the total amount of fries in one glance.  Man, I really felt shortchanged.  There was no value for my dollars / no bang for my buck !!   Oh the disappointment !  The side salad was unremarkable.  I can't say that I would stop back."}
{"text":"The positive of this place is they are very pro-military/patriotic.  The negative is the food is ordinary and the place is worn out and grimy.  The food was very slow to come out and the waitress and cook started yelling at each other in front of us...not cool at all.  All in, we would have been better off going to the McDonald's around the corner.  Pass it by."}
{"text":"Always love coming here for breakfast with my wife we're in the area. Good food, honoring to vets and family-run. This morning I'm trying the Gomer Pyle which is a skillet of home fries, tomatoes, mushrooms with eggs and covered with sausage gravy. Should be fun."}
{"text":"Come for breakfast & maybe you'll get it by lunch.  
It shouldn't take 45 minutes after you order for scrambled eggs, pancakes and bacon unless you're waiting for the chicken to lay the egg.  And they weren't.  When the food did come it took another 5 minutes and then walking up to the counter to get syrup to go with the pancakes. 
I don't mind waiting for really good food, but short order breakfast?   This place feels more like it's someone's hobby than a business. Only think of it if you're 90 and have nothing else to do because you'll age waiting for your food."}
{"text":"If you want water and coffee that tastes like soap while you watch Fox News - this place is for you."}
{"text":"Simple food done very well. If you want a good meal with friendly staff it is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"This is our favorite treasure of breakfast food! The service is wonderful and the food is fantastic! Awesome family owned establishment!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is not what it used to be at all. We used to LOVE coming here for lunch. I went there recently after some time had passed, and despite reading all of the bad reviews, I still gave it a shot, hoping it would be what it once was, and what a mistake!! The water and coffee does taste EXACTLY like dirty, soapy bath water (as others mentioned in their reviews). When my friend and I set our horrid waters aside and ordered other beverages, the owner who is also the waitress, was very unpleasant about it. She didn't even ask if there was a problem, she just took the waters off the table in a huff!! I then decided to try the coffee which was even worse than the water! I couldn't even swallow it! She came over to ask if I wanted a refill and I told her it tasted bad and she gave me a disgusted look, sighed, and in a huff took it away!! She did not even offer to remedy it!! I then ordered a Sprite which had no syrup at all, it was just carbonated water that also tasted like bath soap. After three strike-outs, I decided to forgo a beverage and just eat the food. They no longer offer any of the great meals I used to get, so I settled for something else, and it was not good at all. Even the ketchup was sour, crusty, and horrid. It is one thing to cut costs, but really? I will never return, and I am sad that a great place could turn into this nightmare. Also, I really did not appreciate the attitude we receive because the water, coffee and pop were all undrinkable. We didn't even complain, we paid for everything that was undrinkable and unedible, but the attitude about it was the final straw for me to never give this place another dime."}
{"text":"A great place for a quality meal. Not too pricey and the surrounding are a kin to a small diner. We had an Omelette, lamb gyro and a turkey reuben. The Reuben was awesome, served on grilled rye and coleslaw on the sandwich. The omelette was great fresh fillings. The gyro was frozen \"gyro lamb\" strips but we're ok. Fries are also frozen, the coated kind of you like that.
Cafe Michael met expectations for a local diner."}
{"text":"Stopped into Michael s Cafe for breakfast because I was meeting a friend for quick bite and discuss some business. To tell you the truth never even knew the place was there until he mentioned it. 

The place seemed clean, orderly, and the waitress was nice , service was fast. I ordered the , bainbridge road dept special which made me wonder where the road dept is spending their time that they get a meal named after them..hmm.. anyway

Food was quick, not bad for the money spent.... potatoes were not very good though...lots of black spots which means old potato's or rotten parts. the one thing I did not like when I got my cup for coffee i noticed it had dried out ketchup on it which means there dishwasher is not working very well... food like I said was ok eggs were cooked in some ring holder because the were perfectly round , found that funny..

I would go there again for breakfast but would watch for the cleanliness a little closer."}
