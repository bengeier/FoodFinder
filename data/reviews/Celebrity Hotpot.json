-Dining Companion-

In reference to the fact that 
1) service is rather slow (if you know what you want, just order it all at once)
2) amount ordered is not always what's delivered 
3) service is rather slow

But!
It's fun, and it fills you up!
A perfectly reasonable option downtown when only hotpot will do.  
As mentioned, around $25 per person."}
{"text":"worse encounter ever. Employees were great. Only the restaurant was so horrible at delivering our order. we waited for 20mins for our first order. it was only a few dish n it took 20minutes?! 
- very disappointed with the soup base. not as good as little mongolia's.
-highly disappointed with how the staff refilling those two different types of soups with same stock refill. didnt the pot says itself by the divider?
- regretted of coming here since reading the good reviews by others. Guess this is a \"good\" standard review made by student standard taste bud."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat down for 10 minutes and nobody bothered to come. The employees didn't seem to even bother when I walked out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"if you like hot pot, this is the place to be.  The service here is incredible.  I really like their sauce station where you can mix and match with 15+ different type of sauces.  Drinks (soya milk, green teen and plum juice) are all you can drink as well.  I am definitely coming back during winter time."}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that we happened upon that I really believe could be much busier than it is.  They have a great corner location with windows through which you could see other patrons cooking at the table, talking, and enjoying the meal.  Why not???  And so we walked in and were seated to peruse the menu.  Unfortunately, it was a complete mess---way way way way way too much information.  It was so confusing in fact that we almost decided to leave since we couldn't understand how to order!  In fact while eating we noticed 4 other groups enter, sit, view the menu, and WALK OUT!!!!  The staff did NOT approach them to explain the menu and assist them through the ordering process!  Is it apathy?  I just believe this happens so much that they are just numb to it.  But it shouldn't happen this way!!!!  You've got the customer, curious people who want to try something new, but are scared away by the entire process!

Lucky for us we are familiar with hot pot and when the staff walked by we asked lots of questions and were assisted in the ordering process.  Yes we want the chicken broth.  Oh, thats free but you have to pay extra for the other types of broth?  Yes we want to try the lamb, beef and meatballs.  Which meatballs?  Uh...lets see...Oh, how many of each???  Well, lets see our choices...oh okay since there are 3 of us we can choose how many total (I believe it was 4 each, so that makes 12 meatballs)....Which vegetables?  Oh, how many orders of each?  Mushrooms, bok choy, spinach....etc...etc...etc..  It can be OVERWHELMING!!!!  

WHEW!!!!  Finally got the order in, and now to the all you can drink drinks (soy milk, plum juice & iced ginger tea I believe).  ALL YUMMY!!!  

BUT then once again to the array of 20+ (?) sauces and condiments on a buffet to self-serve into small bowls to bring back to your table.  OKAY TIME TO BREATHE DEEPLY and approach this buffet with calm.  Go through each ingredient like a pro--100% pure-blooded Chinese person that I am---yes!  Got a few, hot sauces, cilantro, grn onions, soy sauce....etc.....and then thankfully one of the workers came up to us and offered his \"special sauce\"---a mixture of 4 different items that he handed to us.  

The food was DELICIOUS and so were the sauces!  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, being able to cook while you eat, chatting and relaxing from a busy day!  The price VERY FAIR--we were here before 3pm and got EVERYTHING for $10pp, including the drinks!  So refreshing!  Such a memorable meal!  

The reason for 4 stars is not the food--that's 5 stars--but rather that the entire ordering process could be MUCH better!  I hope that they can find some way around this, change the way the menu is presented or have a designated person to assist with ordering etc...I think they can really shine!"}
{"text":"Venue is clean, food is fresh and good and service is legendary lol coconut ice cream is good"}
{"text":"Delicious! First time hot pot and I really enjoy it!  It was clean, nice, and so many options. And owner was very nice! Thank you very much"}
{"text":"Second time going to a hot pot restaurant. My husband and I had the chicken & beef broth and vegetable broth. We added our own blend of condiments in the soups and they both tasted great. 

They have a stand where they offer unlimited  unlimited drinks: ice water, honey green tea, soy milk, and plum juice. This was a great idea as we didn't have to ask for refills.  

I would come here again and try different broths!"}
{"text":"Had a tremendously filling meal here with a friend that comes regularly. I had never been to a hot pot before, and he's an expert on these kinds of things - I love finding new restaurants where I can get a lot of yummy vegetarian food, so he's been helping me find new ones that had flown under my radar.

Initially, I thought that the flat $25 was a bit high, but once I realized that everything is all you can eat and it includes a drink, I was sold! I appreciated that they let us have two completely separate pots since my friend was having meat and I was having veg. I really liked the selection of vegetables and noodles and sauces. I love my stuff spicy, so it was nice to just dump as much chili oil in there as I could handle. I also got to try some new veggies I hadn't encountered before, which was fun, and also really delicious!

The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that I ordered udon noodles to go in mine and they forgot. Totally forgivable as it was busy, but even after I reminded them, and then grabbed another waiter and ordered again, I still never received the noodles. I had more than enough food anyway, so it wasn't a travesty, but just a little annoying.

I had a great time, and I would definitely bring friends here in the future!"}
{"text":"First, let me say the reason for the 3 stars is reflective of the fact that it's $20 pp for hot pot, and not as much on the actual quality of the food.  And even that wouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker, except, they pretty much hide the price from you, until it's too late.  What do I mean by \"hide\"?  They don't list it anywhere on the menu.  They only tell you, if you ask, once the food is already ordered. They also strongly suggest trying two different broths, but don't tell you there's a $3 surcharge to do so. You find that out when you get your bill. Now, I will tell you, the hot pot is pretty good, although, not the best I've ever had.  But good. They bring you as many items as you want, and will keep it coming. But how much soup can one eat??? When we got our  bill, and it was $72 for two people, for SOUP, plus 3 tsing taos, we got a little cranky. This place is probably a really good deal if you're starving, and can eat and eat and eat.  But if you're just normal hungry, there's very little way to justify spending $72 for two people for soup.  And they don't let you take home your left overs, of which there's a considerable amount. Seems incredibly wasteful to me. Next time, we'll hit the noodle shop next door, and save ourselves $50, and walk away feeling like we got a good value, and weren't bamboozled. If you decide to go, a little advice, don't get any of the spicy broths.  They're delicious, but the heat squashes your appetite.  So order the mildest broth they have, and load up on the meats to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the variety of soups available. Decently priced. Was it my Mom's style of Hotpot? No but the company, Chinese New Year Celebration and eating all-you-can eat under $20 is not a bad deal. 

I don't eat shell fish so it didn't bother me about having shrimp cross-contaminate everything.. This is perfect for those that have shellfish allergies even the wontons don't have any shrimp in it.

Would I go again? Sure. It's not super fancy. Casual.

The staff there speak English too and menus is fully translated."}
{"text":"we did not even got into restaurant, since there was a big line inside and noone was even keeping the waiting list. we left 10 minutes after waiting and no host approached the line with the waiting list."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. I just left there and everything was horrible. I asked for water FOUR times and i never got it. I ordered black tea when i got the and never got it. Several items i ordered never came such as preserved egg, certain vegetables etc. the servers were reminded twice and still nothing happened. Our last order of just vegetables took over ten minutes to come out. By the time it got to us we had to leave. Then when the bill came, they had the nerve to include the tip. I subtracted the tip and paid the difference.  Needless to say, I will never eat here again and i am going to discourage everyone i know to do the same. Garbage. There is no excuse for ALL those mishaps. It cannot be chalked up to being busy, because there were only 5 tables with people. Never again. At this rate this place will shut down and maybe be replaced by something that knows how to run properly."}
{"text":"**This is a VERRYYY detailed review, with sections; skip to \"CONCLUSION\" at the bottom if you just want short and sweet.** 

I hope Yelp doesn't filter this review because it's so long and detailed- I wasn't paid by Celebrity Hotpot to write this super detailed review. I'm just a very passionate Yelper, dammit!

Pricing: 
$17.50/person for weekday before 3pm, 3pm and after is $19.50. I don't know weekend prices, but if you really want to know the exact weekend price, just call and ask. Tip is already included when you ask for the bill (I think 10%), and it's much lower than what I'd have paid, so I'm happy with that!

Food:
Fresh, and not cheap-tasting. I think the pricing is reasonable for the experience and the quality of food you get. If you're not sure what a food item is (food item titles can be quite vague, like \"Gluten\". What the HECK is \"Gluten\" in hotpot?!), ask the waiters. An order of an item gives you quite a bit of that item (except dumplings and balls-those are counted. 1 order gives you one ball/dumpling), so don't just order it because it sounds good, and totally regret it...

Service: 
Waiters are young, and speak great English. Not stellar service, but they'll do what you ask in a courteous manner. However, they can be careless with refilling the broth, so when you're running low, just let them know. And no, they didn't charge extra for broth refill, and they really shouldn't.

Help yourself (drinks, sauces): 
There are 19 different sauces at the sauces-and-drink station for you to mix however you please, one of them being a special mix made by one of the waiters with his picture on it- they try to make things fun. There are three help-yourself drinks: soy milk, honey green tea, and bitter plum juice. There are raw eggs at the station as well (they do not charge extra per-egg, like some other places)

A tip for you: 
Like any other all-you-can-enjoy, don't order too much at the beginning. 
Especially because all the ingredients are all prepared already; everything you order will come all at once.
They are supposed to give you complimentary seafood without you having to ask (after the complimentary round, you must pay extra for those items, as it says on the order sheet). I realize this now, but  I never received this free round of seafood!  Either they forgot, or because I ordered a lot right off the bat, they assumed I wouldn't be able to finish all of what I ordered + the seafood. But that's not an assumption they should have just made; at least let me know and maybe I would have changed my order! And if they forgot, that's worse...

Extra charges:
I see some complaints about how they'll sneak in extra charges. Maybe it's because of those complaints that they made improvements (and thanks to all the past reviewers for their sacrifice, if this is the case), but it was quite clear what was extra or not. It says on the order sheet whether they're gonna charge you extra for certain options (\"special\" broth, 2 different broths in one pot, etc.). 

CONCLUSION: Young people, good English, fresh food, clean, modern interior and bright lighting. Costs a little more than other places, but it's reasonable factoring in what I listed. Service can be off, though. I would say, all in all, it's the trendiest hot pot option for downtown."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening with the GF and the place was relatively full...always a good sign as it means fresh food. 

The ordering menu is pretty straightforward but we wanted one large pot instead of small individual ones but after asking we could not get thru. Some how other tables we able to get it but no biggie.

After putting in our food order everything came out relatively quickly. Only thing was the ingredients came before the broth so we had to sit there looking at the food waiting for it to boil. For simple chicken and beef broth flavour it should have come out first.

The food is fresh and everything came except for 1 item...no biggie.

The sauce and drinks are self serve. This has its pros and cons.

Pro is you can get as much sauce as you want when you want versus having to ask and wait like other places. Same with the drinks (soy milk, plum juice or honey green tea). The sauces were a bit bland and runny for my liking.

Con for the drinks is that if it's busy you may have to wait in line and there is not much standing room there. For the sauces the same problem but it gets messy there so felt a bit dirty (may be my own perception but I prefer not having 100's of people touching my stuff.)

Refill of food order also came promptly.

I would rather drive to Richmond Hill but if I had to stay downtown I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with a hotpot restaurant in Toronto. I was apprehensive to try a new style of dining but it was one of the best experiences I have had so far. 

The quality of the meats/seafoods to the
Freshness of the vegetables was amazing compared to Korean barbecue spots around town.  There was a variety of sauces that made the food absolutely delicious all under the superb guidance of the manager/server. The service really stood out at this location and the experience turned out to be above average which was unexpected in this part of town. 

This restaurant is recommended to anyone who wants to try a twist on the Korean BBQ experience and wants to experience a new style of eating and oriental flavors. Its open very late even on weekdays so it's worth a try."}
{"text":"this place sucks. They also forgot some of our items and their rice is not even ready. We had to wait for 40 minutes because the kitchen just started to cook. There is an Asian waiter who wears a golden necklace looks like a gangster. We have been eating there like an hour. then he came to us and said : you passed the time limit, pay for the bill once you finished\" WTF is that??? If there is a time limit for eating there, you should tell customers before they start to eat. You can not just see a lot of customers coming in so that you start to ask existing customers to leave. It is so unfair and rude!!  I will spread the words and never come to this restaurant again!!"}
{"text":"Compare with other hot pot restaurants in Markham, Richmond Hill, and North York, it is far away from good. Their broths are either salty or blank and their drinks are also not good. $$$"}
{"text":"Great place for hotpot. Was a cool summer evening and decided to try this place out. Super friendly service and our food relatively came out quick in under 10 minutes which I thought was phenomenal. 

You have to try the Dat Sauce, that was great with all the Noodles, meats, veggies, hell it was great with everything. 

Tip was included, I thought that was clever. Maybe it's because of the area and people don't tip, I tipped on top for the great service. Icecream included! Must try when you're downtown or haven't tried hotpot before, highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was an average day walking up Spadina heading towards our usual dumpling spot when we fancied a shot of tequila to warm our chilled bones then BANG! We stumbled upon this gem of a foodery. Where do I start?? The servers speak great English, and explained how the menu worked, but best part is.... He noticed we were absolute new bags and literally took away the sauces we had proudly made  from the \"sauce bar\" and brought his own creation. I wanted to dislike it but how disappointed was I? He made our first bites for us and it was freaking AMAZING.
Best all you can eat I've been to in a long time. I can die happy (and 30lbs heavier) now.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Dat (our legendary server) for this fantastic experience. We will be back tomorrow. And the next day. And maybe Saturday.

Has tones of meat, veggies and seafood options on the menu and an extensive make your own sauce bar. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to try something new and have a great experience doing so :)"}
{"text":"This was my first hot pot experience since living in Toronto (been living in downtown for the past 21 years). There aren't a lot of hot pot options in downtown (since most of them are in uptown) so I finally grew a pair and tried this place out.

I was famished and in need  of something hardy. We arrive on a Sunday at 4:40PM. It was surprisingly a little busy. We sat by the door (BAD CHOICE...door kept opening and bursts of cold air gave me and my boyfriend shivers). Recommendation: ask to sit close to the back. We got seated and ended up waiting 5 minutes before the wait staff noticed we needed help. I had to flag them down to get a menu. C'mon...this shouldn't have happened (hence the 4 out of 5 instead of 5 out of 5).

The waiter explained the menu to us very fast (couldn't catch everything). He mentioned that some broths and menu items cost extra (such as the seafood - salmon, lobster tail, mussels, etc). We were given the seafood mix (1 plate each) for free...very nice compliment to our meal for sure. Loved it. This made up for the 5 minute wait.

In terms of drinks and sauces for your hotpot, the station is located beside the cash desk. Drinks (plum juice, soy milk and honey tea) were available. I'm pretty sure the soy milk was bought in bulk or across the street since the remaining bit of my soy milk had the powder taste during my last sip. Sauces (the usual: hoisin, peanut, soy, spicy, etc) were there...you can mix as much as you can. I like the sauces variety a lot.

Our food came all at once to cook. It was overwhelming since we literally ordered 1 of everything (and doubles of some). We were able to finish 95% of our order because we were STARVING. Recommendation: do not leave the noodles cooking for too long with the seaweed. The burning smell is very similar to the cigarette smell. I thought someone was smoking outside and the wind blew in..but he waiter said to take the stuff out of one of our pots because of that smell. He was right....

At around 6PM, it got really busy. Packs of 20 somethings and families came in. This is definitely a good sign.

OVERALL, I would say I enjoyed my experience a lot. Both me and my boyfriend needed a 2 hour nap when we got home because we ate to the max. It cost us $21-23 each person. Not bad considering we ate until we passed out. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Yay hoo! First to review! I tried last night,pretty decent and the late night hours is a bonus.i can tell the business owners are really trying hard.
The sliced  lamb and beef dishes are good!
Good service .will be back soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Constantly forgetting our items. Very inattentive servers. Used to be a good place to have hot pot but recently service is very poor."}
{"text":"Went here twice with my boyfriend & both times it was amazing. Even though the second time they kept forgetting our order our server was EXTREMELY nice, the people there are amazing the food is alright, i mean you gotta cook your own food, but no big deal. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I went to celebrity hotpot for a few times. It was pretty good in the beginning. However, i realized the food isnt clean and its a bit pricy as a hotpot place. I dont think its a good place for hotpot"}
{"text":"tl:dr Come here if you're hungry or if it's a really cold day outside. The warm food and staff will fix you right up! :)

Decent food and service, it's a nice place to chill with friends and family after a long day. I've had an enjoyable experience almost every time I've been here. The staff are generally very friendly and nice though their front door can be a little uninviting at times (it's a heavy door ). They have a decent selection of sauces and ingredients to choose from and an all-you-can-eat dinner would cost you around 25-30$, all inclusive. Which, in my opinion, is pretty worth it for the amount of satisfaction you can get. I'd definitely keep coming back as long as it stays this way!

edit: They took fish tofu off the menu!!! :("}
{"text":"Went to celebrity hot pot last night for second time. Same story. Enjoyed the great service from staff. Had such a great time cooking food. So satisfied. Highly recommend. This place is so dam cool."}
{"text":"Was on the way for a hot bowl of pho on a cold friday night and spotted this place and decided to try it out. The place was quite busy for a friday night around 6pm. Waited for a table for around 10minutes. The waiters were pretty nice and kept us updated with the table availability. Pretty good so far.

After getting a table, we went for the drinks / sauce station. It was really dirty and messy with spilled sauces everywhere on the countertop. Quite a few cups were badly stained (prob. due to tea), and it just makes the cups seem unappealing.

Now, the food. The cuts of meat were nothing special. Fresh, but very thinly slices. Meatballs were lacking. They should be firm but they just crumble to the bite. Each person was given a seafood plater (a piece of salmon, squid, mussel and shrimp). Tried the salmon and it didn't taste fresh. Some of the tofu choices were nice.

We got the half non-spicy and half spicy soup base. They were ok, nothing spectacular. Quite blend actually. Once the soup starts to evaporate, the waiters would fill it up with hot water. So the base just gets more blend over time. An example of how to do this properly would be at the \"Tripod king\" hotpot restaurant in Taipei would always fill the soup with more stock, never water.

Overall, the food was alright. Nothing special.

Now, comes the payment part. The waiter was nice to offer split bills among our group. Which makes paying convenient. 10% tip included just like all other reviews. However, I waited a long time to get my change before going to the cash register myself. This was understandable since it was at a busy time of the night.

First time getting the change, I was short changed. So I immediately indicated to the cashier about the wrong amount and hand him back the amount that I was given. Then he promptly recounted the proper change again as I watched. But as he handed me the change for a second time, he then squeezed a loonie between his fingers and handed back the wrong change again. Whether this was done on purpose or not, this pretty much sealed the deal for me on ever going back to eat again.

So to sum up, the experience at this mediocre restaurant starts on a good note and descends consistently to the end."}
{"text":"A pretty good place in downtown Toronto for hot pot.  There is free self served honey tea and soy milk as well as a sauce station to make your own hot pot sauce. The sauce station has a good variety of ingredients:sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, peanut paste, sesame paste, oyster sauce, scallions, chilli oil, chilli sauce and some others that I might not have used.

Came on Sunday and it was I think about $21 or $23 pretax and tip per person for the most basic option, on weekdays it is either $16 or $17 per person. The basic AYCE hot pot allows a beef and chicken broth soup and a veggie soup, tried both since we came with 3 people, both were decent. There are other fancier soup bases that costed more money.All AYCE hot pot comes with 1 tray of seafood with an oyster, mussel, shrimp, and salmon. The food quality of the AYCE hot pot ingredients was pretty food for downtown, all the veggies were fresh, no yellow or limp veggies (I have been to places where this occurs!), the meat and fish balls were not preboiled. Meats were thinly sliced for rapid cooking and good. 

The food came out at a decent pace, the only gripe I had is that I loveeee watercress and I had ordered larger orders since I didn't want to keep ordering. I felt like they only gave me 1 or 2 portions at a time even though I might have ordered 6, it is just slightly annoying to keep having to order repeatedly but I suppose they do it to prevent food wastage since I guess not everyone is fanatical about this veggies as me.

Overall a solid spot for hot pot."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend for family member's birthday celebration and was impressed by the place. Not only is there the large dual pots, you can also get individual pots of starter broth for those who don't want to share. 

The quality of meat is quite good and not overly fatty. They're sliced super thin, so that means you can order a wide variety of meats without worrying about getting full. In addition to all the options of veg, tofu, noodles and dumplings, there's certainly something for everyone. Seafood selection looks to be pretty decent on the menu as well but you're paying extra for those. There's one \"assorted seafood\" option that's free but it's limited to one per guest. From what I can remember, it includes one mussel, one shrimp, one slice of squid, and a small piece of salmon. 

The sauce station is neat with at least 12 different sauces you can mix and match. Beverage station is also in the same area with unlimited plum juice, soy milk, and honey green tea. 

My only complaint was that we had to chase one of servers down to have them fill out pots with hot water before they ran dry. 

Best part was after eating - everyone who had an individual pot was comparing their broth to see who made the best broth!

Icecream is included, but don't get too greedy. First scoop is free but subsequent scoops will cost you $1 each. And these are fairly small scoops too (think smaller than a lime). 

All in all, this is a great place for large groups of people to get together for hot pot. Make a reservation before hand and you'll be set up with a large table. Then all you need to do is pick your broth, and eat to your heart's content!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical hot pot place ... has everything a normal hot pot place has so nothing surprising at all.

First time we went for lunch and was laughing at their holiday tricks

Extra 2$ because it's a holiday
Tip included on a 10$ bill (ridiculous, would have given more tip but their loss).
Any soup base other than chicken or beef is extra 2-3$

Three stars because their selection is pretty limited in terms of meat / veggies. Also the service was kind of depressing ... waiters looked really sad"}

{"text":"Its authentic Chinese hot pot is all you can eat with a great value some of the dishes can be a little bit more fresh but overall its a good dining experience"}
{"text":"The celebrity hotpot is a nice and clean restaurant, with a wide selection of vegetables, staples, meat, and mushrooms. However, it was a pity that we have to pay more for the oyster mushroom, which is my favourite steamboat food. There are a lot of choices for the soup base as well. The tomyum one was really good! If you wanna go for the spicy one, make sure that you can handle chillies because it is pretty spicy. The boss is very nice and friendly and gave us icecreams for dessert. He even asked if we want to have more icecream before we leave. The place also has free flow drinks (sour plum, soybean, lemon green tea). My personal favourite is the sour plum one which is really refreshing. The food/ingredients are really fresh! Make sure that you try the fish balls. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 or 4 times and have never left disappointed. 
The meat is quite good, yet it's the veggies that steal the glory at celebrity.
The staff are efficient, and the manager (I think his name is Dat) is is super friendly and very kind.
Like the other reviews, I am annoyed by a tip being put on the bill preemptively, but I imagine that it is required based on the amount of effort and the turnover rates and crowd which is why it didn't cost them a star."}
{"text":"I would not go back or recommend. You will have much better experience going with another hot pot place in Chinatown. Morals, Mongolian and chine are better in terms of service and food. Overall, the people are hard working but I would rather cook at home."}
{"text":"While somewhat pricier than other hotpot places in the area, the quality of the ingredients is quite a bit better. Everything looks really fresh and theres a decent variety of items to choose from.
Had the spicy and the tom yum soup bases and they are both pretty good.

Peeves:
For some strange reason Enoki mushrooms are considered premium and carry an extra 2$ charge :/
Mandatory minimum 10% tips are automatically added to the bill. While the service is pretty good and I generally tip more, the mandatory part seems a bit offhand."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place came in not knowing what to expect but I am so happy I found it after trying it. Service was good I Ordered satay broth delicious a few different noodles some different sliced meats and a pile of fresh vegetables to cook in my broth. They have a huge selection of sauces but the one called Dat sauce is amazing \"for real\" I could drink it lol. Lastly I had the ice cream coconut which had real pieces of coconut in it and very creamy another plus. Will for sure be back and recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"The Dat sauce was amazing. Waiter made a special concoction for us as well and it was delicious. Must go!!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favourite hotpot restaurant in Toronto. The best part is not having to travel uptown to eat it :) The meat and veggies are fresh, the soup is yummy (I got Tom Yum & Satay). You have your own stovetop and pot vs. sharing one big pot which is a bonus for me, I tried one of their milk teas (Hong Kong Milktea) and it was really good, the servers were friendly and prompt if you needed anything, the decor is new & modern and probably the cleanest restaurant I've seen in Chinatown. I'm craving hotpot as I type this out... I give this restaurant a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Great value for hotpot that covers all the staples.  

Food
Very traditional hotpot with no gimmicks.  The menu has everything a hungry person would expect for hotpot.  It has all the basic meat and veggie options, with limited seafood selection (and those cost extra too).  Everything was clean!

Price
The price is in the low $20s with a few free soup bases.  That alone makes it very affordable for hotpot, compared to the Markham/Richmond Hill offerings.  

Service
Our pot was refilled with water periodically.  Food came out a bit slow, but that was because they like to bring it out all at once with plates stacked high.  

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience.  Drinks were free and they have a large dipping sauce station.  It is comparable with the quality of hotpot restaurants that are uptown, at a lower price point."}
{"text":"First time here and we like it a lot. We had all we can eat great meal. Every thing was fresh well worth the money. 
They also give you drinks with your meal great green tea.

While Celebrity Hotpot hit the spot on a rainy and cold day in Toronto, it's certainly not the best hot pot I've had.  The selection is also not as great.  They also forgot some of our items and it was sometimes hard to track any of the employees down.  Price is okay.  Restaurant is fairly newish and clean.

Celebrity Hotpot seems to charge extra for anything from mushrooms (enoki mushrooms are $2.... are you serious?) to squid to extra seafood.  Everywhere else I've been, they don't charge for this (in NY, in Ottawa, Atlanta, etc).  While the base price for eating here (per person) is reasonable, the extra charges for random things is a little meh.

Free drinks - plum, soy milk, and green tea.  Plum was delicious!

They have a variety of \"free\" items to choose from on their all you can eat menu.  There's the usual lamb, beef, vegetables, etc, and they give you a decent amount (but not way too much) each time.  I like that they don't overdo it with the servings because I feel bad when I can't finish.  Their ordering system is strange though... you put 1, 2, ... depending on how many what... servings? you want?  Or is it how many handfuls?  Or if you put 1, do you get like 1 fish ball?  It's a little confusing for sure and I can't imagine how a hot pot noob feels about eating here and the ordering process.  Quality of the ingredients was pretty good, I'd say.

The spicy broth - I've had better ma la tang at a lot of other places.  It's not got enough of the spicy oil in the broth.  However, still tasted good.

They have your usual ingredients to make your sauce, but I found it weird that their scallions were soaking in water.  They even have eggs for those who like to make the traditional hot pot sauce with a raw egg.

I was mostly turned off by the ordering process, the fact that we didn't receive a lot of our items, the unreachable attendants, and the so-so broth.  That being said though, still a decent place for hot pot."}
{"text":"Food was nice, would have loved a larger menu! Service was very good! Had to make the food so I wish I didn't enter the restaurant as hungry as I did! Was enjoyable regardless and the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Good service, variety- waiter did great job of keeping dishes coming initially and helping us mix a great sauce. Came at a less busy time but service dwindled as the place got more crowded, as it does.

Unfortunate that some broths and seafood were extra but those aren't necessary to enjoy the meal. 

Overall good experience, especially for people who have never had hotpot before."}
{"text":"We had to wait in line but there are four people who came after us got seated before us. We we then seated to a table meant for four people anyways. Apparently two of the stoves are broken and I had to switch my seat three time and it took 4 waitress to figure out which was broken. We ordered seafood on the side but it didn't come, had to ask again for them. Some of the food we ordered from the menu didn't come either. No one added water to our Hotpot and we had to ask when it was almost boiled dry (what if we didn't know you had to add water?) we went there during rush hour and the service wasn't great at all. Today, woke up 4am in the washroom, food poisoning! Argh, never come back here again."}
{"text":"Great hotpot, with ok price and decent service. Hotpot was good, tom yum broth is a kill. They have different sauces and condiments, but without the sauces or condiments already tastes great by itself. Ice cream at the end is great!"}
{"text":"I was watching a youtube video about eating shabu shabu and immediately googled places to eat that way in toronto, and this place popped up first, with the highest yelp reviews. I was really excited to try it. After work, me and a friend headed on over because we were close by. When we got there it was fairly empty (by the time we left, it was packed and people were waiting for a table).

I'll just get the negative stuff out of the way first. I had read about the variety of sauces they had, but when I asked one of our servers about it they said \"ohhh right right\" and walked away (what???). I had ordered udon and they just... didn't bring it. twice. when i asked about it they just kept giving me another order sheet until finally someone said they didn't have any. Lastly, the broth itself... was just okay. and I did not like that they came around and watered it down after a while.. I had wanted it to cook down to mix with rice at the very end, as I had seen done before. Because it was my first time there, I didn't know that they do that. Next time I go (and there will be a next time), I'll simply ask them not to.
Please keep in mind that these things didn't actually really bother me - I just want to leave a completely fair review. The service, overall, was pretty nice! Our servers were all very nice and personable. One asked if we had been there before, and when we said it was our first time, he joked that the only white people that go there are regulars haha.

I ordered tom yum broth, my friend ordered spicy, and we got a variety of meat, vegetables, dumplings, etc (we stayed clear of fish because we figure if it's flavouring the broth it might make more sense to stick with meat OR fish, not both.. or maybe that's extremely delicious, if anyone knows, please let me know)

Everything was good. Not \"oh my god!\" amazing, but good. Especially the freshness of the vegetables - that's what I found most appealing.

I really enjoy this way of eating. It's a really relaxed and fun way to have a meal. But I'm kind of a sucker for any kind of interactive meal. My favourite part was having noodles in the flavoured broth near the end. It's hard to rate the food when, besides the broth (which was just ok), you're essentially responsible for how your meal goes.

It came out to $56 for two people - both of us had water and didn't order any extra cost items on the menu. So that should give you a general idea of what it costs to eat there on a saturday night. 

My rating falls at a 3.5 but with a lack of .5 ratings, I've rounded it up to 4"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's not somewhere I go frequently, but it has turned into a bit of a special occasion place for friends.  It's not fancy, and it's about $20 for all you can eat hot pot.  They have an extensive selection of meats, veggies, seafood, and tofu to choose from, and it's not difficult to order vegetarian or vegan.  The sauce bar is amazing, too.

The service can be a little slow and the place can get crowded, but to me, it's always worth it.  Not a place to go if you want to get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Lunch special $9  hotpot, one meat one veggie one noodle! Good deal!  Ordered extra shrimp, 2 bucks. Tasty broth, good sliced beef, wonton, meat balls, good make-ur-own sauces, free soy milk. Good deal, would come back!"}
{"text":"Had the tom yum soup which was great. Loved their beef meat balls and udon. Didn't like their instant noodles or the spoiled fish. There's a slight language barrier with some of the servers. I'd return for the sake of convenience but I will be sure to check the food out before cooking it to ensure nothing smells funky"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Nice restaurant in Toronto's Chinatown area. Our waiter was great, made us a great spicy sauce to go with our meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good meal. I really liked the different sauces. Loved the noodles and my favorite meat was probably the beef. Price is okay, service is good. My only complaint is that the floors are pretty dirty for a restaurant. They need to be cleaned regularly."}
{"text":"The food and service is always excellent here. It's overpriced. $35 per person for dinner after tax. Been here for over 2 years and the owner always try to sneakily raise the prices. The hot pot soup based used to be complimentary. Now you have to pay for it.

Their hotspot selection is great and always fresh compared to many other Asian hotpot locations."}
{"text":"Tasty hot pot that was a 1st restaurant we tried when we visited Canada. Tried the tomyum soup, but not really hit me. However, their lamp soup?! (im not sure) was really good. Friendly and nice servers. Will come back if we have a chance."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and some spoke English and were very helpful. We were a little overwhelmed by the sheer number of items on the menu and may have over-ordered food (they brought out a little table extender lol) but we actually ended up eating almost everything.

The good: As others have noted, lots of sauces to flavor your food with, and all you can drink (self serve) soy milk, honey green tea, and plum juice. The bathroom was downstairs and when I told them it was out of tp, staff fixed the problem right away.

The good to know: Pictures would have been nice, especially for the variety of noodles on the menu, but we were able to get enough help from staff on this. They bring in one tray of mixed seafood per person for free but additional seafood orders cost more. Also, 10% tip was automatically included with the bill even though we were a party of three.

Would I recommend to a friend? Sure, it was clean, the food was decent and moderately priced for AYCE hotpot, and the service was friendly and good."}
{"text":"I'm a big guy, so I might know a few things about food lol. I was a huge fan of little sheep hot pot as I've gone to those in Canada, USA and in China for the authentic stuff. I've got to say, of all the Hotpot places I've been to, Celebrity Hotpot is definitely the top in my top 5 favourite places to eat at for an AYCE. The staff there are super friendly, and have always catered to whatever my friends and I have requested. Their iced tea is literally the best. Freshly brewed, made in store several times a day. The iced tea runs out but gets filled up quickly. I rarely ever come here with less than 4 people. The manager there is super nice too, he's working there every time we come. He always suggests us different sauces and soups, making our Hotpot experience really unique. I really hope Celebrity Hotpot comes to Mississauga, because the Hotpot we have there is mediocre compared to celebrity Hotpot. I would recommend this place 100% if you're looking for great Hotpot. The place is open late, just make sure you go before last call, like any other restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here in a Monday evening and lemme tell you the service was amazing. The server made us different special sauces for dipping that wasn't offered at the food station. Unlike other hot pot places they actually speak English and bring you everything you actually ordered! I tried the terry special soup base (+3.00) and it was amazing. It had different spices with a kick of hot. The server knew it was our first time eating there and cooked the first plate of beef for us."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table even though we were told it was probably a 10-15 minute wait. I usually don't wait longer than 10 minutes for a table merely out of principles, but my friends wanted hotpot and at the same time, I can't fault the restaurant as it was really busy. 

Once my friends and I were seated, chose our broth and food items, everything was brought to our table promptly. While there's a lot of choices for broth, majority of them are extra charges, only the beef and chicken, and vegetable and tofu broths are free. Seafood items are also charged extra, except they'll give you a tray of seafood (salmon, mussel and squid; a piece each) at no extra charge but limited one per customer. There are a lot of choices for meats and vegetables though. 

We also discovered that we didn't get some food items we ordered and got more of certain items (i.e. ordered 2 trays of beef but got 4 trays of it). We didn't bring it up to the staff as we figured it may be a hassle, so it's likely best to order a few items first and then order more later on. 

So while there are a few misses, we did like the fact that there's unlimited refills on drinks (self-serve) and service from the staff was pretty prompt for a busy restaurant when asking for more water to be filled in the pots or getting the bill. Overall, a decent hotpot place in downtown."}
{"text":"I went to this place having a mediocre experience at another hot pot place for the first time. Celebrity hot pot redeemed hot pot after going here. The food came out quickly even though it was busy that night, it was fresh and great tasting. I was happy with the selection of sauces and drinks they had. I only got the basics which I think is all you really need and paid 24$ for an all you can eat including tip and tax. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great choice in Toronto for authentic hot pot.  Food fresh, staff very friendly, prices were reasonable. Atmosphere ok.  Be aware, 10% tip automatically included."}
{"text":"For our last meal in Toronto, we decided to try hot pot. This was my first time, but not my husband's. Thankfully, Dat was there to guide us through the process! He made recommendations and mixed special sauces for us and otherwise made the experience special for us. 

My husband and I each got the lunch special, which is $8 and gives you a choice of broth, noodle, vegetable, and meat. We tried both the egg noodles and instant noodles, beef and lamb, daikon and bok choy, and the chicken/beef broth. We made a mess, but had a blast cooking everything up. The portions were very generous (especially for the price) and everything was fresh and delicious. A+++ will hot pot again!"}
{"text":"It was alright, but not the best hotpot I've had. It was a bit on the pricier side, and they charge extra for a lot of things.

On the plus side, they have a self-serve bar of sauces that you can mix and match. It includes fresh ginger, scallions, garlic, peanut sauce, sesame sauce, etc. Also fresh eggs for dipping, and fountain drinks."}
{"text":"This would be an OK hot pot restaurant. Its fairly new so the decor was nice and clean. The fish balls they have were amazing and the vegetables were fresh. The waiter was also very friendly. However, it was impossible for my friend and I to pick up a piece of lamb or beef slice without it breaking into small bits and pieces. I don't know if it has to do with the quality of the meat or if it was cut too thin. My friend and I also have AYCE hot pot once a month @ other restaurants in the GTA and we never felt sick (wanting to throw up or stomache) but both of us felt sick after having hot pot here."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"First time dining here and the food was delicious. Service was phenomenal. Our waiter took the time to explain the menu to us as well as bring us some dipping sauces he put together himself from the self serve bar. Service was super friendly which made the experience 110% more enjoyable. Will definitely come back and dine again!"}
{"text":"So it was my first time here as well as my first time eating hotpot and I have to say, it was pretty good. Drinks and side sauces are self serve so you help yourself and you get your own individual pot to cook in which is nice. I went with a group of 11 and we ordered a lot and still didn't manage to finish it all. Wait staff was attentive enough to refill our pots when it reduced down, however, I did take a star off because we put in an order for steamed rice that never came and when I inquired they said they would bring it out and they never did. Other than that I thought the food was good."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by complimenting the service at this restaurant! The server made my experience very easy as a first time hot pot rookie.

The food itself was fresh and delicious. Although abit bland but that may be due to my broth selection and inexperience selecting the many varieties of sauces. Make sure to ask for a seafood plate of you're having dinner, it's one per customer.

I would have liked some more premium seafood cuts; scallops, oysters, crab."}
{"text":"We came her for dinner our first night in town and made it a priority to eat here again before we left. Service is awesome, super friendly staff. After the waiter found out it was our first time he came back with multiple sauces that he put together. Drinks, good. Food, great. I would definitely come here all the time if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 14-16 or something for a TLC dinner meet up. Reserved at 6:30 p.m. and me and my friend were the first ones to arrive. Surprisngly it was extremely empty with maybe only 2 other tables with people eating on the main floor. However we didn't start eating until about an hour at most later waiting for the rest of the people attending. 

The staff was extremely nice to us and didn't push us to rush at all and you can redeem your check in offer when you pay at the end :)

I got the free soup bases which was the vegetable and beef, nothing great, just basic vegetable broth with vegetables in it and the other was probably beef bone broth with also vegetables in it but it also had 3 tiny pieces of tofu in it.

The friend sitting next to me ordered the spicy broth and it had lots of dried red peppers in it. I didn't get to try it but from his reaction he seemed to like it. 

The beef slices we recieved had quite alot of fat on them (about 50-60% of the slice was fat) and according to the other table of friends they just got mostly fat (80-90% fat). The lamb slices were nice, I didn't try the pork but no one complained about it. 

What made me really confused was that I ordered 2 watercress for the first round, and it was pretty small so I ordered 3 in the second round and it was the same size/amount I recieved the first time LOL. 

Also, when we ordered beers, the first corona my friend had, had a lime in it. But the second beer he ordered there wasn't?!? LMAO idk just thought it was funny.

Overall they have a really large selection for animal parts such as beef tongue, beef tripe, and chicken feet. The pork blood was disappointing because it had no taste (tasted like pork-blood-textured water.

At the end of your meal you get 1 free icecream scoop and damn do they have a nice selection of icecream, I think they had about 8 different kinds !?!?! Amazing."}
{"text":"Comfy sofa seats. Comfy environment. Great service. 

Went on a Thursday. Got to choose to sit on wherever I want at time like 3.30pm.

Love the sweet soy milk. (Unlimited)

Well organization - food stacked in square plates - increased my appetite when I see the table of food.

I nearly chose all the food on the menu! All perfect! 

Aware when you chose organs: they taste good but I can not accept the smell of them before putting into the pot.

The spicy soup base was too spicy for me.

It's a nice place to spend with people you love."}
{"text":"We were both feeling for hot pot for a while and decided to try out celebrity hot pot after work on a Monday. We left work fairly early and ended up going to eat around 4:45pm when it was not busy at all. 

I have never eaten out for hotpot before so I was interested to see what the hype was about. We were seated right away and had he menu explained to us. There were two menus; one for the choice of broth, and the other for items to cook in the broth. We were also told about their free self-serve drink, as well as a sauce station with a good number of ingredients to make your own hot pot sauce. I just went with water and some garlic hot pepper sauce.

We ordered slices of chicken, beef, sausages, beef and fish balls, seafood tray, instant and vermicelli noodles steamed rice and some random veggies. Honestly it wasn't bad, but there was nothing amazing about the food. They did forget to bring us our rice and vermicelli...so we had to remind them.

Overall the food was just like any other hot pot. I think next time I crave hot pot I will do it at home with friends versus going out and spending $24 per person after tax for AYCE."}
{"text":"Really like this place - it's always so busy and bustling with people. Try the Szechuan broth! We did not enjoy the spicy broth however... Not enough flavour and too spicy (and we generally love spicy Indian and Hakka food)."}
{"text":"Highly understaffed, unsanitary, Ok-food. 

Visited on a Friday evening and it was a full-house but only had two servers. Being understaffed made service very poor - brought out the wrong soups, and missed orders. We didn't get any veggies until 1-hour in despite ordering it the first round. Soup is refilled by pouring in hot water in the broth with a kettle.

The food had fruit flies in it...

There is a good variety of food, a station to make your own sauce, and drinks station that included honey green tea, prune. 

Dat was a great server who explained to us the menu, and made a special sauce for us. He tried his best to accommodate my table however it was not an overall pleasant dining experience and I do not plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"Compared to other hopot places, food is very fresh and have a wide range of selection. Customer service is really good and it have all you can drink soy milk and pump juicy. Also, everyone get their own pot instead of sharing the pot with other people. 

Price is similar to other hotpot places. 

However, the wait is too you. On a friday night, 4 people need to wait around 40 mins. Thus you better book reservation in advance.

I will give it four stars if it is not in china town. Transportation is kind of Inconinveient ."}
{"text":"Although it's a holiday weekend, the level of poor service I got was not excusable. Was ignored by staff and waited 15 minutes to be seated, then food took 30 minutes to arrive. Eventually told them I was going to leave if food didn't arrive in three minutes. Don't know if it's that I didn't look Asian enough, but we got service after others who arrived after us. Really bad taste in my mouth at this place."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Typical China town ambience. Average all you can eat prices. Really takes you down memory lane and back to you roots. Hot pot is great for a fun and different way to eat! And even more amazing choice during the winter - the setting and food makes you all warm and fuzzy inside. 

Must tries: 
Honey Green Tea (included in the all you can eat drinks)
Coconut ice cream
Red bean ice cream
Satay based soup 
Drunken chicken based soup
Daikon - lots of daikon!
Lots of garlic and cilantro in your dipping sauce

Tip: don't wash your hair before you come here. Your hair and clothes is going to reek of the hot pot smell which can be over bearing once you leave the restaurant.

Fun fact: The Weeknd's \"Pretty\" music video was shot in this exact restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"As far as hot pot goes, the food was pretty standard, the price was ok. 

We were seated by the door, and it was super drafty. They refused to close the outermost door (we tried, they explained to us why the outer door must be propped open....). With every order, we had to wait 30 minutes for they do deliver some RAW FOOD, I don't understand why it takes so long, and about half of the stuff we ordered never came. The plum juice was watered down, there was never any cilantro in the bucket, 

Pro: Their magnetic plates that only heat up the pots are cool
Cons: Pretty much everything else except service/servers attitudes, service was solid."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have had hot pot before (it's our family's traditional Christmas dinner), but this was the first time for us at a hot pot restaurant. We really had no idea what we were walking into. Thank goodness the folks at Celebrity Hotpot were so nice and really took the time to explain to us how to order the broths and items on their three double-sided forms, as well as giving advice on how to make really good sauces. Phenomenal. Yes, they automatically charge a 10% tip, but there is constant re-filling of the broth, plus monitoring for more orders, etc. Kids 10 and under eat for half-price. Daughter loved the strawberry slush (extra charge) and the star cartoon that is the restaurant's logo. Find the scuba diving star!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having hotpot with my own individual soup pot (not my first time having hotpot ever, calm down everyone). I really loved this spot. They have an incredible variety of food AND vegetables, sauces and all the assorted meat parts you want. They have a self-serve drink station with cold honey ginger tea, soy milk (the real stuff) and plum drink. 

Service is really good and the food comes quickly. The soup selection is fantastic. 

I had the spicy and satay soup, both great bases to cook your food in. For some reason, we didn't have slotted spoons at our tables, which was a bit challenging, but we had ladles, which is almost as good. Also, again, the individual soup pots, so I could double dip (or recook undercooked food) as much as I wanted. 

This is a fantastic place for hotpot. The only thing is that you have to pay at the counter, so bring cash if you want to get out quicker. Oh and make a reservation, this place gets busy."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of hot pot but I was dragged here. It is an all you can eat hot pot ($22).  There is a huge variety of soup bases as well as meat, seafood, and veggie options.

You make your own sauce and your own drink refill of plum juice, soy milk, or honey green tea which is cool and sometimes annoying when you have idis and too lazy to get your own refill. Not me... just speaking on behalf of my friend...

They didn't complain or charge us even though there was quite a few dishes we couldn't finish. 

There is also ice cream for dessert, green tea, mango, vanilla, chocolate, red bean, and coconut (sold out when I was there :( ). 

Service was great, they explained how everything works and was very nice when we constantly asked for more corn every 5min. 

Although I despise hot pot, can't complain about the service and the many options to choose from.

Will recommend this place."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COST

Worst dinning experience ever. The place was disgusting with tables of dirty dishes and incompetent workers. I'm from New York and have had plenty of bad experiences but this is by far the worst. I had no problem waiting  but 45 mins for the broth and then another 20 mins for the actual food is beyond ridiculous. Not to mention that the sauce station was completely empty for 30 mins even though I asked the staff multiple times for them to fill everything. The drink station was also completely empty for about 30-45 mins and this was around 8PM. 
     I honesty don't understand how they're in business, it's a horrible operation. They need to add more staff who are capable of doing simple tasks such as filling up the drink and sauce station. How do you expect anyone to eat hot pot if there's no sauce?! I only wish I was exaggerating.
     Thanks to the table of ladies who actually complained to the owner/manager about their horrible experience and how unacceptable it was cause they said everything I was about to. There were plenty of other people who were upset or disgusted as one table walked out but I think most were just amused by the disgusting and chaotic operation.
     I do not suggest that anyone goes there for hot pot. Avoid at all costs. Trust me, you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"my go to spot when I'm downtown and craving hot pot

in all honestly I'm not sure what it is but I love hot pot. to most people it's bland since you just boil veggies and meat but to me I feel like it taste good since I cooked it myself (lol?) 

clean restaurant super fast turn over time from handing over orders to recording soup base and items of choice. 

personally I always get the satay/Tom yum soup base."}
{"text":"the soymilk is so gooood. make sure to ask him to make the special sauce cuz its so gooooooood!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It is in the centre of West Chinatown so it would be very convenient to stop by and keep warm on very cold days. 

We stopped by here on a weekday night and the dinner all you can eat price was only $19.99. The price is worth it's not so great quality. The food was decent, and edible, nothing too exciting. There was also not many different types of broths to choose from, there were extra charges for some of them too. Some items like a variety of mushrooms and seafood were all also extra charges which didn't give much to choose from. 

It was very uncomfortable eating there since the entire restaurant was very unsanitary. Many dead bugs near the table and window from the booth we were sitting at. And there were so many flies flying around the sauces self-serve table. Some flies were also in some of the sauces. As well flies were flying around during our entire meal. They are literally everywhere. The utensils provided were also not cleaned properly and were still dirty. 

They were also understaffed. Only one worker serving all tables during the busiest dinner rush. However, one reason why I didn't give this place any lower was because of his service. Even though, it was busy and only him on the floor, he still was very friendly and assured all guests received all orders and enjoyed their meals. Here and there we had some small talks and laughs with him, which made our dinner a bit more enjoyable. 

I guess I recommend this place if you're desperately wanting some Hot Pot, but until they fix their bug problems, it would be difficult for me to go back."}
{"text":"As usual - this place was delicious. 

This time we ordered the spicy and chef special soup base.

We tried the following items:

-sweet corn (cooked in the broth is actually the most amazing thing there)
- wood ear mushrooms
- coriander
- lamb
- sliced pork
- sliced beef
- sliced lamb
- sliced pork jowl
- taro noodles (my favourite)
- deep fried tofu
- pork and leek dumpling 
- wonton
- beef/pork/shrimp balls
- tripe (it was cut way too thick and was hard to eat - wouldn't order again)

This place is great to gorge on meat and gorge we did. The meat was yummy and the soup base and custom sauce flavourful. Their cold tea drink was very refreshing but honestly the cold water felt much better because of the steam from the boiling pot.

I double tipped as usual because honestly my favourite waiter works there and he is one amazing and dedicated person.  He is very personable and very helpful - an asset to this establishment. It's the sweet bubbly guy - you know who you are!

I recommend trying as many new foods as you can when you go because I've been doing this and found I have new favourite foods.  

My only recommendation to this establishment is cleaner bathrooms and seats that are abit cushioned because their food is great - no complaints here! 

This place is great for couples, families and people just looking for a great filling meal."}
{"text":"Very very decent hot pot. The broth is clean and compliments the ingredients well. I like the honey green tea and overall it's clean. It's one of the better Ayce hot pot places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good value and selection of food for individual hot pot experience. Service is okay, but for Chinatown and what you pay, I'm a fan and the 10% off offer when you check in on Yelp is always a bonus."}
{"text":"This place was great! After tax and tip, it was like $23 per person for all you can eat, including all you can drink Honey Tea/Soy Milk/Plum Juice, and you get your money's worth. The servers were all really nice, and be sure to ask for the sauce master. He makes the best sauces, and he just came up and gave us a few that he made. Both were very delicious. The broth was delicious, and we ordered until we were stuffed. It's honestly the perfect experience for a cold Toronto day. Hotpot is also a great experience in and of itself, so I highly recommend people to try out this place. :)"}
{"text":"If you like Hotpot, this is the place for it! You really can't ask for more, Celebrity Hotpot provides everything you could and would want for your hot-soup-dipping-needs. 

If you haven't tried shabu shabu, hotpot or the like- the premise is really simple. You get your veg, meat, noodles, or other food accessories and you dip them in hot bubbling soup. Everything cooks relatively quickly, so food to mouth time is faster than you may think despite the fact that you are indeed cooking for yourself. It's really the mise en place that everyone hates afterall right? Dunk, dip, eat, repeat.

Celebrity works sort of like an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi joint, or dim sum restaurant. You get a checklist of sorts with all your options there, you number them off and the server fetches your stuff. It's only AYCE here and the assortment of things to order from are overwhelming. There are so many things to choose from (10+ different veg options, seafood, 8+ meats, 5+ noodles, etc.) you won't be hungry after this. It's also really great for vegetarians for this reason, and that every person gets their own cooking pot too. The food comes quickly because it's all raw, but while you wait (given that you are super impatient) you go and mix up a sauce at the sauce stand for dipping all your soon-to-be-cooked noms.

The sauce stand is quite extensive (which is a big plus), you can choose from so many options from different oils, to hoisin, oyster, peanut, sesame, chive, fermented tofu (!!!), soy sauces, etc, etc. So the number of combinations are virtually limitless - it's fun to try new things and make a few sauces until you mixed the perfect one (just remember the recipe). 

Another great thing is that the atmosphere is usually busy and lively. It's a large space with a range of different sized tables with different number of burners, respectively. So it's a great place for groups and parties or for slightly more adventurous dates.

There is also a mini drink stand where you can get unlimited soy milk, sweet tea, and plum juice... it's included in the $21-$24 price so I'm not complaining. You can order bubble tea or pop as well, that's extra.

Last, dessert comes free in ice cream form. It's actually great ice cream too, the same stuff you get from The Big Chill (I asked, they confirmed). Order the coconut, it's so friggin good.

Overall, I've been to Celebrity many times now. It's definately my choice Hotpot place, downtown or uptown."}
{"text":"Honestly I want to love this place. I have gone about 3 times and I've tried! It's so tasty! But I get sick EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!  it's good tasting but if you have a sensitive stomach - I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Unlimited green tea! You can make your own sauce with many options. There were many side dishes to choose from too, and the soup was soo good. A very good and filling meal ^^"}
{"text":"Love the decoration. They have a jellyfish aquarium!!!!

This is a place in where you can spend two hours without notice. It has a casual/modern atmosphere, and a lot of entertainment sources: Aquarium, Tvs, music, normal, and \"eclectic\"people walking around (and sometimes looking at you eating), full bar, all you can eat, and no limit time to satisfy every degree of gluttony. 

I love Chinese hot pot places because they offer interactive food. You can condiment it, cook it, fish it, or eat it the way you like. It would be cool if this place offer the noodle making show at the tables.

The service was ok. The waiter asked us if we ever been there or in a hot pot, with our affirmation he left us the menus. One for choosing the flavors of broth, other for picking the food items. They have a reasonable amount of vegetables and meats, however, the seafood was limited, and in lobster case, a charge for extra $10 would apply.

On the other hand, all the veggies and meats we ordered were fresh and with good quality. I just would advice the restaurant to pay attention to the portions, because we were 2, and every order of veggies looked like for 4 people. When we saw all the trays on the table at the same time, we felted overwhelm by the huge amount of food we ordered. In an all you can eat place, part of the magic hinge on tasting a bit of everything you want.

It is also really cool that the place has some free drinks and all kind of sauces.

After some pauses, tea, and undoing our pant's buttons, we fulfill the auto-imposed task of finishing everything we asked for...

The only bad experience for my partner was in the washrooms. He said that they were the most stinky and dirty washrooms he had ever seen... Guaj!"}
{"text":"I am living on the margin of curiosity here. Their beverage fountain propounded me something I've never sipped before, plum juice.
What is up with plump juice? I was expecting the occurrence of something much sweeter. It's like lemonade and brine. 
I cried on the first sip, gag on the second but loved it on the third."}
{"text":"The day I came one of the waitresses spilled hot water on herself and paramedics came in to treat her. I think she tried to carry the pot back to the kitchen and slipped in the process. The overall quality of the food is not great, the selection is average and the spicy soup base tastes off. I would have given a 3 star review however I really think this restaurant needs to start looking into workplace safety. Some of the workers were carrying not one but TWO pots of boiling water at once with no safety equipment or gear. Even after the incident, the manager didn't even warn against carrying those pots of boiling water. I understand that it was a busy night however I would feel much more comfortable if the workers were better protected. Worker safety should be a top priority!"}
{"text":"Fam, the sauce bar, THE SAUCE BAR. Like 100 points if you've got a bomb sauce station, 100 points if it's covered and clean (*cough* Chine *cough*), 100 points if there are unlimited beverages beside it, and 100 points for the eggs. 

Realistically, the sauce bar makes the hot pot experience for me because most of the time, the lamb, beef, and chicken just taste the same. But NOT WHEN YOU HAVE A BOMB-ASS SELECTION OF SAUCES. Large selection of meats and veggies that are pretty standard... and service is well... standard for a Chinese restaurant. It wasn't terribly busy the night I went, so the food just kept coming right out. Would go again for the sauces doe."}
{"text":"All you can eat hotpot, great to go with group and enjoy a social meal."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite Hotpot restaurant in the whole GTA area!

I'm not a big fan of Hotpot because I don't usually like how they make their soup bases but Celebrity makes their Tom Yum soup - which is my favourite soup, perfectly. 

There's a huge selection of meats, seafood and vegetables to choose from and I love the fact that you can make your own sauce yourself or you ask the manager (Dat) to make his special sauce which is delicious and for some reason none of my friends are able to copy it. There's also a self serve green tea and plum juice station as well. 

The restaurant itself is nice and clean and the service is goes beyond expectations because of how attentive all the staff are to your needs and wants. 

Definitely recommend Celebrity Hotpot!"}
{"text":"Went there recently with friends. Love the unlimited soy milk and plum juice. Additional soup base is a bit pricy tho, for what it is"}
{"text":"their service is tooo bad
sooooo slow
we've ordered a pitcher of beer but we've got it 40mins later and it's all foam
there's a long lineup but It's just because they just can't handle or organize it...
 I don't think it's worth it"}
{"text":"Came in at what appeared to be a busy time as a fairly large group had just left...

Wasn't sure whether or not to seat ourselves (as there were people already coming in trying to get ahead - also no signage or reception desk to speak of) so we proceeded to do so and were then told to wait upon reaching a table.

Now, no one had explained anything to us and handed us sheets of paper to place our orders.  Little did I know and we ordered a double sided pot for 2 of Tom Yum.  Soup was alright but again I wasn't sure of this hot pot concept. 

So I assumed you place the items in the pot to cook... More or less it made sense but the first order we placed didn't include any veggies just the proteins and as we were waiting for them to arrive the soup seemed to be overcooking so it has to be turned down.  

Biggest mistake was to order more meat as we were u sure of the portions at first and wanted something to go with our veggies.  

What killed me the most was that no one had asked us of we wanted any drinks the whole entire time and no one advises us that there were flavorings and sauces hidden behind a wall..     The one employee who had initially told us to wait to be seated had ignored us the few times I had called to him and only came by once he saw that my bf was pissed off.  Only then did we understand what was going on and had the basic soup base the whole time with no drinks.. Thanks for letting us know after the fact.  

All I know is that upon driving home I never ran to the washroom so fast after a meal and was sick the next day and had to take off work.  

Wow. Wow. Wow. Never again.  Thanks for the discount still but I am now biased for all hot pot places. Ugh."}
{"text":"Our first experience with hot pot. The manager was excellent and provided lots of guidance. We had the beef/chicken broth and the lamb broth. Both were excellent. He also brought over two dipping sauces that were very tasty (much better than what we came up with on our own from the create your own dipping sauce bar). We loved the beef and lamb, tendon, the rice cakes, fish balls, Napa, Bok Choy, and spinach. Actually, there wasn't anything we didn't like. Excellent service and lots of offers for refills. The plum juice was \"interesting\" (still not sure if I like it or not, but very glad I got to try it). Overall, a tasty and entertaining meal. Well worth the cost and good quality for all you can eat. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Alright! Find myself returning to this place more than others. My fav hotpot place in town and found it better than scarborough or morals villages near by."}
{"text":"An abundance of vegetarian and vegan options!! Hotpot to me screams meat-based broths, raw meat slices, fish balls etc, so I was so pleasantly surprised to see at least 3 vegetarian/vegan broths (we all had the veggie and tofu broth which is 1/2 that has no additional $3 charge, but other veg options include wintermelon, Chinese herbs) and a huge list of fresh veggies (from taro to fresh spinach to lotus root) and lots of tofu (silky, frozen, curds). There's also an abundance of meat and seafood options obviously, and everything was nicely thinly sliced and so fresh looking. Tip- don't go crazy with ordering because portion sizes are huge especially for veggies, so order 1 per 2-3 people then order more if you have to later to reduce food waste (I don't think they penalize/fine you for leftovers if you leave them undisturbed). Unlimited sauce and beverage (sweetened soy milk, plum juice, honey green tea) refills. Each person can get their own pot and stove top. 

Price is very reasonable for the amount of food we ordered (ayce), $23 including tip (10% tip automatically added). 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good options, good service, nothing more you can really ask of hot pot!"}
{"text":"Update: the place seems to be under new ownership, the selection is roughly the same as before, although no more plate of seafood included for each customer. The food quality has gone down and the kitchen seems to be running out of everything such as lamb, ox touge ect. The orders are all messed up for each table too. I am not sure if it's gonna improve overtime or not. I will avoid this place for now. 



Older version: Very good selection on variety. From what I can tell, it is cleaner than most restaurants in China town. You are gonna get a pretty good hotpot experience if you know what you are doing."}
{"text":"There was a LIVE cockroach in our food.. there's a first for everything but a squirming cockroach nesting itself in a plate of rare beef should never be one.

When we notified the staff with horrified faces he literally took a glance and just wisped the plate away with no explanation only to come back 5 mins later with a replacement plate of beef.. really?

The worst part about this experience was that there was absolutely no apology and their attitude that zero fs were given. I think what's more appalling than their questionable food safety standards was their poor service and lack of professionalism in dealing with this situation. 

Needless to say I am never coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a friday night at 6pm with a larger group of 6. It was still fairly empty but by the time we left at 8.30 the place was definitely filled up. I was really worried about coming here with the less than desirable reviews from others about cleanness, but I thought it was ok didn't seem as bad as others made me think it would be. 

With tax and tip it comes up to be $32 for all you can eat, which is ok. I chose the free meat stock broth, which had good flavour but also felt like it did have msg in it, and salty but in a good way. There is a good variety of items to choose from however not the highest quality, the salmon and dumplings were definitely picked up in the budget section. 

The self served sauce station had lots to choose from and I love that they had unlimited honey green tea (so yum) But the line can build up and its in an awkward place that causes people to bunch up. 

The service wasn't the greatest, clueless staff, slow to bring out items, and never turned on the pots for us leaving us to figure it out ourselves. This place also lacks ventilation, the windows were dripping from condensation and you will leave smelling like hot pot for a week."}
{"text":"My first hot pot experience.  For $22 they give you like 20 different meets, vegetables, noodles and more.  We couldn't finish all the food.  The food and service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some shabu shabu or hot pot this weekend. After looking up the reviews, we decided to give this restaurant a try.

I believe this restaurant opened about a year ago or so and the inside looked relatively modern. We were seated promptly and the waiter was nice in explaining to us how to order. We ordered the beef/chicken stock and the vegetable stock with various meats and veggies.

Things just went downhill from here. We were shown the area where to get the sauces and the drinks. There were over 10 different sauces and condiments. However, it seems that they were kept at room temperature. Even worse, when my girlfriend went for the chilies, a cloud of fruit flies flew out of the jar. Disgusting.

Going back to our table, the broth arrived. They were both bland and lacked seasoning. I wouldn't be surprised if those broth were just bought off the shelf as they lacked both depth and flavor. There is no way these were simmering or cooked for hours like it should properly have been done.

The meats were OK but nothing spectacular. The waiter forgot some of the veggies that we ordered. Because of the broth, everything lacked flavor. We added some soy sauce to the broth and we were hoping that with all the ingredients, the broth would get better over time. However, when the level of the broth got low in the pot, one of the waiter just dumped WATER to refill it, diluting what little flavor the broth had! What the hell? I seriously doubt the kids working there have even tasted this food.

At $22 per person, I would've expected something a bit better. Oh, they also automatically charge 10% tip. At 50$+ for two, I would suggest to go get a better meal somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service and food were great. I was especially pleased that they had a vegetable soup base as I'm vegetarian. The experience I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative for Korean BBQ and Japanese sushi if you want something that has the all you can eat option. There are many things on the menu like mushrooms, beef, crab, lobster, chicken, pork, spinach and more! 

You basically cook everything inside a pot and you have bases like ramen noodles, udon, rice, spinach noodles and more to eat with your toppings. They give you a variety of sauces like garlic, hoisin, peanut, hot sauce etc. 

AND the honey green tea they have available is the bomb! Worth the 5 stars and my money!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. My girlfriend and I were in Toronto for the weekend and decided to try hot pot for the first time. Not only did our host walk is through step by step how it was done, he helped us order, made recommendations and even made us a special sauce. To top off the already amazing service, he offered to refill our water bottles we had been carrying around, and put them in the fridge until we were done our meal. 

Hands down the best service I have ever had in my entire life, furthermore the food was amazing. Try the spinach noodles with their special sauce. 

Overall amazing food, reasonable prices, fantastic service. I'll be back for sure.

- made a yelp account just so I could write a review on this place, that is how impressed I was by the service and food."}
{"text":"you can have one large pot to share with everyone or have your own individual pot to cook things in. there are a lot of sauces, and free drinks. There are also raw eggs placed in ice in that area.our orders came incredibly slow. we were already hungry and were practically ready to just boil an egg and eat it. Some dishes were mixed up as well(got radish instead of rice cake).  food was decent. the meat was sliced incredibly thin, which made it easy to cook, but easy to over cook as well. we were seated in the middle, but even then every time the door opened it was absolute freezing. No where on the ordering sheet did it say that tip was already included in the bill nor did the waiter mention it so i ended up tipping extra...  I would go again, but only when I'm in the area and really craving hot pot."}
{"text":"If you like scalding hot soup spilled on you by the waiter, this place is your first choice. If you like to stay warm while you eat, have a nice hotpot meal to warm you up, and believe you can go to the restroom toasty, you WILL NOT GO HERE. Seated for 8, there was a table beside the window where there is no option to relocate and there is no warmth. Try to use the restroom without your jacket and you'll freeze your butt. We order 80 wontons (10 is fairly reasonable for the size of our group), AND THEY BRING US 15 (seriously how to split that between 8 people is a joke. We waited at least 30 minutes before asking for 100 this time to make up for last time. Obviously they believe we can't finish it so they ask us multiple times \"Are you sure\" yes we're sure can you not see 8 hungry customers. After sitting there with half of our food ordered 2 hour wait is not worth. This is not AYCE it's AYCD (All You Can Drink) soy milk and plum juice  In the end we couldn't wait another hour so we left swearing to never visit this place again. 26$ including mandatory tip for this beautiful life experience with friends makes me not want to go out to eat. Never again."}
{"text":"Very great hotpot place! Food was great and  lots of choices for the sauces.
the honey tea is pretty good.
Service is good, tip was included in our bill, which I did not mind."}
{"text":"1 star for service, 1 star for using their washroom. The soup is terrible. I question why some people rated it 5 stars? Price is not competitive, food so so. Little Mongolian Sheep is so much better!"}
{"text":"Food was good and service was attentive.  Nice to pick your own sauces to mix and match.  The decor of the main dining area was nice (even though there was a lot of steam from the hot pots the atmosphere didn't show it).  

The bathrooms were disgusting though.  There must had a problem as it looked like it was being fixed."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for hot pot. It's an all you can eat hot pot place, so don't expect top notch service ... Like any other all you can eat places, but it's very decent! The food is always good. My favourite broth is the tom yum. I like the self serve sauce bar, so much easier than having to ask your server for more sauce!! The all you can drink comes with honey green tea, soy milk & plum which is a pretty great idea. Overall I would definitely recommend this place, the manager Dat is extremely helpful & nice. This place can get really busy so if you plan to go call ahead!"}
{"text":"If only Austin, TX had something like this. I was spoiled by a coworker during my quarterly trip to Toronto last week. He knows how much I love Asian food (all kinds) and added a Hot Pot place on the list of places to dine. 

I really loved the set-up with the burners installed at the table. I chose two broths and started checking things off the list to cook up. They have an unlimited sauce bar and offer 3 different drinks (green honey tea, soy milk and I forgot the 3rd one) with the meal. I had the chicken/beef broth and then a spicy one. I added everything from beef to seafood to mushrooms and just kept asking for more until I couldn't move. 

The service was great and I really enjoyed the very casual atmosphere. 

I will definitely be back and looking for an excuse to fly back up so I don't have to wait 3 months to experience this again."}
{"text":"Tips is including your bill. Be careful to pay double tips, they don't mention the bill is included tips. I don't recommend this place.
Because vegetables are not fresh( it was terrible) tofu and noodles are still ok. Service was terrible,too. I went to the cashier to get water. And Everytime when we needed something, we went to find the waiter( just one waiter there is and he was not attentive) 

I strongly recommend do not come here,
You are better to go somewhere which is worth to spend your money.

I will never come back this place again!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Only one server during lunch hour. Asking to get a refil for my coke took no less than half an hour. Absolutely terrible service!"}
{"text":"Great place and the waiter was so helpful since it was our first time having hot pot. It was so fresh and filling and they kept brining more and more! It's all you can eat for a good price! I will come back if I'm ever in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I was passing by Toronto for a day with a few of my friends, and we decided to get hotpot for a late dinner. We got to the store around 10pm on a Monday night and ordered the all-you-can-eat hotpot for $23. The broth was flavorful and the side orders were fresh and plentiful! By the end of the meal, we were happy and stuffed! When we left the restaurant, my friend realized she forgot her phone at the restaurant. By then, the store was already closed but instead of driving there to pick up the phone, one of the workers drove to where we were and returned the phone. I've never met anyone as kind and caring! Thank you so much!! Great food! Great people! Couldn't ask for better!"}
{"text":"Myself and seven of my friends came here today for lunch and it was empty considering our reservation was at 11:45am (thought it'll be busy since it was a really nice day/weather). Which was nice though, since our broth and trays came out quickly and no waiting at the self serve station. The service was great, didn't pressure us to finish and leave, and cleared the empty trays when needed.

This was my second time eating hot pot outside the comfort of my home and was pleased with everything. It was nice to have some friends (well, four of them) who have never had hot pot so explaining and showing them how to was fun, and fun for them too!

Personally, I'll definitely come back, maybe around 1-2pm (people were slowly coming in around then) so it's not so weird being the only ones in the restaurant, ha. Maybe sometime in the evening as well, but not in the weekends because it seems like they'd be busy then."}
{"text":"Like some others, I'm giving 3.5 stars, but rounding to 3 because there aren't any half stars. The food came out really quickly, which is impressive, considering that there were so many people that night. It's hard to flag someone down though if you want to put in an order - you really have to shout at them or wave your hand a lot to catch their attention.

I like that they have soybean milk, honey green tea and plum juice that you can fill and re-fill whenever you like. Given that this is ayce, I was also impressed by the portions that they give you on each order. I think the food quality is good, and I like that each person has their own pot so each person can pick their soup base.

Agree with other people, though, that there can be a lot of flies, most likely because the amount of raw food around?"}
{"text":"My go to hotpot spot , perfect for the chilly weather or when you're craving soups. Can accommodate big groups on short notices as well"}
{"text":"Pretty good... the service was great, very nice young lady. The food was good... small portions but it's all you can eat so doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Worst soup based I've ever had.. almost tasteless. Place was also very cold, half the people were wearing their winter jacket while eating."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends this past Canada Day. I suppose hotpot isn't how most people would choose to celebrate confederation of our great nation, but we had an amazing time and absolutely no regrets.

The service here is incredible; very relaxed and friendly, but still attentive. A couple of us weren't familiar with hotpot, so they explained everything we needed to know right off the bat. A big part of the experience seems to be mixing your own dipping sauces from a range of base sauces and oils. About halfway through our meal one of the servers insisted that we try his special dipping sauce blend. We humored him at first, but it really was good. I imagine he's been perfecting it for some time.

The quality of the meats, vegetables and noodles were all very good. There were only two minor complaints: First, the artificial crab was somehow even more artificial than normal artificial crab. It was bright pink, mostly tasteless, and sort of unraveled itself in the soup. It's not that I had particularly high expectations. I'm very familiar with the limitations of artificial crab. It's just that this artificial crab in particular was really a new low. It's like they stopped trying. Second, a couple of my fellow diners claimed the plum juice tasted like soapy dishwater. I went with the honey green tea myself, and it was delicious. Too bad for them! Luckily, the plum juice and honey tea were both free."}
{"text":"I always came to this restaurant. It was a cost-effective hotpot all you can eat before. But recently I came again, I will definitely gave it 0 if I could. 

the tablewares are really dirty. As well as the table. 
The food like beef, wonton and etc are not fresh at all! The beef was even a lit bit dry.
When we were eating, two working staff even had a serious quarrel in front of all the customers. That is sooo crazy.."}
{"text":"Had hotpot here with my friends couple days ago. I am glad they all like it!

One of my favorite hotpot place in town.
Price was reasonable, food was tasty and fresh, and their servers were really kind and helpful. My friends were new to hotpot, but the server explained it so well, and made dipping sauce for us. 

But they are quite busy and chaotic at dinner time. If you have choice, it's better to go there for lunch. The server told us that they charge less before 6pm."}
{"text":"We come here on the regular. They have the best spicy broth and really friendly staff. The manager is super great, he makes sure we always have a great experience. Would highly recommend, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"If you're coming here be prepared to wait 10+ minutes to be seated (while there are several open tables - just no one bothers to acknowledge your existence) then when you are seated you're looking at another half hour wait before you get your food. Food is decent, but not worth the inflated prices and abysmal service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! 
I tried this place on a Friday afternoon when it was quite empty so everything was served very fast. The staff is very friendly and gives diverse recommendation. The place looks clean and nice. There is a small bar where you can get 3 different types of drinks, approx 15 types of sauces, napkins, etc etc yourself. I don't mind getting up and getting my own things, but if you think it's your server's job to bring you everything, you might not like that. 
As for the food, it was not outstanding or amazing, it's rather ordinary. Nothing bad to say about it, it's just that I wasn't blown off by it. The food selection was average. I've seen a lot more diverse options at other hot pot places but it's good enough for me. 
One thing that I thought was unique about this place is that you have 4 different broths - at an extra charge though. 
Also... They don't really come reduce the heat when the water is boiling or come to pour some extra soup. I thought all hot pot places do that.
Desert (ice cream) was served free. 
One thing to take a note of is that 10% tip is included in the bill. I'm assuming they included that because people around this area don't tip enough... Personally I don't really appreciate pre-included tips. Their service was good overall and I think they definitely deserved more than 10%, but if that's what they think they deserve, alright. 
All in all, it was a good restaurant, just not amazing. I'm not a big all-you-can-eat lover so I probably won't be going back much, but it's definitely one of the nicer hot pot restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and the service was nice. The Lobster was fresh. The soup base was very tasty. I highly recommend this hot pot place."}
{"text":"First time having ayce hot pot downtown and it was as expected - not that great. 

Pros:
- Drink station with unlimited honey black tea, soya milk, and plum juice. 
- Sauce station has a wide variety of sauces to choose from.
- Individual pots. 
- Good meat/seafood balls. 
- Selection of food was decent. 

Cons:
- Our booth for 6 people was VERY small. You have very little space between you and the table when sitting down. I was surprised I even fit after seeing how much space was left when my very thin friend sat down.
- Beef was disappointing. 
- Multiple items on the menu were at extra charge (including some mushrooms...).
- Service is slow and the wait staff is not attentive. You have to constantly ask for more broth because your pot is almost a frying pan. Then some of the wait staff who pour the hot broth from the kettle are scary af because they allow it to splatter.
- Poor organization. You do not receive all the food you order. This happened on every occasion we placed an order. Also, the portions they serve are inconsistent. They should either do it by piece or serving, not pick and choose as they like. 

Basically if you really crave ayce hot pot and there is nowhere else to go, then by all means, dine here. It's not horrendous but it's not great."}
{"text":"My first hotpot experience in Toronto. Having come from Los Angeles where all sorts of Asian food reign supreme, I'm pleasantly surprised by this joint.
The place gets packed (especially in this frigid weather), so make sure to call ahead and make a reservation. Self-service station offers 4 beverage options (iced water, honey green tea, plum juice, and honey green tea) and at least 12 varieties in sauces. We had a group of 6, the place was buzzing with the dinner crowd, but the servers provided professional, expedient, and responsive service- not to mention SUPER friendly. We got a 30 minute notice before the next reservation for our table was scheduled to show up, which is a smart move on their time management. (But we were informed to take our time when the reservation was cancelled) I don't know, there's just something wonderful about dining at a place where the employees don't want to gouge their eyes out for working there. With the 25% discount flyer, 2 rounds of beer, and $22 AYCE deal we came out $31 per head including tip. Pretty darn good! And the green tea ice cream is creamy and rich in matcha flavor. The missing star is for the broth base, though at an additional $3 the specialty broth didn't come out so special in comparison to the free option. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Place:  is cozy, clean and just right

Food: is amazing, fresh EVERYTHING  *if you like seafoods better order  alot of seafood mix at first coz the second time  has add ons. i like how you can get your own pot, awesome

Service: the staff  are very  friendly  and helpful but it does take a while for them to give our orders so you gotta have patience when going there. on a busy day be ready to wait. but its all worth the wait.

Overall i will surely recommend this place, and come back for more."}
{"text":"Went here on Canada Day with my friends and boyfriend! It was my first time with Hot Pot and I really enjoyed myself.

The staff were all really well humored and friendly. Our main waiter was really friendly and eager to help us figure everything out and explained how to use everything. Definitely enjoyed their company as well, and they were really great about checking in with us and refilling our orders without being intrusive or annoying.

I really liked all of what we got for our hot pots, the broth was great, and although we learned quickly what we didn't like, the great selection of veggies and noodles made up for it. The meat was really well cut, although the crab meat swelled up and unravelled itself making it difficult to pick out, but it wasn't a huge problem.

My only complaint (and this isn't even mine) is that my friends really disliked some of the free juice. I didn't have any, but I was pleased with everything I personally tried!

I hope to come here and bring more and different friends next time! The menu is big enough that everyone will be happy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is so delicious and fresh. Celebrity Hotpot is fun and gives an unique restaurant experience.

Not many people know what hotpot is, but it's basically cooking your own food at your table in a variety of boiling broth. 

They have many options for broths to cook your meal in, including vegetable-based broths. Then you pick the meats, vegetables, seafood, dumplings, noodles, etc,. that you want. There's also an awesome section to grab unlimited honey green tea & soy milk. And a large variety of Asian condiments for your dishes. 

Overall, the food is healthy (nothing is fried), it tastes amazing, great atmosphere, and variety really gives this place the 5-stars that it deserves."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for dinner and while I enjoyed the meal, the amount of MSG in the soup base will literally make your stomach churn the next day.  If you can handle the soup base or are used to restaurant hotpot, then its totally fine!

The quality of the meats and vegetables are good otherwise. Suggest wearing less layers as your clothes will smell when you return home."}
{"text":"The first time I came here 2 years ago I remember having a decent time and that they had decent food, so I decided to come back as there aren't many hotpot options in downtown Toronto.

This time around, the food wasn't good - I'm not sure whether it was the sauce or soup base that made me feel queasy - I didn't actually get sick but ended up feeling uncomfortable for the rest of the day.

Now, the service was on a whole other level. They only had 2 servers working during dinnertime. Technically only 1 as the other server I'm guessing spent most of her time in the back probably preparing the meat and vegetables. So needless to say the service was beyond slow. My main problem with this visit was how they handled my bill and their logic for using my vicinity points. At a certain point I just stopped arguing with her because I didn't want to waste my time with someone who just DID NOT UNDERSTAND SIMPLE LOGIC.

I will not be coming back even though I have a promotion on my points card."}
{"text":"This place is oookay. 
Don't get me wrong I love paying $18.99 for food I won't eat! (Sarcasm) 
It's not that I got anything against land animals because I don't, I just don't see why I have to pay extra for small portions of seafood. 
Their Tum yum soup is pretty good along side their many sauces to accompany your meat.  Big spacious dining so bring everyone including uncle Joe and grandpa Sam. 

During Friday and weekend dinner hours, this place gets warm and humid inside cause everyone thinks they're the chef. You probably won't notice but you'll see steam on the windows. 
The servers are nice and friendly. And the service is up to far depending on the time you go and how busy it is."}
{"text":"Stayed in a hotel nearby and decided to cure my craving for hot pot.  This place is new, only opened 4 months ago.  It also has a fixed price menu, it is All You Can Eat within 1 1/2 hours.  I went on a Thursday night, which is just under $20 per person .  There is a so called free seafood round, but it is only one prawn, a couple of slices of squid and one small chunk of salmon. However, the ingredients are fresh.  After that, any seafood is extra.  Other meat dishes is included.  There are room for improvements.  Some of the chicken that ended up on my table was not sliced properly ,they actually come out in chunks.  Soya sauce missing on the sauces table, but it was replaced after we notified them.  Service took a little while.  The soup base is tasty.  If you want to have a mixed pot, i.e. two different favors, you will have to pay an additional of $3 each person.  Every item you ordered, only a small quantity is provided.  I have been to other hot pot restaurant outside DC in Virginia, I think if the restaurant provide a slightly bigger portion, customers do not have to keep repeat the order.  It might actually save the waiter's time and dish washing!  Just saying...... The drinks is included as well.  All in all, I still have a good enjoyable food experience.

Was this review ?"}
{"text":"My favourite place in the world, their tom yum soup base is the reason I started liking hotpot. Now I come here almost every week. 
The staff here are awesome, the restaurant is new and clean, food is fresh, service is fast, and the price is very reasonable for all-you-can-eat. Great place for a warm meal with good friends! :) 
I grew up in North York/ Markham and I'm still trying to find a comparable place uptown."}
{"text":"Love this place. I don't live downtown but it's worth the drive down or suggestions way down. All you can eat is worth it. Great selection and you can get individual pots. What's even better? They have a sauce station and even get unlimited eggs! Eat until you explode. Beef and lamb slices were so good. I'm drooling thinking about my experience!"}
{"text":"They charge you extra for a lot things like Tom Yum broth. Most places just give you the option. The quality of the meat is very suspect and one of my friends ended up getting food poisoning from them and she was sick for a week after.

All you can eat never equates to quality I suggest going to made in China or heading uptown if youre really in the mood."}
{"text":"Not much choice in the hot pot world, so if you're hankering for some hearty AYCE  downtown, you'll most likely end up here. 

It's a bit steep (but typical) for AYCE, so come hungry. You'll be greeted with a large selection of seafood, vegetables, and mystery meat balls. You do have options to upgrade your soup base, as well as your toppings.

Pro tip #:3214 

Order the standard soup base, don't upgrade. They have a free sauce station, so just jazz up your broth without the additional cost."}
{"text":"Attractive price but the ingredient is just so so.  This is a buffet style hotpot and a 2hr time limit."}
{"text":"To my fellow Yelpers, if there is a better hot pot restaurant in Spadina Avenue's Chinatown, please let me know because Celebrity Hotpot just doesn't do it for me.
Prices range from about $18.99 to $20.99 but you will get charged extra for some seafood items. 
Service is mediocre, and we felt like we were being 'rushed' to finish our meals and at one point our server pointed out to us that there was a two hour limit (its too bad our server also didn't point out that the seafood items we ordered were extra too) 
This is not a bad lead in restaurant for those who have never tried the \"Hotpot experience\" but I am sure there are better ones in this area, any suggestions?
I definitely won't be back here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here. I came with a friend and I wasn't disappointed at all. The owner/manager ordered for us (as we didn't have a clue) which was probably the best thing to do. We ate everything and ordered more meat. The manager also prepared us his special dipping sauce which was amazing...

I'll try anything once but since this was our first time trying this...I'm coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is comfort food Asian style.  I was a little overwhelmed with the menu but Dat came over, explained how hot pot works and ordered the first round of food.  His selection brought something from everything on the menu.  You get various noodles, veggies, fish and meat options.  I loved the hand made wontons and meat balls.  Sauces range from spicy to sweat and diners are encouraged to mix their own sauces for dipping.  Dat even has his own signature sauce that I recommend trying.  Go with plenty of time and a huge appetite as you will be here a while trying everything on the menu.  It's also a great value for all you can eat and not having to get up for every plate is nice.  Hot pot is an experience and i recommend your first time at celebrity hot pot!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here, this is his go to place for hotpot and I was so happy. I've been to two other hotpot places and they weren't as great. This place wasn't stingy with their all you could eat. The place was super clean and soup base was delicious. The service was great too! 

We went on a Thursday night and surprisingly, the place was not as busy which was great! It was quiet. I felt like I was super loud from laughing too much but who cares. The food was great, tried things I would never thought of putting into my hotpot! I like the fact that they had more options to put into your sauce. I love fresh chopped up chili in my sauce. 

The soup base that we got was Satay, it wasn't spicy but it was delicious. The dumplings are a must get and spinach noodles had a yummy texture. The beef was great, I was very very happy. We got too full on the first round and will have to come back to try the other things they have to offer. 

Do come here, I like this place way better than Little Mongolian Hot pot.

Too bad you guys cannot see my happy face or my happy dance."}
{"text":"A decent AYCE hotpot place in Chinatown. Came by on a weeknight with a large group and thankfully they took reservations because it was packed. Cool thing was that everyone could have their own individual hotpots for personal customization/dietary restrictions. The self-serve station for drinks and sauce had a big assortment but it would probably be more clean and fresh if the containers were covered. 

Food wise there was the conventional selection of meat and veggies at an average quality. Certain broths and meats had an extra surcharge though they weren't necessary to have a decent meal. The service was efficient but it was often difficult to get the attention of staff. A mandatory gratuity of 10% was applied for our group so the cost was still less than $26 each including tip."}
{"text":"3.5 is the exact mark for the place, because a hot pot remains some thinly sliced chunks of food to dip yourself into boiling water... so there is nothing worth more than 3.5 here...

This being said, compared to some older hot pot places downtown, this is one is almost always busy, thus ingredients taste (are?) really fresh and the place looks much cleaner (at least for now). They also have more than 12 sauces to combine according to your taste, ad lib.

Waiters are OK but do not seem to always understand yes and no. Beware about what may happen if they ask you whether you want more or are done with this or that...

I surely will go back if I am eager for a hot pot downtown. Finally, keep in mind the price... 52 CAD for 2 on a weekday evening for a simple hot pot... this is not of a bargain neither."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food, clean reastaurant, and great service. Had tons of lamb and ribeye beef. I would recommend to anyone. They servers speak english, but most I believe were Viet. Some speak mandarin. Also tip is included on bill. Had they not included 10% already I would have gave 15% tip. Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and I find the staff is very friendly and it's a nice restaurant to be in. The environment is clean and bright, makes it comfortable to dine in. 
The sauces are great and there is a wide selection of them. There is even free soy milk and cold tea. The value is great, I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was my first hotpot restaurant experience. I'm Chinese and my family regularly does hotpot on special occasions, and this place was very authentic. I like that everyone gets their own pot., or a big one with a divider to share. The winter melon, sliced beef, and wonton was delicious. Our soups were automatically refilled, and we had access to sauces(such as Hoisin Sauce, Oyster Sauce, Soy Sauce) and a few drinks(Honey Green Tea, Soy Milk, and Plum Juice). The manager is a hard worker, he told us that he only took 3 days off in the last 4 months, but he had a positive attitude and made us feel welcome. There's a sign on the main door that says \"Push for cold air\" haha."}
{"text":"Date night with the lady. Very good! Had chicken/beef and spicy broth. Spicy is very spicy - be cautious! Very tasty sauces to accompany the meat, veggie and seafood. Meat/fish balls was too soft/mushy - sliced beef was above average. Everything else was average. Drinks were very good. Our server was very friendly - he recommended us sauces that go great with each food and how we should cook our meat. Overall great experience!

Went a second time and took my family - group of 7! Busy restaurant understaffed. Servers were nice. The soup orders came out wrong and the kitchen staff kept messing up the orders. We were all frustrated at the service. The owner gave me a 10% discount on the bill. Don't think I'd go back again with a big group - small groups only."}
{"text":"Very good service, in fact amazing service. Friendly, fast, efficient and clean! They also gave us complimentary duck eggs (so delish!) and oh as I type this free ice cream too. Wasn't necessarily the best hotpot I've ever had (like some great ones in markham) but I was still very pleased. Left here full and satisfied. Finally have a hotpot spot to go to downtown. :)"}
{"text":"Cleanliness and organization was on point. Staff were friendly and service was timely. Also, the salmon and lobster were fresh, love that you can service your own drinks. We loved the Green tea especially. \"Dat Sauce\" was certainly worthy of a return visit, we were also able to see how fresh wontons that were handwrapped to portion perfection!. 

Definately try them if great service, cleanliness and great food experience is what youre looking for!"}
{"text":"If you like chinese food then this is the place to go! Date night? Birthday? Traveling? Drinking with your boys and want some late night eats? HOTPOT IT UP!!! Well worth it, food was excellent and dat sauce was amazing I should have got some for home! 5/5"}
{"text":"Typical hotpot place in the middle of Chinatown, offering an AYCE option for around $20-something, which is a fair price considering the foods on the menu. Regular menu consisting of thin-sliced meats of all kinds and various vegetables--although there is an order limit on some seafood. The drink and sauce counters are self-served, unlimited servings included. The service was quick and friendly despite being full (I went there on a Saturday evening), and the waiter was quick to accommodate our request for a table farther from the door (in the middle of February!), where my party was originally seated. Family and group friendly. Drinks menu a little deceiving, but expected from a Chinatown restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special, albeit relatively fresh and tasty, but the all you can drink beverages (honey green tea, sweetened soy milk, & plum juice) and dipping sauces are a step above any other AYCE Chinese hotpot I've ever been to. 

I did choose the option of adding $3 for 2 non-basic soup bases, tom yum and satay, and both were very good.

The restaurant is very clean, and the customer service, rather surprisingly for Chinatown, is really quite good."}
{"text":"Food flies are everywhere, really every where.  They are all over the ceiling AND you food. 
Service was poor. None of the servers know how the buffet order sheet works. 
I would give 0 star if I could. 
Yes. It is all you can eat. So if you can't afford anything better, then this is it for you."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I had never had Hot Pot before. On the other hand, I would describe myself as being an expert in both soup and raw food, so I figured this would be a hole in one. The part that bothers me the most is that I'm sure that Hot Pot and I *are* a hole in one. Just not at this restaurant. 

From the moment we arrived and they couldn't find the table we had reserved (almost all the tables were empty), to menu items being forgotten from our AYCE order, to being constantly told how much time we had left before our seating expired... this experience wasn't as famous as I expected with a name like Celebrity Hotpot.

In all fairness, we had called ahead for a table of 10 people and some of our coworkers backed out at the last minute, so we ended up being 6. The waiter seemed very confused by this and we waited a while to be seated, explaining several times that we were sorry to change our reservation last minute. They still seated us at a table for ten, and at the end of our meal told us that next time we should call them ahead of time to change our reservation. I thought that was what we did when we got there? They could have sat other people with us! They could have put us at a smaller table! 

I ordered a double broth - the drunken chicken and the spicy. The spicy is hard to judge because it is so laden with spice that you cant dunk or cook anything without it becoming covered in bits and flakes of spices. Slowly moving a few of those spices over to my mild chicken broth made for a delicious chicken broth at the end. But I had to wait until the end. 

Make a few sauces from their sauce bar. Experience what it tastes like to mix soy, peanut, hoisin and green onion together by your own measurements. Throw in some garlic. Maybe a dash of chilli. Taste Dat's sauce. 

But with all of this said, walk in to it with weak expectations. A third of the plates we ordered didn't come until we asked repeatedly for them. Seafood portions are 1 piece each. We were given a countdown until it was time to go. And when it was time to go, as much as I was in love with the broth, I was okay to leave.

{"text":"Very nice employees who will gladly teach you how to hot pot if you've never done it before like myself. Massive selection of foods to choose from and they will bring you as much as you want at no added cost. Literally as much as you want. Come hungry. Get the beef, pork balls, and dumplings."}
{"text":"Late night meal and found this place open til 3 am on Saturday and the great selection of meat and soup base made our visit to Toronto memorable. The staff was also very attentive and accommodating would definitely come back to this place if we come this way again. And on top of that my family give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"DON'T EVEN BOTHER. AVOID THIS PLACE, IT IS JUST PLAIN DISGUSTING AND NOT VERY CLEAN AT ALL.

PROS:
- The TomYum soup base, just the right amount of spice and tangyness to it.
- The beverage/sauce self-serve table, I do like how you can grab your own drinks (they had soy milk/water/honey green tea I believe.) and your own sauces
- Closes late

CONS:
- Disgusting uncleaned tables. We got seated and the waiter did not properly clean the table. He just wiped it in a quick sloppy way and left us when it was clearly very, very dirty with used napkins, previously used soup ladle bin, soup stains everywhere. I don't even think the cloth he used was even clean it looked very dirty and used. NOT a good first impression.

- Everything including the soup ladles and spoons very dirty when he gave it to us, they were not properly washed and still had specks of food on them.

- The beverage/sauce self-serve station I liked, but it was absolutely dirty and messy. There was used cups just places everywhere and no clean ones, I had to ask multiple times to get the servers to place new ones. Half the sauces and condiments were empty, and 2/3 of the beverages were empty and needed to be refilled.

- Some of the fish did not look fresh especially the salmon. We paid $6 extra and it looked as if it had been frozen for weeks, it definitely did not have a nice colour to it.

- Dirty pots, dishes left all over the tables after customers have left and kept piling up. It only takes a min to grab all of it and bring it back to the kitchen before serving others.

- Tip is also already included in the bill, very sneaky - they don't tell you but it is mentioned very subtly so be wary to not pay double the tip.

----------

Price was around $24-$26 (?) for all you can eat for one person. It was definitely NOT WORTH IT if I had to \"tip toe\" around all the dirty parts of the table to be able to eat my own meal. Service was okay in terms of speed, food came at a decent time.

We came around 9pm and it was busy, but not overly busy. There were still free tables and enough employees to serve the existing customers. I have worked in the food service industry so I understand if it may have been busy and overwhelming, but everything else was utterly unacceptable."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Price is good, the food comes out at a reasonable time. The service is really friendly. Best part is the unlimited drinks that they have!"}
{"text":"After reading about the hype for Celebrity hot pot we had to try it out. We have only done hot pot at home and wanted to try eating hot pot elsewhere. 

We dined on a Monday evening so it was pretty much empty when we arrived. The server was friendly throughout our visit and occasionally came by to top off our broth. My favourite things to cook were the seafood items. There's nothing special to say about the food because you just cook it and it hasn't been seasoned. What I didn't like right from the start was that the utensils, bowl, and plate didn't seem very clean. They felt sticky and not washed thoroughly.

I think next time we'll just stick with eating hot pot at home because for almost $50 I can eat way more seafood and everything is clean.

PS: Remember to redeem the 10% off coupon when you check-in! I forgot :(."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this restaurant. 

The food was mediocre and the service was even worse. When I spoke to the manager, I learned that he was mostly employing his friends. That would explain why nobody was attentive and every single time I needed something, I had to go running around the restaurant to find a server. I saw \"staff\" out front playing with their phones while I was trying to flag them down so they could take my order. Terrible."}
{"text":"We came upon this place just walking around in Toronto Chinatown, and I just have to say it was amazing and a great new experience for me and the family. Plus the fact that we are 5, the kids loved it too. The service was great and the man in charge was super nice. I definitely recommend, Celebrity HOTPOT!!"}
{"text":"A great eating experience for my son and I while walking through China Town!  The price was good for all you can eat and the staff was patient and kind explaining the process and recommending what we should eat!  Think Chinese fondue!!!!  Delicious and fresh!  You can't leave hungry, and if you do, it's your own fault!"}
