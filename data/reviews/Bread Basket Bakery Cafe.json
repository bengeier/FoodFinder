{"text":"Have driven by this place a few times & wasn't sure if it was catering only.  Decided to check out the reviews online & stop for lunch today.  I had a roasted turkey sandwich on sourdough, it was DELICIOUS!  Would have liked to have seen more goodies out but maybe that was because they were short staffed at the moment?  I'll definitely head back though!"}

{"text":"Really good food. Very nice people. This place has been here forever, but Ed recently bought it. Under the previous owners it reminded me of a bus depot. But now the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The baked goods are superb, and the food is always consistently good."}
