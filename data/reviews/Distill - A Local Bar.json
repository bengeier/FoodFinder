{"text":"Can't beat some beers, pool, sliders, and some good ole Rock n Roll!! All the waitresses are beautiful makes the place a lot better!"}
{"text":"From the moment i walked into this bar, ive had very exceptional service. There very sufficient and never make me wait longer then 4 mins for anything. The bartenders and servers are awesome! If your coming in for a bit to eat or to grab a drink. Anytime of the day is perfect my favorites to come see is Nicole & Chelsea they works in morning and at night John, Erin & Elliot are great too. Any of the servers are great too!! But if you are looking for great service, and good laughs come see these wonderful people at Distill.. (:"}
{"text":"I was at distill tonight and had a great time the bartenders were awesome Corrin mike and Jay provided great service. Love this place."}
{"text":"The only thing amazing about this place was our server.  Cayla was super informed and super nice. She told us about new menu options coming soon, unfortunately chicken sandwiches and steak salads were the only suggestions. Not her fault but food was very inconsistent and boring. Save your money, don't eat here. Also management Cayla should be your boss."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and the entrance kind of throws you off because you can't really tell it's an entrance. We went into the bar side and we were not greeted and there was no one tending the bar. We walked around to check out the decor in the lounge area and no one ever approached us for a menu or anything. We quietly left and ate at the Butcher Block next door. Unsure this place will last due to the previous service comments listed by other people but I sure hope it makes changes fast. Tons of potential and I would love to go back to have a better experience."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times since September and each time has been excellent.  The staff has been extremely friendly and helpful! The food was fantastic and the drinks are reasonably priced.  The entrance seems a little intimidating at first but once you enter, it is a nice mix of restaurant/bar seating a small lounge area near the back.    I would recommend Distill as a great start to the beginning of the night or as a final stop before the night is over!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy going for happy hour and we love when Mike, the bartender is working.  He has amazing customer service and always makes great food recommendations."}
{"text":"Great bar, awesome outside seating! Good drink menu and appetizers! Great place after you leave a group or family dinner and you are not ready to go home. I wish this bar was in Green Valley!"}
{"text":"I hosted a private party on the patio for about 35 people. My guests and I were very impressed by the 2 servers that were assigned to my party. They were very attentive and made sure everyone received their drink orders promptly. I worked with Kristyne  on the menu and followed her suggestion to include a vegetarian dish. The food was delicious! It was nice that the manager checked on the party at least twice to make sure that everything was going well and see if there was anything we needed. I would definitely recommend Distill for your next event! The patio is nicely decorated and there is plenty of seating. The fireplaces add to the ambience."}
{"text":"Not a fan Very slow service and what little attention we did get from the server was not good. food was marginal at best, pizza was bland and the crust was doughy."}
{"text":"Great Calimari.  Good service. Good prices. Visit for the nice outdoor patio, stay for the food and drinks. Say hi to Jeff the GM."}
{"text":"Great facility. Many menu selections. Service SLOW. Kitchen very slow. One great server other two had no clue. Had to track server down for coffee refill, utensils, order another drink. Got our own catsup salt pepper Tabasco to add to our cold breakfast once it finally arrived. Oh and got a steak sandwich not the steak tacos that were ordered by one of us. Only took another 25 minutes to get the tacos. Really? Scrambled eggs and steak tacos not exactly difficult to prepare. Go, but do not expect attentive and competent service and make sure you have lots of time."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Distill on Thursday night! Eliot was the best bartender and extremely entertaining! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great food, great service. Lexy was amazing. Smile on her face each time she greeted us and knew how to handle a group full of men with class and ease. She had extensive knowledge of the menu and answered all the questions we had. Thanks Lexy!"}
{"text":"Beware GAMBLERS.  Comp policy is ridiculous. For every $20 gambled you get 1 drink comped. After over $100 in gambling we had been charged over $70 for drinks. We only had 4 drinks each and lost our money. Bare in mind we were brand new to this bar. There were regulars being loud and obnoxious and getting all the attention they wanted. If you are looking for a new bar to check out..this is not the one.  My Fiance works at a bar and has never heard of a bar with a comp like this. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Horible service. We had Lindsay and a older guy working a Tuesday night. Pathetic gaming bartenders. Thank goodness Nate saves the day."}
{"text":"The food is really really good. Had the calamari and the chicken Caesar salad and the brownie. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Many flat screen tv's and a digital jukebox. Two pool tables and bar top gaming. Try the Modelo Especial on draft with a lime...so good."}
{"text":"Just meet Chris general manager and he is awesome!  Bathrooms are small but there are two. Food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Waited twenty minutes for one drink, put a one hundred dollar bill in the machine and never got a drink again an hour later.    Food at least was very good and given for free because of the service."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  A group of friends have met here for happy hour an a luncheon. We had great service and great food both times.  The manager was accommodating for each event. The food is delicious and a good price - not over priced as many places in Summerlin are.  We will go again"}
{"text":"I come here all the time because I like the food and they day staff. Every so often I come here around midnight which is shift change. You will see three or four bartenders behind the bar and still wait 20 minutes for a drink and someone to take your order.  All the female bartenders are super friendly but I've noticed the two male grave bartenders are more concerned with looking at the computer screen then customer service."}
{"text":"Really slow service. Been there when both empty and crowded and both times still slow service. Waiter staff not very friendly no personality, they barely talk to you."}
{"text":"The food is what brings me back time and time again. Recommend almost anything on the appetizers, think I've tried them all. Ok spot for a last minute date, they have pool tables and the staff is pretty laid back."}
{"text":"Great environment, friendly people, and good food.  Seared Ahi Tuna is my favorite.  If you're in the area you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Bartender Kristina was rude..No concern with customer service!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, attentive staff. Ok drink specials. Plenty of parking. Many tv's. I wish there were more spots at the bar without games. I hate getting kicked out of my seat when I'm buying expensive beers/liquor to let some dude drinking the cheap beer \"special\" gamble away a few bucks."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, wonderful atmosphere and great workers!! Food has been great! Been back twice already, and tell everyone about it!! Great addition to southern highlands!"}
{"text":"Have tried to give this place a chance too many times with zero improvement!!! Food = average Bartenders & waitstaff = poor"}
{"text":"The service is great!  The food was very good especially the avocado egg rolls.  My kids loved the burgers"}
{"text":"Have been to Distill many times and have never been disappointed until I ordered the Stromboli.  The baked dough was tough to cut through even with the provided steak knife.  The stuffed ingredients were sparse at best.  The worst part was the dough...it comprised about 80% of the meal.  Not good !"}
{"text":"First time in tonight... All I can say is this is my new favorite bar to be at. Our bartender Rick was super cool and kept the beers flowing before the last beer was gone. I will definitely be goin back & recommend this place to family & friends!!!"}
{"text":"Best spot in town!!  Keepin' it LOCAL!  Great job Elliot & team...you guys are awesome!  Remember us by name & treat us like friends!  We only get to go out once a week & we always choose this spot!  Keep it up~ ~Chris & Heather!"}
{"text":"We are surrounded by family friendly restaurants that it's nice to go to Distill for a drink, appetizer or meal without a bunch of families. My hubby and I come when my mom can watch the kids so we can have a quick date night. Love the vibe, drinks and food. I love their chicken wings and patty melt. The hubby loves the steak and eggs."}
{"text":"Came into Distill tonight around 9pm for some food and had Mike Naugle as my bartender. He is very friendly and served us right away. He seems very busy but still makes time to interact with all the customers. I ordered the wings and they were FIRE with that Nitro sauce! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"It's been about a year since we've last eaten here. The last time we came, it was pretty dead,  which was strike one. My husband had two Heineken's during the course of our meal, he order a last round, and the waitress brought a Heineken Lite. She also recommended some pretty bad appetizers, which was strike three, but we gave her a pass. Came back tonight to give it another try. Place was pretty busy, and we were happy to see the crowd. Hard to find a good busy spot up north.  Seated ourselves and was not thrilled about the twenty something behind me puffing on what seemed like two at a time,  but dealt with it. Took  about 10 minutes for Sarah, our waitress to come over. My husband and I each ordered a drink. Sarah asked us each for ID. Now I like to believe I don't look my age, but I am going to be SIXTY this month, so, although flattered by the request, I was a bit flabbergasted when Sarah said she could not serve me, because I didn't have my ID on me. I asked to speak to the manager, and she blathered on about how, \"now that I know you don't have ID on you, I can lose my job if I serve you\" Really???? I live in New York, but have a house in LV. We have been up and down the Las Vegas strip this week, and NOT ONE bartender has asked us for ID. After we left Distill, we went to eat at another restaurant nearby. Amazingly, we were not asked for ID when we ordered a bottle of wine. We spent over $100 in this other establishment. Distill, your loss!"}
{"text":"Worst bar, unless you're not black... Then you get service. We sat at the bar Friday night and after aaking for a bartender several times, no one would come over. Needless to say we left without drinks and went to another bar with actual customer service."}
{"text":"This location is 100% better than the Durango location! Rob and Billy are the best!! The food is better and the service is WAY better."}
{"text":"Great addition to the southern highlands area!  Food was just ok, clearly a lot of frozen stuff and service was a bit slow for the place being empty when I went. But that said, I'm excited to go back and try some other things!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the mediocre reviews. Excellent food. We live in Southern Highlands and as all the locals know we have very limited options. Great value and excellent food. They make all their soups and dressings. Always a good sign. Try anything Poke. Jenna was our server and she rocked it. Thanks! Finally we don't have to settle for mediocre bars like The Lodge and McFaddens."}
{"text":"I visited Distill with some coworkers and I did enjoy myself, though I didn't stay long. I ordered one beer for $5.00 and paid it and my second a friend got for me. However, the next day I had notifications of fraud from my banker. My card was charged an addition $650.00!! I did not leave a tab open and only used my card that one time. My account was frozen and informed me that the charge was from this establishment. Mistake or not that's a pretty dramatic amount to \"accidentally\" charge someones card. How could this have been authorized and overlooked? I attempted to email the contact listed on their site but it was invalid. Needless to say I wont be returning. Luckily my bank caught it. I am disappointed because the food did look good, but I can't bring myself to let this place have my business."}
{"text":"Best local bar ever!! They sure know how to treat you good there. I go there about 3 times a week just for the employees. Phil is a great manager!! And can't forget about Rick and rob.. Food is great and they cater high to their players :)"}
{"text":"Went here the other day and I have to say I was NOT impressed. We walked in and loved the atmosphere right away. I loved the decor and vibe of the restaurant however our actual dining experience was extremely poor. We waited a long time for our drinks and had to ask multiple times for waters while we waited which still didn't come until our food arrived. I didn't receive what I ordered but chose not to say anything and just pick through what I did want.  I suspect the food and service was sub par for some reason but it definitely ruined my first experience and I'm not sure I'm willing to try it again."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here today for the first time. We won't be going back. After walking in, it took 15 minutes before being approached by a server. Granted, it was fairly busy with football watchers. One of the electric pool tables had no power, and the other had an overhead light out. One was in a spot too tight for shooting as well. The pool cues were terrible. I ordered the Filet Sliders, and they were absolutely gross. Under-cooked, disgusting. I demanded a refund after just one bite. If you sit at the bar on a Sunday afternoon drinking beer, you might like this place. If you don't, there are dozens of places better."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were excellent and the service was spot on. Plenty of nice new TVs to catch a game."}
{"text":"Came here once and no more .... about 2 1/2 months ago I came to test the food .... The bartender/chef were cool ...  The bartender said customers always order the Ahi Street Tacos ... Ok Ahi Street Tacos it is .... The Ahi it was freezer burned !  Very dry and like cardboard ! sucks ! Junk ! never again !"}
{"text":"This is the frat time eating here near our house in southern highlands and the service was good but there is a very rude loud mouth cook yelling from in back. I was hoping for a new favorite place but this will never be. Will not return"}
{"text":"Disappointing. NO SERVICE.  Arrived at 4:45 pm. No one in restaurant. Sat ourselves. A guy came by and gave us menus. Told us Crystal will be our server. Did not take our beverage order.  Waited 10 minutes all alone in dining room. Staff all laughing in kitchen having good time. Called the restaurant on our phone and let them know we were waiting. Waited 5 minutes nothing. Called again, finally the guy that seated us came to the table.  Some excuse about Crystal being busy with 30 people. Yet he peeked out of the kitchen 3 times. Something about he thought Crystal was handling us. He took our drink order and left.  After 5 minutes we left. So sad, we heard the food was good. Service counts guys and staff needs to step up and help each other. If someone is handling like 20 people, then YOU take care of the others...."}
{"text":"First time there, Monday night football, staff friendly, fair prices, good food, will go back, wasn't too loud or anything"}
{"text":"First time in. Looks great inside. Sign said seat yourself. Not too busy, plenty of seats. Sat for 15 minutes, no acknowledgement, so we left. I'm sure no one noticed. Bummer."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of bars but this place was not bad. I liked the decor when I walked in and the patio area seemed nice. The inside was a bit smokey which was a turn off as I came in to eat. We sat in the dining area away from the bar and that was nice and kinda private. I wasn't drinking this evening so I can't comment on the bar menu but the food was pretty good. My wife had the Caesar wrap which she found a little dry. I had the fish tacos and they were fresh and tasty. My favorite item was the sweet potato fries. Super crispy and nicely salted. I'd visit again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places here in Summerlin. The food is decent, not a five star restaurant, but it is good overall. My particular favorite is the avocado egg rolls. You can't go wrong with it all.  The atmosphere is nice. There is a large bar in the center (good luck getting a seat - it's fairly busy) and plenty of seating even at its peak times. There is also a patio area that is relaxing and doesn't get too hot/cool.  Lastly, you have really good servers here. My friends and I have always had positive experiences with the staff here. Our particular favorite is Jade. She's very outgoing and helpful with whatever you need. The bartenders are also friendly and keep the drinks flowing.  Overall: a nice establishment with great staff."}
{"text":"Love this bar!!  Very cool atmosphere and the bartenders are great!!  Wish I could give it more stars but they don't have the NHL package and therefore we don't go very often. Please get the NHL package so we can watch the hockey games there!!!!  Vegas is becoming a hockey town. Time to buy the package!!"}
{"text":"Great 24 hour local sports bar. The bartenders are friendly and professional.  The kitchen is consistent and delivers a good variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner selections. The Southwest salad and bacon cheeseburger sliders are especially yummy. Nice furnishings, TV screens, and overall atmosphere.  NFL specials make games fun. Really appreciate the drinkable house cab!"}
{"text":"Fast,  friendly service. Great local bar but still has more upscale feel. Not a dive bar."}
{"text":"Great customer service , chill spot for Henderson locals . Wish outside sitting area would be a little more welcoming and add another lamp or two . Food is a bit overpriced for what's served . Love interior design."}
{"text":"Mmm poke stack is the bomb!! I can't get enough.. The service is always on point! The machines give me play. I live right across the street, so it's great to have an awesome bar with a great staff and yummy food so close by. They also have a nice selection of beer on tap. And always looking forward to the beer of the month! A+ in my book"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere.  Amazing food!  Friendly staff!  My new neighborhood bar!'"}
{"text":"The drinks were inconsistent, two of the same drink; one came out too sweet the other too sour.  The food was under-seasoned, even the fries weren't salted.  The service was ignorant and negligent.  Waitress didn't know her own menu.  One server came by and only grabbed our empty drinks but disregarded a need for more water and an obviously rejected plate of food.  You can do better go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was excited for this place to open. Like the space and thought it would be a great place to watch the games. I've taken several friends and everyone has said the same thing that they couldn't believe they allow smoking. Today I overheard another couple say the same thing right as they walked in. A few people have said they doubt they would ever go back. It's very disappointing. I went there for lunch again today. We had to move two times to get away from the smoke. This could be a great place. In a day where smokers have options why does a non smoker have to be exposed and have a miserable experience? Management should reconsider their policy. Doubt we will go back unless it becomes smoke free."}
{"text":"Place smells a bit of smokey. Our waitress was nice & quick.  Overall,  my first time experience wasn't a Wow factor.  The beers weren't cold. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar with an empty bucket over 10 mins is never a good sign of service. Needs help with recognizing customers needs over fraternization"}
{"text":"I came during my lunch break to eat and I would like to say that I had a very pleasant experience. Compared to other local gaming bars I loved that it did not have an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke lingering which made my meal that much better I was greeted promptly by the bartender I chose the chili and cornbread and it was delicious my food came out quickly and my drink was never empty this will most def be my new lunch spot thanks distill!!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome local bar - great for parties or just to grab a drink or food.  Haven been at Distill a dozen times, service is excellent and food very good! The mash potato bites are great!  Last night, had a party with 50 folks.  We had the outside patio which is a great place to host an event.  Trisha and Miranda were incredible! They, and the whole staff, were so attentive. I would HIGHLY recommend Distill !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this bar!!!! Even when it's busy the bartenders are fast and get you taken care of!!! Drinks are strong and food is awesome what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight!  Our server,  Desarie, introduced us to 2 items: mash potatoe balls and wedding soup that were delicious! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Visited this local sport bar when I stayed at the red rock resort. This place was great! The food was great and Mykee, our server, was great! I would totally recommend this place to anyone wanting to hang in a relaxed atmosphere. We be back next time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Such a great local bar... One of those where they make you feel like welcome and special.  Mo and Eliot are always there to greet me with a smile and a cocktail.. I've been a bartender in town for over 15 years and this is definitely one of my favorite local hang outs..."}
{"text":"Second time here and the service and food were average at best. I thought my first visit might have been a fluke but it was consistent with my second. I came back a second time because I like the scenery in the bar and the atmosphere is great. It's sad they can't put it together and figure out better customer service. Usually great food or service brings you back not the atmosphere. Not sure if I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Its near my home and its always clean and friendly. Food is good too."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new place and then were very quickly disappointed. The appetizer (shrimp & artichoke dip) was so bland and lacked flavor that we traded out the dip for salsa.... No better. All you taste was pepper and again no other flavors. I then ordered the street tacos.... Soooo dry had issues actually swallowing the chicken. My BF got the Distilled chicken sandwich and that's when we found all the salt that was lacking in our other dishes. And to top it off our waitress had a bit of an angry personality. Sadly we will not b returning here. The atmosphere was ok."}
{"text":"My second time here and I am now a regular here.  An interesting twist to a \"Hole in the wall\" bar/ tavern.  The energy amongst the group here is very impressive, the age demographic group seem to mesh perfectly.  That being said their beer and drink selection is to be expected and doesn't disappoint my tastebuds in particular.  There is a fair amount of liquor options and their beer on tap is plentiful.    Now to food... Cannot complain and actually give two thumbs up for a \"gourmet\" take on the menu.  From their shredded chicken nachos to the Grilled Alaskan salmon, the people in the kitchen know what they are doing and bring an excellence to their craft.  To imagine a \"Bar\" producing this quality of food is not possible and usually not expected but the cooks know what they are doing.  Don't know what more I can say honestly I highly recommend this location or the other for a night out from the regular bar scene.  Distill is more than deserving of this 5 Star rating"}
{"text":"The meal and service were wonderful!  Eronica is a very attentive, helpful server.  My husband's steak was well-prepared.  The colorful variety of potatoes delightful.  His salad was also delightful.  My salmon was well-prepared and had more than I could eat...so take home.  Finally the bread pudding was delicious.  Kristal Royal brought us back to this place after a previously poor experience.  Please give this place another try."}
{"text":"Best bar food in town. Mashed potato bites and sliders are amazing. Bartenders are super friendly"}
{"text":"Come and sit in Lexie's section. By far the best waitress we've had here! She was pleasant and on point all night. Even when they got busy."}
{"text":"I'm giving Distill 5 stars because I had a great experience both times I went and plan on going back soon. My roommate and I wanted to go out and try something new. We saw the free whiskey shot with check in offer and figured why not? The first time we came, I ordered the coffee infused whiskey and my roommate got the orange cinnamon infused. We agreed that the orange cinnamon was more our style so that's what we will be ordering from now on. Happy hour is definitely a good deal. $1.99 chips and salsa, $2.99 bruschetta, and $3 well drinks...yum! The chips and salsa were a great deal for only 2 dollars. Spicy salsa and a bunch of chips! As for the bruschetta, the bread was delicious and crispy, good enough to eat alone. But the tomato/onion topping also goes great with it! We ordered fries too that aren't considered happy hour. Just normal cut fries with a hint of salt for about $3. Both of us love fries so we have to try fries at every place we go, and they were pretty tasty here. The well drinks were also a good deal! $3 for a whiskey and ginger ale. They bring it on the rocks though, so next time I will ask for it chilled. Sitting outside just makes my ice melt and waters the drink down. But speaking of the outside..it's wonderful and where we choose to dine every time. They have nice high top tables, and lower seating with couches lining the patio area. Cute fire places and lantern hanging lights. Both times we went was during happy hour but I would come back during regular hours too. It's open 24/7 so we were thinking about trying it in the early morning sometime. The staff was excellent both visits too. Friendly and fast service. One of the waitresses even remembered us from the first time and came over to say hi. All in all a great place. (Both of us are vegetarians/vegans)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Place was quiet. Service was prompt and attentive. My salad and my husbands French dip were quality. Decor is fun. We'll definitely come back on a weekend to try them out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly staff. Good happy hour prices. Nice mix of people to mingle. Fun place to be on Fridays."}
{"text":"I frequently go to the distill near red rock and the staff is great, the new one that opened is closer to my house so going there on weekdays for food or a cocktails is just much more convenient. The unfortunate part of this, I like sitting at the bar and the bartenders that work most weekdays are lacking in personality and definitely lack in paying attention to the patrons they aren't friends with. I was in there on 3/6 about 7pm and if it wasn't for Amber (I think that's her name) I probably wouldnt have gotten a drink and just left, it appears she is the only one that wants to work and serve customers while the other 2 that were there, some guy and another young lady with a sleeve of tattoos on her left arm were playing on her phone with their backs to everyone. They would even walk by, see my glass empty and not even ask if I wanted another let alone food. Amber was cover all corners of the bar and any time she saw my glass empty she would apologize for not being more attentive and get another one for me, I can understand her not being able to pay just attention to just me and the people I was with due to the fact she was covering the bar for the other 2 not working. If they are sharing tips, it's a shame cause I do tip well and I did that night but they don't deserve a dime of that."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Great servers, upbeat place with a good vibe, drinks, and pretty good fancier bar food too!  Can't beat the ambiance either..... love the outdoor seating area with fire pits!"}
{"text":"All you people lookin' for a kickass bar, with cool locals, awesome food, and an incredible service staff, Distill is the spot for you. My first time in there I hit keno jackpots that accumulated up to $5400. Then I tried their bombass menu,  which was more like upper end cuisine instead of bar food. Their burgers rock, as well as any entree they create on a daily basis, and the service is definitely above stellar. With Karyn, Nicole, Yvette, and Mike  behind the bar, as well as the infamous manager Erin, all know how to keep the drinks and fun flowin'. Pop in and check it out for yourself, and if the parking is packed on the bar level, just head down to the parking garage below and find plenty of ample spots to park your ride safely. Hope to see you there !!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last week for the first time. I ordered Beef tips & Salad my husband ordered the animal burger! It was so delicious! Trish was our server very kind & helpful because it was our first time there!  KC brought our food he was very pleasant nice conversation!! We will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant only review as I am normally with family for a quite dinner when I visit Distill. The best thing on the menu that I end up craving is the happy hour fried artichoke hearts. I also enjoy the rueben. I can only give it 3 stars even though I eat here often. As other reviewers have mentioned the level of service quality depends heavily on the staff that is working that evening. Some of the staff are excellent and some are not. Also the food can be somewhat hit and miss.   My wife and I agree that the salads are all very basic and not worth the money however I will reiterate that some of the more savory dishes are excellent. I love the Cure burger as well."}
{"text":"Weak and over priced drinks.  Food quality was poor for the price you pay.  Service is slow. Was sat at a dirty table and the waitress never cleaned it off for us. She just put our menus down on the crumbs and drink spills."}
{"text":"Crystal is great and so is Deena.  Great venue with with a killer happy hour.  Place is a great before or after for a Red Rock trip or can hold its own as your spot for the night.  Menu is huge,  generous portions and extremely reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very clean. Great atmosphere. Excellent beer battered fish & chips. No disappointments."}
{"text":"decent food good prices.  okay for sports.  they should buy sports packages rather than just have games on from major channels"}
{"text":"The staff is stand offish. Boarder line inappropriate staff comments coming from bartender and staff members. Will most likely card you if you are under 50 years old looking. Very smokey at times and will most likely come out of Distill smelling like an ashtray."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick happy hour after a hike at Red Rock (I know, the irony) and the place is super cute compared to the one on Southern Highlands in my opinion.   I was kind of bummed that they don't offer buffalo chicken sliders in their HH menu; so instead we ordered Greek fries, chicken lettuce wraps, short rib tacos and chips & salsa. Out of the 4, Greek fries was probably the best. Chicken lettuce wraps was too salty for me and the short ribs tacos was okay - nothing special.   Service was great and our server was attentive. I give it 4 stars since the food wasn't all that."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came in for dinner on a weeknight.  Great ambiance with Halloween decor.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Food was very mediocre.  Husband had an omelet with hash browns that looked like they had come frozen.  My fish tacos were a bit dry.  No salsa available.  Waiter brought a bottle of Tabasco and another bottled choice.  Go for drinks and to watch the game."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times since my last review (which wasn't very flattering) and had a blast. Kudos to Ronnie & Jade the bartenders for making one experience fantastic. Great bartenders who are laid back and a lot of fun that don't act like they are doing you a favor for being there.   Due to a step up in service, decided to do a little something different from our usual Sunday Football meetup and chose Distill. Our teams were in the Championship (Green Bay for some, Patriots for most of us) games so we got there early to take up tables and seats right in front of the screens. One thing really nice about this place is the multiple big screen TV's with plenty of tables / comfy seats set up in front of them which makes it a great place to watch the games.   Right after getting comfortable and drinks ordered, a super nice guy came up to us and introduced himself as Jeff the General Manager. Very genuine and hospitable... not often you have the GM take the time to go around and introduce himself in \"A Local Bar\". Took the time to raise the volume for the TV's in front of us to go along with the overhead volume so we could really hear the games and even came by to check on us to see how we were doing during the games.  Jeff mentioned he has been the GM there for about six months and I could certainly tell the place has improved.  Place ended up being jammed by game time with a great crowd. Ordered up tons of food for table sharing and the orders that really stood out were the Chipotle Chicken Nachos (delicious and huge) and found out why \"The Cure\" burger is rated one of the best in town.   Overall a great experience. The only things I could point out to have made it a Five Star experience is the Waitress never bothered to even introduce herself / give her name, wasn't very personable and didn't mention any of the drink specials taking place. Found out there was a special for pitchers of Bloody Mary's for $19.95 at the time we got there (after ordering single Bloody Mary's and paying full price to start off the day) and around the 4th quarter of the first game we found out that there was a Miller Lite special for the big 100 oz. self serve towers of beer. We only found out because we asked the table next to us that were ordering them. Kind of would have been nice for her to mention that when we were ordering up single beers and paying more than twice the price for pretty much the same thing. Four big bud lights for $24 a round or $12 for 100 oz of Miller Lite.... hmmm. Kind of a no brainer what to go with if we would have known to begin with.  Guess we should have asked when we first got there. Regardless, still a great time and we left stuffed, tipsy and happy."}
{"text":"Over charged for drinks for gaming play and said it was to cover the bartenders tips."}
{"text":"My husband really loves this place. The food is good for bar food but nothing super special, I guess. Service is always good and friendly. We've been there on busy days, slow days, and the service is always on point. That always makes me happy as a former server."}
{"text":"Wow what a change a month makes. Huge huge staff turn over. Jessica, De, and sevral others are all gone. :( still takes way too long for a cocktail. Can they change the drink you get when you check in? They really are not that good.  Still love the Mad Mule. Way better then a Moscow mule."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot! Brittany and Mikey are the best servers! Very attentive and always provide excellent suggestions! Highly recomend!"}
{"text":"Distill on Charleston is the best best!!  They had an excellent NYE Party !!! had such a great time away from the tourists.. I can go there for business  meetings , football or just to rage on the weekends .  We always have a  blast.The food/service  is top notch.  Patio  dining is amazing! OH and The Best Bloody Mary Bar  on Sundays!!  My fav  spot !!"}
{"text":"Distill is just the best!  Great bartenders!!! The food is really good, the drinks keep coming, gaming is fun!  But really the company is the best!  Highly recommend. Ask for Eliot, Erin and Nichole."}
{"text":"Great local spot for chilling out, gaming, or just putting down some shots and beers. Bartenders are all locals, all super friendly and take great care of everyone. The food can be a little hit or miss, but then again I'm a picky New Orleans boy, so there's that. I will say that the buffalo blue burger is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Best local bar! Great food, fun atmosphere, service and bartenders! Mike Naugle is an awesome bartender there he always takes care of you! Definitely recommend coming in to check it out!"}
{"text":"Horrible food service was rude. Never again. They should be ashamed of themselves. Disgusting. Go to BJ's food is better and service is great. This place sucks."}
{"text":"It is my first time here.  I love the ambiance and the food was delicious.  The rib tips were perfectly seasoned and tender.  The server was attentive and on top with our drink orders. I am definitely coming back to try some more different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this Freakin' place!!! The food variety is insane & consistent. I rarely do reviews,.. but the food merits one. I've had the pancakes several times & their the same incredible taste & texture!! Don't get me talking about the mashed potato balls,... HOLY Moley!!! Well,.. back to eating."}
{"text":"Great spot for locals. I loved the low key atmosphere, food was great as well as the service!"}
{"text":"I really do like this place a lot! Been waiting for a cool local hang out and this fits the bill!  I have been there 4 times now and have had very friendly attentive service every time.  Love love love the Mad Mule cocktail :). The food is pretty good too.  Didnt care for their salsa or their avacado egg rolls but really enjoyed their fried artichoke hearts (minus the mayo dipping sauce-surely you can come up with something a little more creative).  The fried calamari was excellent! Not rubbery and not overcooked-perfect coating-nice and crispy-yummy.   Prices are what you'd expect at a place like this meaning it was reasonable.  Super cool bar area!! Cozy and inviting."}
{"text":"Kurt & I moved to Vegas a year ago . Distill is our bar that we come to twice a week or so . The food is simply amazing , Thank you Charles & Jeff .  Bartenders are super friendly, Thank you Teresa, Corrin , Marisa , Mike, George, Jay, & Shawn .  Holly & Natalie are our favs when were not sitting at the bar .  but really the entire staff is amazing .   Dont go by the bad reviews .  Come experience for yourself ...  As you see its been a year coming to Distill and  we  LOVE DISTILL !!!!!  Thank you !!!!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Excellent food. And bartender is super friendly and made great food suggestions."}
{"text":"I love hanging out here! All of the bartenders are on point. Great food, great atmosphere, and amazing people. So happy this place opened up!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today...outside! Amazing breeze rolling through the patio. I had their version of the Moscow mule. Super yummy! I wanted to try a selection of the menu so my friends and I ordered a variety of goodies! I read another review that the calamari was bad so I had to try it myself. Wrong!!! I swear on the bible it was the best I've had! She needs to order it again. The street tacos were amazing, I wanted to lick the plate! Caesar salad was good...I might get the dressing on the side if you like it light but I loved it. The poppers are not traditional they are actual pieces of jalapeño with cream cheese and fried, hot and yummy.  For all these people that went opening night you need to give it another chance. I was very happy with the service, drinks and food. I will definitely be going back. One more thing...I did not smell any smoke and I'm super sensitive to that so I think they must have aired it out."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, great atmosphere. Our server was Rhea and she was very attentive and made us feel like we had known her forever. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A few friends & I went on opening night. The staff was very friendly & the service was great. Prices seemed very reasonable on both food & drinks. We ate the buffet they had (fajitas were great!) but I am looking forward to returning to try several menu options. The patio was fabulous & the updated decor inside was very inviting. I would love to make this my new brunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Love the open space and modern look and feel of it. Everyone throwing out good fun vibes. The bartenders were great,servers also. Thank u Mike especially for being so funny and friendly. The pot roast egg rolls are delicious, along with every thing else we ordered. The machines were very nice to us as well!  It's far from home for us but it is absolutely worth a little drive to enjoy this great new bar!"}
{"text":"Distill is exactly what Summerlin has been waiting for.  They area really hasn't had a local bar scene (aside from those in the neighboring casinos) before and this place really adds convenience and ease when grabbing drinks with friends after work.    Their menu is pretty impressive.  It is a step up from your average bar food and has a very diverse selection (plus pancakes lovers rejoice, breakfast is available all day!)  My personal favorite item is the avocado eggs rolls.  They staff is pretty friendly.  Our server was relatively new so she was still getting into the swing of things, but you could tell she was trying so I won't judge too critically.   The interior decor is warm and inviting, and the patio layout is kind of fun.   The bathrooms, however, could use an update.   Overall, I enjoyed Distill, will be returning and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar! Super chill place, any day of the week. Not much people go here and mostly locals. They serve food 24/7 and the staff is great. I loooooove the patio because of those lovely lights! Perfect place since it's just 7 mins from my place. Love this bar!"}
{"text":"Distill Bar is the old Agave.  The decor hasn't changed much but didn't really need to.  Got here early - around 5.  Wasn't too busy.  Had couple drinks at the bar - my friend won $20 bucks :) - and then sat at a high top table just a few feet away when my other 2 friends arrived.  The one thing that stood out for me was the staff.  Positive attitude and attentive.  From the bar to the table.  We ordered the chips and salsa ($1.99 happy hour) at the bar.  The salsa wasn't bad but the chips just wasn't like Agave when we ordered it was hot and freshly made.  We ordered the mashed potato bites, as we were told it was the most popular.  It was ok.  I guess I expected it to be more crispy on the outside.  I'll try the pretzels or the poppers next time.  Breakfast is served 24/7!  I asked our server for suggestions and settled on the steak and eggs breakfast.  ($11.99)  I forgot to advise how I wanted my steak cooked and wasn't asked so I got it well done.  Bummer as I'm a medium rare girl.  Eggs were cooked perfectly.  Steak was very thin, and had as much flavor as I would expect a well done thin steak to be.  Friend ordered the chicken fried steak special and it came with soup or salad, mashed potatoes and vegetables for $11.99.  He liked it.  Another friend ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast with the sauce on the side and that got confused - amazingly it took only a few minutes to have fresh one made.  The sauce was made with sausage.  Funny part was we had a hard time figuring out the \"sausage\" in the sauce and had to ask.  Our server didn't know and had to ask herself.   That being said it wasn't bad :)  The soup was a chicken and artichoke.  It came out - to me - barely warm.  It was my friend's soup and he was content with it.  But I like my soup hot.  Couldn't even see any steam.  My friend had the black and blue burger.  He loved it.  Gave it three thumbs up!  Seems to be the food of choice as I saw quite a few sliders and burgers at other tables.  I was just hoping the breakfast would've been better as most of the time you can't really mess that up.  Food 3.5  Service 4.5 Venue 4"}
{"text":"dont even bother walking in unless you are a local. it's seat yourself. they will not acknowledge you or serve you. but they will arrogantly ignore you until you give up and leave."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and the bartenders who work here. My fav is Theresa . Happy hour is wonderful"}
{"text":"Excellent service by Erin and awesome food! Both barrenders made sure everything was ok and continuously checked up on us. Shrimp tacos are excellent."}
{"text":"Once again Phil and the rest of the Distill crew out did themselves with their awesome customer service!!! Love watching them all work together as a team!!! Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Great new local place.  Staff was friendly. Happy hour appetizers were delicious. Everyone cleaned their dinner plates."}
{"text":"I love going to Distill because of there Wings!!!        Friendly Bartenders and waitress!!!! Enjoy watching Football on Sunday and Monday.   Smoke free dinning area is great for the whole family."}
{"text":"Really good food. Nikki is a great bartender. Nice drinks, overall a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Been here the last 3 Sunday's it's usually pretty busy but great atmosphere bartenders do a really good job keeping up with the flow of business I never had to ask for refill on my drink they were on top of it! Which is impressive considering how busy they get. Brittney has been great very friendly and helpful. Shaun is equally awesome and very funny they compliment each other very well."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is a pretty great bar!  DRINKS: It's a bar...do I need to describe what drinks they have? ;) You name it, they have it!  FOOD: Talk about food worth your dollar. Everything on their menu is huge! I highly recommend the buffalo chicken wings. It is a great big portion and it tastes great. I like to get their house salad. It is only about $5, but it is sharing size. You can't go wrong with the sliders either, there are various types to chose from. The worst thing on their menu is the chicken pot pie....just don't order it or you'll regret it.  ATMOSPHERE: I love to come here with friends and play pool. It's one dollar per game. The staff is super friendly and quick with orders. It is a great place to hang out so it does get busy daily."}
{"text":"Great local bar to go have fun, shoot some pool, and gaming is the best! Superior bartenders like Nicole, Erin, Elliot & John. If you are looking to just relax without any expectations other than soul enhancement & solitude of mind---this is the place to hang out."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure.  Probably the most respectful understanding bartenders in town.  This is my normal wind down.  A place to forget the worries of your day, anytime of day for that matter.  Lane, rick, chanel, ronnie,teanne, rob, justin, billy, and glenn.  Seriously never left without being thanked or having bad service.  Never yelp so take my word for it."}
{"text":"Brittney is the best!  She knows exactly what we want as soon as we walk in. The pretzel bites are amazing and she already know that we want DOUBLE cheese for those yummy bites. Great staff. Very attentive and patient."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in to watch the Packers and Lions game (Packers fan) :) and had such a nice time! Bree was our server. She was very friendly, caring and attentive. Thank you to Bree and Distill for such a great game day!! We will be making it our place to go for every game."}
{"text":"Fun place to have a drink, but the food is not very good. I've tried several appetizers.  Had steak salad last night.  Everything I've had just doesn't have enough flavor.  Hubby had chicken sandwich last night and he said the same.   Also, not enough bar tenders."}
{"text":"Had a great time! Good service! The mashed potato bites were fabulous! My friends had mozzarella sticks and Ahi Tuna and both of them raved about their appetizers. Our server was very friendly, helpful, and attentive and looked festive with her red Santa sweat shirt! I would definitely return to eat at Distill."}
{"text":"Simply put: Fun ambiance, always a good crowd, pool tables, games and large adult Jenga game with funny dares. Only downfall is, their cocktails aren't good at all. First time I came I tried the mule on the specialty cocktail menu, it was terrible. Tried a regular mule and was still a disappointment. Decided to come back and give them another shot, A friend and I tried every drink on the specialty cocktail list and a margarita. None good at all. What's a bar without good drinks? If you're a beer drinker or just want to come and play pool, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"So we had stopped in here last year and I was very impressed.  I forgot to write a review so... I had to come again and make sure I knew what it was like:). This restaurant is everything that I wanted, not too crowded, good food, great service and best of all nice people!  I will definitely come back:)"}
{"text":"Sarah is awesome what a personality just makes you feel at home and ready to have a good time! Good food recommendations and drinks! Thank you again"}
{"text":"Amazing meal! The service here is incredible! Our waitress Emily was so kind to our family, and was so polite. Our meal was very fresh and delicious! Also, Tammy is a great waitress as well! Highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"We visited this new restaurant/bar, and were quite impressed. We had an early dinner in the restaurant area. Our waitress Holly was absolutely delightful. The food was very good, and there were so many varied choices. I think we found a new favorite in our area. When peeking  into the bar, it looked large, and attractive."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhoodbar. The staff are amazing just too name a few. Theresa, mike , george,  corena (, bartenders) cheif jeff knows how too cook and loves feedback if your unsatisfied which im sure thats a low count of unsatisfaction.love Tammy and the rest of the wsitress stsff always so friendly and accurate. Ive had almost everything except the aui from apps too main course too most sandwiches never disappointed.and the beverages arent bad either.just love the warmth and home like feel and family. Met a bunch of beautiful people at distill. Promise you wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My 2 friends and I sat at the bar. The bartender took a while, but finally got to us. We ordered some drinks and then all 3 of us started to play the machines. As usual, the first drinks were finished quick and we're ready for more. The bartender was busy, but didn't seem to have that sense of urgency.  He would talk to people for like 5 min and then finally go to the next group to get the next groups drinks. Finally round 2  is served. Meanwhile, each of us are down over $40 in these tight machines.  The food comes and looks delicious.  Unfortunately there was no flavor in any of our pasta dishes. It was weird, cause it looked so good and I wanted it to at least taste ok, but NO FLAVOR!   Round 3 was served. No one asked how the food was. Maybe they know what the answer would be. Just to cut to the chase and finish this story, we had about 5 beers each and 3 shots. They comped 2 drinks!!! We were playing the whole damn time!! The absolute worst was when my friends girlfriend came to pick us up, there was some fight in the parking lot and a guy pulled a gun on the other guy! All these police came and had the guys on the side of the road!  Bartender was super slow to serve, machines super tight, food sucked, didn't comp drinks for players, and guns and police!  NO THANK YOU!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in on whim after work- service and food were great- machines were friendly too!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was very quick and attentive upon entry. Grilled fish tacos were delicious and French fries were crisp. Overall a great experience for bar food and drinks!"}
{"text":"So don't come see Theresa, she's a bartender and she beats objects up with her head... Just kidding... She's awesome... So is Holly that waitresses... Everyone here... Amazing staff!! Great food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay so, since there's really no where I like in this area I decided to visit again. First I must say I think they hired a professional chef from the strip now because I've had one of the best burgers in a long time. Amazingly juicy and the tomato, pickle and bread are perfect. The server was super sweet and I felt like I was visiting a good friend's house. Also since it's very late I'm surprised at the quality of food and service I received. Great customer experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is a good bar with good food.   I have been here twice now, and it never seems to be very crowded, but that's a plus for me because I never have to wait. I like that the restaurant is glassed off from the bar, so it is quieter and appropriate for families. If you are looking to watch sports, this is a good bet.  I love the decor. The light fixtures are unique, and everything is dark, but it still feels clean and cool.   As for the food, it's all quality. I like the fried chicken sliders in particular. It's what I crave if I am craving bar food.   The service is a little touch and go. The servers are quick to take your order, and the food does not take very long, but once you have your food, the servers really seem to not check in too often. It's hard when you need something for your food or need a new drink. On the second visit, my order was also wrong. They were apologetic, but everyone else was done eating before I could even begin.   I will likely be back."}
{"text":"Fun times, fun people, great food. This place has a dedicated restaurant side with glass separating the bar/lounge area. Lots out of couches, tables, games and TVs. Great for an upscale dinner or casual date. Came on a Sunday night and the place is full but still able to find tables and seats. Bartenders are super fun and there are lots of events with prizes."}
{"text":"This was a great bar. Everything that we ordered was AMAZING!! Everyone working was very friendly! Our server Trisha made sure that we had everything we needed. Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Came into the bar and patiently waited about 45 minutes before even having a bartender approach me.  After finally being given a menu and a drink waited another 25 minutes before he came back. I understand it being a little busy but at least some acknowledgement would have went a long way."}
{"text":"Jay --  My friends and I have many choices in this area to spend our $$$.   Of all these places, the reason we come here is the warm customer service we get from bartendress Ronnie.   Distill is lucky to have her.  Very engaging,  sweet personality.  Worth the visit  when she is working."}
{"text":"Spent 15 minutes waiting no service came, called the number and a individual laughed on the phone that I called. Lack of professionalism."}
{"text":"Great fun atmosphere, delicious food that is well presented and a really good selection."}
{"text":"This bar is five stars to me. Good service from friendly bartenders. The food is good.  I'm always treated right and want to return.  I highly recommend if you want to chill with a few cold ones  and relax.  TVs everywhere for games, too, with specials."}
{"text":"I have had such a great time here. It was busy but Sean made sure that I was taken care of and that I never felt ignored. I will be coming back here for the drinks and the atmosphere. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. . . Okay, maybe a little strong for a local bar, but this place is pretty great. It's a super chill, super well appointed place to come in for a drink. Not to mention their fully stocked bar, with real, professional bartenders. These guys are pros and will take great care of you. Their progressive jackpots were at $6,000 each and they have this promotion where every hour they pick numbers and if it matches all of your numbers that you pick you get 10k. The burger I had \"the cure\" was so good. It had fried parsnips, which were pretty darn good. I love this place for graveyard. They have a full staff just waiting to help you, full kitchen, bottom line, stop in and have a nice night.   And the patio is the best part, just so you know."}
{"text":"We are pretty new to the Las Vegas area but we have enjoyed Distill several times already. They have great food (plus great happy hour specials) & friendly servers. They have an extensive menu with many choices. We've tried the Chicken Caesar wrap, the chicken nachos, the short rib tacos, the buffalo dip, chips and salsa, and a couple of other items off the menu and none of us were disappointed. Can't wait to go back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is always great. It's quiet so we can visit and when you ask for certain items they always take care of you."}
{"text":"This bar offers amazing food and great drinks. The atmosphere in the bar is energetic yet cozy, a perfect place to meet a group of friends or just have a drink at the bar. I love playing poker and keno here. The bar tapas & food is high quality and really good. I recommend the mash potato bites, the chicken sandwich and the fish tacos. Ryan and Jennifer are really great bar tenders here and Aaron is an awesome cook. This is arguably one of the best local bars in town. (also they have a pool table and a juke box)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I honestly loved this place! It's only 3 blocks from home so we were excited to try it out! We got the turkey and stuffing ball appetizer things (lol). And I got the beef tenderloin tips.. soooo good! My bf got spaghetti and meatball and also said it was really good :) my martini was a bit strong but I wasn't complaining lol I put a few ice cubes in it and it was good to go. The service was quick and good, we will definitely be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Today was my fourth visit....Eh... It's always a hit or miss when I come here. Four stars for the Tavern Atmosphere. It is really enjoyable and comforting here to hangout with friends or coworkers after the late night dinner shift. They have a comfortable patio too!  Unfortunately, there isn't much consistency with the drinks, however; I send my liquor back every time I visit or exchange it for wine (because you can't mess that up).  I had a pizza here almost a month ago; it was small for the \"large\" portion, but really tasty. However tonight, it was terrible [both the food and service]. Waitress was not very attentive either.  Overall, this place has potential if the staff and management get it together before downtown summerlin opens up in October. Otherwise, I could see this place closing up shop before 2015. May try again, but I won't suggest to distill to friends."}
{"text":"Really good American fare and drinks in a funky bar setting!   So my husband and I just went here today initially for a few drinks after work, but we enjoyed the vibe and the look of the place so we decided to stay for dinner.  We are very glad we did.  We had these tasty crab bites to start.  My husband had a patty melt that he liked so much that I barely got a bite.  The thing that sealed the deal for me were the banana fritters for dessert - fried just right with a rockin' carmel sauce.  As locals, we finally feel like we may have found a place that has the right balance between being a funky bar and a very good restaurant.  We are going to go back to see if we are right."}
{"text":"We had a great time and amazing service. I know this place ranks low right now on here but give it a chance it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The hamburger was great and the beer is ice cold! This may be my new spot. I have heard good things about this place from friends before so I gave it a try. I highly recommend checking them out of you haven't already.   PS.  The bartender was cute too"}
{"text":"I use to live on this side of town and frequent this bar all the time.  Just moved to henderson and I still can't stay away.  The bartenders are incredible,...Rick,  Ronni, Chanel, Justin....make you feel like family.  Reminds me of back east bars.  Not your typical money only matters joint.  Great sports venue,  great food,  indoor and outdoor seating.  Awesome happy hour.  Can't say enough...oh. .I'm not a gamer. ..but I literally see people win huge here all the time. .no lie.  I'm just a puss with my money. .lol.  good luck and get over here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a dark smokey bar with plenty of TVs and average bar food, this is your place.  To be fair they do offer something for the non smoking crowd. Similar to their sister restaurant Remedy, they offer all ages family dining / a non smoking environment in a small fishbowl of a room just to the side of the bar.  Of course, you have to walk through the smoke to get there - smoke so heavy that you need to change clothes to get rid of the smell.   Don't get me wrong, I love a dive bar.  I lived at Dinos for about a month.  But Distill falls somewhere in the middle of a dive bar and a restaurant- and unfortunately on my visit they fell hard.   As for the food, I had their new braut which tasted very off. And the seared ahi, which was underwhelming.    Despite the taste of the food, the service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Awful experience. I waited forever to order a drink & told them I wanted to order food and was given the wrong drink that tasted horrible & then ignored to fix the problem with the drink & ignored for my food order. Finally upon getting service, they got me a new drink & messed up my food order & overcharged me. I let them know & they said oh! No apology! Upon getting home, no butter or honey for the cornbread & no salsa for the tacos & they look like they were shaken up in the box!"}
{"text":"Great bar. Nice and big, with plenty of seating and pool. Nice seating with fire on the patio. Best bar in summerlin if you ask me. Food is great, chipotle chicken nachos are my fave !!! Awesome place !!"}
{"text":"We love the food, our second time here. Unfortunately, we sat at the bar and the people just not friendly. We sat at the bar and I think the guys name is Chris, very antisocial, etc. But at least the food is great"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! I've been here a few times and always such a great time, food, and beer. Their chips and salsa are bomb!"}
{"text":"Great food very nice and friendly staff.. the FOOD !!! Always consistent. Please bring back that delicious beer cheddar soup."}
{"text":"So this is my third experience at a local Distill.  The BEST experience so far and DANI was the best sever!   She has a great personality.  Friendly and so attentive.  Made our morning drinking and breakfast even more enjoyable.  The beer selection is great, as is the bartender.  Then the food comes and WOW!   Best chicken fried steak in Vegas. An excellent way to start the day."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical given the negative reviews, but gave it a shot and really like this place. Our server was new, and didn't know the menu too well, but it wasn't a problem. I got the cure burger and let me tell you, it was delicious. Very juicy, and very tasty. I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"What cool bar to hang out at. Food was fabulous, bar tenders are very friendly and fast. Way to go guys, great job!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and keeping late hours. This place has some of the best 24 hour drinking and dining I've ever seen. I own a consulting company, we specialize in Night Club & Service Industry branding, promotions, event management, and training. I know good business when I see it! I came in 2 nights in a row after 2am; both times greeted quickly with a smile, great food, extremely clean and well kept interior, great gaming rewards program, and I was absolutely blown away when the bartender Jay not only remembered me but welcomed me by name the second night I came in! Jay is top notch, give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place to hang out. St Patty's day crowd was a blast. Lots of people but still great service (Miriam especially) and the DJ/MC was a great touch. Overall best Vegas St Pattys spot. Props to the raffled merch, legit clothing not cheap prizes."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Service is always amazing, especially from Ryan G.! He is the reason I became a repeat customer. Very friendly, warm and welcoming and willing to go go out of his way to create a great experience. And the food?! Always awesome!! Better menu and quality than you will find at any other bar."}
{"text":"Over the last couple of months, my friends and I have became regulars here. The atmosphere is very enjoyable and usually always fun, depending on what crowd has managed their way in side! During our first visit here, it was extremely hard to get a bartenders attention, and when we mentioned it to the bar back Rob, not only was he on top of the customer service..he got us our drinks and convinced us to come back. As we continued to come back the service has definitely changed for the better.. But I must say, there are still  sometimes it's hard to get a drink. That could easily be fixed with just a little more organization behind the bar.   The food is absolutely delicious! I'm a pretty picky person for the most part but I'm definitely trying everything on the menu! Mozzarella sticks, salads, wings, wraps, pretzel bites, sliders... It's all delicious!  Phil, Dan, Rob and Rick are pretty awesome bartenders! I enjoy coming in when they're working. Rob is usually on top of his game and is always checking up on you to make sure you're okay and if you need anything!   There's two of guys that I have not named; that I could careless about due to their attitude. So I try to stay out of the bar when they are there.   I've had some crappy service at bars before and ended up not even enjoying my drinks.. At least at this place I know I'm going to have a great time!   Anyways great local hangout! Pretty chill, fun environment. See you all there!  Rick is by far my favorite bartender here!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Very good. Excellent service. Waitress recommended Atichoke appetizer... lived it! We had Tenderloin Tips for entrees. Delicious but lots of gravy. Would say easier on gravy next time but tasty. Holly was our waitress. Explained everything and very friendly. We even are in a rewards program!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast on Friday night Chicken sandwich was the bomb and the chili surprisingly good. Forgot to check in for free whiskey. Damn it. Next time for sure.  We sat back by the pool tables but from what I see the rest of bar and patio are awesome. We will come back. At least to visit the weird bathrooms. Although I have to say the men's room was very dirty when I was there."}
{"text":"This is my third time here. The workers are nice and at night it's a nice place to go with your significant other or friends and have drinks and talk. The only reason it does not have 5 stars is because I have not found any food on the menu that I \"have to have\"."}
{"text":"Nice staff! Good food. Easy little spot to meet for drinks and have a good time. I love the buffalo chicken sliders."}
{"text":"Just had a horrible experience. My boyfriend and I came here to gamble and grab some food. It wasn't packed but a good amount of people in there. We found machines to gamble out right away. The bartender was friendly we ordered drinks and food. The problem is when the food came out. I got a western burger the bacon came out barley cooked it looked raw. My boyfriends food came out with a bug on it! It was dead laying on his plate in the middle of the food. It took us a couple minutes to flag down the bartender and we informed her of the meal. She grabbed the plate said eww and what do you want me to do? Grab you another one or just take it off. At this point we were so grossed out we just wanted to leave. We grabbed the bill and the food with the bug was still on there. I had to ask them to remove it. No one ever said sorry about it or a manager didn't even come talk to us. We will never return here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I live on the strip and I have 0 problem driving to this location. Lelaine is as good as it gets. She is warm, personable, attentive, the literal definition of hospitality. I was here two nights ago during grave and Nate the bartender was the same way. Their manager Jeff is on top of everything, every detail of the bar and their serve Sydney is as sweet as can be. I love this place and this location only and that is why I will keep coming back time and time again"}
{"text":"Place is a joke don't waste your time. Service is poor unless your sitting at the bar playing video poker"}
{"text":"Just dropped in for breakfast after reading the reviews here.  Sat out on the cozy patio as today's weather is ideal.  Was waited on by Brittany who was timely and had a sparkling personality.  She was genuinely interested in us as we had a nice chat.  The breakfast was very good and the price was surprisingly low. Can't wait to come back for lunch and dinner. Looking forward to trying some of their yummy looking alcoholic beverages as well."}
{"text":"I love going to Distill for Happy Hour. They have great drink prices, a really great Happy Hour menu and the atmosphere is relaxing. Went last night with a group of friends and had a great time. Our waitress was really nice, super friendly and on point with her service. The manager Tony came over and sat with us and was great as well. He even offered me his own phone charger when I mentioned my phone had died. That's service! Love the artichoke app, sweet potato fries and the Sangria"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! This is by far the best bar in the south west I can not wait for football season here! The food is amazing especially the breakfast ! Nicole and Chelsey are super awesome by far the best in the neighborhood ! Love it"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to kill an hour & met Corrin-she's a fabulous friendly bartender... will be back again!!! Hopefully during happy hour :)"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere, especially with the fires going. Food is great and drinks did their purpose. Our server Lexi took great care of us and was very friendly.....even laughing at my corny jokes. Highly recommend it for a friend's and family night out"}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this place out and I'm glad we did. Made a point of sitting out on the patio, which has a great atmosphere. This inside does too, but the weather has been so great, it's a treat to sit outside while the breeze is blowing.   We came mid-week, after happy hour. I'd wanted to get here for happy hour, since the prices are incredible for that, but once I saw the very limited food options, I was okay with our arrival time. The patio was open and not too crowded. Erin was our server, and she was great from beginning to end (and we sat for awhile just chatting).  Specialty cocktails are always fun and we tried two of theirs:   Distiller's Delight -- bourbon-based, not too sweet, very refreshing. Probably my favorite of the two. Also tried the Mad Mule (without the simple syrup). This variation on the Moscow Mule is nice, but the addition of all the extra sugar would be too sweet. As it was, it was pretty sweet with a nice ginger bite at the end.   Food:  Shrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip  -- Bland, bland, bland and very watery. No cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of lemon juice to brighten it up. The shrimp tasted like the frozen precooked rubbery kind. Mixed in a bit of salsa with it just to choke it down. Told Erin about it and she said that sometimes it's bland and sometimes it's not, it depends on who is in the kitchen. Sorry, but a commercial kitchen ought to have the recipes perfected, especially when it's a basic 5 ingredient appy that has a bunch of 5-star recipe options all over the food websites.   Chicken Nachos -- Surprisingly good. Once again, not made particularly well, as the chips in the top center were covered in toppings, and then there were a pile of naked chips underneath, but the chicken was good (not spicy as advertised), the refried beans added a salty edge, the cheeses were pretty good, and the guacamole was very good. We used the salsa to save the spinach artichoke dip.   The chips on both dishes were good, but the items themselves came out only lukewarm, so they were cold halfway through. I've seen this comment on a couple of other reviews, so I think it's an issue with the kitchen.   Total bill for 2 drinks and 2 appetizers + tax/ tip/ etc. came to $50. Typical Summerlin prices.   All in all, I loved the atmosphere, the drinks and the nachos. Looked like there might be a few other items to try on the menu. And the inside of the restaurant looked really nice too. So we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"This Place ROCKS!!!!!  We come here a lot... And it's awesome! The environment is chill... We LOVE the outdoor patio! It's just lovely...! The Regional manager is there often, Jeff is Awesome! He leads from the front, helping his servers and greeting guests and also helping the cooks if they need! He has a great staff! You can tell everyone loves their job! He's greeted us and bought us rounds on the house and remembered us only the second time we went! The food is great! The pizza is awesome and the burgers!  The salmon was too salty for my liking but it was delicious besides that;) The server promptly offered to send it back to make it perfect.  Plus they have a rewards card! Who doesn't like money off!!!!!  The servers are so nice and fun and attentive! We love the experience!!!"}
{"text":"Good service and delicious food. Had a good night hangin out with my softball buddies. Hopefully my review doesnt get taken down like all my other ones. The bartenders were pretty cool guys. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Thought this place got better. I was wrong. Must of just went on one of their FEW good days. Done trying, looks like PTS it is!"}
{"text":"Love the street taco!! GM was friendly and accomodating- will definitely go back and check out more of their food and happy hour"}
{"text":"Very nice bar. Extremely large area with comfortable seats, not a crammed bar. The food was very good also, a great variety of items. I ordered a personal pizza that was pretty good. The drinks are on point and the staff is very friendly. I'm extremely surprised this bar has a 3.5 star rating, very low in my opinion.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! The food is beyond bar food! Seriously best food in the neighborhood. Staff is great especially the very attractive Nicole. Best place for lunch or a Sunday game. Ask for Nicole you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened, I LOVE the bar outings (golf, bowling & UNLV game) and the staff is AMAZING!!! Marissa, Corrin and Mike are great!!!"}
{"text":"After spending way too much time (and money) on Las Vegas Blvd it was nice to get away to a local sports bar to watch a football game. Atmosphere is great, plenty of TV's available from all seats with the ability to watch multiple games at the same time.  We decided to hang out in the pool table/video game area. Even though we weren't at a table or bar we were given prompt service from the bartender and got our food and drinks ordered. They have a standard bar menu with plenty of items to choose from burgers to seared salmon. As we were here right in the middle of the afternoon I just went with their bratwurst sandwich. It came out pretty quick and was actually not bad at all. It cooked perfectly, bun was lightly toasted and came with a generous helping of fries. They have a full bar available with a wide selections of beers on tap. There is a Yelp special of getting their house whiskey for free if you check in but drink at your own risk! All and all, a great place to kick back on a Sunday."}
{"text":"We have been to this location three times now. The first time was on 11/18/17. We came down for drinks and appetizers. The avocado egg rolls and mashed potato bites were amazing. We also had the pleasure of meeting the general manager Tony Ramieh. He is very personable and professional and according to my friend he is also handsome. We enjoyed it so much we came back for breakfast on thanksgiving morning and we were greeted at the door by Tony who even remembered our names. We had breakfast on the patio the ambience on the patio is also amazing. Friday night 11/23/17 we came for dinner. We no sooner sat down when Tony came over and said hello. He recommended the fish and chips and it was delicious. They have a great beer selection and wine list. I'm starting to think Tony works 24/7. We will continue to come back this is our go to place now. Thank you Tony Ramieh for making Distill not just above average but great"}
{"text":"Ive had this place once and it was ok. Basic bar food. I have emailed them about 9 times regarding a event and still no one has responded, so clearly there hospitality is HORRIBLE!! They most likely wont last in Vegas if they keep this up, i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone i know! I would rather go to PTs then step one toe into this place again, horrible, horrible customer service. What a shame."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Gyro sandwich was excellent. Shrooms were okay but too small. The salad just so so. It took forever to get our order. When it came the food was cold. Honestly I cannot find a reason to go back here. Not our kind of place. We go out to relax and unwind. This place was so noisy I couldn't think. Waitresses were running around like crazy. I felt guilty flagging them down. The whole experience made me anxious.  I would have given the place two stars but the waitress was kind enough or Savvy enough to comp us for the price of the salad because it took so freaking long to get our order.  One last warning.  If you do decide to go here do not get the house Merlot. It was the worst wine I ever drank. It tasted like Merlot laced with turpentine. First time in a long time that I did not finish a glass of wine."}
{"text":"I came for the first time today... a little disappointed.  I played the machine a bit at the bar, ordered the tostada platter which were pretty much tacos with a hard mini tortilla. Service was blah. Took forever to get a drink and it also took a while to get someones attention to remove my plate from my machine area.i won't be back...."}
{"text":"Decor was cool. Food was average, not bad but nothing ultra special. The drink I ordered was very strong, no strawberry taste to it at all, only alcohol. Wait staff was friendly and attentive though."}
{"text":"3.5   Late Thursday night. White college kids dancing furiously to late '90s EDM. No, seriously, remember Alice Deejay's \"Better Off Alone\"? Yeah, popped collars and awkward kids \"dancing\" to that. Also some lifted-truck bros and bro-hos.   Aside from the crowd, the place actually wasn't bad. Lots of room, plenty of seats, atmosphere a mix of fun/cute (especially outside, though it was too cold to sit out there), and mostly empty minus previously-mentioned bros. Our server was very friendly, our food and drinks came out promptly, and foods were rather good."}
{"text":"Great food Service and Drinks..Mike Mikey Yvette Theresa and all staff are as AWESOME!! Very knowledgeable, FUN, and jus all around great!! Been here several times and always great. The General Dean runs a great crew and is very personable! Even when it gets busy, the crew is still Stellar!!! Keep up the Awesomeness!!"}
{"text":"First time we came here was for the opening and it was a blast ! Had a great time with friends and yummy apps , decided it's only fair to try it out again before I write a review . Me and my  boyfriend came here after work for some food and drinks , I was craving their infamous mozzarella triangles we ordered those chicken wings and fish and chips .our bartender Aby suggested the fish n chips over another thing on the menu we were in between and let me just say I'm not the biggest fan of fish n chips but this order was amazing the fish was so fluffy and the batter was incredible ! Thanks again ! The wings were just as great and the mozzarella triangles never disappoint ! The service was great everyone behind the bar was so nice and helpful (for as busy as the bar was ) which was awesome I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area :)"}
{"text":"Love the local atmosphere!! This place is close to home !! Great Food and beer !! Nice  place for music and to hang out !!! John and Elliot are great guys !!   Just want to give a shout to this crew !! We go here a lot and always have a great time !! Get yourself a RED card !!   Food is amazing and service is Great !! We have posted before but just wanted to say thank you to the Team for always taking care of us !!   Atmosphere is amazing with local vibe , music, food and great choice of Beers !!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place the burger I had here taste like firecrackers like sulfur it was weird , bartenders are anal and not very friendly. I'm A bartender myself at MGM and I usually have patience but wow.. I won't be coming back sorry guys"}
{"text":"Great place to hang after work in Summelin. The drinks are strong and they have some great arcade games and pool"}
{"text":"My wife, friends and I come here often. Cold beers, and great food are always on point! One of my favorite places. But the most important thing for me is customer service. The last few times I've been here, PAIGE and NATALE haven taken care us, they have been great! Everyone is great, but special shout-out goes to PAIGE, She has been outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Normally this place is great. Adequate food and drink, decent atmosphere. Just a nice local place. Tonight our drinks have been empty 15 minutes and our server MIA. The same server who took our appetizer order but never came back to get our entree orders. I even flagged a manager to order another round and we still are waiting.   Update: drinks just arrived. Our third round and the server still got them wrong.   I'm incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:30 PM to the restaurant side to nothing but awkwardness.  There is no host/hostess area to direct seating, nor is there a sign that says \"seat yourself.\"  Having been our first time there, we had no idea what to do so we stood there hoping we would be greeted.  Looking around it looked as if there was only one waitstaff for the entire, yet small, dining room.  We waited restlessly to be acknowledged to no avail, as there was one empty table.  No sooner did a couple brush by us and rudely take the only empty table that should have been ours.  Still nothing from any staff at this point.  I proceeded to the crowded and smoky bar in hopes to find someone other that the bartenders behind the bar. No luck.  We left this place for a more organized and friendly environment--probably will not come back."}
{"text":"Love the decor. Love the idea! Love love the outside ambiance. Been there a couple of times (2) it is very close to my house so I love that... Pretty diverse crowd- food is delicious as of my most recent visit. They added a few new items. The brisket sliders were delicious as were the pickle straws and the stuffed mushrooms. Big downside; seriously had to track down a waitress:( this place is going! Hire more people or replace the ones that don't want to be there. Another big deal (for me) the bathroom was DISGUSTING! But I do like this place:) I will return- even if I have to wait 15 minutes between waitress visits."}
{"text":"What a horrendous experience experience. We were seated and had to wait 15 minutes to get initially served when there were four waiters who saw us being idle , then half an hour to to get out food. The food is also bland and not worth the money."}
{"text":"My First time here, it was Great service, food was on time, drinks were really good. Britney was our waitress and she was Amazing!! I will definitely be back since I live down the street!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a two on this one. The service is absolutely slow, and sometime don't even come to you for an hour or more to take your order. The food and drinks are good, just need better service. And on at parties day, the bartender was not friendly in a nicer way of putting things."}
{"text":"Well waiting an hour and a half for bar food is unacceptable....Friday night is apparently not a good time to come because \"the kitchen is backed up\"! Our order was incorrect and they substituted at their own discretion rather than ask what I may have wanted.....one of the three tacos was seasoned ...however over seasoned....the wait staff is inattentive and the bar staff is slow making drinks"}
{"text":"Go in on a Friday night - ask waitress \"do you have a whiskey list?\" - no. She asks me to name a specific one, I do - says she has it (nothing crazy, American brand) - she returns says doesn't have it and then still can't name any whiskeys - suggests I just go to bar. If your bar is called \"Distill\" - you should have people who know drinks - especially prime time on a Friday."}
{"text":"Good breakfast this morning. Love the new menu and usually frequent the Centennial location for lunch, but wanted to give this place another try. Breakfast for 3 people was only $28, which is a great deal. The omelets were a little small, but the rye toast was huge--and delicious. Our server, Kelye was super friendly, efficient, and funny. I would go back just to see her."}
{"text":"Came here on our trip to Vegas and was very satisfied with the food and mikey was super helpful"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is great, the service is exceptional. There is a warm comfy feel to the atmosphere that has a gravitational pull that will keep you in your seat for hours. Thank you for the wonderful experience. Kristal runs a bar with a friendly atmosphere and a welcoming ambiance."}
{"text":"Best bar I've been to in awhile! I'm always treated with a smile and treated like family. Kristyne and Jeff do a very good job at providing a comfortable atmosphere and pleasurable experience. Kim will keep your tummy full and your taste buds happy!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience we came in for breakfast we ordered something so simple as eggs and sausage explain to me why we we waited an HOUR and the waitress came back to say they had switched tickets orders which meant we sat there watching everyone that came after us get their food. I'm a patient person but this was ridiculous. The waitress came back to say our order was next, I'm sorry but we just waited an hour for our food. We got up and left!"}
{"text":"Big blue van on tap. This was our first time here. Good music/friendly service/nice atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have only been here a few times and the food had yet to disappoint! We got the mashed potato bites as an appetizer and shared the sliders! Great service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Good food and just a great place to kick it with your friends.   Also the bartenders and wait staff are really cool. Next time I'm coming here with a cigar."}
{"text":"Great food great service and great chiropractic needs were met.... talk to John for a good back crack.  I know random but seriously AUHHHMAZING"}
{"text":"Distill had great food. Also a big selection of appetizers. Their nachos need a little Xtra beans on them but other than that it's all good. Nice little spot in the middle of the desert. Alisha the server is the best"}
{"text":"Love this local bar!! Right next to my house and a must go to in Southern Highlands. Great service and cool vibes. Food is always delicious, I love the french toast and buffalo cauliflower. Nicole and Elliot are awesome too!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back because there is a lack of options and I make excuses for why I was disappointed previously ( maybe they were training someone, cook had bad day, etc), but no longer will I do that. I could go on forever at problems; bun charred for to go so bad I had to use bread at home, wrap cut at such a diagonal angle it all falls out when you pick one side up, staff is fucking around and doesn't seem to care about customers et al.   Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Amazing addition to the Northwest part of the valley.  The bartender Mike really makes you feel at home regardless if it is your first time in or you are a regular.  The bar is great and bartender even better!"}
{"text":"Came Sunday for grave got cracked bread it was really good. But the best thing about the bar was the bartender Ryan.  He was so polite and respectful even made sure i made it to my car. He went above and beyond will definitely be back only if he is working!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Even better service. Highly recommend. The manager Tony is very serious about your enjoying his food and service"}
{"text":"First time review... pleasantly surprised! We opted for the restaurant side as I hate smelling like smoke. We were quickly greeted by a very friendly wait staff.  Hubby ordered a chicken Caesar wrap with onion rings, and I opted for the brisket sliders. Everything was amazing. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I had a blast here. The wait staff is outstanding!! Very attentive and quick. Atmosphere is relaxed and fun... there is a jukebox, pool tables and a lounge area with super plush seating. We ordered apps and they were worth the price. When ever I come to Las Vegas this will be on my list to go back again. Five outstanding stars!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this bar! I love the open floor plan it has. It feels really spacious inside even on the busiest nights. It has a somewhat elegant ambience about it, especially in the ladies room. It has two pool tables, why can't all bars have pool tables? The breakfast here is amazing! Whenever I'm craving breakfast I come here. I had to knock off a star because one time I came here in the early morning of New Year's Eve, and when it was time to pay my bill with my credit card, it took over an hour to get it back. I had to ask the bartender for it and start the process of paying for the bill all over again. It wasn't busy either, I mean there were only like 4 other people in the bar. During this waiting period another bar patron spilled my beer all over my machine and wanted to buy a replacement beer for me, and the bartender accused me of spilling it myself and made me pay for my own beer, despite someone else wanting to buy my drink. I left in a horrible mood that night. All the other bartenders rock though. Amy the marketing manager is just the sweetest person ever!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch! Hubby and I split Rib eye....super delish! Mashed potatoes and spinach made me feel healthy and melted better was so worth the calories. Kristina was awesome and we we will come back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"So for a place that has \"a local bar\" in their name... they have absolutely NO local beers.  Wtf? I was severely disappointed with the beer selection.  The saving grace is that it was pretty full of life and people seem to flock from their suburban homes you have a good time.  Plus the bartenders were super friendly and attentive.  I'd say if you were looking for a drink and a gamble with a not too young,  not too old crowd, after your trip to Costco, this is your bar."}
{"text":"I've said it once and I'll say it again this is the most awesome bar in Las Vegas.  I love this place.  The staff is out of this world.  They are friendly, they make you feel welcome, and always make me want to come back again.  The food is phenomenal; not your average bar food.  If you've never been here, trust me you won't be disappointed. The only reason I gave five stars is because six stars is not an option."}
{"text":"Took 10 minutes to get approached . Server had attitude . As a local you would think they would be more welcoming"}
{"text":"Great place! I live about 5 min away so it was perfect to go get a bite and some drinks. The service was impeccable sorry i forget her name bur she was on it, never had to go find her. She had our drinks out to us before we finished the ones we had. Great place i will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love it here.  This place has quickly become home when it comes to watching the Vegas Golden Knights continue their amazing inaugural season and miraculous playoff run!  Our server BRITTANY is the very best and delivers top tier customer service every time!!  We can't wait to go back to see her and have an amazing night out.  Keep it up Brittany and see you soon."}
{"text":"Great place to become a regular if you're local. The food is good and sports are always on!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try a new bar/restaurant in the area. We arrived for lunch and was greeted by a very friendly African American male. He took our drink orders and spoke to us for a few minutes. Off to a good start. Then our waitress comes to take our order. We start with the fried pickles. For $9 I expected more than the very small order we received. (Less than half of what we get down the street for $3 less). Ordered lunch .. we were asked if we wanted fries, sweet fries, or onion rings with sandwiches. We were not informed that both onion rings and sweet fries were an additional $1. We would have still paid it.. but would have been nice to be informed while ordering. When our food was brought to us.. I asked for a refill of my soda. 10 minutes later.. waitress had not been back... finally who I can only assume was a manager came by and I flagged her down to explain  I had asked for refill and never received. She was quick to go get my refill. Finally waitress comes back.. we ask for the check. It took a long while (at this point we were the only customers in the restaurant side). Glad we paid with cash... since she never came back to collect check in case we paid with credit card. Food was just ok. Prices were a bit high ... but would have been acceptable with great customer service. Sad to say we probably won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Food awesome!  I loved the street tacos and the calamari.  This place has a great vibe.  Love the decor and great tunes are playing on the juke box.  Bartenders were attentive and very friendly.  The place is great!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Like the sign says \"a local bar\".  Great food, friendly service, and video poker.  Yes there's smoking, and drinking too!   Finally Summerlin has a 24 hour hangout.  The street tacos were awesome and you get $20 match play for signing up for there slot club.  I can't think of a local bar that surpasses what Distill offers."}
{"text":"My husband and I  thought we would give this place a try.    He ordered one of the hamburgers, which looked delicious.  I ordered the steak medallions without the gravy as I am allergic to wheat.   The server brought it to me  with gravy  I did not touch my meal. The server did not return until after my husband was finished with his meal, and did not acknowledge  the mistake.   She did not offer  a resolution.     Not impressed with the wait staff.     I think the food could have had potential, but I have no idea what it tasted like....... And, yes I paid for this meal.   The hostess was very friendly and made suggestions for appetizers and was very good at her job."}
{"text":"A bit of a hike from the strip but the atmosphere is pretty good. Burger was solid and we could have eaten five orders of the chili fries. One star off for the extremely aggressive margarita (way too sour)."}
{"text":"Terrible sports bar in the vein of PTs. Tons of sports and terrible music. Terrible service. Hard to get a drink and never clean your ashtray. They have a few more beers than the Lodge.  Terrible burgers. Terrible in general. There's just nothing much down this way, lest I would never return."}
{"text":"This is a place to chill,lounge and just be yourself.  Like the saying says, There are no stragers here only friends you haven't met. Love their string calamari and of course Moscow Mule gotta have. Servers  and Service are awesome!"}
{"text":"We go to Distill way to often, spend too much money and drink way to much......why??? Because Distill is awesome! By far one of the best local hangouts around and the food is amazing. The service is fast and the waitresses and servers are awesome, especially Jade, Kaila, and Erin. The management is extremely good as well to include Jeff who goes out of his way to ensure you have a great experience. Be aware though the server carrissa is not very good. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials! Selection is a little small, but everything on that menu is really tasty! Crispy battered artichokes were on point! Wasn't sure when I ordered them but surprisingly delicious! The dipping sauce was tangy and complemented the artichokes well. Great value at $4.  Chicken lettuce wraps are also yummy!Chicken satays were tasty but slightly overcooked, so a little dry (i've ordered them twice and they've been the same both times.) Well drinks are $3. I ordered top shelf, so it was a little more, but still had decent happy hour specials. I'm here about every other week or so. Service is usually really good."}
{"text":"This is right down the street from my house. I love the fact that they serve breakfast. When we get up a bit hangovery this is where we drag ourselves to for some breakfast.  We've also been here for...of all things...Christmas dinner. Great deals on their holiday meals. (hey that rhymed!)  We go here for happy hour with friends all the time as well. Their food is tasty, their drinks are good and I really love the decor.  They have an amazing patio off the bar as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the friendly staff and the food! I now always try to visit more often and bring friends who haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy going to Distill.  They have friendly service.  The outdoor patio is great to relax with friends Awesome food and the drinks are out of this world."}
{"text":"The Cure lived up to the hype! Great food and great service.... The bar renders are super cool and the place has a cool local feel to it. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite local bar. Great for lunch and late night drinks or snacks. Mashed potato bites are always great and I've never had a bad experience with any of the staff. They're always super helpful and always seem happy to see you."}
{"text":"Best Monday night bartenders in las Vegas, Theresa and Corrin!!!! They are very attentive and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a rainy Friday afternoon and was greeted by the friendliest bartender ever ! Nikki was so sweet and fun! They are doing this great donation of by a red Cosmo and all proceeds go to the American heart association, and the drink is delicious! Defiantly check this place out if you're in the neighborhood and ask for Nikki ! You won't be disappointed :)  also try the mash bites !!!"}
{"text":"We had a GREAT time. Burgers were delish the service was outstanding.  Our server, Ines was wonderful.  Ines was fast and courteous.  Thank you Ines for a great evening."}
{"text":"Very surprised at the price of the food.Very reasonable. The food we. Ordered was all very tasty. I had shredded beef tacos.....yummy. Hubby had shrimp tacos....he loved them. Daughter had sliders...she loved them. I liked the service. Staff was friendly. Food presentation was fantastic. I really felt it was a fabulous experience that did not cost way too much."}
{"text":"Nice team I was greeted and welcome to the bar I was told about happy hour and Wednesday are DJ night. I got a players card plus $10 for first $20 cool place I would bring my friends parking might be token but you can park in gravel. Bartender even shock my hand I will be back soon! Cool place to take boss or co-workers."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed the Battered Calamari Sticks and Garlic  Bread with the Spinach Dip. The food came out pretty fast for a busy Friday night at a happening bar. The price is pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Great bar !! Fantastic food ! Great staff! I came in on Sunday and Nicole was super nice ! I couldn't believe how good the food was! This is not your average bar!"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. From the service to food to drinks. Great potential though. Beautiful outdoor area and it is pretty cool inside as well. I've been multiple times but it has never been consistently a good experience."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in town and she took me here for drinks and some apps. I ordered a Summer Shandy and the Cheese Pizza that was on Happy Hour. A lot of the reviews said the food wasn't that great I noticed. My cheese pizza was really good other than the crust being a little bland. Nothing some Ranch couldn't fix. Our server was friendly and attentive too.  I loved their outdoor patio area. It was cool and rainy so we ended up going back inside but I bet it's a perfect place to enjoy some grub and drinks in the spring. Admittedly, coming from somewhere you can't smoke inside, the smell of cigarettes hanging in the air inside was a little off putting. Overall a cool place with a cool vibe if you're not expecting a Michelin-start experience and just want some basic food and drinks."}
{"text":"Another great distill location. Bartenders are always a lot of fun and very attentive. Living in southern highlands, this is really the best bar in the area!"}
{"text":"I love going here with my boyfriend for just a casual date night. The atmosphere is relaxing, the crowds never annoying, the service is always pretty good. We got sandwiches last time, I got the BLT. It was fine, just a normal BLT, I wasn't expecting anything fantastic since I ordered a BLT... But the fries were pretty good. Played some pool, had a few drinks and everything was under $50."}
{"text":"I work in the vicinity of Distill and a friend and I thought we would check it out one Sunday evening. We get there around 8pm with a decent crowd. We grab the first seats we find which happen to be corner seats at the bar. After about 10 minutes a waitress comes up to us (Pacific Island looking with tattoo on her forearm). She SPECIFICALLY ASKED me and my friend if either of us had to been to the bar? We both tell her no it's our first time. She let's out a shrill and welcomes us to the bar. We order our first round of drinks and when she arrives with those we order food as well. About 15 - 20 minutes later she brings us the food. (The food was really great and no complaints at all). We had finished our first drinks in the middle of eating and had to stop eating for about 10 minutes for her just to come back. When she finally arrives , in the middle of ordering my second drink she completely stops me mid sentence to yell goodbye to someone leaving............ at this point I was done with her and this bar. Needing a cigarette, I ask her if they sell. She tells me there's a vending machine but takes cash only. Remembering she's failed thus far , I take a chance and go look at the vending machine .......... sure enough takes debit/credit cards.   I wouldn't be so harsh if she hadn't gone out of her way to ask if it was our first time there ............ she knew we were new so you would think make a good impression. Unfortunately that didn't happen. Sad because I love local dive bars but this one missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"Thrillist ranked Distill's Cure burger among the top 15 in the nation for 2014, describing it as \"a combo of beef AND pork, [that hits] so many flavor notes with Fontina, spicy-sweet jalapeño jelly, a hot mayo, and crisp-fried parsnips layered on with a heavy hand.\"    That burger completely fulfilled my burger desires and then some. It amazes me that this bar and this particular burger are not more popular, as it is a fantastic amalgamation of all the best flavors a burger should have: savory, cheesy, just a bit of spice. It's stuffed and juicy without falling apart, and every ingredient successfully harmonizes with the others. It's a hefty patty, and when assembled with all the fixings it's so tall it's difficult to bite into, and you will make a mess. But it will be worth it, because this is a damn good burger. And a unique one, at that!  I am going to make a bold statement and declare this THE best burger in Las Vegas... for now. It's a competitive city for this title, but the Cure comes out on top.  Excuse the god-awful blurry photos, my haste to devour this amazing meal apparently affected my picture-taking abilities. You'll have to see (and taste!) it for yourself.

{"text":"Did a real quick stop in to check out the Happy Hour. I only had 30 minutes to eat/drink and be on my way and they definitely got me in and out of there in good time. Service was quick and our table actually had 3 servers take our orders/serve our food/check on us.  Well drink was $3, like the price and value there. Also enjoyed their chili fries, chicken sliders and chips and salsa. Just a personal thing, I really don't think that any restaurant should charge for chips and salsa but I will give these guys a pass as the salsa was pretty good. Definitely going back to spend a little more time to feel the vibe. Also looking forward to hanging at the patio when the weather warms up. As a former Agave patron, I am happy to see a cool place in this beautiful space."}
{"text":"All three stars go to the happy hour specials. They have good deals, decent bites, and it's a good place to go with friends when you just want to hang out and chill.  However, I had a sort of disturbing experience when it came to the service (aside from it being slow in general). I had gone with a girlfriend, both of us driving about 25 minutes to meet up here in Summerlin since it's a midpoint between both of our neighborhoods. We had been there ordering drinks consistently for 2 hours, then we decided to switch to water since we both had to drive. When we were ready to cash out, the bartender gave us a hard time! He kept saying things like, \"No, no... you're gonna order more.\" and LITERALLY: \"Wow, you girls are boring! What are you going to do, go home and take a nap?\" We politely explained that we had been there for two hours, and were being responsible by sobering up before driving home. He CONTINUED by egging us on with \"Well, that's what uber's for!\" and \"Yeah 2 hours is nothing, the night's just starting!\"  This really, deeply bothered me. As a bartender, I would hope that your conscious and wanting your patrons to get home safe would be a higher priority than more tips based on my drinking volume."}
{"text":"Everything was taken care of. Hopefully it was just a rookie mistake. We will definitely be going back to our local place, Distill on Durango."}
{"text":"I wanted this to be our new local joint but it won't be.  Drinks were expensive and weak.   Better to stick with beer.  Service was good, I'll give it 4 stars for that.  The big downer - smokers everywhere.  Bar area, lounge area, high top table area, pool area - just too much.  It's time to have smokers move it outside.  The majority of us do not smoke, don't want to inhale second hand smoke and don't want to go home stinking of it.  Time to get with the times.  We are locals, not tourists.  We want smoke-free bars.  And anyone saying it's not smoky is lying.  You walk into a plume of it.  I'd never go there for the food.  It's a bar.  The restaurant is suppose to be smoke free, but no smoke free side is truly smoke free, especially when you walk through it all.  And I would never bring kids there.  It's not a family-style restaurant at all.  IT'S A BAR CALLED DISTILL!  If it was a non-smoking joint, we'd go back."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Amazing food, fantastic rewards card (for free) $10 when you sign up and $20 credit during your birthday month. High quality food, not typical \"bar food.\" Doesn't have that smelly and gross feeling most places in Vegas do. It's definitely a Centennial Hills bar. If you want a bar that has a high class feel, yet warm atmosphere you will love Distill."}
{"text":"If you like noise and smoke and don't care about the service along with a manager who ignores the no smoking laws then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is an alright neighborhood 24/7 bar. It's part of the Remedy's family. Nice decor and ambiance. A little loud, but not obnoxious. Slightly better than average beer offerings. Decent food and a good selection. And they have Big Buck Hunter. All in all, a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"This Distill location is great. It's large with a big area for dining. The bar area is very nice. There's also a great patio too. It sort of all has an old Spanish feel to it. It's very open and airy and not nearly has dark as other bars. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. Have I said \"great\" enough yet? It's great. Come on in here for a drink and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Eh, I'm neither here nor there with this place. Although the food and service did not blow me away or make a lasting impression, I will say that the ambiance and atmosphere is lively and fun.   Single ladies *side note* if you're looking for a MAN this would be the place to go, it's like a MAN cave in there! Lots of MEN Haha. Well in all seriousness we came here for a going away get-together a group about 7 to 10 people.   We sat outside and loved the feel of it next to the fire pits they had. Almost everyone of us ordered drinks and either an appetizer of some sort or entrée and shared so when I say the food was just \"ok\" my credibility comes from that of being able to taste plenty of dishes.   Our server was not the most friendly but not the worst either, but I'd imagine working at an upbeat trendy place like Distill She'd have a bit more of an outgoing personality or serve up at least a few smiles here and there but no luck. All in all a great place to grab drinks and have a good time with friends but not the first place I'd choose to satisfy any cravings but in the end it is called \"Distill-a Local Bar\" rather than \"Distill, a five star restaurant.\""}
{"text":"Server was friendly,  but the food was terrible.   Ordered wings and the carrots were the warmest thing on the plate. The chicken was either baked or microwaved and their hottest sauce was boring. The fries were soggy and oily.  Not good.  I asked the server which dish she recommended and we went with the calamari. Unfortunately, it came out luke warm and soggy. Why is it so hard to get fried foods crunchy or at least hot?   They may need to check their deep fryers and/or kitchen staff, because they are failing at bar food..."}
{"text":"If you love smelling like an ashtray then this is your place. Smokers paradise and no ventilation."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Fun pool table. Decent happy hour. The food looked amazing at first. Chicken fried steak and the 90s fatboy burger were good but after I had the burger I got insanely sick. I feel like there was a poor preparation of the meat and mishandling of the avocado in the burger. I don't know if I would consider going back if they don't know how to properly cook and prepare food"}
{"text":"My favorite local bar in Vegas! Food is awesome! Always get the Double cheeseburger on Sunday morning for football. Megan and Rick at the best bartenders in Vegas"}
{"text":"We live Distill! They have a rewards program that gets you money back. There food is yummy and service is always point on!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Great atmosphere and the Philly CheeseSteak sandwich was very good.  I ordered it with the sweet potato fries and to my surprise they weren't greasy and I devoured them fast!    Nice hardwood floors all around, nice seating when you want to chill with a group of friends and PLENTY of awesome HD TV's all over the place.  There were a few smoking and I didn't smell anything (thank goodness- hate cig smell).    I'll be back for more!  Oh before I forget, there's plenty that can't find the venue or it's 'hard to find.'  Goodness how do you people survive?!  Don't blame the venue on the maps systems not having it in their database yet.  Here's some advice- use your brain the old fashioned way.  You can see the location on their FB like page.  At night it's lit up VERY well by the signs and the words on the building.  I could see it from the intersection of Silverado Ranch and Decatur easily.  Since this part of Vegas doesn't have many street lights, slow down and you'll see the side street Pyle that your turn on from Decatur."}
{"text":"Came in for steak n eggs, it was prepared perfectly and was delicious. Kristina our server was awesome!! Ask for her!"}
{"text":"This is the worst bar I've ever been to. I was looking forward to checking it out, but was extremely disappointed. It took ten minutes for us to be acknowledged, and when we finally were, I didn't even receive my drink at all. We were planning on ordering food, but couldn't get anyone to take our order. So after waiting for our bill for another twenty minutes, we left and will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you live on the southwest side of Vegas (Southern Highlands or Mountains Edge area), this bar is tucked away in a corner off Decatur and Pyle. But worth the find!  My friend Olivia introduced me to Distill a few months ago. We started coming here after work to de-stress, eat and have a few drinks. There are two parts to this place: there's the actual bar, which takes up most of the space here. Large TVs for sports, tons of tables to sit at, the entrance is the main entrance at the front of the establishment. The second part is the actual sit-down, restaurant section. It's separate from the smokiness and loudness of the bar area. And much more intimate. I prefer to sit here. And the entrance is off to the side.   Seating is by choice. We usually love to grab an open booth. Happy hour is from 3pm to 7pm! My roomie ordered the chicken lettuce wraps off the happy hour menu. And my goodness. I honestly think those were THE BEST lettuce chicken wraps I've had in Vegas. The chicken was shredded and so juicy. I couldn't take a pic because I was way too hungry, unfortunately. I ordered a side of sweet potato fries - which were nothing short of amazing - and a whiskey ginger ale off the happy hour menu for $3! My coworker ordered a BLT and she seemed very pleased with her food. But then again, I've seen her order multiple items here and she seemed to thoroughly enjoy the others as well.  Please order the chicken lettuce wraps, even if you don't make it in for happy hour.   And ask your server for a loyalty card! It gives you points on all your future visits and access to their other bar properties around the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go here often after work for a beer. The service has always been friendly. Often I'm waited on by Brittany-total sweetheart. Drinks are strong, price is right. My work had our holiday  party there. They we so accommodating-even with a group as large as ours. Thank for that Distill! And they're open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to watch the NBA playoff games  at a bar so I suggested we check out Distill, glad I came up with that idea. Great TVs around the bar perfect for watching sports, having drinks and eating good food. I order the fish and chips and my friend ordered the cure burger, both were great. I will definitely come back to watch more games. The food was great and so was the service. Our bar tender Eliot was awesome, a really funny guy that made sure we had everything we needed. I like to play video poker and appreciate good service behind the bar, this place has it."}
{"text":"Good place to watch sport. Music is waaaaay to loud. You can't visit with each other and relax.I guess that the workers like it loud."}
{"text":"Had a blast at this bar few nights ago with my friend. Great service and great happy hour prices and menu."}
{"text":"If you like the typical loud, smoky, gambling machine Vegas \"locals\" bar, then you won't mind this place. The food is decent and our server was very accommodating and friendly. This is a new location, so it's got state of the art stuff and OK atmosphere. But I think it's about time Vegas locals start expecting something more. I'll keep hanging out downtown."}
{"text":"This was a pretty poppin bar!! Went here after a wedding and they definitely didn't kill my vibe!! There's a lot of cute girls, a couple pool tables and the food is good for a bar!! I would go back way more often if I lived closer."}
{"text":"I am on a strict diet for about 20 weeks and today I got only my 2nd cheat meal in the first 7 weeks. I went for what I remembered as one of my top 2 favorite desserts in Vegas- the Distill Bread Pudding!   It's been about 9 months probably since I last had it but unfortunately, it was not much how I remember it! It was about 60% of the size it used to be. It used to be twice as tall. Today, it was about an inch thick vs. about 2 inches, was more chewy and not as fresh as in the past, and didn't have the caramelized nuts it used to have. So I have to say I was disappointed and it certainly was not the second favorite dessert I remembered it to be.   That being said, I still did enjoy the restaurant. That is the only food item that I had so I cannot comment on the other menu items. I still enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. Although smoky, it is cozy.   I sure hope they go back to their old ways as it relates to the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"This is our second time to Distill since we moved to the neighborhood.   I think we found our hangout.  Great food.  We went in for happy hour and the sliders and Greek fries will be bringing us back.  But best of all was our server Rose.  She was amazing.   Thanks Rose."}
{"text":"Attendance has improved...now it is not all guys.  But DO NOT gamble here.  They have the worst payouts of any casino I have spent time in.  To the point the gaming board should check in.  Do not gamble here ever."}
{"text":"Went here for the first and last time. Could not get service from a waitress. Sat there for 15 mins then walked up to a lady that was there asked if I could get menus and a waitress she said one second and 5 minutes later nothing! We left! Never again and would not recommend this place to anyone.No they were not busy and no they were not short staffed. Just rude and not paying attention. Train your staff better!"}
{"text":"My Monday and Thursday night home. Erin and Alysia both are awesome servers. Won a jersey! Good times!"}
{"text":"First time at this bar was awesome, good food, good service. The last few times were off, they couldn't change any of their channels one day, another day their nhl package was ordered but not on, then a few days later, still no hockey. Good bar good but not for Hockey fans yet... Hopefully, they get it together and it will be a great northside bar."}
{"text":"We love it here! Good service, good food, and you should take advantage of the happy hour deals. They also have pretty outside seating and you can play pool."}
{"text":"I feel like Distill *could* be better, but I just didn't catch it on a good day. I met a friend for lunch and was in a bit of a hurry. Unfortunately, despite it not being very busy, the service didn't match my limited amount of time. I even told the server, when she finally came around, that I had a pretty short lunch hour.   She was quite leisurely, to say the least.   The menu is pretty extensive, with everything from breakfast to burgers to pizza. Most items were between $10-$15.  I ordered the Blanco pizza, and it was fine, if a little bland. The crust was good, though. Not too crisp, not too doughy.   The patio area looked really nice, and I wish we'd gone out there, but I completely forgot about it until it was time to leave.   I'd probably try it again when I can sit and enjoy myself, but if you're in a hurry, I'd suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place in Southern Highlands area. This has become more of my local bar but it's a great spot to have a drink or get a bite to eat for anyone in the area.  Industrial decor which I like, very clean.  The food has been good each and every time we eat here,  lots of TV's to watch games, it can get busy but mostly you can find a comfortable spot to stay awhile!"}
{"text":"I joined a group of friend here and I ordered the Happy Hour specials the Cheeseburger Sliders (Which came with fries) and the Chili Cheese fries as well as a Sierra Nevada beer.  All of which were very good, I will look forward to returning and ordering different items in the future."}
{"text":"First time at this location.   It was very busy for a Tuesday evening but I have to say the service was fast, food was great and the bread pudding is excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing salads. Great service--the management team actively roamed to ensure all was well. Breakfast is served 24/7. We are here for the weekend only but plan at least one more meal here!"}
{"text":"Paige is currently our food and beverage server, she is the friggin bomb, not to mention cute as hell! This was mine and hubbies first time here and it is a happening place! Food is excellent, hubby had beef tips and I had the grilled fish tacos, they are amazing! The atmosphere is upbeat and the music played is a great classic rock. We are trying to get more friends to come out now as we speak! The vibe is great here and the people look really happy and are having a good time! You gotta check this place out, this is our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Skip it. We tried it for brunch after we hit costco due to the \"best brunch\" banner out front. The $20 mimosa champagne is the bottom of the barrel as is the OJ it is served with. my food wasn't very good (French toast) and my husbands croque was fair. Try another place."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic late dinner and libations last night at Distill. (We found this place here on Yelp.)  I was concerned at first after identifying their sister property was Remedys (at which I did not have a favorable first experience). Our server, Reya (?), was pleasant and friendly. We ordered some fantastic Moscow Mules and two plates of food, ahi poke and ahi tacos. The chef brought them out and was also very friendly.  *My only suggestions are that there was no toilet paper in the ladies room which is a problem and MAYBE turn the music, although great, down a tiny bit for conversation.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I,ve gotta start off by saying this is the best bar is the Northwest. Every bartender takes care of their customers. Im a regular graveyard gambler but come onto other shifts occasionally. I can honestly say every bartender knows my name, and makes me feel like a king everytime I come into their bar. Ive gotta give my shout outs to mike mikey thersea and nicole. They make the bar experience out of this world. Sense im a regular and care about my neighbor bar I have to mention the some of servers such as my favorite Natalie who goes out of her way to see how im doing everytime i see her. The only cook I know and met was charles, i dont know who know cooks the food but its all very good! This is my first yelp review and its from the Heart. I love this bar and everyone who runs it from the top down. That includes you Dean. My only concern is I never see Jimmy around any more and he was a great bartender. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Your favorite ultimate x graveyard player ;)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar by far. I Just wanted to announce that Jay on graveyard kept my drinks full and me occupied as i gambled and happy as i ran the juke box for hours. I know most the staff but i met a new chef on graveyard who had to think on his feet when i asked him to make me the most bomb food he could, off the menu sense ive had everything on the menu before. Chris! made me a bacon wrapped chicken breast with sides that were absolutely to die for and as an avid gambler completely appreciated. Way to go new kid! You killed it. I love everyone at distill keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"We live near here and needed a decent meal on a Saturday night. Place was busy but not crazy. Staff was friendly. Better yet, the food was delicious. My husband got fish and chips and loved it (I tried it to and agreed). I got the beef tenderloin and it was fabulous. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Wanted to check it out. Saturday night about 7. Bar was full. But as usual most people were eating or on the phone. Not playing machines. Wish bartender would ask them to move to one of the many open tables. We sat ourselves and Jennet was very quick to bring menus and get our drink orders. The food was awesome service not so much."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I come to Vegas I come here. Chill vibes and the people are all very nice and friendly. If he's working ask to sit in Mykee's section. He provides amazing service and is always friendly regardless of how busy it is."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out the new place... Guess we'll have to try it a different time. Unfortunately no one answered the door last night after ringing the bell a couple times (it was after 12) and hearing people laughing inside. Looked nice from the outside tho."}
{"text":"I was in the area working yesterday and my customer recommend Distill to me. I came over for lunch sat at the bar I was first greeted by Patrick. I was told about happy hour specials us a few minutes of light conversation it had that everyone is special feel. I ordered the black & Blue burger with sweet potato fries.  While I waiting for my meal I was able to watch nascar qualifying at Martinsville, VA. Burger was good, fries were nice and crisp. I would stop by and eat here whether I working in the area or not."}
{"text":"This place was only ordinary. My burger was over cooked and dry. I wanted juicy. Server was great. Disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"Came to grab a drink with friends, drinks were great and surprisingly cheap! My cousin asked if she could use her South Point employee discount, the waitress said they don't do that anymore.... But she introduced us to the Indicard. If you're apart of the food or hospitality industry you can get the app. You get happy hour food and drinks ALL DAY with the indicard. Def gonna be the go to spot."}
{"text":"I agree add more gaming machines, this place is to busy for that bar."}
{"text":"Great, laid back spot. The wings were awesome ! Excellent service, what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"We ordered burgers to go and they were excellent! So we were super excited to go back and try out the full experience. Sadly, it was pretty awful. We sat in the bar and our bartender gave the worst customer service. As an example, he introduced himself to me and shook my hand and did not acknowledge my husband. The only time he even said anything to him was after after I ordered my drink. He tried soliciting for their rewards card and also only spoke to me. When he took our food order, only me. On top of it, he was the slowest bartender I've ever seen. Took forever to get our drinks and it wasn't busy. He poured the draft beer with no head and just the let the keg run and run until it came off.   For the food, we ordered chicken chipotle nachos. The chicken was so bad we both spit it out. It tasted really old. We didn't even eat it and asked for our check. Bartender said nothing.   The music could also be a little more upbeat. It's a bar. I didn't go there for a nap.   So disappointed after such great food the first time. Really wanted to like this place!!!"}
{"text":"The food we had was pretty good, chicken street tacos and chicken quesadilla, and the drinks were reasonably priced. The music was a mix of classic rock and current country, which we liked. Atmosphere is really nice and we are hoping this will be our new hang out come football season. Excited they are in the neighborhood.  The parking lot is a bit small, and the place can be hard to find or seem out of place just sitting off by itself."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is creative and comforting.   I love their Pretzel Crusted Chicken Sandwich.  They also have a 6 pack of sliders for $16.95. You get to pick 3 different kinds. Everything I've eaten here has been equally delicious.   The staff is always friendly. Indoor and outdoor seating for 21+ only seals the deal."}
{"text":"Walked in on a busy Friday night and  was able to find two seats and ordered from the bar.. great service   Also got fantastic service at our seats from our server Tammy. She was very friendly and attentive throughout our visit...  Great first experience of Distill !!! We will be back!   Thank you Tammy!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, my friends and I shared the mashed potato bites which were fantastic, myself and another friend had pizza and my other friend got the seared ahi salad. We all enjoyed the food. But I ordered a well vodka tonic and it tasted like straight tonic, I couldn't taste any vodka. Also we had to wait a looooong time for our check and it seemed like we were being ignored for a while. But all in all it had great food and a great atmosphere, just wish the service was a little better."}
{"text":"This bar is so kooool.  Classyyyy.   Goood food and drinks.  Pool tables also.  Great date nite place.  Lost of couples hanging out and young kool crowd.  Great music too, Pearl Jam etc... . Check it out"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way to BJs when we saw Distill. The outside ambiance was amazing, so cute and lights so cute... Pulled us in.  We decided to try it out. Walked in, no one greeted us so I had to hunt down a server and ask if it was \"seat yourself\" ... It was. After we sat ourself we waited for almost 10 mins before our server showed up with water. We knew what we wanted so we placed our order. The service was slow. The food was sub par. The margarita tasted like straight mix. The water was tap so we had to ask for bottle. Nothing about this place would have us coming back.... We were better off going to BJs where the food and the service are great!!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit and the staff has been very nice and personable. Hubby and I ordered the artichokes (a little too tough), mini tacos (pretty flavorless) and Greek fries (needed some type of sauce to tie in all the ingredients together). So needless to say food is why it's receiving 3 stars. Parking is terrible don't even bother looking for parking upstairs but plenty underground in the garage. Drinks are nice and generous pours. Nice decor and clean bathrooms. HH prices are pretty comparable to other off the strip locations."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Distill and it was exceptional! I was extremely excited for Distill to open especially because I knew it was owned by the same people that own Remedys. The food was so so yummy! I had the gyro and it was so much better than I even imagined. The meat was so tender and the pita was warm and soft! It was really good. We also had the fish and chips, beef tips and country fried chicken sliders! It was all really good. Everyone just kept commenting on how good the food was. We love that there is a separate entrance and section for the restaurant so you can bring your kids. We had Megan as our server and although she was busy she was extremely sweet, attentive and all around a really great server! A couple other ladies also came to our table to help with things and everyone was beyond friendly and attentive!! Definitely will be going again and again!! We really loved it!   So ecstatic to have Distill in our neighborhood! We needed another good place in the area."}
{"text":"I still come here frequently but the food has gone downhill since the beginning. The sliders were so overcooked, well done, and just a step above high school cafeteria food. The bacon was hard and too well done. I hate overdone bacon. No wonder my friend offered me one! LOL. Even the deep fried mashed potato bites which I love were not as tasty as I remembered them. The potatoes weren't mashed and there were potato cubes inside. The seasoning was off too. On another prior visit, the tacos were just mediocre. What happened to the food? I guess I'll just stick to drinks here. Service is still attentive or decent."}
{"text":"Distill is a warm and inviting place. Its located close to BJ's in Summerlin, with tons of parking.  They have a large outdoor patio with plenty of seating for you and your friends. Very large location, Irish beers, and easy to read menus!  *  Welcome Experience -  Ordinary - Upon entering the main door I was expecting to find a server or greeter standing there, however there wasn't anyone.  Within a minute or two a lady approached me with a warm smile and told me I could sit wherever I wanted and a server would bring us some menus.  I wish I would of been greeted sooner, but in the end it worked out.    *  Establishment -  Outstanding - The design of the overall business is fantastic. Its clean, open, casual, with great music playing in the back ground. There is a pool table off in the corner, a large bar in the center, and a really awesome Patio area.   *  Service -  Outstanding - Our waitress, and her assistants were awesome! They checked on us routinely, and made sure we had everything that we needed. Wish I remembered the ladies name. I found out that she had worked a double shift and was still cheery and all smiles!   *  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation -  Outstanding - The Food was amazing. You never know how a place is going to be when they first open.  Wish I would of taken some pictures of the food. The Mashed Potatoes Bites were DELICIOUS!! The Appetizers were well proportioned, and the quality was amazing.  Kudos to the kitchen staff on a job well done!,   * Stuff that isn't important but I felt it was worth mentioning.  They have power outlets everywhere! We were there for a business meeting and I was surprised to find power outlets in the main dinning room near a lot of the tables.  Great place to have a casual business meeting.   Looks like they could accommodate large group meetings as well.   The menus were very easy to read, and well put together.   *  What I'll remember - The Moscow Mule Drink! AMAZING. and the food. soo good. I will also remember the reasonable prices.  The quick prompt services.    *  What I can't wait to forget   Nothing! It was all quite amazing. And I am a huge critic. This place rocks, way better than some chain restaurant.  They have nice views, and would be a great place to go on a date, or to have beers, lunch, and dinner with your friends.   Suggestions:  - I would suggest they take dinner reservations during prime dinner hours"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff and the Best calamari ever! I'm not from around here but I'll be coming back here when ever I stay at South Point."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and a late bite. I would recommend to leave the dining area open later than midnight in case people need some quiet time"}
{"text":"Stopped by with my girlfriend just before happy hour ended. Took a few minutes to find a table with chairs. By the time the waitress came it was just after happy hour, we asked if they would still honor hh prices she said she'd check.  during that time we moved tables to a better spot, unfortunately meant a new waitress who was quite rude and actually rolled her eyes at me when placing my food order of the sliders that where shameful but I was hungry so I just ate them, all two of them!! The patties where the size of a a half dollar and not good. Woulda been better to have a 7/11 hotdog!! Before the food was served the GM came over to say and tell us that he'd comp our drinks, I thought that was nice. The bartenders made good drinks and our original waitress Paige was a doll, even checked on us after we moved out of her station. Paige was much sweeter and more accommodating than the waitress who looked and acted like she walked outta 8 mile to go to work. We will be back for a second chance. It's close convenient and the atmosphere is bomb!!"}
{"text":"It's a perfect little three-star restaurant and pub the food is good not overpriced place is comfortable and clean the staff are polite and courteous and friendly the chef is pretty good the food is better than OK I would recommend this restaurant for the price the food is very good."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the bar staff is standoffish. My bf and I have been here a couple of times and it's always the same."}
{"text":"Great venue to have some apps and drinks in a low key/chill setting. We ordered the calamari and mashed potato bites, both very yummy. The Irish mule I ordered was just ok. There was a large group of young and loud (obnoxious is more the word) guys and girls who were overly intoxicated sitting at the bar behind us and were so over the top we left after the following series of events. My boyfriend had gone to the bathroom and I was approached by one of the guys from this group not once but 3 times creepily trying to talk to me about hooking up with him. When my bf got back to the table the guy hit my head with his arm (not sure intentional or not) but when he was asked to be mindful of his surroundings the creepy guy almost started a fight with us. I've been here many times before and never had a problem and food and drinks always hit the spot. My only request is that your staff be more aware of the customers and how intoxicated they get, as well as if they are in a smaller area where they are encroaching on other guests seating area to be mindful and maybe move them to a space that fits them. We were sitting by the fireplace and we were there way before this other group came in.  Just realized this is for southern highlands location when it was meant for summerlin. I do apologize but it won't let me delete."}
{"text":"Dan (GM) is the coolest guy... He keeps all the staff and customers smiling and happy. He really knows service standards and you can tell he genuinely loves his job. Everyone here is happy and having a good time and that's what I like about this place! Good energy!"}
{"text":"Ordered at least 5 things off the menu, about half were edible, the other half, well lets just say its the first time in 4 years my girlfriend had to vomit after eating such nasty food, and no she was not over exaggerating I too came close to vomiting, over priced and awful, the place has a great look to it, inside and out, id give it 4 or 5 stars on just the look alone, but loud staff not working playing pool behind us disturbing the dinner, awful food and about 4 different waiters? Not to mention the last desperate act of the ( spend money get points for free food ) program at the end of the meal, all in all, i wont be back here until some other owner buys it and makes it something else worthy of the ambience and decor."}
{"text":"I have been here MANY times over the past several weeks. This is absolutely my group of friends new hang out. The food is great, the drinks are great, and the service is great. Whenever service is lacking, they ALWAYS make up for it and correct it.   It's never too crowded but always a fun group of people. The patio at night is the best."}
{"text":"Not recommended. Walked in at 3pm on Sunday. It was seat yourself. Sat with one other at 4 person table. No service or even being acknowledged for over 15mins despite trying to flag waitress. Horrible service and we walked out after 20min! Better other choices with the same area to go to. Don't waist time or money at this mismanaged location!"}
{"text":"Bad service.  Honestly, I hate being lied to and I was blatantly lied to.  I paid a bunch of money to play tracks at the bar and have a good time with my friends. Guess it wasn't good enough for the bar tenders because they turned off my music.  When I asked the bartender what happened he lied and said that there's a girl that walks around the bar with a 3000 track list and she skips songs as she wishes.  I told him I should at least get my money back because I put $10 in to the machine.  His response was that he would tell her my issue next time he saw her.  After expressing concern... My playlist magically came back on.  This guy clearly thinks I'm an idiot and I don't appreciate it.  Overall, we have just been treated like pee ons.  Not cool bro. Not cool."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the customer service was superb. The quality of food was very well done. I was impressed with Jeff general manager who came out to greet us and make sure that everything was good.  The theme is that of country Western but the environment is very warm and friendly. Lots of TVs so you can watch a live game while you enjoy a meal with your family."}
{"text":"Nice locals spot for those who live on the south side of town. The bar is isolated by itself and it always seems like there are alot of people parked here every time I've been. The food is decent, the bear is clean, the staff is friendly and it is a cozy area to watch sports to to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Great place for Thursday night football, with good happy hour specials. Never disappointments with the food and has good beers on tap."}
{"text":"Corine was our bartender and she was so sweet and nice. It was our first time stopping in and had a wonderful lunch and good company.  We will be back another time for drinks.  Wanting to stop by to see another bartender, Nicole, who invited us out but she wasn't here today. Hope to see you next time!  Thanks."}
{"text":"It is so nice to finally have an amazing bar in the northwest area! The bartenders are extremely attractive and the food is outstanding. They will even make you a spicy margarita it is not on the menu... Which is out of this world! :-) My new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Big t.v.'s good for football. Service is hit or miss. There's a server that we had who would take forever to check on us and would randomly check on others as well. She would go to the back on be gone for a while. But we've also had good servers that are on point. You just never know which one you're gonna get. Chicken fingers are good, chips and salsa, seared ahi tuna salad is good, their queso dip sucks though! It's got a silicone like consistency ... But we just don't order it. After all, it's just bar food!"}
{"text":"Much needed new place for nightlife in NW.  They have a slightly elevated menu than your typical pub food which I look forward to exploring.    This visit I tried the Jalapeño Popper Burger. Sounded amazing however when it came out I was slightly disappointed.  First I ordered medium slightly pink and it came out more rare in my opinion. Also the burger was missing the bacon.  I was expecting more heat from jalapeño but it was not spicy at all. Overall good attempt on a craft burger however it missed my expectations. Might need to continue to work on BOH training.    I will be back.  4/19/17 had the fried artichoke hearts. Amazing! Have never had artichokes this way and for $4 on HH menu....WOW! Served with a garlic aioli for dippin...yum!  I also had the BBQ Brisket Grilled cheese....another hit. Heart attack waiting to happen after this meal. The Texas toast piled high with thin sliced tender brisket smothered in BBQ sauce was sooo good. This sandwich is messy so wear a bib, ask for extra napkins and elbow's up like a cholo on this one."}
{"text":"So disappointing! First of all having a local bar in summerlin is rare and when I saw that distill was openings up walking distance from my house I was so excited. So when I show up during the week to have dinner it took 20 minutes to get water another 10 mins to get a server to realize we are even there and then another 15 mins to get drink. The food is decent and forget asking for refills because that takes another 10 mins. Plan on going on the weekends? Well I did and it took just as long to get a drink. Our waitress forgot about us and when she finally realized we ordered drinks she made another waitress serve us. So sad that a cool urban bar is just another waste of space"}
{"text":"Food is good, they have gaming, pool, buck hunter etc. it's a fun place on this side of town."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. The manager (Tony) hooked us up with a reserved table and a great server (May). Drinks, food and service were fantastic. May was super sweet and Tony regularly checked in on us. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Im new to town and decided to try something new for  dinner, and came here when the game started and the food was great! I ordered cracked bread for my appetizer and for my entree i had the most delicious beef tips and mash potatoes!! Oh man pretty freaking amazing!!    But on that note the bartender woman sucked, the gentlemen was very sweet!! One i didn't know i was in Twin Peaks the woman  bartender walked around with her boobs all out and kept saying \"I gotta make my tips somehow\", if that was the case why doesn't she work at a strip club if she's so worried about her tips then her customers.. Im glad the gentlemen bartender was around because without him i would not been able to order a drink..   But i want to thank you for amazing food and amazing bartender, i believe his name was John. Ill make sure to come back in when he works!!   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite bar hands down. The food is amazing but what makes it the best is Chanel and Billy the bartenders. They make it inviting, friendly, and enjoyable. They always remember you and ALWAYS suggest the best food and remember your drinks and your face! Simply the best. You won't regret coming here. So much fun."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the Distill this evening in Summerlin! Tucked behind BJ's and The Island, I had passed by it before but not anymore :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon to grab a bite. It's kind of in the middle of no where with nothing around it. It's a little dark when you walk in but I like that, I don't like a well lit bar. The atmosphere was very laid back, there's a separate dining area off to the side if you don't feel like inhaling smoke the entire time.   The service was great - our server was very nice and attentive. The food was also pretty good. They have a happy hour menu with small bites and beer for good prices. We tried the chili cheese fries and we added a fried egg on top, delicious! We had the chicken dinner and a burger... The chicken dinner was a chicken breast with a creamy sauce on top with a side of potatoes and veggies. The burger wasn't cooked how I liked it (the other person likes it medium instead of medium rare) but it was good, came with fries too.   Would definitely come back for more beers and good food. Great place!"}
{"text":"Thursday night, and we decided to try Distill for the first time. We came during happy hour but ordered regular menu items. The food on the happy hour menu looked good and we will be back to try it...short rib tacos and filet sliders.      The atmosphere is contemporary and there is a restaurant section away from the bar and smoke. We ate in the bar area and there wasn't really any smoke. I was skeptical looking at the menu, but I watched food leaving the kitchen and it looked good. I ordered the Ahi Salad and it was very good. I would get it again. The greens were fresh, cucumber strips, tomatoes, roasted peppers and won ton strips. The fish looked and tasted very good. The wasabi dressing was light, and did not overpower. My husband had the short ribs and fried mash potatoes, wow it was good! His came with a salad. The food tasted homemade and not from processed ingredients.       Our service was great too. She said in training they tried all the menu items. She was helpful with suggestions. She was attentive but not annoying. They have other people bring out the food. I really like this, because we don't have to wait if the server gets tied up.      We will be back. Everything was good quality. I am pickier than most."}
{"text":"Distill is the best neighborhood bar in the area. It's a great place to watch a game. They have tv's throughout the bar so every seat is a good one.   The menu is really diverse so everyone can find something super tasty to fit their dietary needs. They have great burgers, tacos , ahi, vegan items and breakfast. Try the patty melt, you won't be sorry.   The best thing about this establishment is the amazing staff. Everyone is really friendly and they make sure you have everything you need.   It's great to have a place to go in Las Vegas that feels like a small hometown bar."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my first trip to Distilled was a bit of a let down. I live 3 miles from this location and was hoping to find another go-to lunch spot I could be a regular at. I forgot my ID so I sat in the restaurant. No biggie, I prefer to eat smoke free. The only problem was that it took a bit for anyone to realize I was there. Again, no biggie at this point so I ordered drinks and all is good.  For an appetizers I tried an order of  pretzel bites which look amazing from the start but were a quick let down. The mustard was alright but the cheese is the same stuff you would get at the gas station and it was cold by the time it was served to us.  I ordered a side salad that came with the wrong dressing. I ordered Blue Cheese but got Caesar. It looked beautiful but It took the waitress so long to return to our table I never got the right dressing and ended up asking them to take it off our bill. Sadly I had nothing to review there .  I also ordered a half order of Biskets and Garvey and the Jalapeno Popper Burger. The B&G were a 2/5 stars. The garvey seemed like it was from a jar with some cut up sausage added to make it seem made from scratch. And last the burger was raw in the middle.   I'm leaving two stars because all of the food looks amazing even the we had so many issues & Management was very helpful after the raw meat situation. I'll try again next month in hopes that I can leave a much better review!"}
{"text":"Jay is a dope bar tender. Came in after work&Asked him to surprise me; pick my food and drink. He did an amazing job! I'll be back"}
{"text":"I live walking distance from Distill. I was excited when they opened promising to be a hip local bar and gambling spot. When I lived in Henderson I used to frequent a similar spot that the same people also own named \"Remedies\" and always had an amazing time, amazing Food, Service, Etc. I was immediately put off when after several, and I mean close to 10 visits, to this establishment I found the gaming to pay out far less than many other spots nearby such as Timbers and copper keg. Subsequently I was able to justify my visits here based on the quality and complexity of the menu. That along with the great customer service that I received from George, a barback here, has kept me returning though I'm starting to question if I will continue to come. They have a late night bartender, a larger middle-aged Caucasian fellow with a goatee, that seems to take the fun out of every visit. His demeanor is smug, dismissive, and condescending at best. It literally takes this guy 10 minutes to bring me a drink every time I visit and he acts like it is as laborious as digging holes in the hot sun to do so. I had incredibly high hopes for this establishment prior to and upon its opening, if only based on my proximity, but I feel like this one individual has nearly single-handedly taken that wind out of my sails. I hope this \"could be great\" establishment chooses to staff better in the future and perhaps finds it necessary to promote people like George from barback to bartender and demote people like this guy out into the parking lot. Unless of course you're his friend at which point you will be greeted in a spectacular fashion, prior to my being acknowledged of course, and treated very well, to the point that this guy seems like he only kisses certain people's asses, me obviously not being one of them or I wouldn't be writing this I guess."}
{"text":"Distill? More like Dis still the best bar in Vegas!  Food here is amazing especially the wings. I have an odd obsession with their french fries as well. Did someone say YUM?!  The drink deals here are great as well, and the service is even better. All of the employees are friendly and attentive, especially the wait staff. My server Rachel was probably the best waitress I've ever had, she deserves a raise. The extra side of ranch she brought really made my sandwich (as well as my day) a spectacular one. Thanks Rachel. 10 points for Gryffindor.   If you've never been to Distill before definitely give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. Between great food, great entertainment, and even better service there's no other bar I'd rather spend my money at. Seriously all I can say about this place is...WOW!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before, and have had some pretty good experiences there.  However today April 8th 2018.  I took an our of state friend and his family out with my family.  We got there at roughly 9:30A, and everything was a bit ... off..  My kids ordered orange juice, and they all complained about their orange juice tasted like water...  When we brought it up to the waiter, she said something like, \"Well sometimes when kids order orange juice the bar adds water\".  Who in the hell has ever heard of this?  Waiter replaced the orange juice with real orange juice and the kids were happy.    At about 10:45 we finally got our food,  So 1:15 minutes of waiting.  I ordered chicken fried steak, my chicken fried steak was incredibly hard, the english muffin wasted like fish, the hash browns didn't taste good,  but the over medium eggs were the star of the show...  I left a bunch of food on my plate, and the waiter didn't ask what was going on or anything.  The french toast seemed to be pretty good, and the biscuits and grave suffered the same fate.  Biscuits were hard, and the gravy was nothing to write home about,  the pancakes around the table had the same problem..  People complained they were very chewy.    I had a rewards card with Distill,  and when I put it on the table, the lady asked if I wanted to add points to my card,  I simply replied, \"No\".  When she asked why not, I told her that we were not going to need it moving forward.  She responded back with \"Well you get points if you use it\".  I simply apologized, and told her that we would not be returning.  I was done....  Hopefully they take these reviews seriously, as I think they have great potential...  But this 1 service basically made it so I do not want to come back ever."}
{"text":"This used to be a Carmines gaming bar which was closed down for ages. Distill is a much welcome addition to the neighborhood. It does get very busy, but it is a nice place to relax and have a beer. Can get a little smoky at times. The food is typical bar food, good enough and the staff have always been friendly whenever I've been here."}
{"text":"Bartenders are not attentive unless a customer(not me) hits a royal. Three work a shift and cannot handle less than 25 customers.  Also cannot deal with players cards.  Took over 30 mins to get one.. Then  misplaced the next time we go in and we have to get another one. Not organized."}
{"text":"Great bartenders and great food! They have a great moscato that is almost too good! I wish we lived closer, I would be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Really good Brisket dinner. The meat had great flavor and it was priced right. We sat in the bar and they did a good job making sure it not not smell like smoke. They used to have a weekly poker game here but I guess it stopped. That to bad. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I love this place for multiple reasons. The food was good, the drinks were good, and the place was a cool chill spot. Open late with gaming too!"}
{"text":"Great staff, casual atmosphere,  and good drinks. Chanel makes a mean Don Julio Margarita! Great patio/outdoor space. I've been several times now. Fun place."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour. Food is not amazing, but still good bar food. Drinks are great! Their mule is taaaaay-steeee, (super yum), and on the happy hour menu as well. Decor is cute, service is on par, and place is clean! Would definitely come back for happy hour here!"}
{"text":"Took 5 minutes to be acknowledged and get a drink. I was polite and not demanding yet the two female bartenders  didn't want anything to do with me. I was FINALLY able to order and even through my meal (empty beer) and even after my meal (sat for another 10 minutes). No service. The couple next to me were taken care, actually the couples on both sides of me. The bartender even removed my EMPTY bar glasses AND plates without speaking a word to me or asking if I wanted another drink or anything for that matter. Worst of all I watched all the staff (that just clocked out for the night) get served multiple times before I was even acknowledged. There was a bar back ( I think that's what he was). He waited on multiple people but wouldn't me until I finally asked him. Yes, I was a female, by myself, but damn.   To add insult to injury, I gambled and was charged for everything. By the way, I'm in the service industry and you all treated me like s***. I won't be back. I will make sure i never send anyone here. Worst experience.  Distill in Summerlin will always get my business, especially from now on."}
{"text":"Everything that I have ordered from Distill has been mediocre. I've been maybe 5 times now and am not entirely impressed. Cranberry vodka-tasted watered down Hamburger-undercooked and alright Chips & salsa- overly salty chips and salsa was entirely liquid and not very flavorful  Brownie- dry spongey brownie that was only okay tasting because of chocolate syrup, whipped cream and ice cream chicken sliders- as an appetizer this was alright but not tasty The Moscow mule is the only thing I have ordered and really enjoyed. The main thing that has me coming back is the atmosphere. Nice lighting and woodwork, flat screen tvs, couches, tables and an overall nice environment and crowd."}
{"text":"I go to Distill once or twice as week as a lunch option since I work really close to it. Jessica, our usual server, is always super friendly and remembers our drink orders. She knows everything about the menu and suggests trying out new things. You can tell she's passionate about keeping the customers happy, and it shows in her work ethic.   The food is always great, and the people who work there are always quick with a \"hi.\" Love going to Distill for lunch/happy hour/dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Kristina (with a K) great atmosphere, great food...this is our new hangout"}
{"text":"Close to home. Descent meal. Feel sorry for the waitresses they menus are heavy and their plates and glasses are heavy. Gotta have muscles to work here. Today ordered a chicken Caesar wrap and had no idea it would come grilled. Who grills a Caesar salad? Waitress was nice enough to have it remade cold. Ate half and discovered it didn't even have any chicken in it second time around. Total bill was $37.00+ for a chicken sandwich and a non chicken Caesar salad wrap and two ice teas. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time I came here was at the Yelp event that I purely enjoyed. Came here last night to see how it's like on a regular night. The vibe is very relaxed. The bar seemed pretty packed. But, You are able to sit yourself in the dining area. Someone automatically brings you a menu & lets us know our server will be with us.  Erin was our server for the night. We automatically checked into Yelp & redeemed our free whiskey shots. We also ordered Mad Mule $10 (which was served at the Yelp event) & a Cinnamon Apple Sour $7. Apple sour was on the sour side & extremely strong. The whiskey shots came in coffee & cinnamon flavored. Yuck! Those drinks did the job done alright!  For food: Shrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip $9.99 -- it was very very very very bland. It didn't have enough cheesiness. The shrimp didn't blend in well with the other ingredients. A lot of chips, not enough dip.  Street tacos $7.99 -- shredded chicken with usual contents that comes with a taco. It had a chipotle dressing on top. These were pretty good. Still, nothing that made me want to order it again.   New York Steak & Eggs $11.99 -- beau said it was good cooked perfect. It came with hash browns. & you can choose between English muffin or toast. I tasted it, tasted like regular steak ¯\_(?)_/¯   French toast $7.99 -- beau also got French Toast (guess he was hungry). These were excellent. Probably best thing we ate last night. It was light and fluffy.   Erin, our server, was very attentive. She came and checked on us every so often. She was nice & had lots of personality. When asked if we can change the channel of the TV next to us she said she would but she never did, but we didn't make a big deal out of it. Other bummer, she charged us for our free \"yelp check in\" shots. Of course I told the beau to look at the itemized billing like I ALWAYS do & of course he said he did but really didn't (men!) and just signed his life away. Later I looked at the bill & we were charged for them *insert angry face*"}
{"text":"Love this place especially Mike naugle he is the best!!! The food is awesome. Always have a great time."}
{"text":"THE CHICKEN FRIED STEAK IS KILLER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Service was great, by a Kauai local, pleased and on point. The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a metrosexual location like Las Vegas. Again the food is absolutely amazing! I will definitely come back and certainly recommend this place to anyone that wants good food and good service"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday for a beer and it took 20 minutes to get a drink.  Had to go to the bar to find the waitress.   Then couldn't even get the bill.  The manager said he would just take care of it.  Very disorganized.   Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Service here is great! Every time I've been here I've gotten better service than any other bar type place here in vegas. Great hangout spot for locals to meet your friends and co workers for a drink !"}
{"text":"Very good menu and food!  Wonderful Chef!  My son Always asks me to bring him here to eat.  We have yet to be dissatisfied as it is usually to dine in when we do stop by!"}
{"text":"Distill is a local bar located very close to my workplace. I've been in the area long enough to know that the building they occupy is where restaurant and bars go to die. I thought I'd give this place a few tries before reviewing since I've seen the building change hands from one establishment to another and wanted to give them an extra fair shake.   My first experience didn't leave a very good impression since my coworker and I walked into an almost empty building at lunch time and the wait staff was visibly hanging out while preparing place settings in one of the booths and one of the guys appeared like he was taking a nap. Distill has a decent-sized menu so I asked our server what she would recommend and she claimed everything was good. I ordered their street tacos and the chicken, unfortunately, had the taste and dryness of sawdust. My coworker seemed to enjoy his sliders so I thought that would be the play for my next visit.   I came back with a small group to celebrate with a coworker who was leaving the company. All the staff seemed awake -- big plus. This time, I ordered a variety of sliders. The philly slider was OK but not worth the calories. The western BBQ slider was like a dry hockey puck. The tiny country fried chicken slider which consisted of 40% bread, 30% mashed potatoes(inside the sandwich), 20% breading and 10% chicken was just inedible. It's probably just my luck that I ordered all the wrong food items. So much for the \"everything was good\" claim the initial server made.   On a positive note, when I returned to celebrate another coworker who was leaving (a recent trend), I realized this place seems like a nice place to just hang out for a few drinks and watch sports on their large TV screens. Sans food."}
{"text":"Typical smokey dive bar with an updated facade. Food was decent but if you sit at the bar you will leave smelling like an ash tray. You can tell there are a lot of regulars who just like to drink beer, gamble, and smoke their cigarettes.  Want to avoid the smoke? Sit in their non smoking area!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times,  I've always received good service with a reasonably priced menu,  a nice happy.   The decor is very cool,  everything from the light fixtures to the restroom doors, the leather chairs,  the beautiful patio.  The manager Jeffery has stopped by to see how we're doing every visit. I highly recommend Distill for relaxing and enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Two things you need to know off the bat.  First, 21 and above only; no problem.  Second, SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE everywhere; gross.  Went to the opening last night, and it was packed and loud, but a good vibe and crowd.  There was a band playing, but after talking with one of the owners that won't be an \"everyday\" thing, at least not for now.  Even though it was busy, the servers were quick and prompt and very very friendly and upbeat.  The decor is warmer and more inviting than when this place was Agave, with a lot of lounge chairs and tables replacing the old table booths.  The patio is still there and will be a welcome place to hangout in the warmer weather.  There is also a game room area, with video bowling, golfing, pool table, etc.  And, the \"jukebox\" is pretty cool, with the ability to sync to your iPhone and music playlists.  And of course plenty of  TVs throughout to catch your fave sporting event.  This morning we decided to try out breakfast, since we were running errands in the area.  We sat in the main bar area, and my first impression was \"I don't want to eat in a place that all I can smell is cigarette smoke.\"  It's just not appealing.  It didn't seem so smokey the night before, but this morning was a different story.  The menu looks good, and they serve breakfast 24/7.  My husband had the build your own breakfast burrito (sausage, spinach, tomato and cheese), and they forgot the sausage.  I had the patty melt and it was \"meh\".  Not great.  Not horrible.  I ordered a bloody mary...let's just say it needs work.  Like, a lot of work.  I don't know what I had, but it was no where close to a bloody mary, lacking in taste and \"zip.\"  Our waitress seemed nervous, and I'll chalk it up to the place only being open for 2 days.  But first impression, she had the personality of a log.  On a side note, the manager came over and introduced herself and was very welcoming, perky and nice.  Like I said, I'll chalk it up to nerves and the newness of it all.  This place has the potential to be a great locals hangout, and the owners are experienced restauranteurs/tavern/grill operators.  We'll give it a month to work out the kinks and go back and give it another go.  However, it'll have to be on the patio to avoid as much smoke as possible (if I want smoke with my food and drink, I'll go the casino across the street, or to the Irish bar at Boca Park; point is, Summerlin doesn't need another smokey bar/grill).  And, maybe I'll hand the bartender a good bloody mary recipe while I'm at it.  I do hope this place does well either way."}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner i think is Tony. I loved how he goes to tables and checks in on us, the food is pretty decent. I only ate their breakfast. Their drinks are really good. I would get the typsy palmer. It hits really well. The pancakes are the best. Fluffy n big. Our waitress was amazing. We sat down and like 5 sec latwr she arrived tocheck in on us.  I also love how theirs a seat where you want theme. They have pool tables. And comfortable seating if you just wanna get the beer and watch all the games at once. Good place give it a try. Oh and they do themes like right now its for holloween."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local bar!  The employees treat you like family and they are great conversationalists and jokers.  Marissa is an awesome GM and Corinne is a great Asst. GM.  They are also great bartenders too and work very hard and efficiently.  Other great bartenders are Aliecia and Mike.  Awesome servers are Natalie and Kristina.  Love this bar!"}
{"text":"The best place to go after your shift if your industry and if you're not and just want a snack and a drink. The staff is engaging and they get it. The second time I went back the bartender Rod remembered my name. He knew us and that's what makes you want to come back. All of the staff I see when I come there are \"our people\" now. Distill is where we go after work"}
{"text":"Nice place food is great especially the cure burger but wish happy hour could be longer hard to make it before 6. It would be awesome if they made it a little long."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened a couple months ago.  It used to be a Carmine's.  The wraps are great!"}
{"text":"This is my all time place to be ..  everyone that works there is amazing.. Theresa , Mike, Erin, Dean , Tammy , Natalie the list goes on !! Now the food ... not your everyday bar menu..  you have to try the ahi poke stack & the Buffalo cauliflower... best part I can either sit on the bar side or the non smoking dining side ..  check it out ... just what the northwest needed!!!"}
{"text":"First time in here at Distilll! Wanted to watch SNF somewhere and have the sound of the game being played, NO WHERE in SUMMERLIN could we find any place playing the game and having the sound, wondered upon Distill by accident and BOY what a great place. Game playing, check. Sound with the game, Check. Great food, Check. Wonderful bar staff, Phil and Ronnie, Check. Then the GM stopped by introduced himself and advised us of the happenings for this little spot for us Summer-Lin-ers. A little secret that I am so glad to have happpened upon and will be a new fav for our family. Thanks much......"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the restaurant side is FREEZING! Like meat locker cold in one corner. My food was cold within 3 I would honestly think twice before coming back b/c sitting here has been that miserable"}
{"text":"An awesome local bar full of likeminded people. They have a great happy hour and the wings are incredible.   Service is prompt and the bartenders totally rock.   This is the spot to hang out and catch a game or come and relax after a hard days work.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We had 3 generations with us and everyone had so much fun. The food was great, drinks were great, it was like kicking back at a friends house. Special thanks  to our server Mykee, he was so on top of it and just a really great person. Will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"JON the bartender IS THE MAN I appreciate you and the phenomenal service from everyone here from start to finish was first class i love you guys"}
{"text":"After starting an episode of Pretty Little Liars @ 5:15 I found out HH ended at 6. So we grabbed our shoes and rush down Blue Diamond to get our HH on!!! We arrived around 5:35ish. It was a Sunday and the same playoff game was on every TV. We walked in and it was really loud, I'm going to assume it's because of the playoff game, because after it was over i could actually hear our waitress and talk to my party without yelling.  We came here as a group for bro beers. We grabbed the big chairs and put them in a circle with two tables in the middle for the apps. We started with chips and salsa and a personal pizza. The chips and salsa were a good choice nothing crazy special but it was perfect thing to keep me from ordering all the other delicious looking items. I was trying to be good. However, i tried the pizza and it was yummy. We order some HH drinks and started the night. I started with a vodka redbull. They have nice heavy glasses. We joked when it was close to 6 that our waitress was avoid us. She came back right at 6 and said she had a large party and she would add another drink for HH. NICE! After everyone showed we just chit chatting and looking around. They had some really funny signs. One of my favorite was the big D that pointed to the bathroom. hehe, I thought it was funny. After a few cranberry vodkas I had to use the bathroom, I walked in and thought I was in a club. The music is super loud in the bathroom. I just couldn't understand when it transformed into a club. After walking out of the club I noticed they have Buck Hunt!!! I am awful at the game but it's super fun. I wish i would have had some cash to play. Distill was a fun adventure that will defiantly be had again."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for the Filet Mignon Sliders during Happy Hour...But disappointed with the results. It's like anticipating for Christmas morning only to wake up to...Columbus Day? I am not a steak connoisseur but if that qualifies as Filet Mignon, next time I'll just have the chicken please...  What was good was the Greek Fries. Just simple greek fries with feta cheese, slices of shawarma meat and tomatoes. This is something I expect from a bar like Distill, nothing extraordinary but everything you can expect when you crave fatty greek fries.  Please don't have items like the Filet Mignon Sliders on the menu only to leave us crestfallen. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth..literally.   Besides mediocre food, I love the outside atmosphere. Real nice if you want to get away from the noisy compounds of the interior, especially during a game night.   What's cool is that they offer a Football Menu during football games whether or not you're there to watch the game. My sorry Chargers aren't worthy to watch this year (last in the division, currently at 0-3) so I wasn't really there to watch football but glad to see an additional menu as an option."}
{"text":"OK, I admit it! Since moving to Las Vegas I have become fully entrenched in this cities obsession with hamburgers! An obsession I welcome with open arms...well maybe open lips is more to the point!  I have heard many a yelper RAVE about the Cure burger here, then saw that it won best burger in LV with a recent poll...So we decided we did not want to miss out! I have been here many times, but never had the Cure Burger.  Away we went, all 3 of us ordered the burger, and we were not disappointed! It was awesome! Big, messy and delicious!   Our server was awesome as well! She was funny, and a bit snarky in the most entertaining way! We loved her!   As I said, I have been before. Never left unhappy. Great from brunch, drinks sitting out on the patio is my favorite!! Summerlin in lucky to have this great place to go!"}
{"text":"Cool hip spot off strip. Strong drinks amazing mini hotdog bites in bean dip. Deslish. Waitresses there are fun and friendly. I had a blast 2 nights there!  Downside was the beer selection. If they had better craft beers it would have been a 5 star"}
{"text":"You'll need a compass and Dora the Explora's map to find this place, but it's worth the trip.   Distill is definitely going for that 30 something crowd with its old school video games and \"loungey\" vibe. This is enhanced with multiple large cozy chairs and soft couches lining one side of the bar. To quote my GF, \"it didn't feel like a sleazy Vegas bar\". This is true, the sleaze factor in here is low, but so is the excitement level...which isn't a bad thing. Sometimes you just wanna sit in a dimly lit location, drink a few craft cocktails, and just chill with friends.   The decor is modern influenced with giant letters, canvas \"paintings\" and random light bulbs on the walls that you're starting to see everywhere. Distill is also very clean, which sadly can be a troublesome thing to find with most local bars in the Valley. The staff here are super attentive and make sure you've always have something in your hand; my glass was never empty for more than a minute. I was going to give this place a 3 star rating, but the food won me over and welcomed that coveted extra star.   I'm not a big carb lover, but this place got me right in the feels; fried Mashed Potato Bites and Mini Soft Pretzel Bits, yowza! These might have had meth in them cause I just couldn't stop eating; then I found myself getting fired up when finished them. My food anger only subsided when the Seared Mahi and Carne Street Tacos were placed in front me. These were good, but I definitely have had better seared fish and street tacos. Trust me go with the Mashed Potato Bites you won't be disappointed!  If your not hungry try the \"Distiller's Delight\", a very good and refreshing drink for a whiskey based cocktail. It has Bulleit Whiskey, orange bitters, Sprite, and some other tasty items. Very good in my whiskey drinking book. Great especially after a long day in the Vegas heat.   Distill is a great spot for a laid back weekday night cap or for the upcoming football season. They have copious amounts of TVs. Party on dudes!"}
{"text":"Marissa is hands down a great bartender! Always attentive and always seems to be on top of everything all the time. If there were a 10 star option I would give it. Also phenomenal food!!"}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars for atmosphere only.  The service was slow and not great.  The food was sub par at best. I love burgers and these were frozen pre formed patties. It's very hard to get a fresh bar burger around here.  The fries were good and so was the pretzel appetizer."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say that I haven't been here since it was Agave.  Came in to watch the hockey game with some friends.  Our server Jo( beautiful blond hair) was fabulous.  It was super busy yet she was totally on point and always smiling.  Found out she's brand new at this establishment.  Being in the service industry myself, was very nice having such a nice friendly person taking care of us.   Most of the food was very good, except for the sliders which were rather tough. That was the only negative thing but still rate this 5 stars.  Will be here for the next game.!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great beer and great service!!! The food is literally restaurant quality at a bar any hour of the day. Wide selection of beers on draft and bottles. John and Elliot are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a locals place. It seems if your a local and NOT playing, you will receive better service. I was playing with at lease $100 in a machine and after playing down to my last $15 from my initial amount, I was asked for my drink order.....  I then place my food order. Much faster! The kitchen staff seems more attentive, I imagine they want to make sure the food deliver is HOT for the player....errrr....I mean person ordering food."}
{"text":"Come here all the time, but had a experience I have never had, their pot roast which is special for Thursday's and it was insanely good, it was so moist and delicious hats off to the chef Charles and the bartenders are always always great hats off to Mike Naugle and Marissa they are the best, love this local bar!! Everybody should experience it!!"}
{"text":"Two of us went on a Sunday night just for appetizers and drinks and to check the place out. I was a little worried it would be hard to find because there isn't much in Southern Highlands, but it's well lit. The only suggestion I would have is to put a sign right on Pyle and Decatur so that Pyle is easier to find. The bar was pretty full so we sat at a table. Server arrived right away with menus. The specialty drinks all looked pretty good. As far as cost they were a little more expensive than I expected but not Strip prices by any means. We ordered the Distiller's Delight and the Mad Mule. Both were tasty. We also ordered the mashed potato bites and the crab bites. The crab bites were a little on the pricey side but they were tasty as well. The mashed potato bites were bomb. I could have eaten another order of those if I had been so full. Our server was attentive, refilled our water, asked if we needed anything, so no complaints there. We moved to the bar after we ate as space had opened up. I overheard someone complain about how smoky it was, but I completely disagree. There were maybe three or four people smoking in the whole place. Bartenders were very attentive and checked on us several times. Really the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars are the prices. If you live in the area I would suggest you give it a go! We will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Loaded pints- cool idea. Take your 16 or 25 oz draft and top it with a \"floater\" Bacardi, vodka, liqueur. I had Great White with Marilyn Monroe and hubby Great White with mandarin. Spiced up the beer a bit. Food is - bar. Slightly overpriced. Calamari are equivalent to chicken fingers. Ahi - 2 oz for $12. Pretzel bites were pretzel bites. Pickle straws were mediocre. The bar is smokey and the \"restaurant\" is mini and enclosed in glass. From the bar the restaurant looks like a feeding zoo! Out of the 6 items we ordered (including drinks) they were out of 2. Cool light fixtures. Nice staff. Would return if I was taking someone home from the airport on a late night flight who lived in southern highlands and we needed a bite."}
{"text":"Thank you Evelyn, kaila and rick!! You guys are the best ! Best customer service ever !! Xoxo I'm gonna come back just because of them!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner Saturday night. There was only one waitress for the whole dining room, but she was quick. The menu is great, and the prices good. We ordered everything at once: appetizer, main course and salad, a burger too. The salad arrived, then the appetizer right after, and not two minutes later, the entree and burger, which was pretty much everything all at once. We had to ask the guy who brought them out to take them back until we could start the appetizer. My salmon was great, but the burger was almost raw.  We like the location and everything is new and clean. We will come back, but make sure to just order one thing at a time."}
{"text":"Seriously. You gamble and dont get free drinks?  Max bet the entire time nonstop and win and you pay?  Hell no. Never again. Dude bartender was a jerk. Chick was cool but still wtf kinda bar has that policy?  Ive lived here my entire life and have never heard that. Never. Again."}
{"text":"Soooo...... I live caddy corner this beautiful bar. Wait for it!!!!! This place SUCKS.  Beautiful bar, ok atmosphere....Sunday swing bartenders"}
{"text":"I'm in here quite often and I must say, I never get better service than with Brittany. She knows the menu and accommodates all my special request. She's very personable and attentive. Great local bar!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great comps. Lots of tvs and food is not your normal bar food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting.  My husband and I went for happy hour on a Sunday.  We each had a salad (which were yummy) and the ahi poke stack which was awesome! Our server Tammy was great, she chatted with us for a while, had great recommendations for us and was very personable.  Domestic beers are $3/pint for happy hour which was good as well.  I Wish it would have windows in the bar area, but as with most restaurants with gaming it did not.  Otherwise a great place!"}
{"text":"A good place to hang if you are staying local in Summerlin. Veggie burger is always great. Atmosphere is ok. Sometimes it smells funny like they are cleaning the place with a mildewed mop. The place needs a deep cleaning and it is kinda dark. Food is good but not great. Staff is always pretty good. If it was cleaner I would give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Another visit another great night. Food is delicious and so reasonably priced. This place should be tried if you haven't been here before. A real gem. Come try it!"}
{"text":"This place is the nicest looking dump I've been to in forever. We ordered a large pizza that took close to an hour to get to us. This might have been tolerable if the pizza hadn't been cooked on what seemed to be a rehydrated piece of hard tack. It was almost like they took a generic digiorno pizza crust, put some stuff on and microwaved it for way too long. I know, it might not have been there signature dish and all, but why have it on the menu if it's some half assed supreme boboli faux pizza bs? If that is how they treat something as simple of a staple as a pizza, I can't imagine what they do to the other items on their menu.  On top of that, our servers kept rotating so it was hard to keep track of who to ask for what. Most of them were fine but the last guy (dark spikey haired bar tender guy) was a complete jerk. Totally inconsiderate, ill tempered, abrasive, rude and disrespectful. He made me and my girlfriend very uncomfortable to say the least. Like he was trying to ruin our night but I'm glad I could keep my cool. So if you're ever looking for a place with jerk bartenders that unjustly belittled their customers, distill - a local bar - douchebag central -might be just the place you've been looking for. But seriously, do yourself a favor and please, just go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Omg this place was amazing. Best food I've ever had. No joke. Super delicious. The blue cheese dressing was amazing. The fish and chips were the best I have ever had. Defiently coming back."}
{"text":"The waitress was so rude.  She could have cared less, one of our orders was forgotten when our food came a guy brought it then showed up with my salad, wrong dressing .  I said I didn't want anything because everyone else was already eating. After the rest of the party was almost done he showed up and literally threw the food in the table!  No one ever checked An awful experience!!!"}
{"text":"I love posting great reviews on local places because customer service is number one and going to a local bar and having great customer service needs to be recognized i must add the food thumbs up being my first time i had an  excellent experience!! thanks to Aleisha my bartender !!! Super friendly and welcoming :-)"}
{"text":"Whatever Distill is doing it works ! This bar is fantastic, Nicole the bartender was amazing the service was awesome! Ive never been to a bar that provided such a great service! Wow ! Stop by for a good time !"}
{"text":"This is the best bar and restaurant in southern highlands and the girls here Chelsi, Haydee and Drea hit a home run with service, I love coming here and seeing friendly faces!"}
{"text":"A great local bar with reasonable prices. Staff is always friendly. Upbeat atmosphere. Food is good. Filet mignon sliders during happy hour are a must. So are the fries."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch ....started off with the avocado eggrolls...YUM!  I had the Mad Mule and my friend had the Devoted Hound to drink....both good...the Mule was the best.  For lunch I had the french dip....awesome...she had a calzone....it was huge...we could have shared it...for dessert we had the banana fritters with some yummy fireball caramel sauce.   The service was good and both the owner and the chef came by to check on us.  There were some other things that got our attention...will be going back to try some of them"}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation for 30+ and was told there is no manager on duty.   They told me I could leave a message and would be called back, but no call back at all.   When I called back to speak to a manager again, they again said there was no manager on duty and that the day crew are the ones who messed it up.   Completely rude on the phone and didn't care for the business at all.   If their customer service is any kind of preview of how their drinks and food are I would run away, and as fast as I could.   I'm from here and I would NEVER come back here, even if my life depended on  it.   Absolutely horrid customer service.   Both people I spoke to were rude and very defensive and blaming each other.  If you are one company you fix whatever is wrong, not blame the \"other shift\".  It's unprofessional and deplorable.   I will take my group somewhere else for our celebration."}
{"text":"Service was bad and food was even worse. Why bother having appetizers when they bring them and you main order out at the same time???   Food was stale and looked like frozen reheated stuff. The best part is That food gave me and my girlfriend food poisoning.... So if u want to clean yourself out and impress your girlfriend by making her run to the bathroom 10 times in one night I highly recommend it...."}
{"text":"It was very hard to choose what to eat because everything on the menu sounded delicious but I ordered the Greek/gyro fries and a drink from the bartender and omg it was delicious and the service was prompt I didn't have to wait too long for either - I had to order more to take home and then the other wait staff came by to check on me and were suggesting other items I should try next and I never had to ask for a refill they had it ready to go - awesome place loved the decor too and that it was not smoky in there . I can't wait to go back with my friends and coworkers to try more of their yummy menu"}
{"text":"Went in with 4 people, and we were the only people sitting in the dining room. 2 of us ordered breakfast and 2 ordered sliders and a French dip. Took almost  an hour to get our food. When we got the food, it was cold... not sure who screwed up but it was annoying and we will not go back."}
{"text":"We eat at Distill at least twice a month and I have tried probably half of the menu.  Everything is either good or really good but you have to try the fried pickles and mashed potato bites!  The staff in the dining room is always super nice and the staff in the bar area is great too.  Awesome place to go and hang with friends or take your family.  They also have a little side room if you have a large group."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang... good food, good atmosphere....and Princess Kate makes a great  bloody Mary. Erin, Crystle and Rhea will help you feel at home. So far all the food I have ordered has been good. Just don't steal the Distill glassware.... Brittney will not be happy."}
{"text":"This bar is great. There aren't many local bars in summerlin and my husband and I wanted to check this place out. Ever since our first visit, we are constant visitors. All the bartenders are nice and personable and pour amazing drinks! The food isn't too shabby either. A lot of their menu items are very good and you can run into some menu items you normally don't see at a local bar. I enjoy their Cajun chicken wrap or the southwestern chicken salad. On their happy hour menu, the filet mignon sliders are great as well.   It does get really busy and crowded on the weekends and if you're not sitting at the bar, sometimes the service lacks which is why I rate this place a 4 instead of 5.  There has been times where we've taken a seat and no one has came by and we would have to get the attention of some of the servers just to get started. My advice, sit at the bar. You'll get great service there regardless when you go."}
{"text":"Been going to this bar sense opening, never will return. Played some gaming, ordered food, got bill charged me for my beers ... asked the Manager why I played $40 plus and all I got was a attitude from him, I paid and left .... this guy has no Manager and customer skills ...... Friday Night 6/2 /2017 ...."}
{"text":"First time here, loved it.  My only complaint is that I came with the family initially and it was unclear that they served families.. So we left at the door, thinking it was 21 or older.   I came back to try on my own and enjoyed thoroughly.  Who knew you could get good fish and chips in Nevada!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much. It's super close to home and way more convenient than driving to the other one near Red Rock. The only reason this place is getting one star is because I have to and I like the decor.  My boyfriend and I arrived at Distill at 11:30 pm. We had to get our own menus after realizing that we had been sitting for nearly 10 minutes without so much as a greeting, despite the fact that the waitress is walking back and forth and actually seeing us. After another 5 minutes,  a large group of guys 5 FEET AWAY from us got up to leave, and the same waitress came and rearranged the seats they were sitting in. Still not greeting us. (Nice.)   Another group of guys came in at that moment and sat down in the exact area she was arranging. She proceeded to greet and flirt with them for another 5 minutes before taking their drink order and offering menus. Once she finishes, she just now saunters up to us and says \"So I see you've got menus, did someone take your drink order?\"   Srsly?   It's now 11:58 and this is the first time anyone has spoken to us. I actually had enough time to sit here and write this review and my existence still wasn't acknowledged until just now.   We've declined to order and probably won't be back until this place either increases their staff (size and quality) or teaches their waitresses how to multi-task and understand that flirting for your tip isn't always going to pan out the way you think it will."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Summerlin, not many people here but a great outdoor seating area that takes you away to another country! The bloody Mary bar/Buffett is awesome on Sunday or Saturday, they give you a platter of veggies etc, then have a full table of spices and sauces to throw in with a choice of tomato or clamato! For ten bucks you get enough vodka for three bloodies... Forget about it."}
{"text":"Sucks to write this review because Distill (other locations) are awesome. But unfortunately my experience was awful here. Sat at the bar without any service for 20 min not exaggerating. Kept wanting to leave but had money in the machine that needed to be cashed out from a ticket...from the bartender :(   As we were leaving she was still trying to figure out how to make a certain shot for other patrons, same shot she'd been working on for a good 10 min.   Only word she said to us was \"bye\" as we left. Very odd."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the food here. I ordered the Cajun chicken wrap and it had way too much spinach in the wrap that it was overpowering the whole thing. My husband enjoyed his sandwich that he ordered though. We split the chips and salsa and the salsa tasted very generic."}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere. We were sat quickly and had our waitress greet us and get drinks started right away.We had a fun date night here and will be back!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to try this restaurant tonight based on the pics and reviews of the food.  It was 12:30am and although it has a HUGE SIGN SAYING 24 HOUR FOOD, we were told the restaurant was closed!!!   WTF?  yelp said it was open, their 24 HOUR FOOD sign outside was lit up brighter than the sun but NO FOOD?  Seriously?   Talk about false advertising!  If your restaurant is only open certain hours then SAY SO!!!   EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED as we were not told why or WHEN the restaurant is even open!!!!  I live in Southern Highlands so this would be a great location for late night food......too bad we couldn't get any!!!!!  Someone needs to address this."}
{"text":"This place is a \"seat yourself\" type of setup. It was crowded so my boyfriend and I didn't plan on actually finding a seat. We found a table, with old drinks and a check from previous people so we awkwardly stood there until we found someone to clean off the table so we could sit down.  This place is loud, at least the night we went. Had to literally scream to talk type of place.   The food wasn't that great, at all really. It was either too hot or too cold and just generally didn't taste the greatest. The only good thing to eat here was the dessert.   And the reviews about the service are true. I think we only saw our waitress a total of 3 times, that's it. And that was only to quickly drop off the food. I had to literally wait for some other guests to leave their table so I could steal the ketchup bottle because I know there was no chance anyone was coming back to ask us how we were doing.  Plus, this place was expensive, I felt like crap because the food sucked and I paid so much for it."}
{"text":"this bar looks bigger from outside with  parking garage but it's just like all local vegas bars except  their male  bartenders are only paying attention to the single female customers.  to be honest if your going to hook up on random dates perfect bar ?... but if your a gamer drinker not for you...."}
{"text":"I've been to Distill a few times now and every time I do go there Rob the bartender is always on point.  He notices you right away. If he is busy then he at least  acknowledges you and says he'll be with you in a minute.  Pool tables and cues could use some attention, but other than that... great service and pretty good food even at late night."}
{"text":"I've given this place 3 tries. The service at the tables suck. The short rib tacos taste like they were reheated in the microwave."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out Distill tonight for a later lunch/early dinner. I was immediately impressed upon entering. The decor is really nice and the restaurant is clean and well kept. The bar and restaurant are totally separate which is nice because I'd rather eat in a quieter setting. It was happy hour, so we tried the filet mignon sliders minus the onion. They were delicious and even came with fries. For dinner I got the Chipotle Chicken Nachos minus the beans and my husband was clearly starving because he went with the ham and eggs and an order of French toast. My nachos were loaded with meat, and it was shredded and juicy. The salsa was fresh and had a great flavor as well. I ate until I was stuffed. My husband devoured everything except his hash browns. His recommendation would be to ask for your hash browns extra crispy, but that's really a matter of preference. Our server was Holly and she was great. She was very attentive and had a great, kind personality. We signed up for their reward program and we'll definitely be back! Next time I plan to try the salmon. I really like that the menu had a wide array of both \"bar\" foods and healthier options, like the kale salad. This is definitely not a bar that just serves food. The food is delicious and there's obviously a lot of thought and care that went into the menu."}
{"text":"I came to Distill to have some drinks a few weeks ago.  It is a very friendly, local bar with dimmed lights, some TV for sports, and a lid back, adult vibe.  The bartender actually got very friendly while I was ordering and we were on a first name basis after just a few minutes.  They have some sofas for lounging and drinking, as well as tables for traditional eating.  They make a good mix drink and their beer selection is actually quite good for a local bar.  Their prices are on par with most other bars in the area.  I enjoyed myself at Distill.    My main problem was that they double charged me on a beer I ordered.  It took three separate calls for me to get the charge removed. I would possibly come back to hang and try some appetizers when I'm in the area, but there are so many good restaurants in the Summerlin area that I might just make Distill my local watering hole and use it as a pre/post dinner stop rather than the full evening experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Tuesday night. Less than 10 people at the bar. We waited over 10 minutes for the bartender to get us a drink while she sat NEXT TO US talking at the bar. Been waiting for a refill over 10 again. She's sitting talking to another employee. I look around and every single person has an empty cup. The owners should be angry-people waiting to spend money and employees are just hanging out."}
{"text":"Been a few times already. Ask for Nicole, Amber or Erin. They are fun, attentive and helpful. I had the steak and shrimp surf n turf. Not bad but not great. Steak had some gristle and shrimp only came out warm. I told them them food was not hot enough. They are new so I am sure things will get better. Also you have to try the Buffalo cauliflower.....this shit is the bomb. The pretzel bites were also very buttery and soft, be sure to ask for extra cheese dip. Give these guys a try. I think it's worth it. 1...2....3...4....I wanna come back for more."}
{"text":"I came to distilled with some friends and to be honest the food was good however the service was unacceptable.   The bar tender carded me for food....I didn't even order a drink. I hadn't planned on it but regardless he made me drive home to get my ID so I could order JUST FOOD.   The girl waitress was nice, didn't catch her name unfortunately.   Once we finally ordered it took about 45 minutes to receive the French Dip.   Overall the food is good but the bar tender named \"rob\" is a jerk and service isn't speedy.    PART 2 of this review. My second time visiting this bar. I came in planning to game. The bar was full of people not playing the machines so I politely asked someone to move over. The guy was kind and agrees but his drunk girlfriend came over cussing us out and my friend and I politely said \"you're not gaming?\" And the bar tender this time named BILLY (a tall bearded ginger) threatened to kick me and my friend out for remarking back. Saying \"WOAH. NO. THEYRE PEOPLE TOO\" me and my friend were like ????   Honestly the only reason I come here is because my friends like it and usually the servers are nice. For some reason only the bar tenders are pretentious ass holes to put it nicely.   Please do something about your bar tenders. It's embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. So close to the house, clean, great drinks and prices. Pool tables and more! A glassed-off, non smoking dining section makes it nice for family visits as well. The food here really is not your typical bar food, it's great quality and delicious.  All the employees here are great peeps, can't go wrong! Great atmosphere and fun alone or with friends. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I came here about two weeks ago and the manager/bartender said our \"pitbull looking\"/dogo Argentino SERVICE DOG had to leave the general area of the bar and go to the restaurant area where no other paying patrons were. We assured him our trained and certified SERVICE DOG is allowed to go anywhere the owner is by LAW. He said the owners rules are we cannot be with the general population, which is against the law. We decided not to fight against his ignorance and went to The Lodge on Cactus. I decided to come back tonight with some coworkers and discovered a HUGE DEAD COCKAROACH in the woman's bathroom next to the kitchen. Next time I'll try the Distill in Summerlin! Dog lovers stay away!!!"}
{"text":"GLEN rocks my world!  Not only did he immediately serve me, but his attitude made my whole night.  The reason I have to write this review is because he gave great service to all people around me!  I love the drinks, prompt service and amazing atmosphere! !!  If you want to have a good time come to Distilled! !!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. My one complaint would be that If there's a handful of people smoking in here it like fills the place up. You know how some bars people can smoke but you don't seem to notice and others, well it's literally like you can taste it. Well this is an in between, maybe they need some better ventilation or something i don't know. So for that i have to knock off a star. But the food is yummy! I look forward to coming here when it warms up a bit and sitting outside."}
{"text":"Cute, convenient, and comfortable, Distill is your typical Vegas gaming bar located off of Charleston in Summerlin. I've come here a handful of times and received mediocr service each time. The most recent visit we ordered food. Chicken fingers and brisket sliders. The sliders were very good. But for 2 beers and 2 apps it was $50.00 that is a little ridiculous in my opinion. There are a few other bars in Summerlin that I find to be much better but this place certainly isn't the worst."}
{"text":"Recently had a chance to check this place out for the first time and I wish it was closer to my house! Finally a cool spot with an awesome bloody mary bar - Saturday & Sunday until 2pm. Go ahead order a bloody mary... You won't be disappointed. There's an extensive selection of fun stuff that you can doctor it up anyway you choose. The plate of bacon was a huge hit with my friends.   The food is really good too. I ordered the steak & eggs and it came out perfect. Nice quality new York strip and good portion of eggs. I'm pretty picky about my potatoes but the hash browns passed the test. Other crowd favorites were the Bubble and Squeak and Chicken and Waffles - both recommended by the manager, Kristyne. I also really liked the chicken street tacos.   As far as staff, everyone was very nice. Channel & Rick behind the bar took great care of us. Kristyne was very hilarious and kept a good eye on us. Everyone seemed to really care about making sure we had a good experience. I'm sure I'll be back for more of that bloody mary bar!  Oh my gosh, I almost forgot to mention how much I liked the bathrooms. Haha I love the angled flat sinks and individual wood stalls, very nice touch!"}
{"text":"This bar is one step above your average PTs in Vegas. If you are looking for a chill bar, dim lighting, TVs for sports watching, a few slot machines, plenty of seating, a couple couches, two pool tables, and light background music, then you would feel comfortable there. The ambiance works for a local neighborhood bar.  The food was overpriced and full of lackluster. The pretzel bites were equivalent to something you would buy in a grocery aisle and spray too much Pam on before microwaving. The mozzarella sticks looked really good, but were unremarkable. The buffalo sliders were more bun than chicken and the chicken was overcooked and very crunchy. The fries weren't great, they had no crispiness or flavor, and tasted like they had been frozen for a long while. The service was quick and attentive.   Don't go there for the food or expecting a drink selection beyond every other local bar. Go there because it's close and you just wanted a place to hang out, otherwise don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Me and my mom went to this bar late night we wanted good food and good drinks. And did we find it here. I ordered a mai tia which props to the bartender for making it spot on I'm pretty picking about mai tias and they delivered. The waitress was so sweet and attentive. The food just wow! I had ordered the cure burger honestly you need to try. It's this thick juicy burger stuffed with cheese, just to die for."}
{"text":"I would have given this bar 5 stars but finding this bar was so frustrating!  My mapquest took me to a residential area in the middle of nowhere on W Pyle Ave.  I had to call Distill in W. Charleston to get the cross roads.  So for those looking for this local bar......South Decatur and W. Pyle Ave.  Whatever you do.....keep heading south on S. Decatur until you see Distill sign on your left.  Anyway, the service was really good.  Our waitress,Danielle was very attentive.  She made sure our glasses were full and our plates were cleared when needed.  As for the food, I really enjoyed the fried mashed potato and the grilled chicken with vegetables. The chicken was very flavorful!  The vegetable was cooked just right!    As my stress reliever drink from getting lost trying to find the bar......it was so soothing and comforting that I forgot about being stressed out!!  LOL ( I had the Cinnamon Apple Sour- Infused Orange Cinnamon Whiskey, Redd's Apple Ale and Sour.)  I enjoyed my dinner and service.  I would recommend this bar to my friends and family.  Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Was at the grand opening on Feb 3rd. Good food and good drinks. It was packed and even then the service was good. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Friendly bar with good food. This bar has a friendly staff every day. The bartenders are friendly and welcoming. They're not just friendly to gamers they genuinely make it feel like a neighborhood bar. Jen is the best bartender in town."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.   Don't listen to all the naggers If you look all they do is get on here to leave nasty reviews! This place has wonderful service, great atmosphere, and even better food!! Have been here multiple times and will always return.  I love their southwest chicken salad and I order a side of the bbq sauce. Soo delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place was whack  Wicked Hella-cool Awesome Cool Kickass.  We would definitely be back. The atmosphere was very energetic. Music and all was cool for a pretty chill bar. Food was affordable. Service was on top of it. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A nice kind of bar where you need to grab the bartenders attention to get served.  Pro tip ask the bar back they pay more attention"}
{"text":"I was highly impressed with the food. I expected typical bar food, but I couldn't believe how good my chicken breast dinner was. The potato medley that came with it was excellent. I asked for the creamy dijon sauce on the side. I am a health-conscious eater. One of the bartenders asked me how I liked it, and she said how much she loves the food there and gave me an extra tip. She said she orders the chicken \"dry\", to avoid the oils/butter they use when making it. She also recommended the egg white omelette. Breakfast is served all day, so that is awesome.   I will definitely be getting the chicken dinner again and I will be trying an egg white omelette sometime.  Atmosphere is cool. Service was good. Beer selection is decent, but I'd prefer even more craft beers. Great addition to Southern Highlands, and I am looking forward to many visits here."}
{"text":"This review is based on the food and atmosphere only! I love coming to Distill when I can't decide where to eat. They always provide delicious food using quality ingredients. Their staff is always polite and gives you that neighborhood vibe. Of all the gaming/local bars this is my go-to for the best food! My favorite thing to get is the Distill chicken sandwich it comes with bacon and avocado and I like to add jalapeños. Their bread is Always very fresh as well! (I always admire a place who uses fresh jalapeños over pickled) Everything from their house salad to wings to dessert are all quality items nothing is ever lacking! Thanks for being a staple in the Southern Highlands Community!"}
{"text":"Trisha, is hands down the best server ever.  Period. Always on top of the orders, perfectly timed shots, and Star Wars references. And she's pretty."}
{"text":"We've been to Destill several times and have had great food, great service and a really good time. Natalie was our waitress last night and, even though ALL of the servers have been friendly, Natalie was exceptional. She has a sparkling personality, knowledge of the big menu and she made our evening absolutely enjoyable. Her recommendations, like the mashed potato bites, chopped cobb salad and chicken lettuce wraps, were delicious and priced right! We have officially found our new hang out!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review but i had an exceptionally bad experience. We went in for dinner and I ordered beef wontons from the appetizer menu. When the order came I ate one and the taste and texture was a little weird. I didn't really like it but I ate another just to be sure. That one was just as bad so I cut open a third one to find completely raw beef. It wasn't cooked on the inside whatsoever. When the waitress stopped by to ask how everything was I let her know and she was very nice about it and put in a replacement order of wings for me. By that time I didn't really feel like eating anything anymore (got the wings to go and ate later, they were pretty good!)   I'm not really sure what was going on after that but our waitress seemed to be ignoring us, she passed by us multiple times without stopping even when we tried to get her attention, at times we had to wait 20 minutes to have our water glasses refilled. It was a little busy as the game was on but they seemed to have adequate staff. The only redeeming qualities about our visit was that the wings were good and the knights won the game."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to have some nachos and beer. The beer selection wasn't too bad. You seat yourself and then a server comes to take your order. The service was quick and friendly. The nachos were ok. The big cold mug of beer was perfect. It's a great place to watch a game and hang out with friends while enjoying a drink."}
{"text":"Third time here everything was great until midnight when the graveyard bartender came on shift. I have never felt so disrespected In a place of business in my life. I had a French martini with the previous bartender, who made it well (9:30pm John) my drink was perfect and it tasted  exactly like it's supposed to be made. I re ordered my drink at midnight as we were with a group of friends and the graveyard bartender delivered my drink tasting off. I  went over to the bar and asked the bartender what he made my drink with. He begin to explain what he thought was in the drink (wrong) instead of asking he was pissed off when I told him what was actually in the drink. He then prepared a new drink, as i waited at the bar. The new drink was prepared and delivered in front of me looking completely different and tasting different as well. When I asked the bartender If he thought the drink looked different than the previous prepared he ignored me... I proceeded to taste the drink and told him that the drink tasted differently as well. I told him I had no problem paying for both drinks but the first was almost undrinkable. He then swiftly grabbed the drink from me and immediately and abruptly poured it out in front of me... ignoring my concern. I sat back down with my large group of friends astonished by his disrespect and unprofessionalism. I told our waitress my concern who was very busy and a complete sweetheart. She notified our table that his name was Ryan and that she was very sorry on his behalf. How is \"Ryan\" about to work graveyard at a bar in Las Vegas and not know how to make a french martini.. Even so.. How do you allow yourself as a bartender to be offended when a customer patiently and politely tries to inform you on how to make a certain popular drink... And be rude and disrespectful to the customer. I am blown away by the lack of professionalism what a poorly run establishment if they allow rude bartenders to treat paying customer with disrespect during after hours... Is this how you train your employees? I will continue to notify everyone I know of this bar and the graveyard bartender and his lack of respect to customers. I am embarrassed for you distill. 1 star how horrible"}
{"text":"I'm already a fan of Distill on Centennial and yesterday was not an exception.  Kim, our server, was friendly, always checking on us (there was 8 of us) and our drinks were always full.  The grilled cheese brisket sandwich could have had more sauce and my usual deep fried cauliflower wasn't hot when it arrived at the table.  The artichoke hearts and chicken satay were very tasty.  The desert of the month, please do something else, Total disappointment!"}
{"text":"I love their food! Great prices, the service was alright. It's busy so I totally understand they are dealing with others. Overall great place and scene."}
{"text":"Came here after a delicious dinner at Echo and Rig and fell in love with this place! We sat outside and had couple of drinks. There is a Yelp check in offer too. The outside seating is lovely. Carved out fireplaces, very pretty. I had a moscow mule drink and it was good. The drink prices seem quite reasonable too. Didn't eat any food and didn't see much of the inside. The outside is where it's at!  Very cool. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is  terrible. the dark dankness of sitting down at the bar where they don't bother to say hello for 20 minutes then to sit there for hours spending hundreds on machines and drinks to have a bartender ask you for ID. I'd been here, sitting at the bar since 5:30, it's 11:30 and now you want iD. Ok. You can have it you moron!   I'm 35, thanks for asking, if I were 21 I'd already be home or worse wasted driving and had killed someone.  You should lose your license!  Gross failure at your job! The bathrooms were  disgusting  & filthy, out of TP, paper towels and soap.  I can't imagine anyone ordering food and feeling safe eating it      This failure will be the next to close in the long line at this location.  I can't wait...."}
{"text":"great food and environment. Wish the cocktails were a little fuller, but they taste great."}
{"text":"Love this place. Had been going to Distill in Summerlin so we were very happy when we saw there was one opening a block from us. Every time we've went in, we've had great service and awesome food. We visit Distill about 1-2 times a week. Very happy they've finally opened."}
{"text":"Great food & great service!  Bartender was very helpful with assisting us with the video machines. Only downfall is they need more gaming. Their 10-15 machines don't really suffice for a busy night"}
{"text":"Ryan the bartender charged me over $20 for food and drink that wasn't mine. Refused to take it off and gave shitty attitude about it. Stay away from this place unless you want to get charged for stuff that isn't yours when you leave your card at the bar, better off closing each tab after each drink."}
{"text":"Best local bar in town! Can't wait until they open their new location in Centennial. Food, drinks, atmosphere, and service were all great!"}
{"text":"Eh ok. Sweet atmosphere (5 stars). Ordered the pretzel bites, total FAIL. These are the same frozen ones at the store I microwave at home. Chips and salsa, chips are super stale and salsa is super good. Lol! Go figure. Do yourself a favor and get the pretzel app at Molly Malone's or Black Mountain Grill, both freshly made. Otherwise this is just another bar with bar food, so 3 stars. It's pretty blue collar."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  The atmosphere, décor, the patio!  In fact, once on the patio I didn't even feel like I was in the middle of busy restaurant parking lot.  My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on Sunday evening.  It wasn't very crowded at all.  We were greeted and told we could sit wherever we wanted so we chose the patio.  On this visit we didn't really see much of the inside.  Happy Hour is every day from 3-6 but we missed that but checking in on Yelp got me a free drink so can't really beat that.  Off the appetizer menu we ordered the chicken quesadillas and avocado egg rolls.  Basic bar food but no complaints about taste or portion size.  I wish the tables outside were a little bigger.  We felt cramped eating having to use the small round table and a couple chairs to hold the times.  Not sure why the waitress didn't offer to move another small table for us since it was empty on the patio minus one other group of diners.  I know I will find myself back here soon especially during happy hour.  They also have a loyalty program.  I mean if you are going to frequent an establishment you might as well take advantage of the perks that go along with it."}
{"text":"The gentleman sitting next to me at the bar and I were in agreement; a name like Distill might not appeal to both sexes equally. The place did appear a little lopsided, with few members of the smarter sex represented in the crowd, but maybe it was just an off night.  You have to be envious of the location (though I cannot for the life of me imagine why the prior establishment closed down, they made the best $5 burritos every Sunday morning in the parking lot), many a west-sider will find themselves in this area when on the hunt for food.  At first I wanted to bemoan the continued downward spiral of the local Las Vegas food scene, specifically the burger I ordered that they affectionately refer to as \"The Cure\", but then I realized -  YES - I definitely want to bemoan the continued downward spiral of the local Las Vegas food scene.  The Cure was, well, unremarkable in every way, despite a description that promised so much:   \"Hand crafted burger: ground beef and pork blend stuffed with fontina cheese topped with soy marinated onions, jalapeño jelly, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and fried parsnips on a brioche bun.\"   Doesn't it just sound tasty? Well it's not. Unremarkable, is the best way to describe it. There was one more thing, the second half of my burger was ice cold by the time I finished the first - not that the first half was piping hot or anything, but ice cold?  The bar menu has no section for \"distilled spirits\", despite the name, another thing the gentleman sitting next to me thought was curious. They did have a coffee infused whiskey as part of their signature Manhattan, but if you didn't read the description of the drink you would have never known they offer this unusual item. I asked the bartender about the coffee infused whiskey - and before I could even finish my sentence, he returns with TWO shots of the curious liquid - one for me and one for this gentleman I just met - and then charged BOTH of them to my tab. Wow, really?  If I were the one opening a restaurant in this enviable western valley location, I personally would have avoided the poker machines. But then my goal would have been to wow patrons with good food and service, rather than just open another smoky gambling hall.  In all, the food is not great, the service needs a little, well, delicacy and the place sure was overflowing with men - but I thought is was okay."}
{"text":"Love this place! Glad to have something like this up here! Great food, drinks & service! Cool interior & fun place to hang out. Good for families, too!"}
{"text":"We wanted to check out the hype on this Cure Burger, so that's one of the items we ordered...  I ALWAYS order my steaks/burgers medium rare, but this was a time where I couldn't because it wasn't an all beef patty, the cure burger is a mix of beef and pork, so we ordered it medium. We also ordered Their steak sandwich(forgot the name) and split both. I think it was kinda like a French Dip.  Our Server was great, offering suggestions and answering questions we had about anything on the menu. Our orders came out rather quickly and dug right in. The steak sandwich was very tasty, meat was well seasoned and the roll was nicely toasted. The Cure Burger was love at first bite, and is as good as everyone raves about! A bit messy in a good way, and the Jalapeno Jam gives it a nice kick. We enjoyed every bite.  I don't know about you, but after having something savory, I crave something sweet, so we took a look at the dessert menu. Their Bread Pudding sounded good, so we went with that. When our server brought it to our table, our initial reaction was WTF!?!? This BEAST could seriously feed 4-6 people and pretty much covered the entire plate almost! The gooey nut topping part was good, but the custard part needed a little more love. After a couple of stabs, we were done.  Great visit, and a good spot for late night drinks and bites, but the kids aren't allowed...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"I have been disappointed several times since I've been into the new distill location on North Durango the other two locations are phenomenal but this location just can't seem to catch up to the other two locations. The bartenders are slow and have been rude.  I ordered nachos last night and was served a plate of stale chips with half melted cheese and when I returned the nachos to the bartender he  told me that the chips have been crappy.  Jokingly he told me if I returned the nachos the cook would spit in my food.  Joke or not bad customer.   I live close so I have given distill multiple chances and always have been disappointed in their service.  I am finally done with distill and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great patio area and food.   can't wait to go back.   Service takes a pretty long time but its worth it for the chicken nachos.    Nice late night hang  Ok   So Update...    been back a couple of times now...    Man service is SLLOOOOW, but really I wasnt there for fast service, I was there to catch up with friends...    the outside is the place to be, the inside just feels like another bar.     OK    Chicken nachos...   YUM      Sliders (lots to choose from)   YUM    Tacos...    Had better...   not a fan.       Listen the place is open 24 hours and its close to a lot of things on the west side...     after a certain time of night...   your options are limited...      Im just glad to have a place like this to go to any time of day or night...      the good FAR out ways the bad with this place.      You can check in on yelp and grab a free inused whiskey...    I'm a whiskey fan, but I wasnt a fan of it...    but I do  appreciate it."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place, we've been 3 times now since it opened and haven't had an issue. The food is good, very reasonable prices, beers are only $5 for a tall domestic. Nice decor, and plenty of room for sitting or hanging out. Two pool tables and a TouchTunes for music. Happy Hour from 3-6pm & 3-6am for all your drinking needs."}
{"text":"For a \"local\" bar, the service from the bartenders is non existent unless your a pretty girl. My wife and I have been 6 different times and with the exception of Dan the bartender we have been ignored by everyone else. There is a big bartender who looks like he should be a professional wrestler who won't even make eye contact with anyone. All the spots at the bar that clearly say \"players only\" are usually filled with the opposite. The food is good and we could see this being our \"local\" bar if they can get better and quicker service behind the bar."}
{"text":"Scotty G. runs a top notch place(Graveyard), as always. Perfect drinks, good machines, great food, what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had been driving past this place for months waiting for it to open. We had heard many good reviews about the food at the other Distill locations in the area so we were intrigued when we learned one would be opening near us.   We gave it a couple of weeks after opening before deciding to give it a try for dinner. We planned to go on a Friday after work around 4:30 pm thinking we could beat the dinner crowd. Boy were we wrong! Upon pulling into the parking lot on the upper level, we could see right off the bat that virtually all parking spots were taken. We managed to find an open one and grabbed it. Once inside the bar, it was packed!!! It is pretty spacious inside though, but there was a not a seat to be had in the bar area, so we headed into the smoke-free restaurant area where there were about 6 available tables.   Seating is seat yourself, so we grabbed a table. After about 5 minutes of sitting there, a server came by with menus and took our drink order. We ordered the pretzel bites for an appetizer, hubs ordered the Santa Fe turkey sandwich and Peach D'Lite and I ordered the braised short ribs and a Distiller's Delight.   The drinks from the bar were a little pricey, but they tasted great!   The pretzel bites came with a cheese dipping sauce and a mustard dipping sauce. I could've just eaten those for dinner... well I kind of did...more on that later! The pretzels were hot and soft but the outer portion was just firm enough and not overly salted either. Loved them.  My husband really liked his sandwich, but I wish I could have said the same for me liking my braised ribs. Though the plate looked like it just came out of the kitchen, upon tasting it, it appeared to either have been sitting out or the meat hadn't been heated enough. When I tasted mine, the meat was just... room temperature. I politely asked the server who checked on us if they could reheat mine a little more which she gladly and apologetically did. Another server came back out with my plate which I am assuming was microwaved because he had another plate under the original so as not to get burned. He apologized for the dish as well. Wasn't their fault, but I tasted it again and though it had been bumped up in the warmth a little, it just did not do it for me. I really wanted to like it because I love braised short ribs, but I think reheating it in the microwave actually toughened the meat. Hence....I ended up eating most of the pretzel bites for dinner and heading to Taco Bell after for 2 taco Supremes.   In summary, I might give this place another chance maybe in several months, but if I do come back, it'll just be for appetizers and beer during Happy Hour. The specialty cocktails, though delicious, were a bit pricey for me and not sure I want to shell out the money again for a failed entrée. Or maybe next time I stick with a sandwich...not much chance of those going wrong. At least my husband liked his meal. The servers were great though too! Very friendly!"}
{"text":"There's a few options for bars around my neighborhood that are much closer but I choose to drive a few more miles and come to Distill. The staff there is second to none. I've been there all different times of the day and always get exceptional service.  I like to come and gamble, eat, and have a few cocktails. I haven't had the best of luck on the machines but that's nobody's fault. The machines are always clean with a great selection of games and bonus money you earn playing with a card.  The food is unbelievable considering it's just a neighborhood bar in the middle of the desert. On top of a top notch menu they run specials daily and have an awesome happy hour.  Without a doubt my favorite bar in the city of sin! If you don't know now you know!"}
{"text":"Been to a couple of their locations but need to post a review about Summerlin location. We went there and sat in bar area ,waitress was a little slow to get to us ,not even busy,however when I informed the bartender Dustin,not only did I get get a true heart felt appologie,comped us a drink for the wait. Afterwards came over to our table with some of our friends we met,introduced himself apologized again . I have never seen customer service like that in this town in 20 years. They are lucky to have them and will never forget my positive time over there"}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders and amazing food! Jen was so nice! And the pickle fries are bomb.com!"}
{"text":"The couple times I've been here the bartenders where shitty took forever to get drinks the waitresses were mean muggin all night I just don't get why. Definitely would never come again."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY impressed! I just ordered delivery for two 90's burgers, two salads, fruit, mashed potatoes and a BIG side of ranch! WOW yum, I felt like I dined in a restaurant without having to leave the house!!! This place is sooo delicious and I feel they really put effort into my meal. Thank you for the most delicious delivery we've ever had! I will be taking my family here to dine in as soon as they visit! We can't wait! Looking forward to trying their deserts too!"}

{"text":"came once before and it was decent, only reason we came back was for a friends birthday.  It has a good atmosphere and they have buck hunter which is always fun to play but the food and service were both bad. ..  won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Been there twice. First time was 3 stars as the food was average yet took forever. This time it's a big 0. Walked in last night and sat ourselves as the sign said. Only table was dirty with food and paper waste (receipts/napkins). Not a big deal assuming people just left. Went to get a high chair and staff asked if we needed help...that was the last time we were ever talked to. Sat for 10-15 minutes as the staff ignored us but were quick to pick up checks from people leaving. This place is tiny mind you (dining room) so there is really no excuse for the neglect.  Never even saw or was presented with a menu. Left without anyone to tell our ordeal because there was no staff in the room at that time. Not going back and will advise everyone we know to do the same. Really no upside since the food is average, parking is atrocious, and staff is terrible. If I were the owner I'd be ashamed.  Best part is there are tons of eat spots in Vegas obviously so it's no loss. Look elsewhere you'll thank me"}
{"text":"Went back thinking, \"why not it's been about a year, time to see if this place has changed.\" The answer to that is no it has not. I honestly don't know why they have a pool table when all the sticks are broken and neither table has a pool rack. So I went and watched a game at a table. The first chair I sat in had a small tear, thankfully there was another nearby which didn't have the same problem.  The bartenders were alright, but they are nothing to write home about and they seemed to be always rushing. I never felt like anything other than another guy in seat, especially after I went through $20.00 in a machine at the bar and got asked, \"are you still playing?\" I answered, \"not right now,\" and immediately got asked to move down.  I get it the machines are reserved for players, hence the placard on them. But it hadn't even been more than five minutes since I blew that $20.00. I finished my beer and left. Maybe one day this place will be alright, I'm just not holding my breath any more."}
{"text":"Great little hidden spot. They're menu is awesome with a lot of variety, very reasonably priced and full bar. You can dine in their dinning room which has booths and tables or dine in the bar area which also has the bar top, tables, and smaller tables with lounge/chase chairs. It's was incredibly loud in the bar area so we chose to eat in the dinning room so we could hear each other chat but then went into the bar area for drinks after dinner.   Menu: MUST TRY THE MASHED POTATO BALLS. Omg they're unreal. it's basically a baked potato with chives and butter, mashed up, and fried into little balls served with a ranch dipping sauce and a chipotle sour cream dipping sauce. I we had them in both the dinning area and bar they were that good. The grilled cheese is served on big soft texas toast with a generous amount of fries. I ordered the western burger with the black bean patty which was tasty but i was a little disappointed the black bean patty wasn't made in house so the patty was kind of slim. And of course its served with a generous portion of fries.   Drinks: Very reasonable priced drinks and they also have happy hour! i looked a few of their house wines and the pinot noir is their best quality. I ended up ordering that and was very pleased. They also have about every flavor vodka and flavored rums as well. The bar area is very relaxed with serves in the area in addition to the bar tenders. They even offered us water bottles on our way out the door while paying our check which i feel the gesture went a long way.  Top notch in service and genuine for sure.   Bill: We split the bill, signed for my half of the bill and somehow i was still charged the full bill so i have to give them a call and get that fixed. So may just be sure you check your account before leaving the parking lot."}
{"text":"Sports bar in the neighborhood with happy hour and pretty darn good food!    Been here a handful of times and have tried new foods every time.   This past time, I had DELICIOUS pot roast egg rolls. Yes, you read it here -- egg rolls stuffed with mash potatoes and pot roast. All of which, you dip in gravy. It was so yummy even without the gravy.  Buffalo cauliflower was pretty tasty, as well.  Basic Greek fries, chicken wings.   TV screens everywhere! Great for sports watching."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and how it's away from the cluttered shopping plaza. The food here is great.. I sometimes go here just for the food."}
{"text":"Went here Wednesday night to watch the Knights game.  Service was excellent in spite of being jam packed with hockey fans.  Food came in a timely manner and still tasted good, not like they just rushed to push it out as fast as they can.  Apps taste awesome and so did my sandwich.  Not your typical bar food at all.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It has a great atmosphere. Great service, great drinks. They play good music and the slot machines aren't bad. Sometimes we do very well. The bread pudding is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This was third time coming to Distill, but I just could not find anything special about it.  Their food and service are just mediocre/bad. The servers forget things all the time, they usually seem unhappy to be there, and it takes forever to get the food.  The price is pretty good, but the quality of food is low. The steaks are never cooked right. I know that Distill is not a steakhouse and I should not have high expectations, but even other items are pretty bad. The outside patio is nice to relax though. It is a good place to chill and drink. BUT no food."}
{"text":"Rob is the best! a knowledgable fun outgoing bartender who makes sure your happy & having a good time. He has high energy with awesome conversation. we come regularly to see him and the food never disappoints. great music also I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I live in the middle of Vegas so it's a bit of a trip but this is by far the best Distill I've been too. Up there for best bar in Vegas. Super fast with drinks the people there are not some dive bar crowd also Nicky is one of the main reasons you should go visit this bar. By far my favorite bartender or all time."}
{"text":"My BF and I visited recently for happy hour, so this review is based on this. Service was pretty good. We were greeted promptly after finding a table (seat yourself). Happy hour drink prices were just OK. I was hoping that cocktails would be a $1-2 off, but no special on those. Just your regular well and cheap beer. We only got appetizers and they were decent for the price. The patio looks amazing (it was cold when we went) so we'll be back for drinks again."}
{"text":"Great  24 hour hang out!   I think last 24 great place in Summerlin that is for all locals and not a casino"}
{"text":"This was our second attempt to try this Distill out. The first time, the service was so bad that we left before getting our first round. This time, there was no staff in the bar when we arrived at 3pm and we waited for 5 -7 minutes before ANYONE showed up. Our waiteress, Crystal, was nice and attentive. The manager ignored us, since we were only sitting at a table and not gambling. I mention this because he made a point to greet all of the guest that were playing video poker. Also, for the majority of the time we were here, the TWO bartenders could hardly stop talking to their friends sitting at the bar to wait on customers in a reasonable amount of time. We watched as multiple customers walked in, took a seat at the bar, and waited while the bartenders finished chatting with their friends to look around to realize that there was a new customer at the bar. This is the exact reason that we left without getting a drink the first time we tried this place."}
{"text":"Big bar lots of room. Watch out for Rheya though. This waitress will eat you alive with her quick wit. Every comment you make she has a counter. Fun times will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Jay, Mike, and Teresa are dope! They're consistently great. Good drinks, great service and all around good human beings. Not something you usually find in a bar. We have a few bars to choose from closer to our house but Distill is usually a good choice for a Knights game, decent bar food, shooting pool, decompress after a long shift or people watching Tinder hookups. Whatever it is...Distill delivers, thanks to the twins Jay and Mike....and the lovely Teresa! Oh yeah, Marissa....great edition to the team....We definitey enjoy our random Distill nights! Keep banging!"}
{"text":"First time here and we had an amazing experience! Our server Angela was so friendly, absolutely no complaints. Great service, atmosphere and food! We had the IPA shrimp which she recommended. Super accommodating to our extra lime and less sweet drink requests. We are locals and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to be any day of the week!!! The bartenders and waitresses are fabulous!!!! Mike N. never lets your drink go empty and the conversation keeps flowing, not to mention he's not bad on the eyes The food is fantastic and they're always coming up with new specials.  The gaming is great, lots of different games to play and the payout isn't too bad either. I love this bar!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to the GRAND OPENING of the local bar. Per the flyer we received in mail there was to be giveaways, raffles every 15 minutes and specials galore. Got here, no specials, no sign of any giveaway but the place is packed! Asked about what was on flyer and was told \"oh sorry ma'am (yuck!) we had to push grand opening out\" I was given another flyer that says nothing about anything special. Main thing I don't get is they ARE open. Why wouldn't you have ANY food special's or free food or something the first night (to best of my knowledge) you are actually open. Feel totally jipped!! Food just ok, disappointed in the false advertisement I was sent. Not sure I'll be back which is sad since it is walking distance from my house."}
{"text":"Good spot. Nice inside. Not too smokey and the machines don't suck your money real fast."}
{"text":"It's about time Summerlin had a decent pub/bar/hang-out/tavern, whatever the hell you want to call it, it's good they have one.  Super friendly staff, not overbearingly so, but attentive. Food was quite tasty, chicken sandwich is da bomb! The waitress said you can get it as a wrap (off the menu) , nice tip, thanks. Few things: 1) For yelpers, if you check in you get a free shot of their house whisky. Bad thing is, it's horrible. Cinnamon / orange infused. Pretty much tasted like Triaminic cold and cough. Pass on it, trust me. 2) The bathroom sinks...I can't stand these things. Whoever thought a slightly tilted slab of tile would work as a sink...dude, you were waaaay wrong. Give me a basin and save my clothing from the splash back and the whopping 2 inches of space to place my hands under, please.   Bottom line: Great place to hang, plenty of room to move, cool staff, great food. Just beware of the bathroom sinks...."}
{"text":"Staff is attentive and very friendly   Jalapeño poppers- pass   House salad with blue cheese dressing- so good! I could eat a bowl of that dressing!   Broccoli cheddar soup- home made and really really delicious  Gyro- I give it a 9.5, really fresh and soft pita, tasty meat and sauce   Black n blue burger- hubby gave it a 8.5, needed more horseradish   Can't wait to eat on the patio at night when the weather is a lil nicer....oh, and the bathrooms are soooo nice!    My husband and I are both chefs and work late, so we will definitely be back in the wee hours to get a good quality meal with great atmosphere"}
{"text":"My boys and I enjoy this place. Perfect for football Sundays and to get out for drinks. Great service, good food, great specials, and best of all an upbeat ambiance by the regulars. Chanel, Haiti, and Mariah are amazing waitresses! Sweet, great customer service, and great smiles :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The bartenders are funny, the food is great, and the patio is beautiful to hang out on in the summertime.   Huge selection of alcohol.  Don't gamble though. The machines refuse to give me money.  The bathrooms could use more attention too :/"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout with a great atmosphere!!Graveyard bartenders are legit. Ryan and Scotty are two of the best in the business. Don't understand why people are making a fuss about a French Martini...You won't find a bar in town that serves better food....."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place, but they don't allow kids (for good reasons) so it was a matter of time before the Mrs. and I could get here.  We were not disappointed!  We came on a Sat. night around 7:30/8 towards the end of a Golden Knights game that was on nearly every TV in the place & although it was very crowded (I think there was a Christmas party or 2 going on at the same time) we were able to get a low table with some comfy chairs.  The service was fantastic! I didn't get the servers name (on the receipt it said her name was: Banquet Server2) She was great, knowledgeable about the menu and attentive even though there was tons going on.  This place is open 24/7 and they proudly serve bar food, but this food was above and beyond the normal bar food I'm used to or was expecting.  My compliments to the chef and the kitchen, because everything came out tasting fresh, flavorful and detailed!  You can't mess around in Vegas, there are too many options. I was expecting a run of the mill PT's menu, but this place was outstanding and I can't wait to go back!  We ordered Cracked Bread with artichoke dip, buffalo cauliflower, stuffed mushrooms and the Greek Sandwich.(we split everything) and we brought way too many leftovers home! Let me just say this sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken breast was moist and tender. Who/ whomever is running this place is on their game!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch and dinner, really does feel like a local joint as opposed to one of those done-up Vegas bars.  The Cure burger was nice, though the buns were a little large compared to the rest of the burger.  Steak tacos had a nice amount of marinated flank steak, which might owe itself better to a fajita or carne asada platter."}
{"text":"Admittedly My first visit was tragically, tragically awful.  I did give this place a second, third, fourth, fifth chance and I am glad I did.  I do LOVE the outside area with the Moroccan lanterns and the chimeras with the cloisters of seating areas. Also the food I have had since the first visit has been immensely better granted I stay firmly away from anything I had on the first visit."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars because the service from the bartender on duty was attentive and poured good drinks. However the server who was supposed to be serving us in our section completely ignored us, didn't give us menus and when we asked if our table had a server she said yes and she would be right over, never came, which in turn, made us go straight for the bar. For someone who works in the service industry, I'm pretty understanding and patient, however she didn't have many tables, and it wasn't that busy, and to just ignore a party of 3, is a clear sign of bad service. If I return, I'll make sure to only order from the bar, where we get immediate service."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. TV's and pool tables. Cool atmosphere. Good drinks and good food."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here.  Great food and even better customer service.  Mo and Eliot are great behind the bar. Definitely worth the drive!  The wings are amazingly juicy.  Fried just right, my only compliant is that the nitro isn't hot enough! But I'm a guy who takes heat for pain so they might be too hot for you!"}
{"text":"So so glad we tried Distill! New, clean, modern look. We walked in just before 5 & the bar was pretty full...good sign. We actually sat in the non smoking restaurant area to avoid the smoke. Holly was out server. She was great. We went with all happy hour items: crispy artichokes, Greek fries, Filet mignon sliders, & short rib tacos. All was delicious! Short rib tacos were our fav of the 4. Prices on HH between $2-8 & drink specials at $3. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to take advantage of happy hour. Had the short rib tacos since I had before at another location. Also had chips n salsa.  Tacos here were not great. Total bummer. The chips were AMAZING! Clearly freshly made there. Service was ok. Also had a tequila sunrise since it was happy hour & recommended. Honestly, not good at all."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Distill for a few months now, and I have nothing but good things to say. I'm here mostly for the pool tables and Sunday Ticket however the gorgeous interior and friendly staff are equally important. Tonight, a very friendly server named Maria motivated me to write a review because she made me feel right at home even though I wasn't ordering anything. The crew is great, drinks are reasonably priced and the pool is cheap. Come check it out!   Bonus: this joint isn't smoky like most gaming bars, it's really well ventilated."}
{"text":"Brittany was awesome! Great personality. Awesome service. Food was good, as expected for a late night bite after midnight."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere to come and hang out. Theresa is awesome! She's upbeat, friendly and always has a smile!!!"}
{"text":"Spent Super Bowl Sunday here and was not impressed with the layout.  Table lights were so low and TV monitors positioned badly had customers looking directly into the light fixtures to see the game. Beautiful Mexican restaurant turned into a run of the mill bar and grill. What a shame.  Food was bland and lacked imagination."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and drinks. Food good too.  However, don't even think you'll hear one of your songs on the jukebox. They feature the Touchtunes Julebox which you can use your phone app to play music.  Bartenders will skip your songs to satisfy their best customers that get drunk and gamble their $ away, in hope to receive a large tip from a drunk person that doesn't know otherwise.  Even on a slow night, they cater to their friends and regulars, and leave the new patron out."}
{"text":"The grilled fish tacos are really good! I have them add avocado and  I always ask for lime wedges. The best!"}
{"text":"So we are local Southern Highlands residents since 2001 and we were excited to see Distill open up.  A new bar and restaurant so close to home. So the good news...great sports bar.   Cold beer, great setup, nice servers, clean, open and airy!  Perfect local hangout.   The bad news. ..The food is HORRIBLE...ordered pretzel bites and medium wings.  Pretzel bites were clearly frozen and reheated, gloppy poor excuse for cheddar cheese and a disgusting \"homemade\" beer mustard that was a soupy gross mess...sent that back.  Wings were ok...sauce was a little too vinegary.   Ordered avocado egg rolls at Servers recommendation. ..bad idea...it was a wonton wrapper filled with guacamole. ..looked gross...kinda like baby poop in a wonton wrapper.  Had zero texture and was just gross.  So we will be back for beer and cocktails..only.  Sadly I feel like they could have done better."}
{"text":"I have been to Distill in the past for drinks and dinner, and it was just \"ok\"!  I was told they they have an excellent brunch on the weekends. In fact, they have a sign in front of the restaurant stating that Distill was voted the \"best brunch in Summerlin.\"  Well, I do not know who voted, but it seriously is \"the worst\" (not just one of the worse) breakfasts I have ever had in the past 30+ years.   I had their Protein Omelet, and it had absolutely no flavor -- it was terrible. Another in our party ordered the Strawberry Waffle, and the strawberries (there are only 4 small strawberries on their so-called Strawberry Waffle) were FROZEN. Yes, FROZEN. When it was brought to the server's attention, she apologized and informed us, \"we don't have any fresh fruit.\"  She was right -- because the watermelon, cantaloupe, and other melons they serve as a side dish with their breakfasts also were frozen and tasteless. So, while the reviews for Distill are positive for the drinks and the typical \"bar food\" you get at a place like this (and I agree that this is a fun place in the evenings), they definitely need to drastically improve on their so-called \"best brunch in Summerlin\"!!!!!  Oh, BTW, the server (Maggie) was EXCELLENT.  Maybe the votes Distill received for being the \"best\" actually were intended to praise their servers (assuming that all are as excellent as Maggie)."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. We came here a few days ago for breakfast since is in the neighborhood. I had the breakfast burrito and my wife had the sausage and eggs. Everything was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor. The hashbrowns were the stand out to me, since it is really hard to find good hashbrowns in vegas for some reason. They are buttery and seasoned well. We are definitely going back for breakfast and to try other menu options. I have to add the the menu is 24 hours so you have a lot of choices at all times of the day."}
{"text":"I don't sugar coat things cause I'm no willy wonka so with that being said, shout out to the guys who really turned my experience here around - Eliot, Jon and Ryan.. you guys are true startenders in my book. I wholeheartedly appreciate how they are so attentive and fun whenever I stop in. far from the previous service experience before. you guys are the real MVP's.  since my last review, how things have truly turned around since then. service has stepped up and i can honestly say I haven't been disappointed. so, let's begin..  beverages are of the essence, so even though I was heartbroken of great white being removed off the menu, the seasonal pumpkin shandy they now have is the BOMB!! it's sweet with hints of cinnamon and is so delicious. safe to say I've drank plenty of these already and you should too if this fits your flavor profile.  food was so much better this time. the gyro was on point. cooked to temperature so it wasn't too dry. my sister got the bread bowl and she enjoyed it. nice new addition on the menu and good choice of mash and stew to put inside. my friend got the steak and eggs plate and it looked great as well. it's promising that breakfast is enjoyable here at any hour.  well played distill, well played."}
{"text":"I often have to remind myself while eating dinner here that I'm dining at a bar, because you would never believe it to be true by taste alone.   We had a super bummer experience during their soft opening, but gave them another shot and I am so very glad we did. We've eaten here four times now and they've never once let us down. The staff are incredibly friendly, and make it feel less like a transaction, but more of a conversation. Regardless of whether you sit at the bar, the dining area, or the smoke-free restaurant room - you are taken care of.   We're steadily making it through the entire menu, but here are some thoughts.   Appetizers: Get the Turkey Stuffing Balls. These little morsels of fried perfection are Thanksgiving in a bite, with the most delicious cranberry gelee you've ever experienced. The nachos are....nachos - but made with housemade tortilla chips which make them a bit better. The fried mashed potato balls are fun! Perfectly salted with melty cheese inside - and the smashed potatoes still have their skins, so once you crunch into it's perfectly fried shell, you're in carb-heaven.  Soups: Tomato Basil - if this is on the menu then you don't need to worry about anything else. My tastebuds dream of this soup weekly. The broth is perfectly seasoned with fresh herbs and feature finely diced tomatoes which make it impossible to not giggle with excitement about. Chicken Noodle - imagine Campbells chicken noodle, but no preservatives, boosted flavor, actual chicken, and no sodium overdose. It's mmm mmm good. Chicken Tortilla - whooooo this one has a kick. Black beans and shredded chicken in a delicious, spicy broth. I added some saltines to this to take down the heat, and I didn't want the bowl to end.   Dessert: I've only had one, and it was the brownie sundae I shared with the husband on valentine's day. This was awesome! I'm not usually a fan of this type of thing, but who can say no to a warm, fudgy fresh brownie with a huge scoop of french vanilla ice cream and whipped cream all drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauces? Not me, #obvi.   Entrees:  - Beef Tips. GET THEM. Perfectly seared, gravy on point, honey drizzled carrots on top of a delicious mashed potato? UM, YES.  - Fish & Chips. I've had better. Beer battered, a bit dry, but tasty none-the-less.  -Fried Chicken & a Biscuit. Holy crap. This is amazing. Two drums and a boneless breast freshly battered and fried, PERFECTLY seasoned. Potato medley was sweet, rustic and red under a delightful bed of bacon-speckled spinach...and let's not forget about the buttermilk biscuit. hot damn. Oh yeah, and it's all drizzled with honey. GAHHHHH!!! - Philly Cheesesteak was everything you hope it will be - a beautifully balanced sandwich to serve all of your East Coast needs with ease. This was served with sweet potato fries - a great choice.  - French Dip. I was not ready for this. It was my husband's meal the night I got the Beef Tips, and I almost wrestled him for a second bit. This beautiful beast lingers on my tastebuds still to this day. I will have you again, oh yes - I will.   Our friend got the burger with the cheese in the middle. He's that one friend that searches the world over for the perfect burger and will never be satisfied. He friggin' LOVED this burger. ...so there's that.   The drink selection is great. I've enjoyed the Pinot Noir and Cab - my husband has been making his way through the whiskey creations. The first night we asked for an Old Fashioned and the bar tender referred to her drink list and then made him an Old Grandad - which is definitely not what he wanted - but he's since ordered it again, so apprently it went well.   The placement of bar taps is confusing and a bit frustrating, as the bar staff are super friendly and it's impossible to hold a conversation with them in your direct eyeline.   The decor is great. It's bold and defining without being obnoxious. Thumbs up. :)  Congrats, Distill! You opened up less than a mile from our home, and blow us away everytime - so now you're stuck with us!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my night out here! I happened to go on the night they had an 80's costume party. The DJ was amazing and so was the atmosphere. They only  have those parties once a year. The drink options were great and the appetizers were  good! Service is good it was just hard to find seating. Will visit again soon!!"}
{"text":"Best bar in town !!! Seriously love all the distill's ! Every time I go in everyone's super friendly and the food is great ! Try the Monday night Mac and cheese and happy hour is awesome !! The south west is by my house but recently I went to the one by red rock and the one off the 215 and was happy to say they all rock !"}
{"text":"This bar is very friendly with good energy! Food is good although somewhat slow when it is busy."}
{"text":"My first time here at this bar, really enjoyed the atmosphere along with the mid-shift staff & bartenders!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for bar food.. They stand out in drinks and atmosphere. As most local spots go, they are way above average With a solid menu, great drinks, and a even better wait staff. Pretty reasonably priced items with great game time menu. The biggest standout is friendly atmosphere and awesome wait staff, defiantly a go to local joint to start the evening out right."}
{"text":"Terrible service.   Sat down and waited 10 minutes and nobody came over.  Waitresses standing around talking to other employees!!this place will be out of business soon!"}
{"text":"On my bike ride last Sunday, I stopped at Distill for breakfast based on recommendations from friends.  There was a place to lock the bike outside the front door and it was safe out of view from the plaza's streets.  I've been here when it was a Mexican restaurant and the decorations have changed.  There's a lot of whiskey barrel type furniture with leather/vinyl coverings.  There are also a lot of decorative signs with funny sayings.  The room is quite dark until your eyes get adjusted.  There are a couple of spaces at the bar that have no video poked machines built in and I chose one of these paces.  Lelaine was the bar hop and she was there with my coffee quickly and a menu.  I ordered the Distill breakfast sandwich with sausage, eggs over easy, jack cheese, and English muffin.  You can get the sandwich with other cheeses, eggs cooked the way you want, biscuits or bread, and bacon or ham.  There are lots of choices.  The sandwich was brought with a nice helping of hash browns and my coffee was refilled.  The sandwich was a nice break from the normal omelette I get when I have breakfast out.  I enjoyed my stop here and I'll try it in the evening to have on of their burgers.  Good service and good food."}
{"text":"When first Distilled open it was was great! Good food and service and gaming, but now that its popular the gaming is just terrible!!!"}
{"text":"I like the ham and cheese omelet and the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  The steak and eggs is okay (you get the steak you pay for.)  Decent enough food for the price; I like watching the World Cup at lunch here."}
{"text":"I come here for drinks and a little gambling after work.  Ryan the bartender on graveyard always treats me and friends good.  Aaron the cook makes a good pizza. Service is great and the staff is very friendly.  Also, Britney and Mo are awesome when we come in the afternoon. Always a good vibe in this bar. I like that they have an awesome jukebox and good music available.  TVs all over the place to watch all the games."}
{"text":"Love the mashed potato bites, pretzel bites and chicken tenders.  Great services and unique.  Have a separate family friendly dining area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in vegas! Good atmosphere, good food & good people. See Mike N. at the bar for a cold one, he's the man!!"}
{"text":"Having lived on the Summerlin side of town for a long time to see this actual building rotate though a former life of being many different restaurants/bars over many years, I think there might be a recipe with this new Distill that might make it stick.    Unlike prior restaurants/bars in the same space who really never changed it up so much, the decor and design has changed just so to make it feel and look brand new and that time and consideration was put into this remodel.  It is still built on a round center bar, but they have knocked down enough walls, put up enough brick and done enough design changes to make it feel welcoming and different.    Pretty expansive menu considering it is basically a bar (which includes breakfast 24/7, which I personally found to be a big bonus), what I thought to be reasonably priced and many nooks/spots to sit and hunker down to meet with friends, it seems like a good \"local spot.\"  Often in Vegas, we (or maybe me) look to restaurants/bars that are unique/have an edge/have a niche, when indeed to great solid, basic staple with nice staff, good food and a nice atmosphere.  Although there is nothing earth shattering or noteworthy to say \"this place is awesome\" (although there are pool tables in the back),  I still enjoyed going and will absolutely go back.  As it advertises wanting to be a local hangout, I think they might be on to something and being a local in the Summerlin area, I will go back.    Curious about the smoking policy, for the nice hostess indicated that you could smoke anywhere and I saw only one person smoking who was sitting at the bar.   With people eating everywhere and NV law, not sure the hostess was correct.  I am not a smoker and a \"you can smoke anywhere\" bar would surely be the only thing that would turn me off about this place.  Again, I did not grill the nice hostess any further, although would clarify when I am in there again.    Maybe it is indeed my new local hangout."}
{"text":"Ive been to the one in Summerlin and really dig the layout and patio especially and was/ hoping they did something similar with this location....nope!   Walking from the side door that said restaurant entrance i felt like i was put in time out as everybody was in and around the bar and i had to eat in the glass bubble. I can appreciate this was to separate the smokers from the non but still a little weird layout as it really looked like i was in an aquarium by myself. The service was just ok, a little too much standing around and gossiping for me (should be done out of sight of guests). And the food is similar menu to Summerlin with basic bar food and nothing that really screams.... gotta come back for that except the dessert. Bread pudding ... YES! no raisins...YES the the 3rd power.   Id come back but not that often... id actually drive to Summerlin from SW to have the layout and atmosphere more comfortable then to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Do i like this place? Sure... love it? Not quite.   Ive been here several times mainly for sporting events and the seating they have in front of the tv's as if your watching comfortably at home, but with waitresses bringing you food you dont have to clean up the kitchen after!   The outdoor patio is nice on clear not so hot nights to enjoy the fireplaces and a good dessert and a drink. The interior is not bad either and the servers have always been super helpful and friendly. BUT my main gripe is the food, as its lacking in my opinion.   Had Fish tacos - Flavorless, even with a weird sauce they laid over them.  Sliders - Dried out meat, and just not dressed with anything special. Breakfast burrito w/sausage - The best thing i had which was just okay but nothing to write home about as how can you mess up eggs, and meat in a tortilla. Bread Pudding - YES! Do have especially if you dont like raisins like me.   All in all this place is an okay go to spot in Summerlin for the sporting events, and a bite but i wouldnt come too often as the menu is just kind of bland for me. Points are mainly for the service and outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"Eliot & Jon!           They are both awesome Bartenders. Have the best personalities and always on top of their customers. You get greeted as soon as you walk in the door.       The last time I was here was probably about four months ago. I was here with my girl friend and it took 20 mins to get a greeting and finally took our drink order. Then it took another 20 mins to just get a menu. And they weren't that busy and there was three bartenders and two servers working that night.    But since then I've had a wonderful experience here and will come here more often now!"}
{"text":"We love Distill.  Great place on the family side or in the bar.  Large menu and great brews, service and food.   Try it for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Lovin this place...can't believe I just now found it. Great service, chill vibe, yummy food. 5 bucks for bomb brownie dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is relatively new, though I've been coming in for about 10 months. Every time I've had lunch here I am always greeted w professionalism and courtesy. The food is typical of a bar type place but always fresh, hot and crispy. I recommend the burgers! Pretty generous and always cooked to my preference. There are some pool tables that I've actually used a few times w my friends. Pro sizes and very level. The atmosphere can get a tad Smokey as they smoke at the bar but the ventilation is always in check. The main reason for my 5 star review is because I actually met the chef today. His name is Chef Charles. Super nice guy. Very attentive and considerate. He obviously runs his crew very well. I saw him speak to a few employees w a lot of respect and it's apparent they respect him too. The restrooms are immaculate! This place is a great bar atmosphere if thats what you are into and also a great food place if you like bar food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and so glad they opened one on Durango! Great, fun place to hang out. They do special things like costume parties and ugly sweater parties for the holidays. Those are fun! Mike the bartender is fantastic! Favorite bartender ever hands down. Highly recommend going to see him and they have machines too!"}
{"text":"Got bourbon?  So out for a bite and a drink one night with a few mates we thought we would try Distill. With no real expectations we strolled in to a fairly busy bar. With a brewery style decor that has lounges, table seating, pool tables and a very nice large bar to boot, Distill is great setting for groups or a sit down meal.  Checking in on yelp you'll grab a Distill bar infused Bourbon on the house. The bartender gave me a pretty sweet Coffee infused bourbon with diet coke. I'm gonna say this was pretty nice drop and if you like a little sweet I recommend it.  For dinner we ordered some mash potato bites as an app!!! Order them! They are amazing. For dinner we got the six pack sliders!!! A mix or combo of different sliders. Ruben, cheeseburger and Philly cheese steak. All were pretty tasty.  Id like to give this place 5 stars but maybe because it was full and hard to find a seat I didn't get the full experience. For sure a place to come back to and will be a nice watering hole for a lot of people"}
{"text":"We're giving them 2 stars because we've been here many times before and the food has been very good. However service on the weekends is always lacking. While we realize it is St. Patrick's and it was busy, there is no reason that we should be sitting at a dirty table  (with the prior patrons' drinks, dirty ashtrays, and paid bill) for nearly 15 minutes, with at least 4 separate wait staff (3 girls, 1 guy) walking by without so much as an acknowledgment. We live 5 minutes away, as do a lot of our friends. We will suggest The Lodge at Cactus from here on out. We will not be back."}
{"text":"An outstanding new addition to the Southern Highlands Bar scene. Staff is friendly and courteous and the food is great.   The place is also configured well and you don't feel crammed or worried about having a place to sit.  Pool tables are nice and parking was easy.  We found our new place to hang out."}
{"text":"The chicken lettuce wraps were good, way better than Yard House. The fish and chips were excellent. The batter was crispy and hot, like they should be. There are few places in the NW to eat good food. Keep up the good work and remember good food and service is your livelihood!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my buddies and had a great time! Chicken wings were great and our server Rhea was awesome! Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time during Monday Night Football"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Patrick is one of the best bartenders around and his team is great!"}
{"text":"Love it. I am not a bar person but this is the place to be! Amazing people, the bartenders and the lovely ladies make the experience that much better. I love eating outside. Even in 100 degree weather and some whiskey shots it was still fine in the shade... And I just found out they are getting misters ! Cool . We have gone at all different hours but only the happy hour 3-6  pm or 3-6 am. Both times were cool. And free check in whiskey shots! Psssst. Do not get the coffee infused. I like coffee and I love whiskey but not together. They are slightly new but business in great."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim one night with some friends. The place looked so nice, inside and out. Very spacious inside, and lots of seating. We came around midnight, and seated ourselves in kind of a dead area, so I was concerned that we might be overlooked, or that the server would take a while to get to us, but she was very attentive the whole time. Good pub food. Good portions. They're open 24/7 too.  Food:   Avocado Eggrolls - Not what we expected. The eggrolls were stuffed with a mushy guacamole, rather than avocado slices or chunks. It wasn't very enjoyable biting into a crunchy wrapper and having the filling squish into your mouth. Taste was meh, but the ginger dipping sauce was tasty. Wouldn't order this again.   Biscuits and Gravy - Standard, nothing special. Not great, not horrible. The sausage in the gravy was a nice touch. $3 price point doesn't hurt either.  Potato Nachos - Tasty. Exactly what it sounds like, slices of potato, fried, and topped with the normal nacho ingredients.   Calamari Straws with a Mango Curry Emulsion and Sriracha -My favorite of the bunch. The calamari was soft, and the sauce was interesting; just savory enough and just sweet enough for me. Ask for more on the side, because the drizzle on the plate isn't really enough.   Bread Pudding - Ok, but not great. Nice and buttery,  but too dense.   Overall a good experience, I'd come back some time for the calamari and to try out some other items."}
{"text":"There was some ridiculously high expectations for this place coming in due to a friendly recommendation about an awesome happy hour and great mashed potato bites. After those two items .. nothing else is even worth mentioning. Mediocre soups lacking any kind of seasoning and a dry BLT that left my girlfriends face sadder than the amount of bacon on her sandwich. The worst part of all was the customer service. Our waitress was designated to the restaurant section away from the bar and struggled to manage the few tables that exist in this section. She managed to make us wait 15 minutes prior to greeting us or taking our drink down followed by an additional 15 minutes for delivery. This place was an embarrassing experience to say the least . I wouldn't recommend it unless I was already hammered looking for good bar food to sober up."}
{"text":"Hosted a party at Distill and everyone had a great time. Staff was most attentive, food was well prepared, manager checked on us several times. Outdoor patio was perfect for our party. Decorative and cozy. Several of our guests said they would choose this venue for their next party. Thanks, you helped make our event memorable !"}
{"text":"It's been a few spots prior and this is the best. Good service, great drinks and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now. It's a pleasant change from BJs, which is our usual hangout. Love the covered parking... no burning my hands on the steering wheel when I come out.   Food was pretty good. The fried artichokes are to die for but they were out of them last time we went. The fish and chips were decent and the waiter recommended and bragged about the French Dip, which was also solid-but didn't really stand out. Large drink selection and they have some out of the way beers. Atmosphere is high energy and service has been good. Will be going back and will keep updating on this new place."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since day one!! Unfortunately I'm moving out of centennial hills. The staff here are so attentive and friendly and often go above and beyond for ALL of their guests not just the regular faces that they already know. The experience they create through their hospitality genuine personality and general true neighborhood feel is nothing short of warm welcoming and comfortable . I had the privilege to drink and dine  with Jay and Mikey most often due to my schedule. However Mike N and Corrin and Erin as well as countless service and kitchen stuff I've had the privilege to meet are all wonderful. Weather after a long night and I need to drink to wash away the troubles for a great afternoon watching the game just relaxing!!  Having been in the service industry myself for well over two decades this is a well run machine and I'm sad to leave and I know will be successful and create many many regulars and and become the foundation of this increasingly  growing neighborhood!! Hopefully maybe someday day catch you where the sun rises!!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the mixed reviews we decided to check out Distill for ourselves. Things started out great but quickly went downhill. First off the place is nice with a huge bar area and lots of TV screens. We sat in the restaurant area during happy hour and started with the Mashed Potato bites-and they were great, had a couple of HH beers and wells drinks to go with our food. We all got different sliders with sweet potato fires. One of the fries was very dark and the others which looked freshly made were hot but loaded with salt. The sliders could have been made out of cardboard as we never tasted anything so dry. The chicken cordon blu sliders was a chicken tender topped with the driest ham ever. We could barely eat any of them and decided to take them home to the dog and see if he could choke them down. Our waitress disappeared after we got our food and we sat for at least 10 minutes before we asked another waitress for to-go boxes.  When the bill came it was wrong-our HH drinks were at full price, when she came back with a \"corrected\" bill it had some of the drinks corrected but added another at full price. Not wanting to waste anymore time  waiting for a correct bill,we deducted the overcharge from our bill out of the waitress's tip and left."}
{"text":"cool little spot which I'd like to go more often if it's not for our server who reminded me of Debbie Downer.  holy cow lady put on a smile, at lease fake it or something... you're in the customer service business.  looking at her face made the experience depressing.   the sauce used in the calamari was delicious.  the place is spacious.  Maybe I'll give it one more try. however, if I encounter Debbie Downer again then I'll have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Eliot and John are amazing, Brotha's from anotha motha!!! They were awesome!!!  I am used to the awesome service from Remedy's in Henderson, In which Patrick, Chad, Sean, Ryan are amazing!!! They recommended Distill which is owned by the same company and closer to my home.  That being said, support our local businesses, PT's, \"The evil empire\" is building restaurants on every corner, the McDonald Monopoly effect.  Literally, PT's will go into an establishment and offer the owner 50,000 cash to put their machines in.  In other words, you might not be at a PT's per say, but they have a hidden control, monopoly effect wise.  Golden gaming  owns PT's, and indirectly owns small business owners with their machines in their establishments.  All in all Distill is my home away from home!"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar! Came in time for happy hour and food is decent. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Close by to my house, being a fairly decent spot to eat at, it's definitely fun and have enough tv's and slots to hangout at"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite bar in town. Cold beers and the best breakfast ever good thing they serve it 24/7! Best place for football and Nicole and Rachel were super hott  totally the best service around here Fun atmosphere even during the day. I gotta say this bar is above the rest!"}
{"text":"I love this patio!  I am so happy that it has a bar and restaurant that I want to go to...again and again! We went for happy hour on Saturday afternoon.  We sat in uber comfy leather chairs to watch the England vs. Italy FIFA match. We started with the free shot with our Yelp check in.  The orange cinnamon infused whiskey was smooth and delicious!  Our servers were awesome!  I started with the Distiller's Delight..  It was so refreshing. Danger Will Robinson!  Warning....they go down very easily!   We ordered off the Happy Hour menu.  The yummy fried artichokes were battered served with a mayo based dip.    The bruschettas were toasted and garlicky served with chopped tomato and onion.  The salsa was smokey and delicious.  The chips were heated but a little on the hard side.  I like my chips to be light and flaky, but at 2 bucks, I can't complain!  My server Laney (sp?) suggested a Jameson and Ginger Beer with 3 lemons.  OMG it was delicious!  We will be back!  Update:  We came back for breakfast and were  lucky to get Laney again.  We both got bacon and eggs and shared a short stack.  The coffee was roasty, delicious and refilled frequently. My over easy eggs were perfect.  A side of applewood bacon, crispy hash browns and sourdough toast completed this huge breakfast.  We couldn't touch our supersized pancakes.  We probably will be back for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick drink, however, I recently planned a last minute 10 year high school reunion in the outdoor patio and it was a hit! The General Manager, Tony, made the planning easy and stressfree. On the day of the event, we had personable, friendly servers that paid great attention to detail. The prices are also very reasonable for a group party. I will definitly be planning more events at this location! Thanks again, Tony!"}
{"text":"Love distill food!! Great country fried chicken the best great staff .. Very friendly !!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is like in any other bar, and this one is convenient to my location. I just thought their drinks were too weak and their bar service was too slow last time I was there. I ordered 2 long islands they taste like sweet ice tea. Long islands are usually strong, and I'm not a drinker, usually I'm done after having one. These two were just to weak. Then my friend ordered food from the bar, didn't get it after 30 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"I don't do reviews all the often but this one I just had to. This entire experience was awful! Food quality & service failed miserably. My cheese steak was hard as a rock and my bartender was more concerned with whoever was texting her than taking care of me and my friends. It's a shame because I'm a fan of this bar chain, but sadly I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"if you're a smoker and a sports fan - great place.   If you want service and a place to talk to your date - go elsewhere.   Lots of people, younger set, so if that appeals to you, then press on.   military discount available."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere for a birthday and the hockey playoffs! Brittany was amazing. She was always there when we needed something and had a fun attitude all night!"}
{"text":"The bar is cool. Atmosphere is nice. So glad it isn't smokey! Lots of people and lots of TVs and cool art on the walls. Service & pricing was good, but the food was pretty bad. The Greek fries & filet sliders were ok, but the chicken satay & chicken lettuce wraps were terrible."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great.  Holly is the best server. Always friendly and very attentive. Holly is the reason we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome and a great new spot in centennial hills but I've came during the graveyard shift a few times now and me and my buddies do enjoy country music so we pay for songs through touch tunes but the bartender Jay skips our songs because he doesn't like country. If you're going to have touchtunes in a bar, the bartender should not be skipping songs that people pay for."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday to catch a few games only to find college soccer on three of the main viewing screens. Enticed by the \"All Day Breakfast\" we figured it had to be good since it was being served so frequently. As a regular bruncher, I would say breakfast is sub par at best. Do not order the breakfast burrito or omelette or the \"American\" cheese. This place makes EggWorks look like HoneySalt! Step your breakfast game up, Distill! I shouldn't have to pay for a plate that looks like it came straight out of last night's trash!"}
{"text":"First impression when u walk inside was the bar was pretty and looks like a chill place to hang out. However, there was definitely a lack of service. We walked in and sat ourselves at a table. The bartenders saw us walk in but no one greeted us. We waited for at least 15 minutes until someone went to our table. We went here on a Sunday afternoon so it was pretty dead. We contemplated on leaving to go to another place because no one bothered to check on us.. Not even a quick greeting to tell us that someone would be with us shortly. We ended up staying and ordering food & drinks. The server was not bad, she was polite but the service was very slow.  I ordered a margarita from their speciality cocktail menu.. Probably one of the worst margaritas I've had in while. Overall, the place has potential as the inside looks good. The experience was not so great."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we found Distill!!  We love going to their happy hour...  amazing options at fantastic prices.  One of our favorite dishes is the Greek Fries.  Their staff is always so welcoming and takes great care of us.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I know this is a property of Remedy's, but this location has better food then the Remedy's at 7 Hills. We live in 7Hills and would prefer to drive over to Distill than go to Remedy's.  Not sure, but feel like Distill off Decature really cares to give good  food and Remedy's at 7 Hills figures they have a captive audience so even though food ok, that's just it. Get by. Better than a lot of bar and grills, but get your Distill chefs to teach each others about passion to make it right"}
{"text":"Fan, fan, fan! I'm a FAN! I'm pretty excited this cool little bar has been brought to my hood. Local - this place truly is. It's out of the way to really travel to but allows those in the close vicinities to hang out without having to leave their comfort zone.  I love the vibe of the bar. Awesome decor, TV's everywhere - there are actually four TV's put together to make a huge one! There is a variety of seating - you can sit at the bar, couches, cool armchairs, high tables; booth or row type of seating... so many options! Oh and there is a pool table, in case you don't want to sit at all :) There is also a restaurant, if you're not feeling the bar despite the flexibility.  Food and drinks are awesome. I really enjoyed the senorita, strong and goes down easy. So much so that I had three when I only planed to have one... isn't that always the plan? I find the wings and fries here to be spectacular! Definitely in my top 3 favorite wings in Vegas. How amazing is it to have it close to my house?!?! The calamari, pretzel bites, fried mozzarella, and seared ahi tune were all great as well. The mozzarella comes in half moons rather than sticks. Really yummy! I haven't tried their burgers yet but that is on the list. Their breakfast looks good as well, going to try that as well at some point :) I can't be happier about Distill coming to the neighborhood. The vibe, the options in the experience you can have, and the quality of the food make it a great asset to the community."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas, we found ourselves looking for a local place (Summerlin) to have dinner. We ended up across from the Red Rock at Distill. We seated ourselves on the patio to enjoy the sunshine. We were welcomed quickly by Erin and got our drinks in a flash.  We decided to order appetizers and settled on the mashed potato balls and homemade poppers.  The manager brought them out and introduced himself.  Bar food but really, really good!!! (try the poppers) We then ordered another round and a six pack of assorted sliders. They, like the appetizers were served diligently, quality ingredients, and tasted amazing. A free whiskey shot and full belly later, we  again spoke with Tony the manager and  although we are not \"local\", were made to feel extremely welcome.  We felt these people really care about the customer.  During our next  trip to the Red Rock, we will visit Distill again."}
{"text":"Wow this place has really degraded in service and quality. From what used to have a full house hardly had anyone in it. Drinks taste very weak and watered down. Asked server to make sure they are putting vodka in the drink I ordered and she charges me for for two drinks when I got one and claims I asked for extra vodka. The food is now very bland. Ordered pretzel bites and they were extremely greasy and very undercooked. The cheese sauce they come with was lukewarm and already thickening upon receiving them. They used to be cooked perfectly. Used to come here quite often but that will come to an end unfortunately."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this sports is great. Really love the fact that it's full of locals and not tourists. If you're looking for a place to watch the game, have some brews, and eat some good bar food THIS is the place. Jack the prep cook was real cool and add our experience really enjoyable!   Thumbs up to this place and Jack!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I will definitely recommend this place to others! The jalapeño popper burger was cooked perfectly and all the appetizers, we ordered almost all of them, were all good. Don't miss happy hour!"}
{"text":"Came here on a packed Friday night with a group of 8 for dinner. We all shared two types of apps (avocado egg rolls and mashed potato bites) and for an entree I had the Seared Ahi Salad. It was delicious. Wasabi dressing was refreshing, just the right amount of tuna, crispy won tons, savory warm roasted red peppers and cucumbers. AJ was our server and she visited our table numerous times to make sure our food was good or if we needed a drink refill. I definitely recommend this establishment and will return!"}
{"text":"Nicole is the best bartender seriously every time we come in she's so sweet and nice this is our spot thanks Nicole"}
{"text":"Premiere atmosphere and patio dining at its best. Exceptional prices at about $15-$20 PPA. Prompt service!! 3AM to 7AM HAPPY HOUR!!!"}
{"text":"Slowest food service you can imagine. 40 minutes for a salad. No manager or ticket expeditor directing the kitchen. And no one seems to really care. Fried items come out faster because according to our server \"it takes less prep time to fry stuff\". There is no manager on duty. No one helping. No one caring. Customers in the restaurant area have waited longer than we did and just gave up and left. Food is delicious though, unfortunately the service ruined our entire night."}
{"text":"So my husband and I went here for the first time late at night and we loved up. The decor is  pretty cool and the place was packed. We sat at a table across from the bar, and our waitress was really good. Very attentive and made great recommendations. I had the white and red sangria, I preferred the white. Overall our first experience was good and would go there again. For a local bar off the strip it was a good time."}
{"text":"Man this place is amazing a nice little dive bar and the food is amazing I had the PC nuggets and the steak and eggs and they were amazing the service was great Billy is the best me and my family went twice back to back nights in Vegas it was so good thanks Billy for the amazing time"}
{"text":"Wow ! Do I love this place ! The best bar staff in all the city, no wonder Distill crushes all the competition. Whatever they do here as far as bartenders; it works ! The food is also fantastic and this place is like family. I love my Sunday football crew Nicole and Sean shout out to my little duo ! For sure the best bar around, thanks Distill for being my version of \"Cheers\"!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for food in So Highlands BUT.... What happened within the last two months?  The food has always been delicious.  I eat here often.   Now, the food is always overlooked.  Pancakes, always dry and burnt. Ordered pancakes at least five times in the past, and always so bad.  Last hamburger bun, burnt.  Meat so over cooked and dry.  Beef tenderloin skewers, so overcooked and dry, couldn't even bite into them. In the garbage they went.  Avocado eggrolls used to be big and nice presentation.  So yummy! Again, overlooked and smaller.  Fruit bowl was slimmy. I hate writing this but come on, please have the kitchen step it up like it used to be!    What happened lately?  Also, bartenders, acknowledge a customer when they stand at the bar. I know you're busy, but at least say I'll be right with you.  And don't keep having a conversation with other customers talking about the weather, etc, when you have customers waiting.  Bad customer service!   Waitresses in dinning area are great! If the above was fixed, I'd give this place ten stars!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazingly tasty burger.   All the dishes are well served.  This is a great place to come and watch tv or hang out and get a drink.  The food is not fancy and its a bar atmosphere (no kids).  The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My friends and i get off late so when we want to go eat after its hard to find a good place open late and i've passes by distill a lot so we decided to give it a try and i gotta say i'm glad we did. The food was good, loved the atmosphere, nice place to just relax and kick it with friends. Gotta come back soon."}
{"text":"A huge fan of this place.  It's a great local bar with a cozy atomosphere and awesome bartenders. I come here with friends quite frequently to enjoy a few beers, play video poker, and share some pretzel bites (you have to try, they are the most addicting little nuggets - they come with the cheesiest cheese and a horseradish honey mustard). Distill is also a good spot to watch games, although it can get pretty packed like most bars.   Patrick and Mo are two of the bartenders we see a lot and they are great! Quick and readily available if we need anything. They engage with us too which always adds to our positive experiences here and are also why we enjoy coming back.   Would definitely recommend checking out Distill if you want to grab drinks and appetizers, bar food, or even dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Where is the \"10 star\" option? We LOVE Distill! The food is absolutely fantastic. Every time we go here, we leave raving about the incredible food. Tacos, steaks, beef tips with mashed potatoes, salads, soup, I have never had anything at Distill that wasn't incredible. The presentation of the dishes is beautiful and food delivery is very fast as well. Each person that we have recommended has loved the restaurant, and I'm sure that you will as well!"}
{"text":"1 star because there is no opportunity to give zero. I called 2 times and both times I was told that I would get a call back shortly. That did not happen.  I was trying to set up a going away party for my manager but they never responded to accommodate us. On the first call I was told that I would receive a call back shortly with confirmation,  that was at noon. 4 hours later I had not heard back so I called again. The hostess insisted that she was not trying to ignore me but that she was waiting for a manager to approve our party. It is now 11pm, still no call. I called back for the third time and yet again I am told there is no manager. The guy on the phone ended the call by saying \"either I can take a message or I can't help you\". For a new bar trying to receive the respect of the local community it just lost 30+ potential customers who had no idea it even existed and sadly work across the street. So much for supporting local."}
{"text":"Ryan is a awesome bartender... he welcomed me and my roomie to this side of town always looking forward to drinking his tasty shots it's been a long time... he also introduced us to the awesome menu.... sweet potatoe fries are addictive with the special dipping sauce... still waiting for a hangover to try the hangover burger... its cozy not that big but $1 pool some comfy lounge chairs... I never hit on the Machines at the bar..."}
{"text":"Wow what a awesome place. The vibe is chill and the food is 10 out of 5 stars. Mikey did a great job of setting us up with drinks, food and a comfy table on the patio. I highly recommend the seared ahi and the pot roast spring rolls!"}
{"text":"I'm confused...why does it say Italian, breakfast-brunch? The staff and bartenders were awesome!! Their food however, wasn't. You could tell the pretzel bites were frozen and heated in a microwave. My boyfriend ordered the brisket which was very dry. He took 3 bites out of it and had to send it back, even though it was smothered in grease and bbq sauce. The waitress was kind enough to offer anything else in place of the brisket, and they kindly took it off the bill. The drinks are over priced for a \"local bar\" $10 for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Was here last night for a Family Soft Opening. This used to be Carmine's but was gutted and looks great. Plenty of TVs to watch the game.   The food and drink selection was excellent. The \"Mad Mule\" was a great cocktail. Food was excellent, very large portions. I enjoyed the Chicken Salad and it was delicious.   I have high expectations for this bar. Hopefully becomes the new local spot!"}
{"text":"Has the potential to be awesome, but unfortunately extremely disappointing.  Bartenders were awful, not nice, and had no idea what they were doing. Medium rare burger came out well done, with cold fries. It wasn't even busy in there and the whole staff looked flustered. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"this place has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, delish food and it doesnt matter day or night you get the same great service"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to do brunch for weeks now at Distill, I don't even live close and drove over specifically for the brunch. Now I will say, it's the NFC/AFC championship game day so the bar is jam packed however, they have a \"lounge\" area with open seating BUT you have to have a party of 8 to sit up there. So essentially they would rather turn away business because I don't have a group they can auto-grat! My boyfriend and I went elsewhere and ordered up!  Very disappointing for one of my favorite bars."}
{"text":"Can get packed on the usual nights. Delicious drinks. Separate restaurant is also great. Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the meal I had on my recent visit. I have come to accept that this establishment is best left for drinks and fried bar food appetizers (French fries, wings, etc..) Entrees...not so much!! I ordered the steak with demi-glaze that came with a medley of roasted potatoes (red, purple & sweet potatoes) and grilled asparagus. I ordered the steak medium rare & it came medium. I had to send it back. The second steak came back a true medium rare. The steak was \"tough\" though...like from it being frozen too long & then defrosted days prior to cooking. It did not have that \"fresh meat\" taste. The demi-glaze was a little too salty & the asparagus looked & tasted like they had been frozen & not fresh prior to cooking as well. I was disappointed. On the bright side: the potato medley was good as well as the side Caesar salad. Stick with the traditional bar foods & skip the entrees. Also, stay away from the ahi tuna...does not taste fresh & has a metallic fishy aftertaste. I have ordered it twice & experienced the same problem."}
{"text":"The food is so good, it's BETTER than bar food. I'd come here for a regular meal. There is a fun bar side and a chill dining area that is separate but not too separate, you still get a little of the vibe from the bar. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, the drinks are great, and the food is amazing. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Distill could easily be a 4 star place for me. Everything here is great, except most of the servers. I feel the servers have not been properly trained. They'll wait a long time to take my order so they can order my food and drink at the same time. Or bring my food before drinks. Or not offer water before taking my order. The place would be great if they had their wait staff properly trained. Which is really a problem with management. Servers please read the proper process: greet your customers and offer them water, then come back and take their drink order, then come take their food order, then come back and check that things came out correctly and that your customer needs nothing else. It's called \"customer service\", and it means exactly what it is called. I'd love to see service improved , so I can change my rating."}
{"text":"This place has a very cool and modern vibe! The staff is friendly and fast! The food is always amazing, and the service is exceptional! The bartenders are great, pouring up some the the best signature and classic drinks in town, and it also helps they are all pretty easy on the eyes! Who doesn't love some eye candy while enjoying a nice cold one? Mike is our favorite...best bartender around and this place hit the jackpot adding him to their team!! Awesome atmosphere, great people, great food, and great drinks...what more could you ask for?? If you haven't been, you are truly missing out!!"}
{"text":"not sure what I'm missing but 2 visits so far and not impressed! I was there the first weekend and service was awful. food was so so but i found it and cocktails pricy.But its new and was very crowded. i understand. Tried again last nite and not much better! service was better but not very friendly. this was noticed by all 4 of us there for dinner. Again not impressed with food and drinks are pricy for what tbis place is! glad to pay but make it worth it. i live very close and was excited to have it in our area. i will try again because i want it to be good and its close. i will review again."}
{"text":"Thank you Mikey! Our server was so attentive and cared for our visit. My friend dropped a drink on accident and he could have easily refused to bring us another but it was still full and because the tables in the patio is so flimsy he was kind enough to remake it. I will be back in no time simply because of his service. We also ordered a chicken quesdilla and the chicken nachos. As well as a breakfast shot he recommended. Totally delicious if you don't want to taste the after taste.! Taste just like pancakes."}
{"text":"Amazing Happy Hour Specials 3 to 7 p.m with very friendly service! Love that the restaurant is separate from the bar.  Got to watch the Olympics on their big screen TVs as well as the numerous TVs you can see in the bar area... Great neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"We've been to distill multiple times and it's a great bar. Nothing super special until tonight. We had the most amazing service from Sara. She was super attentive and friendly and was right on top of filling our drinks when they were out. And it was busy so that's a plus in my book. I just appreciate amazing service and that's exactly what Sara gave us tonight."}
{"text":"I had ordered a veggie burger, fries and a salad for delivery from Distill. I have NEVER gotten such bad food poisoning from vegetarian food. Now how that's even possible is beyond me (someone isn't washing their hands who's preparing the food or not washing the vegetables properly). 2 hours after eating this, I became VERY SICK and began puking. Classic food poisoning. Generally this is my favorite veggie burger, but I usually go to the summerlin location to get it....this was my first time having it delivered and it came from this location. Again, when food poisoning comes from vegetables there's a clear lack of washing.....gross. WASH YOUR HANDS AND WASH YOUR VEGETABLES! What restaurant gives customers food poisoning from vegetarian food?! Disgusting, I can't even imagine what the meat products do. In fact, maybe management should check out that entire kitchen or the health department because again FOOD POISONING FROM VEGETABLES ISNT NORMAL. Avoid this location unless you want to be sick."}
{"text":"Great service, great happy hour. 4_7 am and pm daily. I suggest the tacos. Bomb. Try the Eddie vodka or one of many craft beers. Fun slightly zany mixed crowd. Keeps it interesting. Pool tables, board games and of course gambling at bar, sports on the televisions.  Stop in for awhile. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is amazing the bartenders  are great and I love that you can play the jukebox from your seat.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nichole is very nice and a great bartender always friendly with A great smile and accomodating.She always knows all of our drinks and is great conversation and helpful.She always recommends great food to eat and is prompt and attentive.This is A busy place and she pays attention to everyones needs.The food at Distill is always delicious and the gaming is great.This is a great place to watch A game or have dinner or just relax after A long day at work."}
{"text":"Walked out after being given menus then not having any service after 15 minutes waitress with short blonde hair look at us three times turned and walked away. Horrible Horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on Monday night football. It wasn't that busy, but the volume was so loud, you couldn't speak to the person next to you. We ordered several items off the happy hour menu. Without listing everything, nothing on the menu was good. I'm not even going back to give it a second chance....."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I went for happy hour, a ladies night out and we had a blast. We stayed at the bar and had appetizers and cocktails, enjoying the awesome company. Our bartender (Jeff, Joe, Bob, we decided to play a guessing game with his name and ended up giving him a new one) was absolutely amazing. Seriously, he put up with us and did it all with a smile. =)"}
{"text":"Solid choice. Good food. Great people. Ask for Brittany. The absolute best. She is the sweetest, most tolerant (of my juvenile crew) server I've encountered in some time. Good westside choice, cool patio."}
{"text":"Came here with my dear and beautiful wife, we live close by and found this place by accident....  We walked in and we were shocked, great music comfortable chairs great environment!!!! This will definitely be my local (home bar) great service and chill place!!! Kaila was our server and she was very  friendly and nice Will come again on my next date, with the same lady....  prices are not bad at all"}
{"text":"Amazing bar! I come down here just for the service and amazing food....my server Marnie gave me the most amazing service and I will be back.  Had the French dip with the most amazing au jus. Best sandwich I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I've lived in Southern Highlands for years now, and I've never gotten a chance to go to this bar until now. It was simply superb! For a Thursday night, the place was pretty filled and busy, but not uncomfortably so. We sat down in the couch areas and almost immediately got service. The drinks were reasonably priced ($9 for grey goose/red bull & $7 for shots of patron) and the ambiance was great.  The most amazing part was our server, Chanel. She was absolutely amazing. She was fast with our drinks, as came to check on us every 20 minutes or so to ensure we didn't need anything else. She deserves a raise! The manager Elliot was also very nice after we spoke to him to let him know how amazing Chanel was.  We also had the mashed potato bites based off of Chanel's recommendation, and they were delicious. We will definitely  be coming back again. A must if you live in the area."}
{"text":"I was in the area and never been to distill before.. I pulled up yelp and saw they had some pretty good reviews so decided to try it out. I ordered the Cure burger, asked for med-rare.. server stated that since there was pork in the meat it had to be a minimum med-well but would come out tasting like med-rare. I took her word for it. It came out beyond well done and all I could taste was the black char on the meat. She came over to see how everything was, took back the burger and I ordered avocado egg rolls in its place. I love avocado but this plate was disappointing as well! Absolutely no flavor! It comes with 4 pieces and and I still had 2 left on my plate when the server came over and cleared the table. I looked to my hubby and said well I guess I was done.   I am not one to complain but this place was a joke. The setting has a nice vibe to it but the service and food sucks."}
{"text":"Came here around 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night. It was pretty full for a weekday. Then again, that was my first visit so I'm not sure if they get more packed than that lol. My friend got seats right by a tv for us.   It was a little weird because I didn't know if we were supposed to order at the bar or not since I couldn't tell if there were any workers actually waiting on tables. It took a little while for her to get to our table, but she eventually got there. Their menu is pretty big, plenty of things to choose from! I never crave burgers... ever. But I glanced at that part of the menu and was suddenly craving lol. I opted for the western bacon burger (or something like that) with sweet potato fries. & my friend ordered a (chicken?) quesadilla. We also got a couple or Jameson & ginger ales. Honestly, the burger was goooood & so were the fries. The burger was a little too drenched with bbq sauce but still very tasty! I'll probably get it with bbq sauce on the side next time or just tell em light. The fries were perfectly crispy.   Service promptness was okay but very friendly! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"the new burnt end sliders are incredible. very happy Mike suggested that and the bread pudding for my girl and i when we came in after some thur night football."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere waitresses were very pleasant I will be going back there soon and that bread pudding  the people had next to us looked awesome."}
{"text":"MNF Review- I'm here more often then not for MNF for the last two years. I've noticed on more than a few occasions that the bar staff gives the giveaways/raffles to their friends then to actually draw and announce the winners. It's kind of disheartening to see this and is happening more frequently now then last year. Let's keep it fair for all your patrons that come and spend money at your bar. Just happened again tonight at the Broncos/Texans game. Never heard one announcement by your female or male bartender."}
{"text":"The drinks were a bit small & watered down for the price but the burger I had was pretty good!  Upon the recommendation of other yelpers, we also got the potato appetizer.  VERY good.  A friend also ordered the fried mozzarella & that was also tasty.  The waitress we had was friendly & was quite attentive in the beginning but as time went on, we had a hard time finding her & she forgot a few drinks people had ordered.  I will say that I was super impressed that with our large party, they had no problems with splitting the check up.  A lot of places scoff at you for asking but they were great about it.  We'll go back if we're invited but I can't see us going there purposefully without someone requesting it or a fantastic special of some type."}
{"text":"Great place!  Friends and I started coming here at the beginning if the football season   We've been coming for most Monday and Thursday nights to watch the games and take advantage of specials during the game..... 100 ounce tower of beer for $12!   You can't beat that..... Not to mention the awesome food..... Regular menu is great too...... Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Lack of consistency on food quality. Ordered a chicken sandwich and ended up with half a sandwich, soggy breading, and rubbery chicken. Day shift bartenders are always pleasant, can't say the same for night shift."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation on a recent trip to Vegas. Relaxed atmosphere the food was delicious, great beer selection. Our server Mykee was very welcoming and went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a good bar at any other time than Saturday night at 1155. Went there with some friends. Took a long time to get first beers. Ordered food. Ordered Nachos 5 sec after my friend did. They came out 15 min apart. Then my Nachos were noticeably smaller even after friends have been eating the other Nachos. No portion control or consistency. I ordered a beer with my Nachos but it seemed like the bartender didn't want to pour it, cuz he took forever to do so. The bartender acted like he didn't want to serve us and focus on his friends at the end of the bar. Idk but for the first time here wasn't that great. It wasn't even that busy. I was surprised for a Saturday night. All in all not worth it unless you live next door to one and can walk."}
{"text":"We came into Distill and there were already food and drink menus on the table. It was around 1am and not busy at all so we began flipping through the menus. We waited for service and different waitresses kept walking by us making eye contact but no one took our order or approached us for drinks. We waited 30 mins and people kept coming in after us and getting served before us as the waitresses kept walking by. After being ignored for half an hour we walked out. Terrible service and will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Never coming back. Our first time here, we sat down shortly after midnight at the bar. The bartender instantly had a shitty attitude and was unpleasant to deal with. Upon getting our food, we were never approached by the bartender again.   Our friend joined us later on and sat down. Another bartender came up and asked our friend for ID and then looked at us and asked us again. (we had been eating and drinking for an hour already at this bar).   Our friend was able to get one drink from that bartender, then never saw him again. After 25 mins of us waiting to order another drink, and our friend waiting 15 mins to find the bartender to order food, we had enough and had to yell across the bar to get our check. The bartender apologized for the wait and never offered us anything else after.   The food was alright, but the service sucked. We work hard for our money, and expect great service when we spend it. This place will not be on our list again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service and ambience was perfect. Even though it was busy (it opened just opened 2 weeks ago) our server, Tammy was very attentive to what we needed and was very friendly. I even got a rose for Valentine's Day. Very diverse range of music that my boyfriend and I love. We definitely can't wait to come back and this will become a new regular bar for us."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  Tianna was awesome  Food is very good.  New menu I was told.  The Manager was visiting every person at the bar.  I will return next time in town"}
{"text":"This bar has really great food, but the service is more or less the same unless you sit in Brittany's section.  She is very friendly, knows her menu, and never makes you feel rushed even though I am pretty sure we go in right when she is near getting off.  Ask for her!"}
{"text":"Best local bar in town. Our graveyard bartender Scotty was awesome. Never had an empty drink always on top of it even with a busy bar. The food and atmosphere of the place was also great definitely gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"This Distill location is my favorite one by far! The food is awesome and always cooked to  perfection. The staff is beyond friendly, helpful and professional! They make the 35 minute drive worth it! The decor is fun and pleasing to the eye. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a great evening with friend's and loved ones. BIG PLUS is the super cold beer mugs, the beer tastes so much better in them!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. It's in line with average bar food. I got the French dip, it was average (nothing special about it) but it was good. The service was very good, the waitress was very attentive. The best part of this place is the cool outdoor patio with misters."}
{"text":"Short pour heaven!!! If you're looking for super expensive short pours this is the place! Wow Martinis half full shots half full even the glass changed every drink smaller and smaller. Ran out of makers mark. Chatted with manager he brought us one new drink and waitress walked away as soon as we mentioned the glass change short pour. I'm a local wish I loved this place but it sucks. I'll never be back here again! Super sucks I hoped to like it. It's my 3rd time haven't been impressed once. BJs is way better so is islands go there instead!"}
{"text":"This was our first time the food and services was outstanding a new spot for us near our home. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Smoking? Really. I guess a way to get around what the voters voted for is to post a sign saying 21 and over. I asked the mgr why they allowed it and he had no answer. But he did say they have a great ventilation system. But we still smelled smoke. It's too bad, it has good food but I'm not asking for a side of cancer."}
{"text":"Best local bar . Ordered chicken wings to go with Elliott. Great customer service provided. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is awesome here. Cheap drinks and food. Service was friendly. The place inside is dark and cool..but relaxing. Will definitely return to Distill again. A+"}
{"text":"Four stars because of the service.   Ambiance is nice. Fun place to watch the game. Teresa, our bartender, was great. The staff was always attending to us and smiling. Such a welcoming feeling, especially been coming to the area for a year now.   We tried the wings, I wasn't disappointed. I also didn't have expectations. We will be back to try other food on the menu. Great addition to the neighborhood. We might have to say bye to the local hang out BWW.  Also it was a plus to meet locals in the neighborhood. Home away from home in Cali."}
{"text":"On a whim we decided to try it out. We'd seen it and kept saying we wanted to try it. When we can in it took a bit for someone to realize we were there. But ok. It's a Sunday we get it. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer. The appetizers took quite a while to get out the cheese triangles were good but not great. Once our meals came out my hashbrowns were hard and tasted old, the bacon was also really hard and over cooked and eggs were room temperature more than half of my meal went back. The sandwich my husband got was dry. I can't comment on my teen boys food because I'm not sure they tasted it.. There was one waitress who seemed disinterested in us and took quite a while to check on us. Refills took quite a bit. I thought that was odd because the place was not busy and she was very talkative the table of men behind us. Either way I feel like I paid way too much for the quality of the food and slow service. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I only come for breakfasts on the weekend. I like to take my little girl out and we rotate between here, Rise and Shine, and The Lodge.   Breakfast service is good. It is typically very slow so it's easy to get attentive service. At bars I typically get bacon and eggs. At Distill that also includes hash browns and toast. They are both fine. I believe the hash is probably frozen, but it is still tasty. There is no kids breakfast on kids menu so order one egg and bacon side a la cart for my 4 year old. Works out well for us as hash and toast is a lot of starch and we can split that easily enough.   Coffee has always been good. I take it with two creams so have to remember to remind server to bring more cream with refill (they consistently bring 3 with first cup).   Only real complaint - Door faces east and metal handle is not covered. Really?! It's Vegas that metal gets hot. Cover it for goodness sake.   Bottom line I'll keep coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"The one star is because that's the absolute minimum I can give. Sat at the bar near the POS for fifteen minutes, watching other guests who arrived after me receive immediate service. Finally was able to place an order, which the bartender Chris got wrong when he was repeating it back to me. He forgot to bring my girlfriend's drink, and we waited an eternity for the bill. I can't stress enough how angry I am to receive such dismal service. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Ordered something simple a patty melt! Dried out bread over cooked patty and 14 French fries, My guest ordered fish n chips all breading and few fries ( must be shortage if potatoes ) never go again over priced crap"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot; great food and awesome service.  We've been there several times and its always been great.  Our server twice has been Nicole, she is amazing.  On point with recommendations and courteous service.  The Bar staff is friendly and outgoing - Mike, Yvette, Dean are wonderful. Food wise, the Fish Tacos are the best I've ever had, the Black & Blue burger was delicious and the sweet potato fries are yummy.  Being from PA my husband is very picky about his cheesesteaks, theirs lit up his tastebuds.  Looking forward to trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"What a dump. Caught the server runner and what looked like the cooks all smoking weed out back!!  No wonder the service sucked!!  Also found out the manager was the bartender on shift. Lol 3 of his employees were smoking weed together out back on his watch!"}
{"text":"The wife & I went for lunch in the restaurant half on Friday.  The service here was very good, the waitress was friendly, prompt and professional.  The food was ok, but nothing special.  The seared ahi was obviously frozen, but passable and the tenderloin tips were good.  They lost another star for something I hate; they brought out all the food at almost the same time.  We literally had the apps, our salads and main courses on the table at the same time.  I realize this is primarily a bar, but the courses should be spaced out a little at least.  When the customer has to try to rush through an appetizer and salad to keep the main course from getting cold, it is not ok."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. Gave it a try a few times thinking maybe the barter that his name starts with a J... was having a off day but he was consistently so rude! One time I heard him speaking bad about some of the clientele that come in. It was so awful I had to walk out. Never will come back and I definitely spend a lot of money on the machines. Not a good asset to the company at all! He needs to go!!"}
{"text":"The bartenders here are just down right unfriendly. We are locals. Most of us in the business. Lighten the hell up. I've tried three or so times and I have given up. I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came in recently and encountered an amazing bartender and server. I'm a gambler and have been to many bars around Vegas and i have to say that Mike and Brittany are absolutely amazing! Mike is so attentive. When my drink is half way, he appears with another drink without me having to ask. They're are few bartenders that I'm truly impressed with and i have to that he's the whole package. Great conversation, menu knowledgeable, accommodating, and extremely friendly. I'll will definitely be bringing all my gaming friends here on his shifts.  Special shout out to Brittany. She is a great conversation and brings my food to me with an amazing smile and warmth each time."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to come. I've never been to Vegas, staying with a local and she brought me here. The vibe is awesome and the food is great. Brittany is by far the best server I've come across in a long time. She was on top of everything along with her bubbly personality and super sweet. What a great experience. Thank you Brittany!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Had the potato nachos and the calzone. However the waitress was pretty bitchy. The nachos are listed as an appetizer. When she brought the calzone I mentioned we never got the nachos. She said they were in the window and oh, did I want those before?    Anyway, good food but bad service and not a lot of liquor options considering it's called Distill."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local bar.  Open 24 hours a day, it's the perfect spot to grab a late night drink either at the bar or outside on the patio.  Every time we've been the service has been excellent: friendly, knowledgeable and fast.  Foods delicious; we love the sweet potato fries, chicken nachos, tacos and calamari.  There's a pool table, Juke Box and obviously gambling machines at the bar so there's really something for everyone plus a ton of parking."}
{"text":"Good food, service and friendly staffs. Can't wait to try other items on the menu.  Nachos and cheeseburger sliders are exceptionally tasty and reasonably price.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this to be a great place to go after work.  The food was disappointing to outright bad.  The free coffee infused whiskey shot on Yelp is disgusting, they can keep it.   On the plus side, people there and the bartender were great fun!  Maybe I'll try something else when I eat there."}
{"text":"I went there tonight to meet with friends.  The service and food was worth a five star rating.  However, smoking is allowed inside at the bar as well as outside.  There is no separate room for smoking so even though we were sitting quite a distance away from the bar I could still smell the smoke enough to make it my last visit.  I'm not sure how they get away with allowing smoking in a restaurant as there are laws in NV regarding the topic.  Food and service get five stars.  Smoking allowed inside the restaurant gets a 0.  Limit smoking to outside on the patio and I would be back."}
{"text":"Brittany was the best server!! We never waited for anything and had the best personality. The only reason I'll be coming back is her service. Raise coming soon?!!! Hope so...   Also food was great and drinks... but service matters more to me so yay Brittany!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy drinks and play boardgames with friends! Drinks are fair priced and the atmosphere is chill."}
{"text":"Owners attention required  Saturday night around 7:25pm New to this area and with the choices on Durango always super busy, I thought this place off the main traffic will be welcoming and friendly. I was so very wrong, we sat down at end of the bar, observing the older female bartender talk to a couple for a while, no problem we like talkative bartenders, after that chat she pass by us 4 times, never eye contact, never a greeting, and she start to take care of other costumers and orders.  Wow!! Super wow, nice place, looks like a good menu but sadly we will never know because your bartender is rude and ignores costumers"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. From the outside the bar looks pretty cool with a lot of signage. Inside was pretty busy and we found a table near the bar. We were greeted immediately and asked if we knew what we wanted, however we just sat at the table so wanted to look at their menu. Server came back and I ordered an Redd's Apple with Fireball shot (25 oz) and my boyfriend ordered a beer. Another server or manager came over and checked on us. She was very friendly. We also ordered the medium chicken fingers with sweet potato fries. It was pretty good & yummy. I enjoyed my beer. It was recommended by a friend. The cinnamon from the fireball shot kind of made my Apple cider taste a \"little\" like Apple pie.   Anyway, we received great service. They were very attentive and friendly. Also chatted with us. Plus the food came pretty quick. So that was good because I wanted to eat while I drank.   The atmosphere was cool. Not smokey in there at all or anything & had nice decor and lighting. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves there. I think there was also a birthday party going on in the lounge area. They also have pool tables & gaming machines in there."}
{"text":"The woman who took our to-go order this morning, was just lovely!! She was so sweet and kind. Our order was perfect when we opened it up. She included everything that we needed and more. I wish that I remembered her name.  Found out her name today. \"Erin\". She's so awesome that she included Cholula in the order because she remembered that we asked for it yesterday!! You rarely see such awesomeness nowadays. Erin, you are #1 in our book!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Went there for breakfast. They have a good selection of breakfast items.  My husband got the steak and eggs. Steak was scrumptious! I had bacon and eggs, which were ok. I think they used powdered eggs which is why I say the breakfast was just ok. On the plus side, the service was great! Plus the bar has lots of tv and seating. Look forward to watching football games there in the fall, or trying out the pool tables. I'm definitely going back to try out lunch and/or dinner and their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because Kelly rocks! I was staying at the hotel across the street and was just going to stop in for 1 drink before we headed out for the night and we ended up staying pretty much all night because Kelly  was so awesome. She's so funny and friendly and cute ;) anytime we come to Vegas we will be making a stop in for drinks just to see her."}
{"text":"First time at Distill.  We ordered off the happy hour menu.  We were not disappointed!  Decided on the Mashed Potato Bites, which we never had before, and they were amazing!!  Came with ranch and another dipping sauce with chipotle base (I'm guessing).  Also, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla which was blissfully delicious!  The combination of flavors included a little spice , pico de Gallo, cheeses some herbs and a whole lot of taste! I will frequent the place and enjoy the ambiance of a locals bar, friendly welcome of the bartender Elliot, and the quality of good food at great happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Poor service and worst food.  Very slow servers and hate to call them real bartenders. Worst bar experience ever."}
{"text":"I just love this new spot. Sara & D are amazing servers, request them when you go in. They'll take good care of you! Chicken nachos, mini sliders, bruschetta, mash potato bites have been tasty enough for my boyfriend & I to return multiple times now. Great happy hour! Pool tables & a pretty patio.. :)"}
{"text":"Come and check out Distill in Southern Highlands. The food is wonderful the drinks are great! The bartender Chelsi couldn't be any sweeter!! She is always a joy to be around!"}
{"text":"Definitely a noticeable improvement on staff since the management changes and since Marissa took over as GM.  The Marissa/Carin team is doing a fantastic job.  The bar is back to normal again, just like when it first opened.  Always welcoming and great drinks, food and service.  Hope to see it continue!"}
{"text":"We had the buffalo wings and a Philly cheesesteak. The buffalo wings were by far the best I've ever had! And that's saying a lot! The prices were inexpensive and there is a ton of meat on the wings."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here tonight for a girls night. The bar was pretty full. Which is to be expected on a Friday night. So we went over to the restaurant side and sat down. The food was good but our waitress was horrible!!!! It took her forever to come to us and get our order and she seemed so annoyed by our presence. She never came back to check on us after we got our food. Didn't ask if we wanted another beer or a refill on the water we also had. Both our beers and waters were empty for a long time then she just walked by and put the bill on the table and kept waking! We both took that as she was ready for us to go. We had planned on hanging out and having another beer and maybe going to play pool. But at this point we were just over it. So we put our card in to pay the bill, it took her another 10 to 15 mins to come back to run our cards! This is some of the worst service I have ever had. I will not be back! There so many other bars in the area that our so much more welcoming."}
{"text":"5 stars for Brittany, our server! Brittany, I can write poetry to you, girl!   She's beyond amazing! We had a difficult group, and by difficult I mean the kind of guest that would ruin your day! The kind no one wants to serve. I had to personally pull her aside to apologize for everyone's behavior! She did not break! What a trooper! Her attitude remained positive from beginning to end! She had to deal with ALOT and she never broke her uplifting positive facade! I'm just obsessed with her and her immaculate service!!  We come back months later, and she still remembered us and welcomed us into her section with open arms and a wide happy smile! She's my favorite type of server! Just overall wonderful! And her attention to detail is top quality!! Her attitude towards her job and towards everyone else both happy and difficult, stays the same! She gives her best service to everyone! That's a tough quality to find in a person! She just doesn't break! She's smiling, happy, positive, and genuine from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out! Always polite, responsive, quick, and on top of everything! She stays ahead at all times!   We only come back to say hi to her and sit in her section because she's THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"I love the food, love the drinks, and love the bartenders.  It's not cheap, but it's not strip pricing either."}
{"text":"I've heard good things so we decided to do dinner here with a friend.   I dig the laidback vibe and decor, I love the quirky patio space! It was a bit hot this day so we stayed indoors. Just note this is a bar and is a smoking establishment but it was not smoky when we went. I will probably try to smoke a cigar on the patio one of these days.   Make sure to check in, there's a offer for a infused whiskey I didn't see until after we were finished and paid. D'oh!   We shared the shrimp artichoke spinach dip. The dip was really creamy and nicely seasoned. It only had a few shrimp on top and it really didn't need it. My philosophy is don't be skimpy as it gives a lesser impression than if it wasn't there at all. Just don't put it at all and offer more quantity of the dip as that was good and we had plenty of unused chips as we polished off the small dip quite fast.   I decided to get a black and bleu burger. This was a pretty good burger, not skimpy of the stinky cheese and I like the horseradish sauce though wish it had more kick vs just the flavor. Comes with a side of choice and I picked fries which was standard, but good. Our friend got the Cure burger and between the two, that was the definite winner. That was uber yummy so I took two bites instead of taking a small taste.   The fiance get fish and chips. This unfortunately was a bit of a miss. The batter had decent flavor and fish was good but it wasn't very crispy at all and should have been fried up longer. Whoever plated it, should have caught it and let it have a few more minutes. Slaw didn't have much flavor as it barely had any dressing on it. The fries were good.   The fish and chips was in the entree section of the menu which comes with a soup or salad. He chose a caesar salad which was actually pretty good caesar and was rather sizeable for a \"side salad\".   Our server was pretty friendly, and was reasonable with checking in on us and refilling.   While one entree was a miss, I think we will be back soon as we can see the potential. There is a industry half off happy hour on Weds. starting at 10pm so we will probably come back soon for that and I am definitely in for The Cure!"}
{"text":"There was a bartender named Rob, came in for my first time and he gave me the worst business I've ever had not even 5 seconds into my visit... it's a cool spot but that guy seriously ruined my vibe."}
{"text":"A local bar with cool twist to everyday comfort foods. A gem in centennial hills off durango and centennial center blvd. I've had a few of their dishes like the chicken and mashed potatoes sliders and of course the classic chicken wings, which were both tasty, filling and fairly priced. The staff was very friendly and friends of mine who also comes here on a consistent basis says the same.  This place is great for take out or to chill with friends on any night of the week for good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times on the restaurant side. Always great service and food was great for everyone in the group. They have a lot of different options to choose from. They also have some type of reward card gets you points for discounts."}
{"text":"The decor is cool and has a relaxing atmosphere. Great music selection. Happy hour is twice a day, 7 days a week and has a decent selection of food and drink specials. Service is average at the bar and somewhat tolerable. There are two bartenders; but only one actually took my order, gave me my beer, and asked how the food was. I order HH priced short ribs tacos which were tasty but dry. I might try this place again to see; if I have the same experience."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood bar....love the atmosphere and offerings. Rhea is the best server and only person we rely on for our orders!  Management is pretty good but could cut some of the lack-luster employees."}
{"text":"I've gotten kicked out of here once, it was awesome.  Anyway, after laying low for awhile I made my way back into this bar(no one recognized me, success!) and it's turned into one of my favorite places-for graveyard shift. No bar is a real bar unless it's open 24 hours.  The food is great. Though I don't really set any high standard for bar food, but this place serves some of the best food than any of the bars in town. More then just a selection of nachos/burgers, they have breakfast and entree meals as well.  Pool tables. That's all.  I will admit though, I have been to this bar various times of the day and night, and the only time it deserves this 5-star rating is the graveyard shift. I'm sure the service is better at this time simply because there aren't that many customers, but holy shit the day and swing shift workers. Those bartenders are absolutely terrible. While I get the whole hiring for 'looks', some of them are pretty ditzy and make you wait 20 minutes for a drink when there's only 3 other people in the bar. Should probably add skill and customer service to the employ requirements."}
{"text":"Very good local bar. It's more like a gastropub.  Because I think the food doesn't taste nothing like bar food.  I myself hate bar food. You can tell the cooks take pride on how the dish is presented to the customer and the staff is so friendly. I yet to have a bad experience there.  Well the only bad thing. It's full and need more chairs when the golden knights play. But that's not they're fault no one likes to go to an empty bar.  I look forward to having more memories here.  Hello distill goodbye PT's."}
{"text":"Came in for a late night dinner with my dad and we had a ton of fun watching sports and eating delicious food! To start, we had the avocado egg rolls and they were so full of flavor, I'm craving them right now. I ordered the Cajun chicken wrap and my dad ordered the Southwest salad. I would definitely order it again. The fries were crispy and were a great side for the wrap. My dads salad was huge and fresh, I plan to order this next time! Drinks were great, but it was super busy so we had to wait quite some time for service...the apps and numerous TVs kept us busy though!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers and a staff that actually takes time with its guests!!!! Dean was awesome!! Great looking place excellent!!"}
{"text":"One of the few places in town where I really feel like a local in a local joint. But I wouldn't have come back so much if the food, staff and vibe weren't so good. Definitely worth a shot for a chill, smoke free lunch fire a good energy happy hour."}
{"text":"I am rating DISTILL 5 STARS~~ because Dan, their manager treats me like a Princess!!  It feels good going there.  The other bartender's Dusty Lee, Jessica, Lindsey, Rick, Chanel, Laine, Rob and Phil are also wonderful. Erin is a super sweetheart. Distill is fun and their machines have been good too. Lot's of FREE PLAY. I love the contests and that DISTILL really honor's their players. I am happy we have such a nice 24 hr. place like DISTILL in Summerlin~~"}
{"text":"Nicole is the sweetest bartender I have ever encountered, in love with this place Joe the bar  ambassador is great and had us laughing our asses off. The food was amazing and the bloody Mary's were on point!"}
{"text":"Used to like coming here for football....Unfortunately, it's NHL season too, if I wanted every TV in the bar to be on NHL, I would go to the game!!! Now, it's college football bowl season and every TV except 1 is on NHL. Time to find a better bar!! Oh....and the men's toilet has been leaking for at least 6 months."}
{"text":"Can't really post anything positive here besides the ambiance being nice. Service was horrible, timing of the dishes being served was off, the waitress dropped the ball multiple times and the assistant manager was flat out rude. The food was average at best, although the margarita was well made, I will not be patronizing again.  It's not that hard people, service with a smile goes a long way, even if the food is average. Try it out sometime."}
{"text":"Service was really helpful and friendly. The Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich was delicious. The fries could be better, crispier. I'm looking forward to trying other things, there were several I was considering. The dining area is pretty small."}
{"text":"Great place to come watch football on Sundays. Not extremely busy, they provide a happy hour menu, and plenty of extremely comfy couches located all around the restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm very impressed.  Great menu (unlike a lot of other local bars), great atmosphere and they have a lot to offer.   Erin was our bartender and she provided me with the Lovelady Golden Knights beer and the pot roast stickers.  Soooo good.    I'll defiantly be back here as I wasn't expecting to have such a enjoyable experience in a bar located in the middle of a desert around a bunch of homes.     Very cool"}
{"text":"A nice break from alot of local bars,a lot brighter and less somber gaming experience than most,food is also a nice change up with traditional bar food,but more outside the box options...also if anyone read Chris g's review he is the worst kind of yelper I was there that night and not even close to what happened he did skip part of a block of country songs after asking the bar if anybody played them,because a lot of people asked about songs they had played and he assumed the person who played them had left...when the guy came up complaining he handed the guy his phone and apologized and offered for him to use his personal money for the guy to replay the songs....sorry for the rant I have had great experience with all the bartenders jay mikey Corrine and Erin especially...i just can't stand people lying on the internet"}
{"text":"It was really busy when we walked in and we were wondering if we should wait it out. Glad we did. We found 2 seats for the 4 of us at the bar. We lucked out with a table not a long as they said. Ahi salad,  yummm, dirty martini ribeye, yummmm, Cajun chicken wrap, another yummm and western bacon burger, yet another yummmmm. We will be back. Paige you were awesome,  great recommendations, great smile!"}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here or happy hour and on Fridays! Good food and drinks! Brittany is one of the best waitresses here, great advice on food and friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Very few slots. Service slow and aloof if you actually find a seat at the limited seating at the bar. I think it's busier than it deserves to be from sheer lack of competition in the area....for now."}
{"text":"We had the cheese steak sandwich, chicken Parmesan sliders and the mashed potato balls. Everything was yummy. We ordered two mules and they came in pint glasses (boo) they honestly didn't taste very good either. At least the food was great! I'd come back if I was in a pinch for a place to take a few people."}
{"text":"This is such a great spot best place for football. Stopped in with some friends to watch the college games and the breakfast was fantastic. I'm a long time distill regular so I'm stoked for this season. Nicole was my bartender and she's awesome. Best bar in the neighborhood with the best bar menu in the city. Go in and ask for Nicole you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to distill I was really happy with the service. It was around grave yard. The food was really good. I recommend this bar to everyone in the southern highlands."}
{"text":"Great local bar and dining,  went for a couple of hockey games and there was drinks special and raffles going on. Nice fun atmosphere happy hour 3-7 was great good prices and appetizer were good. Haven't tried there menu food yet but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Distill is still one of my favorite bars in Las Vegas. We have had mostly great experiences from enjoying the Super Bowl, discovering that The Cure burger really is as good as the reviews say, to making friends with people in a neighborhood of Las Vegas we'd otherwise never visit.  However, one particular employee there has irked me to the point that I've come back to Yelp, hoping management will take steps not to lose my business and the business of the friends we've recommended to the bar. I preface all of this by mentioning that I've been served by every member on the staff here. Everyone who works there, without question, is excellent and professional - unless you have the unfortunate experience of Carissa.   If she is your server, you are better off giving your business to the restaurants nearby. Her service is either slow or non-existent. Often, we find ourselves waiting up to an hour before she returns to refill our empty drinks. Or, perhaps you're new to the bar and curious what's on tap. She doesn't know. She won't find out for you. In fact, she'll watch you stand up, take several steps toward the bar until you can see the taps to decide, and then take your order. Don't bother asking what's good for food, she doesn't know. Dare I mention the more than a few occasions where she flat out did not serve us? When we had to ask another server to take us instead...    My review remains 5 stars because of the other outstanding people who work here. Just know that there's potential for a terrible experience here too."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location and I'm so happy there is one on this part of town.  New, elegant, clean and fun!  Pool tables, and a non smoking dining area.  The service here is always on point no matter what time of day.  As far as food?  I've had a chicken wrap and built my own breakfast burrito in the middle of the day!  I love that.  Breakfast anytime is always a plus in my book.  TV's are all over the place, and you can definitely get whatever game you like on at any time.  Well over twenty beers on tap, Red Bull, crown apple and the latest and greatest.  The only downfall here is that sometimes they are too packed and if you like to gamble, it can be a bit hard.  But other than that, I typically never have anything negative to say about anyone or anything here.  Out in the middle of nowhere in southern highlands, so it's not hard to miss!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"So I have been to this location four or five times and no matter what I just cannot get comfortable there.  The layout is rather odd.    I've really only gone there to gamble and I wish I have had luck but the machines seem to be extremely tight.  Because it's so open it's extremely loud.    As far as food goes I've only tried the quesadillas and they were very average.  Service is decent but bartenders get lost when busy and takes a while to get a drink.  However the tall blonde is excellent and the curly haired brunette is also very good.  A few of the times I got fast friendly service from them.  Maybe I need to try more of their menu, but for the few times I have been there it is just kind of meh."}
{"text":"We had 4 drinks, 4 shots and an order of the pot roast egg rolls. Our total came to over $80. We walked out of there very disappointed. The drinks were incredibly sweet with very little alcohol in them. After 4 \"straight shots\" it was clear that we were not being served our money's worth. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because of the pot roast egg rolls which came with gravy and horseradish (which wasn't spicy). These eggs rolls were delicious, tender AND crunchy. Nevertheless, the atmosphere in this place feels a bit bougie for saying a local bar. It didn't feel local, it felt strippy--as in on the strip. In huge marquee letters they have \"GET LOW\" on the side of the wall?? What? Lol. This is the hills, the suburbs, not the urban...."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible! They've only been open about a week, and we've gone TWICE! Once for breakfast, once for lunch.  First off, the restaurant is 100% separate from the bar, so no smoke, whatsoever. It's in a glassed off area with about 12 - 15 tables. There's been one other couple there each time we've gone. This means fast service by the very friendly waitress (Christina), including refills of drinks (sodas/coffee).  The food is what brought us back. Wow! So tasty! Steak and eggs could be done poorly, but here it's perfect. Biscuit was a little \"cakey\", very thick, and the gravy didn't have oomph. That can be forgiven because of the tasty, flavorful French toast: not dry but just the right amount of moisture.  For lunch, we've had fish tacos and a Kale salad. Well done. The fish was big hunks of unbreaded deliciousness. The side of onion rings were 100% perfect! The salad had the right amount of texture and tastiness.  Since this place is new, it shows. Everything is clean and shiny. The restrooms look like something out of Better Homes and Gardens. They're exquisite with new tile and fixtures.  We were apprehensive about this place, since it's a bar, with smoking, but our hopes and dreams have been answered! Here is a 100% no-smokey place with fabulous food, wonderful service, and we haven't even got to the booze, yet! Perfect in every way!"}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and helpful. The food was good but nothing that really stood out. We had tacos and a quesadilla. They did have a couple of cider options on their drink menu."}
{"text":"The street tacos were very salty and the avocado egg rolls had a weird guava sauce that made the rolls taste gross. They might want to taste there product before it goes out."}
{"text":"I've heard that the burgers are really great here but I only sat at the bar during my visit to Distill. On a Friday night, the environment was a little noisy. There's a full bar w/dinning area. Standard american food menu. The bar tender was friendly and attentive. We had the avocado egg rolls and sweet potato fries, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate the food a 6, not bad but nothing special. This place seems like a good spot to have drinks w/friends, overall it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"If you go here I would suggest trying a table and not the bar.  I sat there gambling a good 1/2 hour before one of the 3 bartender even knowledged me.  The sad thing is this is all we have in this area with any sort of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Erin was our bartender at 3 pm today. Damn, she knows how to make a kick ass Old Fashioned. Definitely coming back to this place. Awesome drinks and food."}
{"text":"Came into the bar with a few friends, Marissa greeted us with a smile and a great personality! Drinks came fast and correct! Food was way better than i expected. Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Randomly stopped in here for a midday drink. Breakfast served all day! Steak and eggs is a great choice. Friendly servers that aren't too bad to look at either (winky face). Cheap drinks. All around a good time."}
{"text":"Nice, clean and not crowded. I went with a friend and we shared the IPA Imperial Shrimp and Avocado Egg Rolls, both were really yummy! Service was good, not great but I gambled $40 bucks, playing dollar hands and they didnt comp even 1 of our 6 drinks....last time we played $50 each and not a single comp as well. Like...not even 1 drink? Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Food: 4 star Service: 1 star  Upon arriving at this fairly new local bar at 10:15pm, my friend and I sat at the bar and ordered a beer each. After sitting for about 15 minutes waiting for the bartender to come around to ask if we would like to order food, we simply asked a server for a menu. We decided on an appetizer and 2 entrees.   After deciding on the items we wanted to order, still no bartender came by to take our order. Finally I believe the manager (male in a black button down short sleeve shirt comes walking by) and notices that we would like to order. He asked what would we like and places our order. He came back to try and make small talk asking if it was our first time visiting (probably assuming that at this point we were a little irritated).   About 10 minutes later the appetizer arrived. After sitting for about 5 minutes no bartender came by to offer napkins, plates, or cutlery. About 3 minutes later the 2 entrees arrived. We felt bad asking the food runner for the items that the bartender should have brought or asked us if we would like.   We finished up eating and after we were done with our drinks, one of the bartenders came buy to offer another drink. We would have for sure ordered another, but because of the non existent service, We'd rather go to another bar and spend our money on the service there.   My friend had asked for a water, and the bartender directly turned around and picked up his cellphone and started texting on it. We both personally work in the industry and this by far was the rudest thing a person at the work place could do. I'm sorry but you are at work for a reason, to work! If you feel like you need to be on your phone more than assisting paying customers, then maybe you should work for A cell phone company. Eventually he received his water after the guy was finished with his txt.   We really wanted to like this bar being that the food was great and it's close to home! I really like supporting local bars, however when you can find better servers and bartenders at chain restaurants it really tells a lot about this bar.   I will say that being that there are not many local bars in the area, this distilled has it made. However, Once other local bars such as PTs gets ahold of a demand in this area, paying customers will not put up with bad service."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and the lighting and seating is perfect for dinners and get-togethers. It's also kid friendly!The staff are always friendly and accommodating. I definitely love the menu and the consistency in quality and taste.  The pot roast spring rolls are a must! Packed with pot roast flavor and crisp pastry. I order these everytime. The Mashed Potato Bites are also amazing! I've like the Jalapeño Popper Burger. Very delicious. The cream cheese and bacon toppings are so good.  The Pot Pie is flaky and the roasted chicken and vegetables inside are delicious. Definitely up there with chicken pot pies of tried. The fish and chips are not bad. My gf likes to order them here. We never have room for dessert! We once made it 1/4 into  Bread Pudding."}
{"text":"If I could 0 stars I would. But since that isn't possible 1 it is. Easy start here is to mention that everyone here is rude. Everything you ask for is an inconvenience. Ask the bartender for a drink. You might as well have slapped him in the face. Ask the waitress for a menu to order food. And you just asked for her lunch. Basic Las Vegas bar with basic bar food that they don't even let you know what they have or don't have. Order a southwest hamburger. You get a bun and patty. Oh yeah by the way we are out of all of that other stuff. Trash. The whole place just throw it away. For this experience you're just as good off going to your run down PT's down the street.. Don't waste your time. They don't even appreciate you anyway."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Mashed Potato Bites - Creamy House Made Mashed Potatoes with cheddar, pepper jack, and parmesan, spices.  Served with chipotle sour cream and ranch. Croque Madame - Swiss, Ham, Bechamel, Eggs, Hash Browns Chicken and Waffles - Fried Chicken drizzled with caramel chipotle sauce, waffles French Toast - Bread Pudding with Banana Foster Sauce  Located just a mile from my front door, and recently offering brunch as only a 24/7 'Local Bar' in Las Vegas can, it was just after 8am that I entered Distill and with the crew mopping floors as a few locals sat playing video slots beneath the echoes of KISS's \"Shout it Out Loud\" it was to a Please Seat Yourself sign that I was greeted - a seat in the upper rim selected with a young woman named Chrissy interrupting her duties of setting up the Bloody Mary Bar to procure me a menu, water, and the first of several cups of surprisingly good coffee.  Offering a 24/7 menu of items ranging from snacks, sandwiches, and salads to entrees and even hearty breakfasts it was largely for the weekend-only 8a-2p brunch that I'd scheduled my first visit to Distill and ordering in two rounds with every item recommended as a good choice by both my server and Assistant GM Kristyne, who stopped by to chat no less than three times, the meal unfolded in four plates that all showed surprising creativity and execution one would generally see reserved for far more 'fancy' spots.  Beginning savory, it was with a paper-lined cone full of tender cheesy potatoes beneath a golden topcoat that the meal began, and paired with a duo of sauces from which the smoky sour cream was undoubtedly a standout the flavors were up front without a bit of the greasiness oft associated with fried potatoes - the hashbrowns served next to a competent croque madame for example, though the sandwich itself was little more than ham, egg, and cheese on toast as the Bechamel was a touch too thick and unfortunately under-flavored.  Moving on to two more brunch-specific selections, as the soundtrack shifted briefly to Pink and copious coffee refills continued, round two saw the arrival of two substantially larger entrees and although the chicken tenders proved no better than the sort one would expect at a decent pub the waffle was executed beautifully with a crunchy exterior and springy crumb, the spicy sauce keeping sweet caramel in check - a sense of balance equally achieved by three thick slices of custard-soaked breaded seared crisp with sticky bananas foster finding its foil in a toasty layer of nuts.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  Far exceeding modest expectations in terms of food, scene, and customer service with prices trending far lower than several other spots in the city it is only a matter of time before I return to Distill and although I'm certainly not the bar's target audience for booze and games I also look forward to seeing whether the quality carries over to Elixir and Remedy's, the Henderson based members of their growing 24/7 family."}
{"text":"Great breakfast deals, and also burgers are on POINT!!! good spot to watch the NFL and sports games."}
{"text":"Been meaning to go here for awhile, but when I finally  checked this place out last weekend I wasn't impressed.  It's a great vibe when you walk in. Decor is cute and cheeky. Food is average. I ordered the Chicken Cesar wrap and it was way smaller than I expected. It seemed like there was only 3 or 4 small pieces of chicken in each half. There was more lettuce than anything...it was seriously a lettuce wrap. Now if you're going there for drinks, their prices are pretty reasonable. So next time I'd probably just go for drinks and to play pool/games. Mediocre bar food but great place to grab some drinks with friends."}
{"text":"First time impression was decent. Table shared a couple of appetizers which tasted amazing. Wait staff was very knowledgeable about beers/spirits so way to go on the training.   Only con was sitting outside service is a little slower but the inside bar was very busy. Will try it again because I'm eager to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"The entire staff took care of business but Nicole the bartender was super dope!  Definitely come down to Distills in Southern Highlands if you're looking for good food, friendly service and a solid bar!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become our favorite spot! Every time we have been in we are greeted with as smile and served right away.. the food is the best we've had at any local bar.. our drink picks are the Sangria & Mad Mule.. So happy Distill is now in our neighborhood! Tammy and Emily, y'all are awesome!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD AND EMPLOYEES! Decent prices as well! Also, not a crowded bar and pool tables. Definitely our new spot!"}
{"text":"Distill is my local spot, the people are really cool, food is good and really good prices on drinks. Special shout out to Brittany, Mikey and the Ahi Poke Stack!!"}
{"text":"We love this bar.  Excellent food. Great friendly atmosphere.  Marissa is running a great location.  Bar staff Teresa, Corinne, George, Mike and Shawn are excellent!  Servers Holly and Natalie are awesome.  Kitchen staff puts out excellent food quickly and delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried to grab lunch here with my son as I've heard your menu is amazing. The few times I've been in the service is slow.  Waited 15 minutes at noon and no one came in to serve us even though I made a point of smiling at bar staff. Guess I'll never know if the food is good or not..."}
{"text":"Such a cool place!  Love to just hang here, relax with friends, get some food, and grab a drink.  The outside is so neat at night - cool outside lighting, mini fire pits to sit around, etc.  Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Update: how convenient of this bartender to not give receipts to the individuals of our group after they've paid. Definitely need to file a dispute somewhere to make sure this doesn't become a common occurrence!  I would have rated this place a 4 stars if it wasn't for the end where our bill was incorrect and the bartenders' (Ryan G.) response was \"that's the way it is\" just because we are the last ones to leave. We leave a tab open for ourselves (group of 5 people) not for others to charge their shit onto our card and the bartender had no right allowing people to charge onto our card or even to add items that weren't paid for because he couldn't pay attention. Did he pocket cash and we ended up responsible for the two added items, very possible. That constitutes fraud and management should keep a closer eye on this guy. If it's not this guy, then this bar is taking advantage of large isolated groups that come in and adds on items that weren't ordered to increase profit.   We ordered two sex on the beach, a pomagranite punch and a whiskey sour and ordered one water (not bottled) before shift change. Then at the end we ordered two tequila shots, somehow wings and an AMF drink were added to our tab when we decided to leave and close the tab.   I tried ordering my tequila shots earlier in the night, but Ryan was too busy showing some customers what was on his cellphone instead so I left and returned to the counter a bit later for it and to get quarters for the pool table again. I tried to hand him his tip after getting my coins, but he just turned around and walked away after handing me quarters, so it ended up being placed under the rubber mat on the counter. Kind of explains why our tab ended up incorrect because of his negligence and lack of attention or he pocketed the cash that was paid from our other group and decided to use us since we paid with credit. Make sure to keep/ask for receipts if part of your group pays cash.  AGAIN BEWARE of leaving your tab open, for the reasons above which is why I was skeptical at leaving it open in the first place, but since it wasn't busy(Monday evening) I thought we would be ok. How terribly wrong I was. How is it fair to overcharge customers because you couldn't do your job properly?  Pool tables cost $1 each game (uses quarters only or maybe it just works better with coins). We came in a little before 11pm and unfortunately I didn't get the names of the original bartender or waitress. He was great, seem to have a sense of humor from our brief encounter and waitress was good, could have been better, she seemed like she didn't want to be there and didn't seem too happy when I told her my sister was still deciding what her first legal drink should be, it had only been a few minutes since we arrived. She warmed up a bit later and was very attentive, frequently coming back to check up on us and apologized for taking long in bringing my boyfriend the water he requested. Both were definitely better at providing service than Ryan did.   Restrooms were clean, a plus. Large area to hang out and yes a bit smokey. You can smell it once you pass the first set of doors. I may or may not return to this establishment.. since our first experience here turned out like this.   I was really hoping I could come back to this place and take advantage of their loyalty program versus going to PTs/Sierra Gold or all the choices in Downtown area. But there are plenty of other bars with more games and better service around town that will gladly take their customers"}
{"text":"On New Year's Day we just had to watch my Green Bay Packers with lots of folks, knowing there would be enough fans at Distill.  The best part of this great sports bar/restaurant (besides the food) are the big cushy leather chairs & sofas, enough space between others, the just-right lighting, and the greeting one always receives from a terrific staff.  I recommend Angela, our server for the few hours, who goes the extra mile & does it with a fun personality (as though she loves her job).    The menus are vast & include:  football day menu, happy hour menu & B/L/D.  Wanting to begin my take-off-a-few-pounds resolution, I chose the fish & chips, & was I a happy camper!  Three sizeable, lightly-breaded in beer batter fillets served with lots of good fries (I gave to my partner), coleslaw and a salad  of gourmet greens (or clam chowder) for $13.25.  He had the steak nachos from football menu & they were plenty, being generous with the steak portion.  And not too gooey.  Your choices on that menu are terrific, incl. generous & attractively plated fish tacos.  The music that night (we asked for the game \"noise\" instead) was for anyone's taste; a nice departure from the usual screams of Brittany Spear types.  The prices are righteous on all menus, and after 3 yrs. of stopping by-- in good weather a favorite patio of mine for dining-- I've not had a mediocre meal.  Kudos to Distill !"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now and I REALLY wanted this to be the new local watering hole. Unfortunately it will not be. Where to start... well the decor, design, and layout of the bar is on point. The service here blows, and I'm serious when I say this, IT BLOWS. Yes some of the bartenders are nice and efficient, but god damn do I have to wear a sign around my neck saying \"I'll have another cocktail??\" If you don't initiate interaction with the bartenders forget about getting a drink. I NEVER write reviews, this just shows How shit this place was. I definitely felt that the guest did not come first at this establishment. If you want an overpriced cocktail and want to wait 30 minutes for it then this is the bar for you... I'll be sticking to timbers down the road much better service and more personable bartenders that know how to work behind a bar."}
{"text":"Great bar except when one particular bar tender is working, they now have her on day shift and the service is awful!! I have been to many many bars in 28 years living here and she is the worst at her job I have ever seen . They need to put a ticket number machine in there like the DMV cause the wait is about the same with her I will not be back when she is working again ."}
{"text":"Female servers good, male servers not so good.   Comfortable lounge chairs.   Adequate beer selection.  Full of wannabe thugs and workaday twenty-somethings. Go here until Pint opens."}
{"text":"Distill is a local bar that has about everything you need for a good time. Indoors; they have a pool table, large comfy seats, a bar, and plenty of room. Outdoors; boasts a rustic chic style with even more seating and fire places to create a nice ambiance. I often find myself looking up and wishing that my backyard could look like this.   The drinks are super affordable. The staff are around enough to get drinks, but not so much that they intrude on your conversation. I have never been hungry while here, but a couple of friends have ordered food before. It is nothing outright amazing, but definitely better than some of the chain bars.   Between the inexpensive cost of drinks and cool atmosphere, this is definitely a place I can see myself relaxing."}
{"text":"I really wanna like this place since it's near my house...but I just can't. I got really excited last time I was here because I found out they had Chainbreaker IPA on draft (woop woop) and it was delish! But the food here is wack. It's just something to fill your stomach with. Sliders are sub par. And the pizza is TERRIBLE! Seriously, some store bought shz that took forever to come out. Idk what this place is trying to do. After living in the area for a while, I know that all the businesses that try to take over this building don't do well. And idk why. But this place needs some work too. If the prices were cheaper, then I guess I could reason out the quality, but as of now...it's overpriced for stuff I could microwave at the grocery store :-(   As for ambience--- I mostly just like that there are a lot of seats. The bartenders are kind of weird/borderline rude. Not really friendly? But seem to have side comments galore. There's also a random \"I Love the 80s\" poster in the middle of the room, smh."}
{"text":"Had a great meal and a few brews watching the Yankees game .Service was amazing!  Rick Cruz took care of me  great time!"}
{"text":"Mike is an amazing bartender! Always has impeccable service and respects his customers! Definitely come back during his shift!!"}
{"text":"Consistently phenomenal. All Bartenders are on their game. Super friendly and accommodating.  Menu is great. Not to mention that handsome Tuesday rocks. Yeah for John and Patrick"}
{"text":"The service was terrible! I went with a group of friends for a bon voyage lunch. It took them almost an hour to get me my iced tea. We had to practically beg for silverware.  Our food arrived after about 40 minutes.  They completely forgot one of our group members order and they charged an extra 1.50 to someone who ordered extra gravy. Despite everything we went through the servers did not so much as demonstrate a hint of empathy. They didn't seem to care at all. That was the worst part if it. I am not exagerating. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Patrick and Mo rock! They make awesome Martinis, make you feel so comfortable and always have our drinks ready when we walk in. We definitely return because of them. Great happy hour as well! Buffalo sliders are tasty.  The bar is always clean and love the atmosphere. Great pool tables area."}
{"text":"Best bar in town :) I love distill and everything about them! Nicole and Elliot are great out here in the southwest ! I drive all this way just to see them but centennial distill is my home spot love everyone there too :) happy to  call distill my second home !"}
{"text":"Brittany is a beast, great enthusiasm, top marks all the way around for her! I had the burnt ends sandwich with fries.  They were pretty good this is out after work spot and as long as Brittany is here I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"1st and last time for us.  The service was non existent and the place smelled of stale cigarette smoke.   I guess if we were throwing money into the poker machines we would have received better service."}
{"text":"This place was cute unfortunately they really need to get a new chef I was not to impressed with there food I order the Philly steak sandwich and it was horrible had no flavor and nothing was grilled the drinks were very good and staff was super nice not sure I will come back tho"}
{"text":"Food was delicious service absolutely outstanding. Tammy and Eric did an awesome job. Extremely nice and helpful. The food came out in perfect timing. Definitely coming back. Thanks for making my wife and I feel so welcomed. Can't wait until our next visit. If I could give more than 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Always amazing !! Love the food and most of all love the service !! They always take care of us and love the fact I can play some great music and have a great time !! The staff is always awesome!! Been coming here for 2 years !!!  Heat local atmosphere and nice to hang out !!!!"}
{"text":"The best staff as well as the best food. I live nearby and eat there at least once a week! They have plenty of healthy meals as well as amazing sweet potato fries! You call and order and be assured your order will be exactly as you ordered it to be."}
{"text":"I have been to Distill twice. Both times we sat at the bar.  The first with a girlfriend who happens to like margarita's.  The bartender greeted us and introduced himself, then gave us the \"Happy Hour\" menu, which consisted of 3 house wines, limited cocktails and VERY limited food (chips and salsa at a discount, WOW!) The bartender convinced my friend to try their famous fresh squeezed margarita at the cost of $10. (Not on the Happy Hour menu).  The drink was so tart and bitter she could not drink it.  The bartender replaced the drink with a glass of wine and charged us for both!  The second time, I took my dad who loves a good hang out bar.  The bartender again greeted us, introduced himelf, shook our hands then promptly disappeared never to be seen again.  It took us 10 minutes for the next bartender to see that we did not have any drinks and ask what we would like.  For happy hour they offer draft beers for $3.  My dad ordered one and instead of the bartender asking, \"Would you like a large one for an additional $1.25?\" brought him a large one.  We did order an appetizer, but since the \"Happy Hour\" menu is so limited, we ordered the Calamari off of the regular menu.  It is very good, served with a mango/sirracha sauce for dipping.  We asked for a little extra sauce and then found that we were charged for it!  You don't always get what you pay for and at Distill, you pay for everything!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Bartender's are on it, food is worth the travel and service is 5 star! Finally a classy close to home bar to be."}
{"text":"I'm assuming that all the bad reviews must come from those that have higher standards than I.   My experience at Distill was RELAXING and DELICIOUS. Sunday afternoon, happy hour from 3-7pm. I have a tremendous appetite, but the 3 apps we ordered was more than I should've eaten (sliders, Greek fries and fried artichokes). My fave was the fried artichokes, and the sauce that accompanies the dish was FAB!   The on tap HH drafts are the norm domestic lights, but who cares...beer taste the same after a pint.   The ambience on this Sunday afternoon was uneventful, just the way it should be. Good selection of music for whomever was paying for the jukebox.   And lastly, Sara(h), our waitress had to have been the sweetest and informative waitress we've had @alocalbar! Can't wait to use our rewards points for the next visit."}
{"text":"They have absolut pepper vodka for bloody marys!  I like their patio!   So chill.  ATTENTION ATTENTION:  get the deep fried mashed potato balls!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super cool new bar, has great seating and lots of machines, great menu, lots of choices. New machines and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really chill, lots of tvs to watch the games and the patio is really nice for brunch on a Sunday. The breakfast burrito is yummy and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place when it opened because the menu sounded really interesting, and then we brought home dinner one night and literally everything we ordered tasted frozen and bland.  Okay, maybe not the Caesar salad. That wasn't frozen, I don't think.  But everything we ordered was mediocre and dreadful, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy your after-work shifter or a great dinner. Have tried most of their menu items and really enjoy them. Main reason I return time and time again is because of their associates. Whether I I sit at the bar or a table I always feel welcomed. It does have that local feel some of us look for in their favorite watering hole.. Thank you Distill and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I heard that Distill was opening in Southern Highlands and was excited to have another option for food and cocktails in the South West.  The atmosphere was beautiful and really fun!  The service was great and we had a few people check in on us as the night went on.  We ordered cocktails and a few appetizers and I was impressed!  The cocktail menu was a little different and right up my alley.  We ordered the street tacos (which were some of the best I have had in a bar type atmosphere) and the mashed potato bites (so decadent and delicious).   I'm happy!  We will definitely be back.  Next time for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Prices were decent. But this bar is pretty Much the same every pts and local Bar. I honestly prefer pts to it. But it's def a decent little bar to hang. And it's got a pool table and isn't as Smokey."}
{"text":"Here for lunch and the food was great.    Ahi tacos were yummy and the burger was good.  We will be back.   Nice to have a good local place for food."}
{"text":"What can I say ?! WOW is this a great place ! First off my first time and I'm not usually on yelp but I have to spread the word on this place. Go in and ask for Nicole or Rachel they were so cute together what an awesome bar staff :) the food is fantastic huge tvs and a great layout of the bar, by far best time of the year for football, good drinks, great food and great service. Don't skip this place for your weekend spot!"}
{"text":"I am not basing this review off of the actual bar/restaurant (as I haven't been there enough times to warrant a full review), rather I am basing it off of the wonderful party they hosted for us. My now wife and I held out wedding rehearsal party for around 100 people in the outdoor patio and it absolutely exceeded our expectations. They were well staffed and very organized. Christine (one of the mangers) set up the entire event for us and everything went great. The set up was perfect, the food was fantastic, the staff was very attentive and helpful, and price was right in line with comparable venues around town.  They set up a full bar outside on the patio, had waited service as well, and set up a full buffet spread. It was also the little things that made a big difference like they had both regular and cucumber water available for guests to refresh at. They ensured that all guests were able to get transported home safely.  I absolutely recommend this option if you are ever hosting a party.  Every guest told me it was one of the best parties they had ever attended."}
{"text":"Rock solid bar. Kristyne kills it down there and knows how to make you feel welcomed. Going back to drink some beers!"}
{"text":"This location has great bartenders, however the management does not recognize their loyal high end gamers ."}
{"text":"First off the food is great(sober or drunk). Eliot or Jon behind the bar are excellent. They remembered me and my girlfriend just from our first visit, which is nice.  Seems this bar is always packed and thats because of the service, food and loyalty the bartenders give to the customers."}
{"text":"Stunning dining areas (both inside and outside), as well as a very cool atmosphere. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive... Delicious meal and fast, fun service! Will definitely be back to grab drinks and more delicious grub!"}
{"text":"Friday night. Asked to get a waitress so we could order drinks and food at the table. 3 times we asked and no one came. Got our own drinks from the bar all night. Bartender with the beard is a metrosexual douchebag. Started making fun of me for asking for service. It's been 3 hours jackass. Do your Fu**ing job."}
{"text":"**UPDATE** Best \"bar\" food ive had! Had some trouble with getting my order right at first but now that theyve been open a while they seem to get it right every time."}
{"text":"Excellent service every time! Great food and knowledgeable staff. Amazing service on multiple occasions from the bartender Mike who works swing. He's always very friendly and his drinks will not disappoint!!!!"}
{"text":"we went to Distill in Summerlin and loved the atmosphere, live band music, and food options so when we saw this open up near our house we were excited.    WARNING:  this place is NOT poppin like Summerlin.    This location is much smaller and more low key.  I have to admit unless you're familiar with the area it's secluded and might be difficult to find. However, as a local bar to start coming to ... I enjoyed it. There are pool tables and different seating areas. If you just want to eat, or appear you're not in a bar, there is a restaurant section blocked off for non-smokers.  Our server was super friendly.  Since it's Ash Wednesday, the fiancé and I decided to try the fish and chips.   The fish was a little too oily for me, but the fish portions were huge.  The drinks were reasonably priced.    Overall, I would come here again, bring friends, enjoy some drinks, and hang out !"}
{"text":"Service was really bad, my order was messed up in two different areas (no eggs in burrito and hash browns instead of breakfast potatoes) and so was my date's. It was not busy so I don't understand the slow service. Other times I would have given them 5 stars but this experience has lowered that to two. Get it together!"}
{"text":"I was here during happy hour with a friend who was visiting from out of town. The beers are reasonably priced--I got the craft beer of the month and it was under $5.  We split the chipolte chicken nachos, the filet sliders,  tacos, and Greek fries. Everything was good. The Greek fries were okay but I have had better--there was no sauce so the meat and feta just fall off the fries. The nachos were really tasty!   They have a really cool patio that is decorated. We sat out there and our first waitress was SO nice! She had to leave so we got a different waitress. She made comments that we were too far away and made us feel uncomfortable. I am not sure if she was mad that we sat outside,  but there were others there when we got there."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The food was subpar (got the short stack with a side of scramby eggs) and the waitress seemed either tired or high on something.   Not sure what other people see in this place to give it good reviews but I guess earlier in the day, it's better. Either way, I won't be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The food is always amazing (especially the Lemon Pesto Chicken) and the service is great. Especially Erin, she remembered us and our drinks which makes it even nicer to hang out here. The free desert we earned with our Red loyalty card was the icing on the cake tonight."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Try the Cure. Hamburger. My husband ordered a steak medium well and when it was too rare they took the time to get it re-done. Pickle straws are a tasty appetizer. We will return!"}
{"text":"Came in about 3 am I cant remember the bartenders name but he had dark hair with the a kinf of spikey cut..youll know him when you see him. Great service and even thiugh it was late GREAT food thank youuuuuu"}
{"text":"Service was a 5+ Food was a 2/3   As I have gone past this place probably 1000 times I decided to go out of my norm and stop in.  Walked in, somewhat loud for a weekday, seemed the music would get louder as the people would get louder.   Seated myself, was served by Sydney, who was really attentive and friendly. She made the experience enjoyable, even though it was a little busy she took a few minutes to chat.    I ordered the grilled chicken without the sauce  and chicken soup.    The soup of surprisingly really good for a bar.  It had a pretty good spice kick to it. The chicken was average, not being able to see what you're eating because of how dark it was in the bar was a little discouraging.  I'm not a sweet potato fan and there were a lot of them.  I was not able to make out the difference between normal potatoes and the sweet. The red peppers were mushy, but edible.  Overall the customer service from Syndey would bring me back with my friends or even again alone.   I would probably stick with a burger next time since the reviews are very high   Updated on July 27  Food 4 out of 5 Service 5 out of 5    So like always I need to try an eatery two times to make sure it was a valid review the first time   I walked in and instantly I was greeted by Kayla to took my drink order.  The sever, Sydney, from my earlier review was here and was up next   I Ordered the amazing chicken soup with the kick and it was like before amazing.  Ordered a burger with bacon this time and it was well prepared. Fresh bacon, Tomato, and lettuce.   While I was eating the bar back stopped to check on me to make sure all was good. The price for the Quality was better than the chicken."}
{"text":"Great local bar.  Food is several notches above bar cuisine.  We were quite surprised with the quality of the burgers and the homemade soup was amazing. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive until it came time for the bill but we can overlook that because we left satisfied and a bit shocked at how good the bar food was."}
{"text":"My expectations weren't low enough.   For a smokey dive bar, i was excited about outside seating. We were greeted enthusiastically and our waitress showed up soon after to take our order of a couple drinks.   now.. whenever i see beers on a menu i've never heard of, I like to ask about them. I like beer and i like trying beer. One might suggest that behavior likening to beer tasting be done in a place that serves beer... such as a bar.  However, it seems to be an unwritten rule at Distill that if you sit outside, you are immediately dubbed an a$$. AND... if you ask about beers, you can expect the waitress to only really know the size of the beer and have about a 60% accuracy rate on the hue of the beer. Getting any info on what a beer tastes like was pretty stupid on my part to think that a business would actually know the menu that is printed on paper and not handwritten on a chalkboard.   Having asked a few simple questions about a couple beers i had not heard of, it was clear that the waitress was really bothered by having to do the minimum amount of work; and, that we were outside was even more so of an insult to have to endure the constant walking to the nether regions of her place of employ to deal with people she clearly thought sucked.   I'm to blame for ordering the beers I ordered. However, the beers were crap. Whoever is in charge of ordering beers isn't good at their job.  The waitress was not a happy soul in any regard.  The outside seating was nice.   If either of the two previous failing businesses that were in this location returned, so would I. But as long as Distill somehow manages to profit in what is a pretty nice location, I guess i'll just be happy to have my beer outing adventures elsewhere."}
{"text":"My first time here was a great experience! Nice big comfy chairs in a lounge area surrounded by tv's with every sport or game playing! Server was attentive at making sure we never had an empty drink or bottle for the 2 hours we were there. Very clean and plenty of seating in the establishment, huge bar!"}
{"text":"Good happy hours, 24 service and an inviting patio.  Yes.  I went on opening night and it was super packed.  I only ordered a round from the bar.  The bartenders were busting their butts, but were also very friendly.  Today I went in for lunch, the food was good, came out quickly and I was very well- taken care of.   The manager even came over to introduce herself and was so friendly.  We need a good neighborhood bar in Summerlin, I hope this one sticks!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing because it offers a lot of things other bars/restaurants don't in the area - 1. Out doors patio with cozy fire pits and live music on Saturdays.  2. High ceilings so if you don't like smoking you never smell it ever in this place. 3. Saturday and Sunday Brunch that beats any on the strip and don't have to wait in long lines. 4. Several pool tables to challenge your friends to a game. 5. Cozy large man cave chairs to set back and enjoy some football with your crew. 6. Many areas to handle large parties even when not planned because the owner is always around and is happy to make any occasion special. 7. The food is above the normal bar menu ( salmon,shrimp,pizza hand made to order,street tacos) endless choices. 8. Happy hour/football specials (monday,Sunday, Saturday,Thursday) menus. Stop in and say Hello you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite local bar in town the food is awesome  and a solid staff to go with it! Distill chicken sandwich  is sooo bomb and it's not your typical bar food.  You have to check this place out asap!"}
{"text":"Great place, came here tonight to pregame for the night and to get some food. From the road it has a good location, stands by itself with awesome signs that you can see clearly. There is plenty of parking and the outside looks nice.  Inside is a rectangle center bar that is pretty big in size, has alot of seating along the walls with booths and chairs. You seat yourself but the servers greet you very quickly. The drink selection is great and the menu has a big variety of food. The prices are pretty awesome, 4$-$20, for appetizers to full meals. They carry craft beers and the normal beers. Have great sounding cocktails.   They have a good music selection and it's not too loud inside. Many televisions and casino games to be entertained by, they also have arcade games and 2 pool tables! They have a personal jukebox for the entire place where the customers play the music they want. Just download the app. Nice atmosphere with cool lighting. They even have a nonsmoking area. They got a cool lounge area with classy seating. The booths are very well made too.   Highly recommend this bar to everyone, tourists and locals. Will definitely be coming back here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  for a great night out without breaking the wallet!"}
{"text":"Love this bar we usually go in 3-5 deep. Super disappointed by what happened tonight. Couldn't order food or drinks. Over twenty minutes with a crew of 3 gamers. Not mad just disappointed of how the place usually operates. After we decided to leave it took 20 min to cash out."}
{"text":"I've been waiting 10 min for my ticket bartenders seem more interested on talking to other customers than see if I need anything else  it is 11:30 am. Bar is near empty  This is the 4th time I been here and there's always a problem   Don't think I'll come back"}
{"text":"So my wife and go there for a function to see the band \"Lovely\" it was a local radio station promotion. It was there happy hour during that time. $3.00 wells and select beers. I went to the bar and ordered a rum and coke and a sea breeze (vodka cranberry) for my wife. $6.00 cool with a $2.00 tip. We find a seat and a short haired blond waitress asks if we want anything after about 30 mins of sitting there. Sure another round and a side of fries (frozen) about $3.00. we were sitting and the band came on, so we walked up to see the band I found the waitress and I told her I would take care of her when the band was over. She kept on watching us like a hawk as if we were going to skip out? when the band was over I went to the waitress and said I want to close out. She gives me my bill which should have been about $9.00 and it said $16.93? I looked at it and said whats this? It said I ordered a sex on the beach and something else. She oh that's how it rings up, I said a sex on the beach and a sea breeze are 2 different things. I gave her money for the bill as she was getting my change I walked to the bar where she was at and I said can I see that bill again and tried to explain to her that she gave me the wrong bill. She said yelling at me I'll take care of it, it's not worth it to deal with this and gave me my change and threw the receipt at me. I still walked out of there paying someone else s bill.  I will not be going back with that kind of service."}
{"text":"Elliot is the absolute best! Come visit, ask for Elliot and you will not be disappointed! He ALWAYS takes care of me and my group!"}
{"text":"Food is terrific so I have no complaints there. Over the last week, I've visited Distill at least 4 times. Each time, I've grabbed a bite to eat and played video poker. On all of the previous visits, my drinks were comped including a visit earlier that day. When I came for dinner, I bought a friend. We ate dinner and when we got the check, I was charged for 1 of my 2 beers. I'm not upset that I was charged but I'm upset that I wasn't informed ahead of time that I was being charged. Inconsistency and lack of communication impacted the tip. I'm one that regularly tips above 20% but think I may have left $2-3 this visit. Great food but not sure I will continue to visit. I also went to Fireside and the food is just as good with a better beer selection which is free while playing. Gonna miss Distill because I really liked the place."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to get a good burger on a Saturday night and I have seen the \"Cure\" burger mentioned many times so we decided to head on over. Overall, we were really underwhelmed..  First off, it is seat yourself anywhere, which is fine, but when you walk in, it really seems like a place that they would seat you, for the tables at least, so after standing there 5ish minutes and having several waitresses pass us by, we walked up to one to find out it was seat yourself...the lack of interest from any server was to be a theme for the evening.  We found a table and sat while several servers passed us by, easily a dozen times. No menus to look at, no drinks, just us sitting there, and (I would think) obviously looking like we needed menus. Server finally came over with menus, and then back about 5 seconds later to take drink orders. As I had literally just gotten the menu, I asked for \"a water to start\"   They did bring the water out pretty quickly and then cue the same dozen waitresses walking by while we sat for 15 minutes waiting to order. When the waitress arrived she actually asked \"Did you want to order some dinner?\" I was very tempted to say \"No, we just came for water\" She seemed surprised when we actually wanted drinks...at a bar....anyway, I could go on, but the rest of the evening was the same service wise. Waitress nowhere to be found, dinner took forever (although the man who dropped it off did apologize for the wait) and just feeling like we were almost inconveniencing the servers...it was very odd.   I could almost understand if it was meant to be more of an actual bar, but it is set up like a very large restaurant with tables everywhere, so it was just weird. I was tempted to just hit the bar myself and get my own drinks, but I kept playing the waitress must be coming over here any minute game, even though I could have gone to the bar and back 20 times in between visits from her.   Anyway, on to the food. Short story, everything was meh. Long story, we ordered mashed potato bite appetizers, very bland, almost no taste at all actually, and was only marginally helped by the sour creme sauce. Pretzel bites, again incredibly bland and no taste, and again only marginally helped by the mustard sauce.   The Cure burger which I have heard good things about was also fairly disappointing. It had some good flavor, but was probably the messiest burger I have ever had. Everything was dripping all over my hands and the plate below and sliding everywhere, resulting in bites of just burger or just sauce toppings. I finally gave up and ate it with a fork, which was 1. ridiculous, and 2. only worth it if it had been really good, and it wasn't. I edited to add that it did not have the fried parsnips in it either. I thought that was on the description, then thought I mixed it up with another burger, but I didn't and they were missing. Sweet potato fries that I ordered along with it were tasteless (sensing a theme on their fried items here) and the margarita (one of their $10 \"distill specials\")  was also just eh with a short pour for sure...definitely had better.  It's one of those places that had the service been top notch, it would have made up for the food, or if the food had been awesome, it would have made up for the service, but considering both were not good, it's not worth a return trip at all. Too many other places in Vegas doing it better."}
{"text":"I mean...it's mediocre food with hurried service, which Im coming to understand is pretty much a constant in this city.  The mashed potatoe balls which many have recommended were less about the potatoes and more about the cheese, jalapeño, and generic Italian'esk breading, which strangely enough tasted like the same breading used on the mozzarella triangles.  The fish and chips were coated with a heavy thick batter which was soggy and undercooked and the chips were bland tasteless soggy luke warm bag fries.  Awesome.  My martini arrived on the rocks in some kind of mixed drink / beer glass, which, considering they have like 6 different kinds of martinis on the menu, theyd at least know how to serve them.  Having sat down in the bar area, we at least anticipated being able to have a few drinks and hang out, its not as though there were no other tables open, and we did have a 80 dollar cheque open.  Needless to say, as soon as we opted to not have dessert, our bill immediately arrived and the card was wisked away and returned 60 seconds later, which was THEE fastest service of the night.  I guess we're more interested in turning tables than having people order a handfull of 12 dollar drinks."}
{"text":"Nicole is the shit! Lose or win she makes it a good time! If only the poker machines were as sweet as she is I would probably live here! Best bar in our neighborhood"}
{"text":"I ordered the same dish sorry its that Good! Grilled chicken with veggies we need to come here more"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. The food is solid, the drinks are good, and the staff is excellent. Summerlin has been lacking a solid bar that isn't over the top and doesn't feel like a den full of local drunks... this place is the sweet spot.  The inside of the bar is comfortable and inviting. There is a separate dining area for those that don't want to hang around the bar. The patio has a variety of seating options and a mister system which makes sitting outdoors relatively nice in the evenings.  The wait staff, bartenders, and the manager Dan make this place a standout. The bar is staffed with good people and it shows. Overall vibe of this place is excellent.  I've noticed that the crowd that comes here is mixed with both older and younger people. A lot of casino industry people come here and love it. Everyone gets along and great conversations are the norm.  This is now my \"go to\" bar. I will continue to go to Distill with my wife, family, and friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Christmas Eve to see mike Naugle. He is the best and I will follow him anywhere. I live in Henderson now, so I dont get to see him often. But whenever I'm on that side of town, I have to make a stop!! Love the atmosphere in there, the food is always good and everyone is always nice."}
{"text":"Brittany was AMAZING! On top of the  look of this place, she made my first time here an amazing experience. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place and it was sooo needed on this side of town! Great atmosphere and music! Our server was Nicole and she was amazing, attentive and knew the whole menu inside and out. I have a garlic allergy and she took the time to get out the recipe and talked to the chef Charles for every dish I was interested in. Best service I've had in a long time. The food was delicious not your typical bar food! I ended up getting the the Distill Margarita delicious and the 90s Fat boy burger and sweet potato fries, my husband tried the Beef tips with mash and whole carrots and asparagus and a red wine demi glaze and started with huge dinner salad. We had a great time thanks again Nicole you ROCK!!!!! We will be back for sure. Next time to try happy hour food and drinks!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local bars. The graveyard bartender scott is super friendly and provides awesome service every time I am in. Distill has the best bar food. Their buffalo cauliflower is my go to. I've had it other places, but no place is as good as this place!"}
{"text":"Brittany was incredible!! Soooooo friendly and vibrant!! She was extremely professional and knowledgeable on the menu and had all the best options of the night  food was great and I will definitely be returning again! Service was impeccable! Thanks again Brittany!!"}
{"text":"A nice addition to our corner of the Las Vegas Valley, we finally had an opportunity to try Distill for dinner.  When you walk through the front door, you are met with the option of going into the bar area, or choosing to dine in the Restaurant only area. We decided on the latter as it was more of what we were in the mood for. The sound from the bar does not carry over to the restaurant, which for us was a nice touch.  Distill has a pretty large menu and has just about anything you can imagine. They also offer a very fair priced happy hour menu as well. For dinner, Karen ordered the Grilled Cheese with Brisket sandwich which came with a side (she went with onion rings). She also ordered a side salad which was bigger than you would expect. For me, I ordered off of their 24/7 breakfast menu, an 8 oz NY steak & eggs to be specific. My meal also came with the choice of toast and a decent size serving of hash browns.   Overall, the food was really good along with the service. There are plenty of TV's in the bar area and 2 large screens in the restaurant area. This is a great addition to the NW part of Las Vegas and I know we will visit again."}
{"text":"horrible service! i called in a to go order and got put on hold for 5 min the first time, 3 min the 2nd time and hung up on the last time. when i finally got thru it seemed as though i was bothering them. my bf went into get the food and was ignored by 2 different bartenders while they played on their phones and so he left without our food! i work in the industry and would never ignore a customer especially trying to give u business! used to like this place but now we are done! get it together people! mind u this is a monday nite and they weren't slightly even busy"}
{"text":"Here is a joke for you... An Asian and a Mexican walk into a bar.  They say hi to the bartender on the way in to make sure she knows they are there.  They sit for 10 minutes and nobody approaches.  There is the bartender and a bar back tending to the bar.  No call to anyone.  No one gets a server.  It's like they don't exist.  Finally, they walk out, walking right past the bartender.  She looks down and pretends they don't exist.  Not one word.  Where is the joke?  The service, or lack thereof at Distill.  This is the second time this has happened, last time with a different bartender.    It the service industry.  FAIL.  If it was once, it could be an anomaly.  Twice in two visits?  That is incompetence.  Is it totally her fault?  No, it has to be lousy management/ownership.  You just have to read the reviews to figure out why your scores are bad.  Drop your arrogance and fix it.  All these reviewers aren't wrong."}
{"text":"LOUD!  TOO LOUD!!  My guy and I came here with another couple because our friends have been wanting to check out this \"local bar\".  The music was so loud, that we had to speak in raised voices the entire time we were there and STILL could barely hear each other. Clearly, everyone else in the place had a hard time hearing each other as well. Most of the people were leaning in to talk/yell to/at each other. All those people yelling over the unnecessarily loud music just makes the entire bar/restaurant even noisier.   We sat at a nice four top, which was clean and were greeted very quickly. Our poor waitress was very sweet and smiled a lot as she yelled \"HI CAN I START YOU OFF WITH A DRINK?!?!\"  I had the \"Mad Mule\", a specialty house cocktail. (Citron vodka, mixed with \"fresh lime juice\", simple syrup, orange bitters, and ginger beer.)  With this kind of ingredient list this cocktail should be awesome, but it was just ok. I will have to try something else if we ever go back.   Distill has a big variety of sliders to try, but we went with something simple. The \"Bacon Cheese Burger sliders\". Sadly, not much to write about, they were just average.  The best thing we had all night were the \"Mashed Potato Bites\". They take mashed potatoes and mix them with cheddar, pepper jack and parmesan cheeses then add a \"blend of spices\". They roll them into bite sized balls, then bread crumbs and fry them. I recommend trying those if you eat here.    I'm giving our server 5 stars as she somehow got our order completely correct over all the noise. She was attentive, smiling, easily split the check for us between two cards AND said \"I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!!\"  Maybe...maybe not."}
{"text":"So I am only giving this place 3 stars because of the pm guy bartender.. he is just not nice there is one that's nice Scotty and the Chelsea 5 stars for those two. The food is good always hot. The bother bartender is just so shot and rude. Careless not friendly at all and we go there all the time and the first thing we think is oh man what bartender is it.."}
{"text":"On the next episode of Cougar Town...I mean wow, this place is it in Southern Highlands for social action. Place was packed!  Used to be an Italian place which was pretty bad, Distill certainly upped the ante with the whole reclaimed wood, Edison bulb feel that seems to be the go to look for a restaurant that wants to be \"different.\" Layout is clean, good place to watch games with multitude of screens, pool tables, and an enclosed dining area.   My food experience was a bit of a letdown though. Had the fish tacos with it being rubbery and over seasoned. My wife had probably the most disappointing fish and chips ever--soggy and greasy. I mean, it's fried guys, hard to mess up. We have a theory that it sat at the pass and just drowned in its own oil. The positive was service where they recognized our displeasure and comped us the meals. I'm going to give them a pass and will try them again, chalk it up to it being new.   Anyway, they are trying. Next time I'll just sit at the bar, have drinks, and enjoy the view...rraaar."}
{"text":"Menu sounds good but portion size and execution totally disappoint. I dont mind paying more for good food but one order of fried mushroom shouldnt have 6 mushrooms two of which are the size of a quarter.   Food was pricier than normal pubs.. kind of yard house feeling But portions were like small plates Wine pours are small  Mixed drinks are weak  This place was a great addition to the area and want to love it. But after both first and second time its just a disappointment and 3 people $100 later just sooo not worth it.   Stop being so stingy with your portions"}
{"text":"Little gem of a place with friendly staff and yummy food. Only complaint would be portion sizes. I like to bring food home and I usually don't have much leftover... smaller portions compared to other places, but delicious."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Very pretty and the bartenders were great, we ordered little doggies and avocado egg rolls, both were delicious! We will definitely  be returning."}
{"text":"I'll give it 3.5 stars overall. I've been here 3 times now, once around 7pm, once at 4am, and once at 3pm for college hoops. First time, sat at the bar, ordered the mule drink and a chicken dinner. Cute bartender took our order for drinks, then disappeared...finally another one took our meal order. Chicken had good flavor, lots of food on the plate, but was a touch dry. My friend has the tacos, he enjoyed them and got full on 3.  2nd time came in a bit drunk with a couple friends. Not too many people there except the bar/wait staff off work. Had the chicken fried steak breakfast and it was pretty good. My friends didn't win any money so they went home early and unhappy.  3rd time came in with a group of 3 other friends, we had some cocktails and some chips/salsa while watching the college hoop games. TV's are a little weird if you sit at the hightop table. Our waitress was fantastic, gave us a free beer (mistake) and a free philly cheesesteak sandwich (another mistake). We all had a good time.  Drink orders were a bit slow to start with, and a glass of water had to come from someone different which is strange. The place was relatively busy and I didn't notice it being smoky. I guess the only reason I'm downgrading to 3.5 stars was the slow service on visit 1 and 3, and the chicken not being that great. I guess I'm used to really good food. This was typical normal bar food and nothing special."}
{"text":"Desiree was our server, my fiancé and I stopped in for a couple appetizers. We were beyond impressed with our service and our servers positive attitude. Great food and even better customer service!"}
{"text":"So happy they finally opened a place like this in centennial hills. I came after work with my co workers and enjoyed happy hour with a $5 glass of white sangria. The decor is so cute and they have really pretty wall decor. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Had a great time!! Will be back, the cinnamon/ orange infused whiskey is awesome!! Brian is a great bartender, pores a great drink!! Not to smokey, really good \"bar\" food!! A must check out!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch with friends at the bar. The bartenders a really nice and attentive but the food is lacking. The pretzel bites were way too chewy and tasted microwaved and the dipping sauces were not good. Hoping the kitchen improves as it's a good location and the staff are nice."}
{"text":"Location is a bit random I think. The place is half the size or even smaller than the Summerlin location. It was super duper loud on Friday night, to the point that you need to yell to talk to someone next to you. I don't know why it was so loud. Either way, it's the same old. Drinks are actually reasonably priced. I think a vodka tonic is $6 and long islands were $7.   Would I come back? I think not. Not a bad place to come with some friends to hang out. It was nice that you can sit."}
{"text":"I went here specifically to try the \"Cure\" burger. I saw some legit reviews, and also was on the hunt for the best burger in Las Vegas.   Cure burger - 2 star.   I was unfortunately disappointed. The burger tasted as though it was missing something. I found the meat patty itself to lack flavor, the other additions in the burger fell a bit short. There was some sweetness to it, but it was needing either a tad bit more, or some contrasting flavor to bring it out, which I didn't experience.   The only assumption I can make is that, it was a busy night with a major game, and happy hour time. I don't know if it was cooked differently than if I had come at a less busy time. I hate writing this review, since I was looking forward to this burger.   Chipotle Chicken Nachos- 3 star. Average nachos. The chips though, were delicious, and I'd probably come back and get the chips and dip or the chips and salsa as the salsa was VERY fresh and delicious.  I do want to note that I LOVE the interior design of this place. The outside patio is gorgeous, and if the weather isn't too hot or too cold, it'd be such a great place to sit and dine with friends. Inside, there was an area where there was a huge couch, and a tv right in front, almost as though you are watching a game from home. So brilliant!  Service was a 5 star.   For some drinks and game days, this place is ideal."}
{"text":"We came to Distill on a Saturday afternoon. Absolutely starved. I mean, I'm withering away at this point.  They put me on a commercial telling people that for only 50 cents a day, they could help me... Then A beautiful bartender named Nicole clearly saw that I was in dire need of food. She recommended some turkey waffles. I have never heard of such a contraption. But the way she described the succulent Turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry, gravy, and syrup topped on a breakfast waffle had my mouth watering.  I didn't need a menu. I ordered before she was even done explaining what it was. This is Thanksgiving on a waffle the week before Thanksgiving. This was the best invention at the best bar in town. Thanks Nicole!"}
{"text":"Great spot, nice decor. Not smokey which is a huge plus for a gaming bar. The menu looks great and they serve breakfast all day. My only knock....how in the world do you not have any Mexican beer on draft? It's the little things;-)"}
{"text":"My favorite local bar in my neighborhood. Great atmosphere, good service, and an outstanding happy hour. They have a great rewards program too that will get you free food in no time!"}
{"text":"It's a bit off the beaten path but can't be missed when taking Decatur south towards southern highlands. I was greeted by the adorable daytime bartender Nicole, who was super bubbly and attentive and got straight to pouring my mimosa. The menu looks delicious but I can't lie, I'm a simple bacon and eggs girl, and by simple I mean PERFECT bacon, crispy hash browns, and eggs- country scrambled. My food came out perfectly, the service was friendly and amazing and I even hit a jackpot! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went in to distill tonight and Mikey made me feel like home. I will be coming back here for sure. Whatever drink you ask for he can make !"}
{"text":"Great food!!! The style of the place is amazing! They even decorated for Halloween! It's now my new Friday night out  bar !!"}
{"text":"A big group of us got together to celebrate the holidays as well as a good friend's birthday. The atmosphere is casual and they were kind enough to set up reserve signs for our party. Our server was prompt and organized with separate tabs. The food and drink service was quick and exact. We have been here before and we will return again. Thanks for hosting us distill!"}
{"text":"I love hanging out and drinking at this bar. If anyone goes to Distill try the potato bites.  They are so delicious."}
{"text":"Havent been in to my favorite bar in a while and I missed it.  Elliott and Nicole we're awesome by far my favorites this place kills it try the IPA shrimp it's fantastic all around ghr food and service is beyond great"}
{"text":"Been here on and off since it opened. I dealt with their weekend grave guy at a different bar and was u happy with him, but gave him another chance. My husband and I each threw in 50 to our machines maxed bet and had two drinks and two apps and got charged for everything. I don't think everything should have been comped but maybe a drink or two?!? He stood staring as we looked at the check. Like I said bad experience in the past with him.. You can never get his attention unless you shout for drinks and your check good luck. Last time dealing with him and last time at distill."}
{"text":"This is our local spot. Extremely comfortable setting with great service. It just feels like a really, laid back, neighborhood spot. The beer and drink selection is great. Only suggestion would be to get a better happy hour food selection."}
{"text":"I had just moved back to the city a month prior, and a friend of mine suggested we meet here for a drink to catch up. When I was in high school this place was Agave (a Mexican restaurant), and now it's completely revamped into a great local spot! The outdoor patio is super cute with string lights and comfy seating areas, and the inside is decorated very nicely as well. The restrooms even say \"For those who sit\" and \"For those who stand,\" haha. Especially compared to the other 24 hour local bars around the city, I would have to say this is my favorite.   The only reason I took off a star is because I ordered the sweet potato french fries (which were INCREDIBLE - they even came with their own maple/brown sugar dipping sauce) and I guess there was a miscommunication between the bartender and the kitchen, because I had to ask about 20 minutes later where my fries were. My friend said she's never had that happen to her before, so I assume it must've been a fluke. The bartender was very apologetic and immediately went to the kitchen to see what had happened. Other than that, this place was great! I'll absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place. Far better than your PTs or Sierra Golds. Been 3 times since opening and each time the food is great and service is on point.  Love their chicken wings, pot pie and fried pickles. Surprisingly the Salsa is one of my favorites. Better than 99% of the Mexican joints around here. Anyway highly recommend this bar and excited this area of town finally has some good options for dinner."}
{"text":"Great local bar! Great service, especially if you get Rhea. She is amazing and sweet and just a great server. The drinks were great and the food was delicious. Loved the filet mignon sliders. They are all over the city but this one is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I stopped in the day after the grand opening to redeem my complimentary burger I got for being a member of their loyalty club. There was a wait to get a machine, which I always find bizarre!  I found an empty spot at the bar and ordered while waiting for one to open up.   I had the Fat Boy burger, with bacon, cheddar, avocado and fries. I ordered it medium rare and it came mostly rare. The bottom of the bun was close to burnt too. Since I was in a hurry and it didn't taste awful, I didn't send it back. I did mention to one of the employees at the bar that the bun was burnt, and she looked at it and confirmed. I received no offer to send it back or an apology. Not a good sign for a new business! The employees were friendly overall. I had a draft beer, a Stone pale ale, which is a quality choice to have on draft.   If you're a gamer, they offer $10 in play after playing $20 for joining the slot club. I not only got that $10 but $5 for the instant bonus game (Lotto Bucks) and another $10 for I have no idea what. For my $20 buy in, I got an extra $25 in free play. Not bad! A guy next to me hit $500 playing video poker. Too many people were smoking, and yes that is to be expected. The price you pay for free food!   I didn't see any advertising for their loyalty card, although there may have been something on the happy hour menu- I didn't look at that. The parking was pretty messy as most spaces were full and I didn't want to explore the underground parking that signs around the business were pointing to."}
{"text":"This location has a pretty decent patio, and when the weather cooperates, it's a nice option as it's pretty dark inside. The bar is the focus of the indoor area, and it's a poker bar. They offer a selection of specialty martinis and other cocktails, and the few I've tried have been good. One of their burgers, the hangover cure or something, won a best burger award from Thrillist. I had it and it was very good. I recently had the Italian sandwich, which was pretty tasty as well.   Their 3rd Anniversary Luau party was a decent event, with a free buffet & drink specials. On the buffet was teriyaki beef, chicken & macadamia crusted mahi as well as macaroni salad, green salad & macadamia cookies. The free photos offered at the party was a nice touch also. They were photo booth style on a green screen with multiple backgrounds available, and the three of us enjoyed getting a few pics.   Distill also has a yearly 80s party, which was really nice the first year, with plenty of 80s decor. They handed out sunglasses, buttons, etc. to accessorize with. The 3rd 80s party, held in May this year, didn't compare to previous ones. They do have themed drink specials during the parties, such as Long Islands, lemon drop martinis and various beer specials.  The building has been though Agave, then Dos Caminos and now Distill. The current decor can't compare to Agave, and I'm still not over their destruction of the pink Agave building."}
{"text":"Okay, so I shouldn't review a bar/restaurant on opening night but I'm here now and no one else is doin' it. Glitch #1:  the LVRJ ad said: Food! Fun! Prizes for the first 100 people!\"  I really didn't think we'd be in that coveted swag group even though we got there at 6:40. But seeing that Distill was re-distilling in the space occupied by the late, lamented Agave Restaurant, a cavernous place, we didn't expect to be fighting for wall space. How'd this happen?  They opened at 4:30!  What happened to truth in advertising??  They did have a buffet station set up, with pizza, round potato bites, beef strips and all the fixings for fajitas, chicken & artichoke dip, bruschetta, and jumbo shrimp for shrimp cocktail. The fajitas were very good, the potato puffs were delicious, but the rest was just okay.   Finally we snagged a booth, and except for the demo girls handing out Royal Crown & Jack Daniels' Tennessee Honey samples & some cute t-shirts, we couldn't snag a server even to clear the table, let alone slake our parched palates. Servers are also bussers, which didn't help speed things up. And the bar was backed up with drink orders. They definitely could benefit from a second bar.   We did manage to fill up on the free offerings, so I'll reserve my food critique until next time. We checked out the menu, with its standard assortment of appetizers, salads, burgers, and sandwiches, and prices are pretty reasonable. But the Happy Hour (3-6 pm and 3-6 am - catering to early joggers?) menu is completely unimaginative and eminently skippable.   I'll update my review and impressions of the food after all the excitement dies down (and hopefully the noise - this place is jet-takeoff LOUD!!!!!), but my initial impressions are just ho-hum."}
{"text":"I went to Distill last Friday night for happy hour.  Good crowd.  Nichole the bar tender was very nice.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I've ever had in Las Vegas. We waited to put our order in with the bartender and after 30 mins she finally went back to check on our food and came back to say it would be a few mins more...there was only 6 people if that in the place...we got up and left...asked another customer on the way out and she said the same thing...apparently they weren't ready to be open...and on top of that they don't take reservations....so I will take my 20 veterans else where....on a positive note the ice tea was good...I would have liked a refill but 3 people sitting at the bar were to much for her to handle..."}
{"text":"Ooooof, I really really wanted to like this place. Especially since it's so close to where I live, it's open 24 hrs, and has the cutest outdoor decor ever!   Unfortunately, it was just kinda sad.....the music they played was meh, the food they served was barely edible, and there was a cricket just hanging out on the wall behind our table (we were seated inside in the \"restaurant\" area...ick...also, our server herself was so afraid of the bug, one of my party had to kill it).  I will say that it was fairly packed in the bar area and seems popular enough amongst the locals?   I might come back when I'm itching for a drink at like 10am...but otherwise, I'm sure I can find better places to go for a casual drink."}
{"text":"March 20, Monday at 5 PM a group of us went in there to celebrate and check out happy hour. Extremely disappointed with the food. Everything we order had soooo much salt on it. It was awful . Everybody asked me how it was and I had to explain to them that I was sick the following day from so much salt on the food. I would never recommend this place. Every time the waitress brought us something we explained to her that the food was extremely salty and she did nothing except smile and walk away.  WTF I was upset that I had to add one star because they have no negative stars as an option."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this bar but I find it overrated. The prices for drinks I feel are pretty high, for what the place is I'd rather go to a Timbers or PTs. The place is normally pretty busy, plenty of places to sit. Only two pool tables, which are usually taken. Servers/bartenders always friendly."}
{"text":"this is the greatest bar that you can go to in southern highlands. the staff is good and the drinks are tasty. it's down a secret road so you can hide from the coppers."}
{"text":"I've been living in the area by South Point for the last couple years and haven't had anywhere nearby to hang out since I'm not really into the casino and tourists scene.  Distill's changed that for me, though!  Minutes from where I live and a great atmosphere.  You've got a good-sized bar in the middle, some tables and lounge-type chairs along the outside walls and a couple of pool tables just outside of the separate dining room area.  I stopped by for their grand opening last week around midnight.  Missed the main crowd but it was still super busy.  Despite the volume of people I had no trouble getting up to the bar and being served in a timely manner.  Went back again today for lunch and tried the Western Bacon Burger with fries and washed it down with the Redd's Apple Ale they have on tap.  Delish!  I've only been waited on by two people so far, one of them my friend Kristina who's been serving me for close to a year now, but it seems like everybody on the staff is on top of their game, friendly and happy to work there.  That's a big plus because I've been to my share of bars in this town where there's drama going on with the employees and employers and that just kills the vibe for me.  Distill's a great place and one of my new favorite hang-out spots!"}
{"text":"My favorite local bar by far!! I come here way more often than I should - so much so that I consider it a second home (oops). The food is delicious, but most importantly, the bartenders are the best!! Because of my work schedule, I come mostly during graveyard hours and Rob is seriously the best. He's friendly, attentive, and makes awesome drinks. When I have the opportunity to come on other shifts, bartenders Billy, Chanel, Megs, Teanne, Rick, and Mike make it a wonderful experience! In the words of Toby Keith, \"I love this bar\"."}
{"text":"First of all I love the outside decor. At night when everything is lit up it feels like I popped into a tree house party. If you're a sports fan inside is the place to be, but you'll find me outside here anytime of year. Had a great meal here yesterday. We had the chips and salsa and mashed potato bites - both were delicious.  Happy Hour counts on Saturday so I had the red sangria- and as recommended it was tasty! For dinner we had the grilled shrimp tacos and the Distill chicken sandwich. Both were very well done and delicious. They are working on new menu updates so I'll be back to see what else they come up with.   The staff was super attentive and friendly. Kudos to Connie and Tony for taking such great care of us. This is a great spot in the sometimes pretentious Summerlin neighborhood- down to earth and great food."}
{"text":"It's definitely a plus that this bar is so close, and so far the service has been good and the menu is really great. Definitely looking forward to industry Wednesdays after 10PM, awesome food and drink specials with your industry ID. Favorite thing on the menu: Avocado Egg Rolls $7.99, Mashed Potato Bites are good too. Yum! Of course they are still working out some kinks, and I'm not super crazy about their beer selection, but I will hopefully be able to update to 5 stars soon. Yay for a new local bar!"}
{"text":"Local bar with great drink prices and a cool ambiance. The bartenders are all friendly. It's a pretty big bar. Plenty of seats. 2 pool tables. There's a restaurant section. There is also tables around the bar for when the restaurant section is unavailable. Seems like it's pretty busy weekend nights but you'd still find a few ppl during the week days."}
{"text":"Walked into Distill and thought we'd walked into Eden. This is my first and last visit. Decent prices during football hrs so we were planning on being there at least 3 hrs. Until about maybe 30 mins into it when I was asked to move from a unique (1 of 2) machine at the bar so a woman (who had just won and cashed out a decent amount, I can assume at the other,) wanted to play where I was sitting. Not one for playing a a machine while my hands are dirty, due to the appetizer sampler that had arrive 5 mins prior, I was waiting to play until finished. Though my boyfriend next to me was playing his machine, and having already been asked if we were playing, I was asked to move to a different seat. Thoroughly upset I was too polite to say no and speak my mind.   Felt it appropriate to add as well the women's restroom was in poor order. One of the two stalls was not only out of paper but had toilet seat covers covering the floor of the stalls. As accidents and people happen, I would have not paid attention to this if weren't for the fact I could hear myself even speak out loud due to the loud music. I don't often mind this being in my mid 20's but really?  As good as the food was (reason for the 2nd star), and as regular as we would have become living and working just down the road, we won't be returning. Which is saddening since Molly's closed and the food was good.   Don't expect to stay in the seats you may choose or get common courtesy in this establishment unless it's from Brianna."}
{"text":"First the Likes. Liked the hamburger (it was tasty).  Liked the beer (it was cold).  But even with that I won't return but perhaps I'm just not the clientele they want.  I like a neighborhood pub with video poker, decent food, and a chill ambiance - this isn't the place for that.  that jukebox is nightclub-loud!  A good chunk of people were hollering to communicate with one another in perhaps an attempt to ensure they were being understood but it just added to the cacophony of the place.  Some people might dig that and feel at home in a place where you can't hear yourself think but that's not my thing.  What really soured my experience were other rowdy patrons.  Not rowdy in the fun way but rowdy in the obnoxious way.  People who angrily scream f-bombs in some sort of misguided attempt for attention.  Looking 'round, customers and staff all were clearly annoyed but no one from the bar took the initiative to quell the brewing storm.  I cashed out and bailed from what I saw as an inevitable confrontation between those folks and the patrons who came to have a good time."}
{"text":"Great service, loose machines, good food, cool atmosphere. What more do you want in a local bar! Also music on point!"}
