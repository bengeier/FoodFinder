{"text":"This place is great! A beautiful menu with a wide array of items to choose from. Whether you're just stopping by for soup (the borscht would be a great choice) or a light dinner (my personal favorite: Ahi Tuna), Restaurant Europa will not dissapoint! For dessert, I highly recommend the Chocolate crepes!"}
{"text":"Red Caviar served here. Best red pearls, butter and crackers since pre cold war days in Saint Petersburg. I Nina. I full woman. Never cross me."}
{"text":"The menu is large and has lots of options.  Many things seem very appetizing. 
The presentation of the food was very nice and looked good. However, the taste/quality just wasnt there.  The entree is served on a bed of sauteed and/or grilled vegetables that were overcooked/oily.  

In summary, there were some things we liked a lot.  Service was good.  The bread & butter is unique and delicious.  The atmosphere and decor are nice.  The food could be prepared better.  

However, I do intend to return at least 1 more time.  There were items on the menu that sounded so good, I really wanted to try them.  The menu is very unique and offers a good sampling of vegetarian & fish options.   I believe for all those reasons its worth another try."}
{"text":"Visted Restuarant Europa for the first time and I was very impressed!  The manager Rusty was warm and inviting making sure to check that we did not need anything. The atmosphere was great along with the food..I tried the mussels and fruit salad and oh my the Vodka Lounge....Rusty let me sample Limited absolute Miami and SanFransico vodka, all I can say is wow...I will definitely pick some up and the bottles are cute too.....they also had a violinist playing....I will definitely be back.  Great to check out"}
{"text":"This restaurant needs to make some solid improvements in both its  service -- more & better capable serve staff is needed.  The kitchen  staff, if the person preparing dishes is using the term  \"chef\" the ownership has not properly evaluated or needs to shake up what they have. Sauces  are to compliment/enhance  a dish not hide. Our party of 6 had unequal quality, acceptable, okay, & barely tolerable.
Unfortunately, the \"server\" did nothing to resolve  our concerns except agree that we didn't  have a good experience.
They did not make us feel  as though we would want to give this place  a second  chance"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:
- there was a live violinist! he was awesome and played some upbeat classical music as well as some soothing, romantic ones
- clean, spacious, nicely decorated
- somewhat busy that night (Friday 7 pm - 8:30 pm) and seems to be popular with an older crowd.
- noise level: moderate, lively 

Service:
We had a decent waitress. I noticed that the servers wait until customers are finished eating their current dish before serving the next dish.  This is nice touch since many servers often serve the food too early and interrupt the customers while they're trying to finish up their soups/salads/appetizers, but the entrees end up being served cold.  This happened on to me on two separate visits with two different waitresses. 

Food:

Mussels appetizer (photo included)
Somewhat citrus-y, but lacked flavor overall. It wasn't overcooked or under-cooked, and the portions (~ 6 mussels)  were decent.

Borscht (photo included)
This soup was actually really delicious. It basically tasted like tomato soup with sour cream and a lot of veggies.  My Russian bf said it was pretty good as well. I would definitely order this again.

Lamb rack (photo included)
As I mentioned earlier, the server may have waited until we were finished with our soup/appetizer to bring out our entrees so the meals weren't served hot/warm. The lamb rack came with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes - both were tasty, but the lamb rack lacked flavor in my opinion. My bf enjoyed it, however. The only positive thing about the lamb was that it wasn't dry.

Lobster ravioli (photo included)
Despite being served cold, this dish was quite palatable. I really enjoyed the stuffing since I could actually taste a lot of lobster meat.  

Overall, I had a nice dining experience. The live music is probably the best aspect of this restaurant.  The dishes are a bit pricey and I haven't been wowed by any of their dishes, but I'd like to come back and try some of their drinks and maybe take a free salsa lesson (free lessons are on Friday 8:30 - 9:00 pm)."}
{"text":"This place is truly located in a unassuming storefront, as one of the other reviewers noted.  We nearly drove right past it.  

Wanting to try something different, we were intrigued by the thought of Russian food.  So our journey began.  This is a low key place with good food and great service. Sue, our waitress, was outstanding.  She explained various parts of the menu, and even brought out some samples for us to try. 

Onto the food: 
Bread with olive butter, and salmon cream cheese.  Superb!
Escargot, and frog legs for appetizers. Delish!
Borscht soup: tastes like home.  
Duck Breast and Salmon Gratin.  Amazing.

Needless to say we were in a food coma by the time we left.

We will be coming back.  There are more foods we wanted to try, but frankly out bellies couldn't handle anymore intake!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the location -- this is without a doubt one of the best restaurants in Cleveland, in my opinion. We dined here this evening and, despite the fairly empty dining room, had an awesome time. Started off with the fresh, hot bread with addicting butter accompaniments - smoked salmon, olive, and plain butter. Absolutely delicious. Someone had the soup special, mushroom, and it was rich and hearty.  At our table two people had the chicken entree, another the stuffed cabbage, and I had the meatloaf Wellington. Everyone raved about the food and mine was unctuous and very satisfying. The roasted or pan fried green beans were a hit as well. Service was outstanding as well - very attentive and super friendly. Couldn't ask for more - will definitely be returning whenever I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday for dinner with my husband and to use a Groupon I had purchased (1 appetizer, 2 soups/salads, 2 entrees, 1 dessert for $39).  I am so glad I bought it because it ended up being a fun evening and a fantastic deal.  The place was pretty empy when we arrived, but was starting to fill up by the time we left for \"Tango night.\"  Our waiter was exceptionally helpful, friendly, and attentive.

First we got a basket of warm fresh bread with a trio of spreads - green olive butter, regular butter, and smoked salmon cream cheese.  These were amazing and I think the highlight of my entire meal.  We had the beef-filled potato pancakes appetizer, which were soft and flavorful.  My husband got the matzo ball soup and I had the borsht, and we were both pleased with our selections.  He had the lobster tail entree, and I had the Russian Schnitzel.  They were both good.  Mine was very rich and heavy, and I don't think we even managed to eat half of it between the two of us.  For dessert we had some kind of ricotta cheese and raisin blini with apple topping, which was very good.

I was really excited reading one of the previous reviews about the family style dining that includes unlimited house wines.  Before we even came to try it, I was planning to come back later with my friends for that.  But the menu doesn't mention anything about beverages for the family style option, so I'm not sure if they changed their policy on that.  

Not sure if I'll ever make it back here (due to location), but I certainly would be happy if I did."}
{"text":"Family reunion dinner. They needed more servers for a group our size. Otherwise we were all blown away both by how good the food was and how much there was of it. My faves were chicken schnitzel and beef goulash. Some wonderful salmon dishes."}
{"text":"Decent place for Russian Fare in Cleveland. 

It's located above the Ceviche nightclub, which makes it a great spot to get a bite before heading down for some Salsa or Tango. 

The service was fairly good, with food being bought out immediately. My one issue was with the caviar I ordered - the caviar was massively oversalted, and when I pointed this out to the waitress she suggested that (being Indian) I didn't quite know what caviar was meant to taste like and the dish was fine. It took me convincing her that I had eaten caviar multiple times before (having a bevy of eastern european and russian friends) and another table with a Russian couple sending their caviar back to convince her that my caviar was no good and ought to be taken of my bill.

Other than that, the food was really good! The panko crusted tilapia with almonds was delicious! Definitely worth a one time visit at least."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon and couldn't have been happier with all of the food we got for $39. 

First they started us with bread and 3 great butters. We got the mussels to start as an appetizer and then I had the Borscht and my wife had the French onion soup which were both very good as well. 

For dinner I ordered the ahi tuna and my wife got the twin lobster tails that ended up being 3, both of which were great!

Lastly we got the chocolate creeps for dessert. 


We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere with a guy playing live violin over background music.  The Moscow Mule cocktail wasn't anything to write home about...the version of that drink is WAY better at Velvet Tango Room.  Onto the food...portions are very generous.  The smoked pork chop with apples and the short ribs were both good.  The short ribs were a little on the fatty side (required some landscaping) and the sundried tomato rice pilaf it came with was slightly undercooked.  Service was friendly but somewhat slow.  It gets crowded on a Friday night.  Unless you want to sit at a table practically in the middle of the dance floor in front of the guy playing music, make a reservation so you get a booth."}
{"text":"When we drove up to restaurant Europa for the first time, it wasn't what we expected it to be. Restaurant Europa is in a big plaza, and appears to be pretty small from the outside. When you go in the first door, you'll walk down a short hallway to another door which enters into the front of the restaurant. They offer an extensive menu featuring various European entrees. Our server told us about some of their most popular meals, which included the pork schnitzel, stuffed cabbage and a few other things I can't remember. We decided to start off splitting a seafood crepe. It had crab and cheese on the inside, with an Alfredo sauce on the outside. I was kind of worried that it would have a fake seafood taste to it, but it was actually really good. For my entree, I went with the pork schnitzel. It was much bigger than I expected, and had a creamy mushroom sauce on top. It included a side of potatoes, which were sort of similar to a potato chip, but cut thicker. They had several desserts that sounded amazing, but we were already so full, we decided against them. We'll definitely be back to this place to try some of there other great European classics."}
{"text":"One of our favorite dinner locals for sure.  We love bringing friends to experience new food"}
{"text":"Definitely recommended to everyone I know.  Try to go with 4 or more people to take advantage of the family style dinner.  

About 8 salads and choice of 4 entrees, unlimited house wines, coffee, and soft drinks all included.  My favorite dishes are the schnitzel and meatloaf wellington.  

Go with some stretchy pants because you will be stuffed after.  Beautiful violin music to dine by as well.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I dined there in May 4, and the very very nice bar tender suggested the double lobster special. The Lobster tails were cooked very well, but the veggies were dry and tasteless. I loved the butter selection: one is a lox, the other one is plain butter, and the third one is a olive tapenade butter. The live music is a nice touch, but the customer service was outstanding."}
{"text":"So, some good friends had a Groupon and we decided to try out this amazing place nestled in Pepper Pike. I've had Russian foods before, but this was quite the experience. 

Europa is nestled off of a large traffic circle in Pepper Pike, inside of an unassuming storefront. We were ushered into a place with deep, rich woods and copper accents. The place felt like we'd stepped into a place of foreign tastes. We were not wrong. 

After being seated, the waiter, a genial fellow, showed us the \"Vodka Tasting Room\", an old walk-in freezer revamped with furs and frost to be the perfect environment (complete with a rack of old fur coats in varying sizes,) to try out a variety of vodkas in the \"proper environment\", which was apparently Siberia in deep winter. A very nice touch. 

We got a family meal deal, which sounds like something from the Golden Arches, until you realize that for this deal (ranging from about 25 to 35 dollars a person,) was for a MASSIVE number of appetizers (relishes, pickled items, Russian potato salad, a beet salad to die for, etc.) All told we got about six of those, shared between four people, plus ample baskets of bread and butter. 

If that didn't fill us up enough, we were then treated to schnitzel, meat loaf wellington and a spiced chicken with apples on a bed of Quinoa. All told, we were stuffed and happy, and the food was WONDERFUL. The service was also great; our glasses were never empty, our needs attended to constantly. 

I will say that prices were higher end, but it was WORTH IT; good food is not cheap, and this was most definitely good. 

They have lot parking out front, but my suggestion is to car pool...and get a designated driver because the food comas you're going to gratefully suffer will make it IMPERATIVE that a qualified driver escort you to home:) 

So, if you're flying by, land on (Restaurant) Europa, and stay for a meal that will take you out of this world in this Russian paradise."}
{"text":"And then, let's talk about the food.

Foie gras was overcooked; but they were kind enough to replace it with more appropriately seared Foie gras.  Served with seared, split grapes, it was edible, but not delectable.

We also had Blinis, which were rather good.  Cheese and grapes, Mushroom, and chicken were the insides of the three that came in a set.  

The chicken Kiev was remarkably dense, though not terribly oily.  Dry meat, however was not to my liking.  The dipping sauce made some amends, but I'm not sure I like meat so dry.

We had a Russian ravioli, fried.  Also dry, with a gravy dipping sauce.  

-------

I'm not a connoisseur of Russian cuisine, so it's really hard for me to come down decisively on this venue.  For all I know, this is incredibly authentic food.  If it is, it's not for me.  I might go back for the Vodka room, but it will be a long time before I head in for Russian foodstuffs.

If you know of superior Russian food, please let me know, I'll go immediately.

On the other hand, in a conversation yesterday, a Russian acquaintance of mine related to me that the quintessential Russian \"restaurant\" equivalent really centers on the availability of alcohol, and a space to party."}
{"text":"Came here to this Russian + American fusion restaurant with the hubs with a groupon that was a gift from a friend (thanks, friend!) Our groupon came with an appetizer and two entrees. I was eager to try Russian food. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience.

For the appetizer, we ordered pickled vegetables. Seems like every culture has its own version of pickled vegetables, and we enjoy most of them! Our came with shredded carrots, tomatoes, and long slivers of pickle. The pickled carrot had a nice kick and it was definitely our favorite. Our server told us that to the Russians, the tomatoes were the best because it went the best with vodka!

Onto the entrees. The hubs ordered the pork chop and I ordered the Maine lobster tail (with an extra cost of $5, since it wasn't part of the groupon deal.) I was grateful that the owner accommodated us with the lobster. Both came with carrots and pilaf/mashed potatoes. My husband had a hard time with the pork chop - it was pretty salty and it had the taste of ham. It was a mix of salty and sweet, with the chopped apple topping. The lobster I had was pretty plentiful (3 tails!) but I could tell it wasn't the freshest lobster ever. I have the feelings that a lot of the food is not the freshest fare - maybe frozen or otherwise. Much of the food reminded me of a dorm cafeteria, unfortunately...

The best part was our server. She was kind, attentive, accommodating...and she really wanted to make sure that we had a good time. 

They do have an ice bar and a large party room - probably fun for large and rowdy family parties. :)"}
{"text":"The food is carefully and meticulously crafted. Everything was fresh and the items on the plate complemented the main entree. The service was prompt, friendly and not rushed. The location is in an out of the way strip mall but well worth going to. The specialities are Eastern European, but the conventional  fare is done expertly as well.

We were passing through and wished that we could hitch this place to our car and take it home with us!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a small strip mall, the entrance of this place was marginally difficult to find. The decor inside is nice, and the staff are cordial. The place had almost nobody in it, but I wouldn't be alarmed by that. Their website says on weekends you need reservations but I don't think that's the case for weekdays. 

For appetizers, we got the borscht and shrimp crepes. The crepes were really hot and burned my tongue, but the waitress explicitly warned me so I'll put that one on me. It was delicious and cheesy (?), as was the soup. You get free bread with the meal. I got the tuna, and we got the duck. Both were prepared beautifully and tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in everything - the food, the service and the ambience. I ordered two appetizers - eggplant and russian salad. My friend had borsch and pelmeni. The waitress brought the borch and non of my appetizers. So I had to sit and wait while my friend was eating. I wanted to try an exotic russian drink and ordered The Tzar. It basically was vodka with a tiny spoon of red caviar inside the drink. It Supposed to come with olives too but they didn't put it in. It was a terrible  drink - when caviar dissolved it looked like mucus in vodka. I sipped a couple of times and sent it back. The waitress said that I can order something else but she will charge me $12 fir this drink. The food came in 30 minutes - two appetizers. Eggplants were ok but the Russian salad looked and tasted like it was made a week ago. Discomposed vegetables with indigestible chicken. I had to look for that chicken very hard - because it was nearly no chicken. My friend got pelmeni - out of the box for $14. The ambience is nothing - random colors and few samovars on the walls. I couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"I love Russian food, so we went out of our way to try this restaurant. The service was good, and the decor was modern, which impressed my husband - who's now been to many Russian restaurants in the US. Once the private party in the back room got going, the music was Russian too. 

I wasn't super thrilled with the menu, because there were so many American dishes on there; there's no shortage of other places to get American cuisine. The food was pretty good: the borsch was authentic-tasting, and the beef stroganoff (on mashed potatoes, not noodles) was good, though the olevye (Russian potato salad) didn't taste right to me. (To be clear, all the food was fresh, so I'm not questioning that.) There was a prix fixe option that's more like a standard Russian restaurant meal: a dozen or so appetizers and then a few entrees; you needed to be a table of 3+ to take advantage of it.

So, if you haven't had much Russian food before, this is a good way to ease yourself in. If you're Russian, just set your expectations appropriately for the menu."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and have always enjoyed what we ordered. The Kiev Chicken was great and borcht is always good. We've gone early on Sundays and it was a nice quiet eating experience."}
{"text":"Another visit on our Yelp Int'l Supper Club journey and very yummy!

When yelpers speak of \"hidden gems\" this is truly what they're talking about--meaning I had no idea this place even existed, let alone where the hell it was before my visit. 

Tucked away in a shopping plaza in Pepper Pike, Restaurant Europa is easy to pass by from the outside, but quite interesting on the inside. It's dark, dated to the early 90's with pink and teal splattered black plates. It was packed with lots of rich-looking old people. I mean, it was mid-week and at least 2-3 tables had a bottle of vodka sitting in a champagne bucket next to them. There is a \"live\" violinist, if you count a cassette tape playing the background music while a guy plays his violin over it. I found it kitschy and cute. There was also a tango class that began about 15 minutes into our meal which made getting to the restrooms rather difficult without getting waltzed over. But, again, it was kind of cute!

Service started out rather slow and then sped up a little as our meal progressed. I ordered a Moscow Mule (when in Rome) and it was pretty tasty. I could tell they actually used real ginger beer and lime juice--but it certainly packed a punch. Let's just say they know their vodkas and just booze in general. Speaking of, they have an ice room that's normally -10º, where they give you a fur coat and you can take shots of vodka. Our waiter explained it was temporarily out of order (just that day), but the owners are Siberian and the ice room was their tribute to their heritage! Pretty cool--I'd come back for that, alone!

Back to the food, I ordered some apps for the table, including potato latkes with smoked salmon and the pickle platter--all delicious. I'm Jewish (half) and I'm used to homemade potato latkes, trust me, these were good. I skipped the salmon, so I can't comment on that aspect. The pickle platter came with cucumbers, tomatoes and shredded carrots. Honestly, they were all good and you could tell the difference in pickling technique as you tasted each one. I think the carrots were actually my favorite! Our table also ordered some soups to start and I, of course, had to try the matzo ball. It was flavorful with light, fluffy matzo dumplings, tender chunks of white meat chicken, celery, onion and carrot. Definitely a fan. One of the yelpers ordered the borscht, and although he mentioned it was a different preparation than he was used to, he said it was still tasty. 

For our main entrees three of us ordered the stuffed cabbage and one the pork schnitzle (spelling?). I can say that my cabbage rolls were tender and very tasty, although a little sweeter in the sauce than I'm used to. Don't get me wrong, the sauce isn't sweet, just sweeter than my Mom's preparation, which is my favorite. But these were very good! The mashed potatoes were OK, nothing super special, and a little over-mashed/thin for my taste. I was so full after all the apps and soups that I could only finish half of one of the rolls--and the plate had three!

I'd definitely come back again, but I doubt I'd be a regular. Great Eastern European comfort foods, for sure. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised. When we walked into the place there was only one other couple so we figured, oh, oh! They opened at 4 and we went at 6. The place could use a little redecorating but then again it has a Russian theme. We did some appetizers, they had a chopped ahi tuna appetizer mixed with avocado and we also had escargot. Both were excellent and a very nice portion. Another 8 people arrived for dinner. We ordered, my wife had stuffed cabbage, granddaughter had the shrimp pasta and I decided on the scallops. All portions were very generous and quite flavorful. We would certainly do a return trip.

We had an excellent waiter named Rusty, you could couldn't ask for a more polite and accommodating server."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Really recommend this gem in Pepper Pike. Owners are first class and have an eclectic menu. Thank you so much and we'll be back a lot!"}
{"text":"The biggest mystery about this place is why it is not more popular.  We have been here several times with only one or two tables occupied.  Nice selection of Russian and Eastern European fare.  Good bar selection with very healthy pours on the wine and vodka - there is a decent selection of both.  Food is well prepared with huge portions.  We have always taken home some of the entree.  Great service.  The dining room is a bit dark and heavy.  There is some renovation going on at present.  We will continue to visit this place whenever we crave Eastern European comfort food."}
{"text":"Food was subpar and overpriced. The worst Caesar salad I ever had. They used ground Parmesan cheese. The ice bar was different and the wireless violin player was different. Nothing like the old Russian Tearoom!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! I just came back a second time after Groupon. We had beef-filled potato pancakes as an appetizer, duck was my main course and a chocolate crepe for dessert. All the flavors were amazing. The service is also great and I love the fresh bread they bring out with salmon butter, Olive butter and regular butter."}
{"text":"So I attended Restaurant Europa for an event, so I didn't try anything on the menu.  But this review is for more of the party room and the atmosphere.

The event that I attended was the Land before Rhyme event that was hosted in their basement party room.  The room was really cute and set the mood for the open mic/poetry slam event.  I could really see myself possibly using this space for a birthday/social gathering in the future.  

We had our own private bar area with two bar attendants.  The downside of this, was that they seemed to now really want to be there.  Another downfall was that the bathrooms were very small, hot, and not very well lit.  Other than that the place had a very hip/trendy ambience about it.  I want to go back to checkout the food and drink menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Bartender was knowledgeble w/great customer service, (can't remember his name), the Russian Schnitzel was delicious, inviting atmosphere, but the kicker is the Siberian Vodka Ice Room! They have furs and Ushankas for you to put on and enjoy shots some of the best vodkas! Will be going back:)"}
{"text":"Europa is a total gem! It's my general go-to whether I'm looking to grab a drink, a meal, or hit up the salsa bar on the weekends (I don't really dance, but it's a fun crowd to be around and I've definitely made a few friends). The food is great - my boyfriend's favorite is the Russian Schnitzel and I recently enjoyed the Chicken Obuolys. The menu is updated with a dish or two pretty often which I love. Last year, I hosted my boyfriend's birthday at the bar downstairs and we just brought in a cake and made a night of it - everyone was very chill about it.

The best part is the vodka selection. Not just the brands, they infuse their own vodkas with pretty much about anything, from jalapeño to horse radish to lemon and lime. I like getting the pickle infused vodka as a martini yummmm. I've actually never done the vodka room but my parents have and they were all about it, which is a pretty big compliment because they're retired and super picky about where they eat.

I went there recently before Christmas '15 and they really updated the decor! The bars are bigger and wrap around the room, and after asking one of the bartenders about the painted plates on the walls, I learned that they come from Russia from before the Iron Curtain fell, when any type of religious endeavor was banned from the country, and so people painted scenes on these plates of a happier, more plentiful time. Maybe I'm a total dork, but they were beautiful.

10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Here is what I would rate the different food items, based on what I've had in the past:

Herring appetizer - 3.5 out of 5
Borscht - 3 out of 5
Russian salad - 2 out of 5
Schnitzel and potatoes - 3.5 out of 5
Kvass - 1.5 out of 5
Napoleon - 2.5 out of 5

Overall, it's not a bad place, but I would not say it's a must go destination."}
{"text":"Two words. Stuffed cabbage.  
Stop what you are doing and go get it.  
Great family style dining.  Cool party room in the basement.  Also try on a fur coat and have a shot in the vodka room."}
{"text":"My family came and got the feast. Everything was homemade and delicious! Definitely order a desert- any of them- all homemade!"}
{"text":"This place was a hidden little gem. Tucked away in a strip mall away from a lot of the big chain restaurants that are around, this place is really beautiful inside. Dark and inviting with a little space on the floor for dancing.

We came incredibly early because we got done shopping in the surrounding areas a little earlier than we expected, so when we were here the restaurant was empty.

Service was good, why wouldn't it be if you were the only people there? The food was good - my favorite was the beef filled potato pancakes with sour cream - delicious.

I ordered the boneless beef short rib and enjoyed it. The wild rice with sun dried tomato was a hit - really moist and flavorful. The meat was cooked well and really tender. Maybe a bit too much sauce for my liking, but still good.

Overall, a place I would love to come back to."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be into Russian food, but after eating at Europa I can say for sure that I was incorrect. My friends and I enjoy coming to Europa for a drink now and again, but most recently I was hungry so I decided to try some food. 
I ordered the stuffed grape leaves and the borscht. While I only meant to have a bite or two of each, I couldn't help myself: I ate the whole thing! Our waitress, Sue, was a delight and helped me choose these two delicious dishes. Being middle eastern I am very picky about my grape leaves, but these stood up to any I've had. They were seasoned wonderfully! Even as someone who loves beets, I was skeptical about borscht; again, I was wrong. The flavor is simple and clean, and oh so satisfying, especially when topped with some cold sour cream. As I'm typing this I am beginning to crave it actually. 
Besides the food, my favorite part of Europa is the ice room. They provide a variety of beautiful fur coats for you to enjoy along with some ice cold vodka in the negative temperatures of the room. As someone who has always dreamed of going to Russia, this Siberian experience is a close second to the real thing! 
Overall, every time I've been to Europa I've more than enjoyed my experience. I don't give many 5 star reviews, but this restaurant is a must try. I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place.  
I was so stuffed, and there were so many options it was wonderful.
I liked the atmosphere in here."}
{"text":"The best Eastern European joint in town. Great culture even better food. 

Would recommend the Russian Schnitzel!"}
{"text":"This place was very good.  The food was very good. Our server rusty exceeded our expectation. Never had to ask for anything. He was always one step ahead of us."}
{"text":"This review is for the Friday night Salsa party only.  It's amazing, drawing excellent dancers (and rookies, too) from far and wide to dace, mingle, and generally be friendly and have a good time."}
{"text":"Short and sweet....food and service are excellent at Restaurant Europa.  I will definitely be back next tim ein Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great place. Very uniq, you won't find anything like that in Ohio. They got ICE BAR aka vodka room, interesting experience."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the staff is really great and friendly, and the cold room for the vodka is a really neat touch.

But that violinist. You can't escape him and his pre-recorded mini-disks of shame. The room is open, so wherever you sit, you will hear him. Loud and clear. The whole thing, from the Violin-Disco in which he's doubt a pioneer, to his gentle weeps as he is reviewing his career choices during a too-loud version of Ochi Chernye.

Get the Russian potato salad. It's very good here."}
{"text":"Had the meatloaf Wellington which was pretty good. My friends ordered the duck and pork dish and they like them. Had to experience the cold room and vodka. They give you fur coats to wear as you down a glass of vodka in a -14F room. That was fun. Servers are nice and courteous."}
{"text":"The atmosphere...most notably the circular metallic papers attached to the wall with plastic pushpins were definitely a disappointment!  see picture. How could any respectable restaurant manager allow that?  

The prices are not cheap, so I expected a nicer atmosphere...white tablecloth, nicer lighting etc. We were in the front of the restaurant next to the bars and we thought the lighting was too bright for a relaxing dinner and drinks.

We knew the food would be European comfort food with a Russian emphasis. The calamari came recommended by the server, but was just okay and the sauce was more Asian than European.  

My first choice was the stroganoff but unfortunately they ran out.  As main entrées we wound up eating the schnitzel and lamb rack and \"just OK\" was the sentiment of the evening.  Go to Hofbrau House for a much superior schnitzel.

Napoleon was a big disappointment...the custard was bland and the pastry layers were soft and in my experience they should have been crispy. I think it clearly was not fresh or made there.

We both felt that the bread, Caesar salad and martinis were above average but those hardly make up for main entrees and atmosphere that were below to well below average.  

Since we were just coming off a horrible winter we opted not to try the Siberian freezer experience which I have heard good things about.  We might come back for that but, unfortunately, we won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered a kobe beef burger and it looked/tasted like a school lunch patty. It was so disgusting I literally had one bite and my server said she could tell I was unhappy. I told her why and she responded by saying well it's from Japan so it can't be fresh it had to be frozen... no offer to speak to a manager or if I wanted to exchange my meal or anything... I still paid for it in full and the only thing I ate was some fries.. won't be back"}
{"text":"I wish I could like it even more. We've eaten there twice. The food is good, but not great. Best thing I've had was the cold borscht -- creamy, loaded with dill. The stuffed cabbage was OK.

Service is friendly. I could do without the violinist who uses a recorded soundtrack and has a very odd mix of songs.

The cold room for drinking vodka is a cute gimmick."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing, great family style dining. Absolutely must try borsch, lamb chops, sea food.  
Definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"A group of 18 of us came here on a Thursday night to celebrate being friends. Many had not tried Russian food or that type of dining experience; about a third of the table had. 

It was an amazing time. The owner and staff treated us like royalty and the food was amazing!  Meatloaf Wellington and the Russian salad (and of course, the caviar and vodka) we standouts. 

We all had a great time and everyone will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. So cozy and relaxing with great Russian comfort foods. All foods are good, and we've had most of them. Excellent appetizers and salads of all kinds. Foods are familiar but with a Russian twist. Service is always the best. This time the restaurant had a nice decor update. Go for nice conversation and a chance to go into a cold room to try the Vodka."}
