{"text":"My family decided to bring me here for my birthday as you eat for free as long as you have ID. Not the best food but it definitely knocks mandarin out of the water. I really enjoy their pasta station. Variety of pastas, sauces and toppings ( cheese, bacon, broccoli ect...) To choose from. Their main table was probably their lowest point, mussel less shells, and some dishes lack seasoning. Their pizza isn't bad and to my surprise they actually had lamb. Never thought I'd see lamb at an AYCE. The taco station was awesome and their baked potato station was good but the chili was kinda watery, so I the sauces from the tacos to put on my potato. The staff was amazing. Great to talk too. I had a full conversation with the lady cooking my pasta dish. Overall a good place to eat. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Excellent cutomer service and friendly, approachable staff. Fresh, delicious, and good selection of food. Brunch is my favourite time to go. They have a crepe station that they make your order in front of you, which is a nice experience, and at dinner it is a pasta station. 
There are not too many buffet options in the GTA, so this is a nice change from Mandarin."}
{"text":"Salad bar was ok just ok not good not bad. Roast beef was very very tender and good Yorkshire pudding wasn't good Deserts ok just ok would I come back at $25.99 per person NO."}
{"text":"There's something for every appetite at this place.  You won't be disappointed.  Try the house beer it's pretty decent"}
{"text":"3 times I have been here..the food is good quality but the service is not. Single tables stop being a priority when there is a large party that is there. 18 minutes I waited for a refill on my beverage. This is the 2nd time i have experienced this issue. I drive well out of my way for this place only for the fresh pasta station. I will admit the burgers are to die for. Thick and juicy and was really impressed with the chef constantly checking the burgers inner temp. 

Just wish management cared more about what customers thought. My first time here I had bad service and I complained to the manager who was at the front door. Didn't seem like she really cared about it.

Not to mention waiting 20 mins to cash out"}
{"text":"It is OK. The food is alright. Oysters are the best tasting thing in the buffet. The problem with this location it gets variety of people and there is a lot of office crowd who can be extremely loud and pushy when you are getting your food. Last time I went there it wasn't a very pleasant experience. Lunch time is a kill zone and similar can be said towards dinner. Weekend is more relaxed. They do offer free birthday buffet with a valid ID which is great if you like there food."}
{"text":"The dinner is a rip-off. Stay away. No fancy dishes - no shrimp, steak, etc.

The lunch is a good value. The hot dishes are so-so - sometimes awful - but the big draw is the hamburger station. Their burgers are quite good and the fries are well cooked and well seasoned. For $12 you get AYCE burgers & fries - a great deal. The soups are also quite good, if you're lucky - they all seem homemade and when they hit it shows. 

This location is noticibly better than their other locations.

I would suggest you avoid going here for lunch over the holidays, as they do away with the hamburgers in favor of a holiday roast. The burgers are the best part so they charge you $7 more to feed you worse food - bad deal."}
{"text":"I find that buffet restaurants are becoming rarer and rarer these days and Tucker's marketplace are one those few that have stuck around. The food was decent and had a variety to pick from.  

I want to mention some of the highlights of this place.  They have a pasta/rice station where they make your food to your liking.  They even serve gluten free pastas if you desire.  The salad station was a hit for me because they come in a wide variety of selections and everyone from our group really enjoyed the roast lamb as well. Not to mention, we were a party of 11 and felt that the service was superb.  Our waiter was very attentive and always cleared our dishes in a jiffy. 

One thing I find they can improve was on the quality of their desserts.  It really leaves much to be desired. For a price of $25.99 per person for all you you can eat, i think it's pretty decent. Oh and of course if it's your birthday then your meal is on the house!"}
{"text":"Still just as unappealing in flavors, as it was about 10 years ago. Figured we would try it again and as they have a special for a free birthday meal with proof. All I can say is, go to another type of buffet that serves tasty meals and are not left drying out in the buffet. Can't even recommend a good dish to try out.  Many items are bland, greasy and taste horrible.  We will not be returning.
Also, should mention that many of the plates around the buffet stations were not properly washed."}
{"text":"After paying for my meal, I went to the washroom. As I'm out washing my hands, one of the chefs come out of the stalls, doesn't wash there hands and goes straight through the doors. Made me sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their dinner buffet, maybe because I don't eat meat... But the breakfast is great! for 18.99 they had everything from cold salads to eggplant in tomato sauce, to fish & beef... Also endless section of desserts. If you're staying at a hotel nearby, the hotels usually charge similar or the same price for breakfast, with a quarter of the items... You're better off coming here to have a breakfast fit for a king!"}
{"text":"I eat here about 3 times a year for the past 4 years and food quality has always been 5 star.  Washrooms have always been clean but I always go at opening rather than closing.  I would eat there every day if this place was next door to where I live!"}
{"text":"This location has always been a hit or miss for me. There have been times where the food is amazing and so is the service, but other times I found the selection to be very small and the service sub par. At my most recent visit, we were seated beside an 8 party table, which was fine, but our server neglected us for most of the evening & catered to this table instead. Plates weren't cleared off in a timely manner & it took awhile to get our refills (which has been the usual case every time I've been here).

For the price, I find the selection of food to be limited. I tend to only come here for the free birthday dinner but there are better buffets out there."}
{"text":"I went to Tuckers on the weekend after a couple of years, hoping the food would be as delicious as it was when I went last time - boy was I wrong...

We went around their brunch/lunch buffet time so there was ample amounts of staple breakfast items, eggs, bacon, sausages, waffles etc... Didn't really have these (other than the bacon strips - because you just ALWAYS have to have bacon) as I was in lunch mode.

What I was looking forward to the most was their prime rib... But it was disgusting - i think the cut was a really bad cut because everyone on our table had extremely fatty pieces with little meat on them. On top of that the prime rib was only being served medium rare and medium and the cook refused to cook it longer for patrons who wanted well done - which they used to do a couple of years back. Other than I had jerk chicken which had potential but was kind of dry (we all know you need jerk chicken saucy), and some thin crust pizza  - the pizza was probably the best tasting dish there that day. 

Keep in mind I'm reviewing all of the food in \"buffet quality mode\"

Other than these dishes the rest were marginal and there wasn't much of a selection as the breakfast dishes were taking up most of the spots.

One item that stood out was the make your own soft taco section. They had warm taco shells, with sour cream, salsa, cheese, lettuce blah blah blah... The tacos tasted exceptional and I improvised by loading bacon strips in them from the breakfast station LOL so yea it was good.

The desserts were alright, not much selection they had some brownies, mousse, and a couple of cakes along with ice cream sundae bar and a chocolate fountain. Again marginal, ill say Mandarin has better tasting desserts.


Overall I don't think ill be going back to Tuckers, unless I would be forced to for someones birthday or party..."}
{"text":"Excellent for lunch. Had the buffet. It was great. Salads were fresh and good selection to build to your liking. Main courses and deserts were great as well. All for a great lunch buffet price. I went with three other friends. It was a unanimous decision that we all would defitnatly go back."}
{"text":"This was a nice place to grab a bite. The service was nice and the food was alright. Not a ton of flavour but plenty of variety. I didn't think the \"World Class Chilli\" was anything to write home about, pretty disappointing in that regard."}
{"text":"~ A 3.5 stars for me ~

I am not a big fan of Tuckers but went here with my coworkers. This location here is quite nice and clean. The restaurant is set-up well inside as the seating areas are on the sides and the centre is for food.

The service was very good. The person at the door and our server were extremely friendly. Our server was very quick in cleaning and providing drinks... so the service was up notch.

Over all the food choices were ok. They had a salad bar, food bar, fresh Pasta area, Grill area, bread area, soup area and a dessert area. I enjoyed their salad area where there was a great variety. I also enjoyed their fresh pasta area, you can get any type of pasta, noodles even Raman...

Overall an average restaurant, good for when you have multiple people with lot of dietary differences."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars, but that being said...the food was great.....the prob is that there were 2 of us and we were put at a 4 person table...this was Wednesday night, when I came back the first time after getting my food a teenage boy was sitting in my dates spot, when she came back after me she had to move over.....he and his mother happen to see people they knew and sat near them...leaving the table that they were eating across the room.

I got up for my second plate ...came back, he was now in my seat .......he then moved when he saw me...so I moved over .....he then proceeded to stare at us while we ate.
The waitress came by a number of times that evening and didn't say a word....he watched us eating our food the whole time, I'm pretty sure he was taking pictures also. My dates jacket was behind him at one point because he kept getting in our seats whenever we got up to get something......the waitress didn't say or do anything to resolve this......the food was really good but we couldn't enjoy anything til we got to out ice cream and treats....only because he and his mother finally decided to leave. 

I haven't been to a Tuckers in years, the price was much cheaper than Mandarin and the many sushi dinners that we go to. But this truly ruined my meal and I'm very mad that I had to experience this, it's really put me off of our next visit and I think I'll just stick to going to other places for a buffet.

But like I said....food was really good, I'm sure this ignorance won't happen often but I was excited to go and the staff didn't help the situation at all."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday lunch and I must say the food was not bad. Our server was great as well and was attentive. I enjoyed the salad bar, freshly grilled burger, sweet potato fries and red skin mashed potatoes made with cream and butter found beside the roast beef not to be confused with the other mashed potatoes found elsewhere on the buffet. My dining companion noted that their dishwasher needs servicing because it was hard to find clean bowls at soup station and also remarked that the rice pudding was good but not stirred well while cooking as it has clumps of cooked egg? in the custard. All in all, it wasn't a bad lunch."}
{"text":"For $20 per person on Sunday brunch, there was a good selection but it was only meh. You won't find French toast, waffles/pancakes or bacon. But there was an omelette station (btw mine was burnt yet it was still served to me) and precooked crêpes which was a disappointment. Just like any other buffet there were salads, soups, hot entrees, carving area of ham, sausage & roast beef, desserts & smattering of breakfast pastries/bread. Everything was just mediocre but what I enjoyed the most was their wood fire oven pizzas. Basic toppings served on a thin crispy crust. Would I come back...probably not. I'll stick with Sunday brunch buffet at Hot House Restaurant which is much more satisfying and only $5 more."}
{"text":"This place was good.  I came here to treat my boyfriend to a free birthday meal. 
The service was great, and everyone is extremely friendly.  The food was good and the desserts were really good.  

Worth a try on your birthday :)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good for a Buffett of many choices. Service was excellent and the good fresh on a Saturday night. Too bad there aren't many more of these in the GTA."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would.  Gross, gross, gross!!!!! Roast beef was gray and so tough you couldn't chew it.  Caesar salad had nothing on it but salad dressing?!? Donuts were greasy ... yuck!!! Mussels were fishy and old tasting.  My group was concerned about food poisoning. We all had bad stomachs after.   I found it expensive for what they offered.  $30 per person.  Definitely not worth it!!!! Pizza was just about the only thing I can honestly say I enjoyed. Flavourless, below average quality.  Shocking it's still in business!!!  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I know, I know it's a buffet, but...
The Sunday night freshly roasted whole turkey, with legit Turkey gravy plus squash and roasted yams, cranberries and all the 'fixins' was a total winner for me. They could have stopped there and I already would have been happy.
Throw in some lemon rosemary chicken thighs and beef bourguignon, finish it off with some fresh fruit and somewhat pedestrian cheesecake, and I really feel like I got my money's worth.
I wanted to try their fresh, made to order, pasta bar, but I gobbled (ha!) so much Turkey, I had no room.
I think their money was entirely wasted on the pizza oven, as it is putting out such an inferior product as to be completely not worth the trouble, but that turkey dinner took me back to Grandma's house.
Winner, winner, turkey dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for dinner tonight it was our first time. The food was old, dry & smelled of rot! No seafood here what so ever! Well besides the mussels that smelled of ass! And taste like it was rotting too! Very disappointed in this place! Compared to the mandarin this buffet is a joke! For a weekend dinner the selection was poor! And we think everything was leftover from lunch! My plate & drinking glass were dirty too! The old decor & the nasty food are a complete waste of time! Staff are friendly but that is all I can say that is good about here!"}
{"text":"I been here 2 times in the past two months.  I am not a fan, I do not know why my family keeps on going back.  I do not think the food is that good.  The selection also isn't that great.  The food doesn't even taste that good (prime rib).  If I am going to go out I rather spend 10 dollars more to go to a better place such as The Keg where I know I will get good food.

1st time: meh

2nd time: mother's day, messed up my reservation so we waited 1hr...I rushed just so I could arrive on time.  Waste of my time"}
{"text":"Just found out in time that they give a free birthday meal. There's not many doing it anymore, and certainly one of the only ones without conditions (i.e. with a group, email sign up, etc...). The experience was 3.5, but gets a 4 for this reason since I have to pick.

I'm haven't really been a 'buffet guy' for quite some time, as you tend to get a 'jack of all trades, master of none' approach to cooking - and that's if you're lucky. And being on the other side of 30, AYCE is not a as big a draw as it once was. With that preamble out of the way...

It's a nice open layout, not worn out, and comfortable. Every food group station is clearly labeled and ordered. Some of the food from looking at it may get a '3' and I could tell not to invest my appetite on it, and my wife's Greek salad was poor. However, there's still a lot of good. They have their own beer and the red lager was surprisingly near perfect. There's of course a lot of salad options, to be expected, but some are unique and/or modern like the kale mix they had. Nothing was looking wilted. They had two roast beef cuts available (medium well, and medium rare). My choice - the medium rare - was gorgeous and cooked perfectly. Sometimes you'll see it was perhaps cooked to fast, where the outside is well and it quickly moves to almost rare; however in this case it was virtually the same colour/flavour/consistency almost right to the edge. It could, however, use a bit more seasoning. I was so happy with my red meat offering, that I had a hamburger, which was cooked from fresh chuck. A very good hamburger - in fact that was my wife's choice of the day. They provide grilled mushrooms and onions, bacon, cheese and the regulars. I also had a couple pieces of pizza which came out of a rotating flame oven. Desserts were more of a '3'. Okay, but sweet but without much distinct taste. My wife did say the ice cream was good however.

From looking at the bill, lunch (since my wife was charged) is only $12.99. That my friends: is a steal. That's about the lowest you can pay for any dine-in meal regardless of buffet. While they may have some items on the 'miss' side, there enough 'hits' to justify returning. I also like that they only stay open 3 hours during lunch time, which shows they're not keen on wasting and/or serving old food."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, but i can say their quality has improved since my last visit, which is great to see.  I've always enjoyed it here, especially in groups with family or friends or coworkers or whatever.  It seems they have added some new items to the menu also and their pizza section of the buffet was a bit of a surprise since its made right there, no frozen stuff, its all done in house.  The deserts were different than last time and i must admit i may have had a bit too much in that department also.  But once again my favorite thing was the roast beef and gravy, the ham, and all the other delights in the hot food section.  The salad bar was nice, but beef makes the world go around and anything you can put gravy on makes me happy.  A return trip is in the near future, and this time, I may just have to indulge in one of those delicious omlets they were cooking up along the back section.  Even better, i may have to fill a plate with an omlet, roast beef and icecream, the trifecta of buffet life."}
{"text":"The problem when you have a friend with the palate of a child? They have horrible taste in food and restaurants.

My husband and I were invited last minute to go to Tucker's for a friend's birthday. I knew already it was a bad idea since I tried their bland food over 5 years ago, and his new girlfriend did not even like North American food. His excuse was he wanted to show her \"good\" white food, like OMG...*shake my head*

I knew vaguely of their free birthday meals. We went on a Sunday, and his birthday was the following Tuesday. I thought, oh he just wants to go so he gets a free dinner - no problem, I'll be happy to attend and help him out. I found out that the birthday promo was only valid for the exact date of their birthday. So nope! He actually wanted to pay full price and for dinner too. It was $25/person for dinner - I think this is very overpriced for what they offer.

I definitely think they are under staffed as there were stacks of dirty plates left on our table the whole time and we had to go out of our way to ask our server for refills on our drinks. The server would regularly pass by our dirty plates.

There were a huge variety of salads, which I'm not a huge fan of (Insert \"You don't make friends with salad\" joke), but an underwhelming and small selection of main courses. I did not enjoy any of the main courses. I guess what you pay for the dinner here for is their roast cuts of meats, which I am not a fan of, and the people who I ate with didn't seem to eat more than a bite of their meat selections.

I had their coconut curry stir fry, which they cook fresh right in front of you; the sauce tasted horrible and watery.

Their breads were good and fresh, however their butters/spreads were not very good.

Their chilli was labelled as \"award winning\" but it wasn't anything special.

The dessert selection was very visually appealing: Cheesecake, carrot cake, flan, gluten free cupcakes, ice cream, etc. I'm a huge fan of cupcakes but their cupcakes were horrible. My husband loves flan but did not like their flan. Their cheesecake was good but did not taste like cheesecake at all! I enjoyed their ice cream.

My husband and I had horrible stomach aches that night and the next morning. We didn't even stuff ourselves like we usually do at buffets. We were thinking it was possibly the butter/spreads and they were not refrigerated/kept cool.

We were out $75 for my husband and I, including drinks and tips. Could have easily spent that money elsewhere and had much better food and service."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday group dinner tonight. 

Not exactly my first choice... but then again, it wasn't my choice to make.
The birthday guest gets to eat for free with the purchase of a drink and that's why the birthday guy chose this place.

Service 2/5: mediocre at best. Server had to be asked a number of times to refill the beverages. Plates were stacked up for a couple of rounds before they were cleared from our table. 

Food 2/5: not a lot of selection/variety.
You know it's sad when all you eat is roasted chicken, pasta and corn on the cob.

Please see pictures attached....:(

Never again...definitely a disappointment for a foodie."}
{"text":"Great place for a family lunch or dinner especially if youre tired of the more common Chinese style Buffet. Tuckers offers an awesome selection of consistently great dishes. The roasts, burgers, stir fry and the bread pudding are really tasty. Tuckers is more on the expensive side but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"As for starters, I have completely given up on Buffet Style food. Really does nothing for me anymore. 

I think this place is definitely a lot fresher than the foods you would get say at Mandarin. 
Added bonus for this place? Chocolate fountains on the weekends YUM!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday party last week and the food was okay. It serves its purpose of satisfying a range of tastes with buffet style dining. Stay away from the mussels though. We noticed some of them were just empty shells!"}
{"text":"All day breakfast deal is not worth the price or hype. Aside from the freshly squeeze OJ and egg station, which was very busy, everything else was mediocre. You're better off spending that money on a gourmet breakfast or brunch meal at a fancy restaurant. Restaurant is dark, musty and old."}
{"text":"Never again.  Far too expensive for the small selection of sub-par food."}
{"text":"Remember Sizzler? I think it still exists.. Well this is Sizzler-sorta-deluxe...

The decor is a bit upgraded, the buffet one size larger and includes a carvery and a few more desserts. The seating is still fairly cramped so you can stare at what your neighbors are dragging in, and you end up in lines for scoops of bean salad.

Don't get me wrong, the food was for the most part, fresh. But it has the feel of a feeding frenzy and things are at times lukewarm and mushy. And for $22 a pop you still end up trying to get your money's worth.

I'd go back, but only with a coupon."}
{"text":"Years and years have gone by and have never got around to eating here.  Finally had the chance.  I was not overly impressed nor was I disappointed.  There was a great variety of selection of all different types of food.  All food was prepared and cooked properly especially for a buffet restaurant.  Service on the other hand was HORRIBLE.  Plates piling up on our table and drinks being served half way through our meal.  Waitress disappearing.

None the less I will return to Tucker's as I was fairly please"}
{"text":"Came here today for weekend lunch. My cousin's birthday's tomorrow so she decided to treat all of us. Our reservation was at 12 noon. The place is huge with a great selection of food. Lots of empty tables when we came in at 12. The place got busy around 1PM. Place is clean and staff is all friendly.

There are tons of food selections. Most of their food is quite average as expected from a buffet. However I am impressed with the cheesecake from the dessert section which was surprisingly delicious, unlike other AYCE places. Definitely a must-have.

Over-all I like this place, and would probably come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"For the money, this place s very legit. The atmosphere is nice, the food is ok, lot of different options, and the staff is very friendly. Got my belly full with ham and roast beef and grilled veggie n grilled yam ;)"}
{"text":"The free birthday dinner is what made us come here. (Has to be the actual day of your birthday and they require government ID for verification). 

Dinner:
The food selection is small but tasty for the most part. The fresh pasta/noodle/rice cooking station was definitely the best thing going for the place. Had the pesto pasta with spinach and mushrooms which was absolutely delicious! Boyfriend had the pad Thai which was OK -- the sauce was much too sweet. The cooks were very friendly. 

I also enjoyed their potato salad, meat pizza, mussels, ham pot pie, freshly cut roast beef, and onion rings. They had a cheese tortellini with alfredo sauce which looked really good but only tasted OK. The sauce was delicious but the tortellini tasted hard and bland. Not sure if it was undercooked or freezer burnt. 

Dessert:
- Creme brulee: Did not have the crunchy caramelized sugar top however the flavour of the brunet was still tasty. 
- Apple cobbler: Very tasty! Especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 
- Apple strudel: Tasted good however they do not chop the apples but use a whole half apple per slice of strudel. Made it hard to eat and just a little strange looking. 
- Carrot cake: Loved it! Real cream cheese icing and loaded with raisins! 
- Cheesecake: A little on the soft side but tasted really good! Homemade tasting. 
- Chocolate muffin/cupcake: Tasted very bland and stale. 
- Chocolate chip bar: Way too much butter. Fingertips literally got soaked in grease from just holding the bar briefly. It tasted good but not worth the guilt. 
- Brownies: Very chocolately and good except the icing tasted like generic canned icing. 

Service:
Friendly although on the slow side. Had to ask for a refill despite leaving the empty drinks at the edge of the table to indicate they were empty and needed refilling. Plates weren't cleared promptly each time. Overall good service though. 

For the price of $26.99 per person plus $2.99 drink person for Sunday dinner, it isn't worth it. The selection is just too small and quality wasn't consistent. But for the price of free (for the birthday person), you can't go wrong. If dinner was cheaper then I would return. Otherwise, this will continue to be just an annual visit (If that. It may be hard to go on the actual day of your birthday. Mandarin allows you 3 days before or 3 days after)"}
{"text":"Hands down Tucker's is definitely my favourite buffet restaurants to visit. We always make sure we pop in here for our birthday dinners and usually again around the holidays.

The food is always freshly prepared and served at the appropriate temperature. The service is okay... not overly attentive but you're never left waiting for drinks or to have your plates cleared.

They offer a little bit of everything and you'd be hard-pressed to not find something you liked.

Their salad station is extensive and at this location, no two items are repeated (some of the other locations repeat the same dishes on both sides). They usually offer two soups and sometimes chili (seasonal I would imagine). Cut off a slice or two from their many loaves of bread and you're ready to tuck in to your first course.

My must-haves: Their wild rice salad and their potato with dill salad and, if they have it, their corn chowder. Honestly, between their soups and salads, I could simply pick away at those all night.

From the carving station, you'll typically have two or three options and I've seen a selection of roast beef, pork, lamb and turkey. All are excellent and cooked to perfection. The sides are usually a staple of regular mash potatoes, garlic mash potatoes, squash, corn, sweet potatoes, baked potatoes, etc, etc...  and yorkshire pudding. This time, across from the carving station, there was an area where a lady was making potato pancakes which were absolutely fantastic! I hope it becomes a regular item.

There's also an area where you'll find items such as pizza, asian noodle type dishes and chicken dishes although I can't really say that I visit that station too much.

The desserts seem to be never ending and usually by the end of the evening, I don't have room for a wafer-thin mint (not even a tiny little thin one) let alone... oh go on then... I'll have a sliver of cheese cake. Ugh."}
{"text":"came here a few days prior to Christmas. the food is always great, and the staff are always very couteous! the choices for entree and desserts were great.  There's a little of everything at Tuckers and their prices are reasonable for what you get.   This place is much better than their Scarborough location at Kennedy and Eglinton Ave."}
{"text":"It's getting to the point where we only come here on a birthday to get a free meal. The food CAN be okay, but it can also be bland and flavorless. If you're getting a deal, it may be worth rolling the dice. Otherwise, there are so many other choices in the area."}
{"text":"I've always LOVED brunch here!!! 
I've been going to Tucker's Market Place for years for brunch with my family. 
I went again this past weekend and mmm I love it! They always have a large assortment of different foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And dessert!! 
They always try new cooked in front of you feature foods. Last year was fresh scrambled eggs cooked right in front of you. This year it's crepes! Food crepes with chicken and mushrooms for example. And dessert crepes as well!! Mmmm
Delicious !

A few weaknesses though is for their juice - you pay by the glass. Orange juice comes in a small glass while lemonade comes in a glass 4 times the size which I don't find very fair. So before you order juice - ask how much and how large each type of juice will be.  
Their roast beef this weekend was very pink too which I found to be a turn off :\

Everything else though is delicious and I love going there."}
{"text":"If you enjoy a mediocre to poor spread of food...  Here it is!
I liked the FREE b-day meal (usually when we attended).
It's an ok place for a large group, not cheap, expensive!"}
{"text":"Service is great. We were welcomed at at the door and asked if we've been here before. Since it was our first time our hostess immediately gave us a quick tour. Then we were seated. Seating was really comfortable and spacious. We ordered 2 cocktail drinks which were reasonably priced at $6.99. Selection of food was decent. It was unfortunate that they ran out of some food and said there was no more for the evening (for that reason giving 1 less star). Some food was very good, others have been out for sometime and not fresh. Like any buffet, food is average. The only turn off is when our waitress gave us our bill when we did not ask for it. It wasn't any time close to closing nor was the restaurant busy."}
{"text":"As suggested by an old working colleague, we met for lunch. It's the first time for me at Tucker's Marketplace after many (perhaps 20) years. I suppose that I didn't have a great impression that previous time so that is likely the reason it took so long to come back. Most restaurants don't last that long so I felt that they must be doing something right after all these years when I accepted the invitation to meet and eat there.

Mostly made a large salad to start followed by some chicken pieces and vegetables. Everything was tasty.

I found the service, quality and freshness of the food to be above average. It didn't seem that the food had been dwelling in the container for too long which can be a problem at some all you can eat places. 

I will try their dinner offering at some future time."}
{"text":"Ok but not very good. Food variety really sucks and everything is stone cold. All the deserts were stale and rock hard. The burger station and pasta making station is a gimmick. Probably first and last time I would go to this place. Way better places out there."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My family goes here to celebrate all the time.  I love that they have free dinner on your birthday (when you purchase a drink and show ID of course)  The staff is friendly and the wait staff is quick to clear"}
{"text":"Tucker's used to be my favorite buffet restaurant but the last two times I have gone, we have walked out, why? 

They do not have enough food! Can you believe it! Going to a buffet and they run out of turkey within an hour and it's often pink and not cooked properly. 

Like every other restaurant, the main problem is not being run proper and they do not seem to care! 

I guess this is why a few other locations have closed .."}
{"text":"I am not a super huge fan of Tuckers selection but our server was nice and meal was reasonable and it was the easiest place for us to get to."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I came up for Anime North and needed a place to eat within decent distance of the conference center, and we ended up finding Tucker's. The place is absolutely wonderful, with a good array of food that allowed us to come back a few nights that weekend and have something totally different every time we went. The staff is excellent, and didn't bat an eye when we asked to pay in US currency. Overall, my friends have been raving about the place since we got home, and we can't wait to go back."}

This location makes me super sad that the one at Heartland closed down - that one was way way way superior to this place. And it was the one that I was used to and loved. 

It had once become a family ritual to do birthdays at Tucker's - so we thought we'd relive the experience again on my Dad's birthday this year. The space itself was quite big, and at first glance, made the buffet spread look huge. But it's rather rusty; patches of paint on the floor, shabby interiors, etc. The buffet spread? Not so big OR tasty at all - bread, soup, salad aplenty if that's what you come to Tuckers for. A sub-par array of 12 entrees with limited choices of unappetizing items like vindaloo, potato perogies, potato pie - basically stuff that's inexpensive to make and fast-filling. My usual go-tos - pesto salad and beef roast - were disappointing as well. 

Sadly, the experience didn't end on a good note. Our waitress brought the bill to us. We wanted to pay with our \"preferred\" Tuckers card (to grab some points). And she said she'd do it for us; but instead took our payment and didn't swipe the card; we found out later, when we asked the hostess to check that the waitress hadn't swiped it... and neither did she inform us of the $10 credit on it. One of those girls, basically, who just wanted to grab the cash and forget about the rest. 

I wouldn't have left without causing a scene if it was any other day. But Dad's birthday - I think we all wanted to enjoy the remainder of the evening."}
{"text":"Loved the food.  It was fresh, apprpropriately heated/chilled, and had lots of variety to suit all tastes.    We filled our boots!

The downsides however were that we had to wait a loooong time for water, and forget refills - the server was too busy.   Also $22 is a bit pricey, despite the variety - my belly is only so big.    

I also agree with the other reviews in that they felt the tables were too close together.

Would go back but maybe at a cheaper time  (are lunches cheaper?) and when less busy."}
{"text":"Just recently about 10 of us from the office went for two colleagues' birthdays. When I first found out about the venue, I was kind of disappointed because I expected an old, dirty, gross buffet. Maybe it was the day we went but the food was actually really good. I didn't go off the path and try fried fish or Chinese noodles or anything like that but I did, however, have the mussels and some pizza flatbread as an appetizer and they were awesome. The pizza was a nice thin crust with a lot of fresh toppings and the mussels were meaty and fresh. I also had a burger patty (that they grilled right in front of me) and some kale salad and I was very impressed. It was only $15 for the lunch buffet and well worth it. I would totally return again."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time tonight.  I would compare this to an upscale Golden Corral.  Salad bar was very large and looked tasty but I did not partake.  They had a carving station the wasn't the best but wasn't horrible.  The pasta station was actually very good.  You can get everything from Italian to Asian pastas.  I actually thought the pizza was very good for a buffet.  The desserts were great.  For a buffet I thought the food was very good"}
{"text":"Was decent. Like a Vegas buffet. The roast beef and yorkshire pudding was good. So was the make your own pasta bar thingy. For $20 you get a nice selection. Worth a stop when you are really hungry and don't want to drop a lot of clams"}
{"text":"I've taken 4 times different guests with me. They all loved it. Reasonable cost, very good ambience, quality food, extra ordinary service. What else you like in business lunch. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party recently, it was my first time at Tucker's and will likely be the last.

The service and the drinks are amazing, definitely the best things about this place. Their drinks consist of a lot of fruit, and they have amazing cocktails with some of my favourite alcohols (Parrot Bay Coconut Rum in a mango smoothie? Hell yes!). Our waitress was also incredible. Dirty dishes and empty glasses were cleared immediately, and she was extremely friendly and helpful.

Everything else about this place was very bland. I understand why you'd want to bring a large party to a buffet- after all, there is something for everyone and you can go back for as much food as you like. When I first walked into the buffet area it seemed impressive, but once I started actually trying to pick food I couldn't find anything I was really interested in. There was a large pasta salad selection, but they were bland. Pizza that seemed like a frozen pizza you'd buy at the grocery store, a large selection of various meats (some were far better than others), a large dessert section, ice cream, and a bread station with soups & chili. It looks far more impressive than it actually is. I tried a few things once, but never went back for seconds of anything. Even the desserts...from afar it looks spectacular and delicious...but up close not so much. Tried the chocolate mousse but it was so sweet & heavy that I couldn't eat very much of it.

For $25 per person (with drinks costing an extra $6-$7) this place is extremely overpriced for what you get. Definitely not worth the money, and so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Okay this place is not that great in terms of food but the lady working the fresh pasta/noodle station definitely gave this score a bit of a boost.

Staff: We were seated quite promptly and they gave us a nice explanation of the different stations. There is a fresh pasta station and the person working the kitchen struck up a conversation while my pasta was being cooked. I appreciated being treated like an actual person and they made some recommendations. She alone boosted this review by one star.

Ambience: We were seated in the corner booth and it was very cramped an uncomfortable. Thankfully, after the people behind us left, I was able to push the booth chair back a little so that I had room to even sit properly (HULK SMASH!).

Food: The pizza was burnt (and tasted burnt), the food in the heating stations were cold, the cupcake dessert was dry and stale. The meatballs were good, the fresh pasta was tasty, and there is a wide selection. Also it's a bit alarming how I saw cases of canned pasta sauces and other canned products on the side.

I'm torn about this place because I like the concept, but the results were subpar."}
{"text":"I expected a larger variety.While there was a huge salad bar, meat options were limited-roast beef,roasted ham,jerk chicken,some seafood,a few stews/cooked dishes with meat and pasta/stir fry with choice of meat. We were seated in the area close to the buffet so it was quite smoky- the ventilation system is not very good.The toilet was clogged and the whole floor flooded and it took them more than an hour to send somebody to clean up which was plain disgusting."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a few vegetarian options, some made to order, I wasn't limited to just one or two options, compared to a few other buffets I've been to recently. 
Every dish here which doesn't contain meat is full of salt, unfortunately, I felt like I needed to inhale a gallon of water afterwards. 
1 extra star for our nice waitress."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this place; for a buffet it always remains consistantly good! With ample parking and seating I find the atmosphere relaxed unless it gets really busy where big tables and children can cause some noise and space concerns.

The food is Always delicious, but it is always the same... they offer a fairly large variety of items but do not rotate or mix it up, which can actually be a good thing to some. I am a sucker for their mashed yams and roast beef; melt in your mouth!! They have a cold asian noodle salad with cabbage that I can never refuse and the mixed drinks and milkshakes are amazing!  

I highly recommend this place especially if your celebrating a Birthday cause the meal is free with proof of birth date"}
{"text":"We were a party of 7 adults and at least 4 of us were big eaters so I think we got good value for the money. Salad bar was fresh, just wish they would have had bacon bits, onions, chopped eggs, and cheese.  The carve table was good and the server there was nice and accommodating.  As much food as there was, I thought they could have offered a little more variety.  Dessert offerings were good. My only complaints are the surely waitress and the air conditioning vent was directly over our table that cooled off the food too quickly"}
{"text":"*Trays of food not replenished frequently 
*not enough variety 
*pasta bar unsatisfactory 
*too pricey for quality of food 
*food not fresh"}
{"text":"I came here today (Saturday) to celebrate a friend's birthday since we heard they offer a free dinner buffet to the birthday person. I was wondering if they did a lunch buffet, but their doors were closed when we arrived at 3pm. They opened their doors at 4:30pm. 

Dinner buffet costs about $22.68+tax+tip... Pretty pricey for a dinner buffet, but of course, it's near a bunch of hotels and Pearson Airport. As such I expected excellent service here. The front end reception however was standoffish and slightly rude.. I asked them if they were still doing the free birthday meal, and they didn't really answer me and just started looking into the podium intensely ignoring my question. Upon leaving, I did say goodbye to the front reception, but no goodbye to us, or even acknowledgement we just spent our dinner here. They were sooo absorbed in their conversation. I suppose they were discussing some serious business.... Right, as if. However, our table server was nice, and provided us with fast service. 

The food was pretty good. They have a pretty big salad bar...except that is the last place I would go to when I feast at a buffet.Their hot item selection wasn't spectacular... But they were still delicious. I especially like their roasted chicken and roast beef (carving station); both are very tasty and juicy. Everything else was pretty much carbs (rice, noodles, pizza, fries etc). One thing that disturbed me was that I saw a nacho station...There is no need for something like that at a buffet! Cheap of them to do that actually. I expected better. As well I found most food on the warmers were not piping hot as I have experienced at other buffet restaurants. 

Well good thing is the dessert station is nice. There are two chocolate fountains (white and dark) for you to dip your fruit (cantaloupe, banana, honey dew.... but no strawberry WTF). I kind of expected strawberries for the price I paid. C'mon!

All I can say is that selection is narrow and few for the price paid. The ice cream was soft and from a fresh tub - but there were only 4 flavours (vanilla, chocolate, mango strawberry yogurt, no sugar added butterscotch). There are only 3 soups at the soup station... and none of which are really that great, except the chili I guess. And I feel they could add some better entree items in the hot foods section... there was what only 2 seafood dishes (mussels and some white fish on basmati rice)?

It was overall tasty, but kind of expensive for the limited selection."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite buffet restaurants but the quality is so low now and the selection is quite bad. You get your group of veggies and 2 identical tables of the same food.

After you get to the main entrees and try a few you realize that maybe 2 of the items are edible. The rest usually are just a mound of slop. 

The carvery is decent but nothing to write home about. 

The desserts are disgusting. You never know how long they've been sitting there. I once picked up a piece of cake and found mould on the bottom. Now St that point I decided never to go to Tucker's again."}
{"text":"I was not impressed... the food was pretty bland... the carving station staff was unattentive.

We were checked in or should I say kept being interrupted... \"how we were doing\" every 10mins.  

We were seated behind the dessert station... and the girl on the other side kept banging.  Inn what... I have no idea.

I have been to the location on Mac is before it closed.

The decor is nice... simple and not tasty cooked food or dessert.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. I am rounding up. 

I have been to Tucker's Marketplace a number of times. It was pretty close to my old office place. It's an extra five minutes more to travel from my current office, so it's not horrible by any stretch!

We often come here when we have a team lunch celebration. This location was a part of our eat-out Friday ritual. I drove a fellow colleague and our manager here a couple of Fridays ago. 

There is plenty of parking. There are a few restaurants sharing the same lot. It's an ideal place for this cluster of eateries, as there are many hotels close to the airport. 

We were a group of seven folks. We didn't have any issue getting a table. 

It's a buffet. I prefer Tucker's over Mandarin any day. I love the variety. The food simply tastes better. 

You can get to own pasta prepared at one food area. There's the carvery, where you can get roast beef and more. The salad bar is perfect. I love the corn, tuna salad, and beets. There were three types of soup when I was there. I went with beef barley, which was hearty and delicious. 

I enjoyed my food. I normally don't do well at buffets (two plates, followed by a small dessert plate is all that I can do), so I'm there for the variety of foods to sample. 

I loved the sweet and sour fish. It was perfect. The perogies were yummy, as well as the meatballs in marinara. 

My favorite dessert is the bread pudding. So good! I also enjoyed the chcolate cake. 

Our server seemed nice, except that she would take and walk away simultaneously. Um, okay. 

I'm surprised that I beverage got around to reviewing this place. In glad that I did at long last!

{"text":"One of the few places left in GTA that will do a free birthday dinner, which is what brought me here. I'm a huge fan of their fresh-made pastas (I got the cabonara, which was excellent and fresh!). Their ham and roast beef station was also perfectly adequate, and a good selection of sweets for after, though nothing amazing. Everything else was just \"meh\" .....a bit too far out to justify coming again.....until the next birthday, that is!"}
{"text":"Come here on your birthday since it's free, I definitely recommend doing that.  Otherwise, it is quite expensive.  

Sure, they have good pasta here, but really how much can you eat.  The rest of it is alright, but not as many options as I would have hoped.  There are tacos, which I always see but never bother trying.  There is a salad bar.  And there is meat, like roast beef.  

For me, the only good thing about this place is the pasta.  But the price doesn't justify coming here on any other occasion except for a free birthday meal.

{"text":"I like this place.. some of the food here is okay, but there are alot of decent dishs here. What I mostly love about this place is that it has lots of varieties of Comfort Food! Which I personally love. I like the style of jerk chicken that they have and the pasta and breads and desserts.. Yum. Sometimes it is a hit or miss but with so many food around, it can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So I came here during my anime north weekend.  

The servers here are so paitent with our asses. However, they weren't ready the first time we showed up, and the second time we had to be in a time limit from the moment one of our people showed up. 

The spread was pretty good, ranging from pastries to salads, to pastas! 

Everyone kept stopping us to ask us what was happening with our cosplays. That was interesting. 

What was annoying though, was the fact that we were ignored for the most part the second time around. We had ordered drinks, but they took forever to get to us. 

We are coming back. I'll know what to expect though."}
{"text":"Average buffet restaurant.  Friendly, helpful staff and management.

The salad bar is epic!  They've added a great Mediterranean kale salad, with olives, feta and an awesome dressing!

The ribs (nights only) are tender and flavourful!  Ham is fabulous, especially with the mustard sauce!! 

The desserts are good.  Cherry tarts.  Warm bread pudding and sauce.  Crème brûlee.  Red velvet cake.  The sundae bar!

A big complaint is that they don't serve prime rib, but tough as old boots round roast.  YOU have gotten quite expensive, you're more than MANDARIN.....And THEY serve prime rib, peel and eat shrimp, crab legs, extra large stir fry shrimp, and deep fried large shrimp!

Please get prime rib for nights and WEEKENDS!"}
{"text":"Don't know where to start...Okay, the good news...Free birthday meal and kids eat half price. Stir fry and meat stations were passable but not memorable, portions were small and not the greatest tasting. 

The bad, buffet variety is minimal, Most of it was bland, foods are reminiscent of canned or frozen ingredients made with ketchup as tomato sauce. I would say this is certainly not worth the birthday meal if you had to pay any price. Plates were dirty after wash and the service from our waitress sucked. 

So would I return on my birthday for free, I think not! you definitely get what you pay for which is nothing. I would recommend  a free meal at a soup kitchen on your birthday which is probably better in the end."}
{"text":"I've never liked Mother Tuckers much, and this location was no different.  Bland and flavourless buffet options,redeemed only by the fact that they were hot and kept topped up.

when I do buffet I like to self myself courses, and though the salad bar had plenty of options, when it came to putting together a pasta or seafood opening course I found limited options available. Over sauced mussels, Asian breaded and fried fish, they didn't go well at all with the one pasta option, so I gave up.

My main was unmemorable, I literally don't remember what I bothered to have, but it wasn't long before I was on to desert. I stuck with a safe bet, vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. 

Meh."}
{"text":"i would go to any one of the mandarin buffets before i spend a dime here, or let anyone else spend a dime on me, towards this business. im trying to figure out how food can be stone cold, in a buffet warming table? although they are trying to promote alot of niche's with these buffets (pizza making, pasta station, steak carving station) its all a gimmick. the service and attitude of the employees here just cements this place as a bad time. 
bland, flavourless food. 
go to zets instead, just down the street, tell em i sent ya"}
{"text":"We went there for my hubby's Birthday and service was excellent....friendly efficient and clean. The food is sooooo much better than Mandarin. More variety, tastier, and I've never seen my 8 yr old eat so much. Looks like we have a great place to come back too!"}
