{"text":"What a find!!! I\"m so glad to see they did something with that old hotel.  Loved the atmosphere, great drinks, good food and the service was terrific. I will go again. Very cozy place to spend an evening"}
{"text":"We LOVE the atmosphere, cuisine, drinks, and service. Seriously, just when you thought downtown Kent couldn't get any better, it does. Everyone was so friendly!  We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect addition to Acorn Alley and Kent. Classy place for locals. Great noshing on small plates and apps..."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. Kent was desperately wanting as far as intimate tapas bars go, and Franklin Hotel Bar fills that need.   The space pulls you in as soon as you walk through the door: warm lighting, comfortable waiting area, exposed brick, plenty of seating options. We visited on a busy Saturday night, so the hostess suggested  the bar, and I'm happy she did. The bar seating is comfortable, and the service didn't falter in the slightest. The have a wide variety of beer and wine available, but you can tell they take pride in their cocktail menu. They have a selection of both classic and unique cocktails to choose from, and the bartenders really know the menu (if you're worried about how sweet a drink is before you order, just ask - their suggestions are on point). I tried both the Cherry Limeade and the French 75 (with lemon vodka instead of gin) and I'd order both again. We didn't get to try much of the food this visit, but it all sounded intriguing. The one snack we got was great for the bar: Kettle Chips with onion-Gruyere dip.   I'd say Franklin Hotel Bar is on par with some of the tapas bars I've been to in Cleveland, but with the casual friendliness that makes Kent feel like Kent. Next time you're in Downtown Kent, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful bar with an extensive cocktail and beer menu and very good service. But don't come here if you're hungry - their food options are very limited.  My husband and I shared three items from their \"shareable\" menu - the shrimp tacos, the pork belly queso and the short ribs. All were very good but very small portions. I think we'll be back sometime to have a drink but we'll eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"This was a great find, we were pleasantly surprised with the excellent food and service.  Our bartender and server; Rachel, had wonderful suggestions on small bites and beverage.  We started with the deviled eggs which were amazing!  The short rib tacos, served on Wednesday's, were tasty with just the  right amount of seasoning.  We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! My wife and I joined our friends at this really quaint hotel bar for sharing plates and a clean, quite and amazing ambience for dinner.  We had a great experience and our waiter, (Grant), made us feel like we were regulars.  If you go get the lobster Mac and Cheese!!! ... to die for:)  Follow me on Twitter at hilliard57!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love what the Franklin Hotel Bar has done with this space. The drinks are on point, even the list during happy hour is great. We haven't tried a lot of the food, but everything we have had is fantastic so every time we go we just order the same things. I have gone there alone just for some unwind time and with my husband and friends and we have always had a great time."}
{"text":"Finally! An upscale / non-college bar in Kent!  My friends and I started our night out here and left with a new best friend, our waitress Philese! She was absolutely amazing... so funny and kind. We just hit it off with her and then nervously asked her to be our real-life friend, haha.  They have all of your classic cocktails, but also several signature drinks. I had this floral/fruity martini called the Fleur De Lis, and it was super good. They also have herby and spicy type of drinks too which I want to try, like the spicy pineapple margarita.  Also, we were celebrating the birthday of one of our friends, and they brought out a free cheesecake! It was incredible.  Long story short, we had one of the best nights out at this bar. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved my first visit to the Franklin Hotel Bar at (under?) Acorn Corner. The decor inside is lovely with semi-circular booths, bar, tables, and some cozy-looking arm chairs in which to play a game of chess or converse with friends. They seem to have a really nice selection of beers and wine but on this first visit I was all about the cocktails as a well-made mixed drink is a bit more of a rarity on the Kent scene. I was super pleased with their take on the Old Fashioned which was the perfect selection for a cold wintry night - heavy on the whiskey muddled with sugar crystals and delicious cherries. I look forward to returning to try some others along with their delicious sounding small-plates and shareable bites!"}
{"text":"The Franklin Hotel Bar is a more upscale establishment, dimly lit, with an older feel. The drinks are priced average for the upscale bars in the area. They have a large selection of wine, however the martini I had left much to be desired. The wine was great. I like that there are big comfy chairs and couches throughout.   The crowd here is more the reason for the lack of stars as it is very liberal. Twice now I have had conversations turn rather ugly over very simple comments.   One time in particular, I commented that I was confused why both bathrooms in the bathroom area said \"Women's.\" I walked over to use the restroom and in that little hall the door on the left said Women's. So I turned and went to walk in the one on the right and it also said women's... I was very confused at this so I walked back to the bar and asked my friend to check and make sure I wasn't crazy. I wasn't trying to start a fight with anyone and was simply trying to find a place to pee... the bartender let me know that both of those were ladies rooms and the men's room was actually back toward the back of the establishment. I remarked that that was very confusing and was immediately ridiculed by two women at the bar a few seats down. They started loudly making comments about our male privilege and asking why they can't even have two restrooms without a man throwing a fit. I proceeded to discuss my support of our current President from that point on with my friend.  This wasn't the only time that we were shunned as conservatives here. We tried it again a few weeks later, and again an innocuous conversation turned into us being slammed for being conservative.  I will not be back as the overall crowd of regulars here seem to want to chase off anyone who doesn't share their beliefs. I have reviewed quite a few places and this has been the only time politics has kept me from enjoying an establishment."}
{"text":"I popped in here with some friends after passing by while visiting my old college town. I was pleasantly surprised by the list of signature cocktails and small plates. So, I decided to try a a small sampling of what they had to offer.   The bacon-wrapped dates, deviled eggs and cocktails are all top notch. I'd put them up against offerings from cities like NYC or Chicago any day. The service was also wonderful and our bartender was attentive and friendly throughout our entire visit.   My one problem--and the only reason I'm not awarding 5 stars--was with the kitchen. You see, as a part of my order, I asked for a serving of the mixed nuts. On the menu, these were described as \"spiced and candied nuts\". They are a bit pricey at $6, but I'm a big fan of spiced nuts. So, I wanted to give them a try.   Upon arrival though, it was easy to see that these were nothing more than salted mixed nuts ala Planters. Normally, I wouldn't really bother with sending them back, but for $6, I felt a bit obligated. Within 5 minutes, my nuts returned fully spiced and candied as promised--and they were delicious (minus the rosemary still being on their stems).   As someone who worked in a kitchen for 8 years, I completely understand the desire to slack in the last hour of service. Especially, if you're trying to wrap up and have already put the ingredients away. But, there's really no excuse for trying to pull a fast one on your customers. I'd have rather they told me they were out of the product.   It just angers me, because it makes me wonder what other corners are cut or what else they conveniently disregard without people knowing. I firmly believe in getting what you pay for and sadly, things fell short of that expectation.   So, in summary, I'd highly recommend visiting Franklin at least once. But, be wary of what you order and make sure you receive what you're paying for."}
{"text":"Okay so I went on a date here last night and let me tell you...we love this place! We each had two drinks (spicy pineapple margarita, stormy mai tai, glass of house riesling, and a milk porter) as well as four, yes four, appetizers. The appetizers included the roasted poblano deviled eggs, charcuterie board, lamb meatballs, and the caprese. We loved everything! The atmosphere itself is fabulous and I feel like I'm lounging in an NYC bar. Thanks so much for being exactly what kent needs!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time tonight and were very impressed all around. We tried several different drinks and they were all delicious. We had the pulled pork nachos (as did the gentlemen at the bar next to us) and they were absolutely perfect (they finished theirs as fast as we did).  The ambience was great, and the service impeccable. It's the exact kind of place we have been looking for in the area. We are looking forward to going back again soon!"}
