The owners Johnny told me i was attractive, made me feel uncomfortable, asked if my black boyfriend would come beat him up for making these comments. Owner had coke powder on his nose. Terrible !!!!!!!! If i could give it negative stars i would. Do not go !!!! Crooks."}
{"text":"I went here one night with a group of 7 including myself.  We couldn't tell who was a server, hostess, guest, etc becasause the staff didn't seem to be wearing anything in particular, but I figured out who I needed to tell that we needed a table.  She didn't take my name, just told me to wait, so we sat down at our table and found out that our only option was a sandwich or a 15 dollar buffet.  So, she said that the buffet food was not unsanitary (there were lots of kids and we were concerned at little hands reaching in for food without tongs) and that it was all changed every 6 minutes so we decided to stay.  We went up to the buffet for round one and saw ravioli, chicken marsala, ziti, bread, salad, and sausage.  I grabbed the last 3 ravioli and some ziti and went to sit, thinking it is looking pretty sparse, I will wait for the next round.
The ravioli was very good, but the ziti was very cold.  So 5 minutes later, I went to check (for my table) to see if the buffet had been restocked (since we were told every 6 minutes).  It wasn't.  A lady assured me that it was on its way out.  We waited....and waited...and waited...and waited...I checked back about every 2 minutes for about 30-45 minutes and it only got refilled once.  When it did get refilled, we were told that they were out of ravioli and that new food was coming.  We got stuck with some \"bean salad\" that looked like white beans, water, and romaine lettuce (hot), and chicken parm, but the chicken parm buffet was only 1 piece of chicken, almost like a fluke.  

All in all, I would never go back because I basically paid 15 dollars for 3 ravioli and a lot of wasted time sitting and feeding dollars into the juke box since they have a loud and noisy environment, but no free music.  We spent so much money at this place and it was absolutely dissapointing.  Do not go here!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with some co-workers and had the soup and salad buffet. There was a ton of food including pasta, chicken marsala and meatballs. It was all homemade including the salad dressing.

A gentleman who appeared to be the owner greeted us enthusiastically and even supplied us with free bruschetta. The entire meal was good, I felt like a valued customer and well worth the money."}
