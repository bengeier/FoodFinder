{"text":"If you have two dollars in your pocket and a grumbling tummy this is the place to go.   Perfect for a snack on the run. Little pastry pockets filled with beef chicken or vege. I tried the spicy beef and it was great. Pastry was delicious and flaky. There is more pastry than filling but at 2 bucks who can complain really?"}
{"text":"Saw it by accident walking north on the west side of Yonge street. I'm no expert on patties but it was yummy. Got the spicy beef. Filling was HOT and a good amount of spices in it. At 12:45noon, in and out in 2 minutes and $2 right next to Eaton sounds pretty decent to me."}
{"text":"Great lunch time snack.  Was on a walk during my lunch break and happened to notice it after checking out the local camera store.  Grabbed a couple spicy beef patties for myself and a friend back at the office.  Super friendly service and love that they make the patties in house.  Definitely a step up from the frozen variety I'm used to.  Did \"spicy\" and it had a comfortable kick but think I'll level up to \"Extra spicy\" next time.  Quality patty for a decent price with very friendly service.  Will repeat."}
{"text":"This place is awsome. Went first thing this morning and people were already ordering. Good sign.  I was worried from other reviews that said lack of filling and thick dough. Mine were perfectly balanced. Really it was almost over filled.  Most importantly is the taste. I got chicken, beef mix of mild to extra spicy.  I liked them all. My company did not like the gravy of the chicken but said it was purely a person taste.  I hope the quality standards stay because I want this to me my go to spot every time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I grew up eating the extra spicy beef patties from Tastee in North York. These are similar (there is some connection according to the website) but I felt like these had less filling. Still delicious."}
{"text":"Very affordable price, and I must say... their patties are very addicting. Less than $5 for two patties (I usually get the chicken and the non spicy beef to satisfy both flavors :) ) simply love it. Gotta try out that coco bread soon too!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and its not so bad. Dont get the non spicy, doesnt have a lot of taste. The spicy one was yummy and the chicken was interesting because it has a curry type of filling inside."}
{"text":"First of all the coco bread is amazing and really soft and fresh!  My 2 stars is mostly for the patties themselves.  I was expected when the guy I spoke to told me that they make all the parties themselves.  I was expecting some more substance to them.  I tried the extra spicy beef one and it wasn't super spicy.  My biggest pet peeve about patties everywhere is the ooze that comes out that everyone calls beef. Although these are supposed to be handmade patties they are much like the frozen ones you get in the grocery stores.  I wouldn't return to this place as I can just make them myself which would be real homemade or I can buy a box of the frozen ones in the grocery store.  I would have expected that a place that specializes in patties would do it really really well or even offer some different ones."}
{"text":"Even if its $2, its not exactly the cheapest lunch because you will need more than one patty to fill you up. The coco bread goes surprisingly well with the patty. The filling inside is the best. Could eat this every day."}
{"text":"We got half a dozen assorted patties. The crust was perfect and both buttery and flaky and the fillings were very tasty. The staff was very friendly and we chatted for a while. Excellent experience and great street food."}
{"text":"Came here during my Toronto visit at Christmas, I only wish they'd open one in Vancity!! Warm and perfect on a cold day, cheap and cheerful for a freshly baked, filled to the brim Jamaican patty. My friend had the beef, regular spicy, I had a vegetarian patty. Both reviews surpassed expectations. These are definitely NOT your high school cafeteria patties!"}
{"text":"I was walking down Elm St. And couldn't resist checking this place out.  Who doesn't love a yummy beef patty?  I ordered the 2 patties + pop combo.  The patties were probably the best I've had since Island Foods at Village by the Grange which closed down several years ago.    I had the extra spicy beef patties and though I didn't find them that spicy for my taste buds, there was a lot of filling inside and the pastry was flaky and fresh.  They were a decent size as well. If you're in the area and craving a quick lunch or snack stop in at Patties Express."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make.   When I told the Patties Express guy that I took home a box of 12 frozen patties home and finished them over one weekend, he laughed and said, \"It's OK, you shared the box with your family, right?\" I dutifully replied with an enthusiastic \"OH, YES. Yessir, of course. \"   That was a lie. I ate them myself.   To be fair, I shared a few with the hubbs. And the fact that the moist, flavourful beef filling was a mix of spicy and extra spicy - well, that just burns the calories straight off, doesn't it?  Plus, the shell is nice and flakey straight out of the oven which means if it weighs nothing in your mouth, it must therefore equal nothing in the belly.  Science. To top it off, I only ate one coco bread with them. You may be wondering why bother with the bread restriction when demolishing so many patties anyway - and if you question whether it's because the slightly sweet, soft, triangular shape of the bun, sliced in half to perfectly cradle the patty wasn't worth it? Well then, you'd be wrong, cause those are pretty good too (although I  would still have to choose milk bread over coco bread). My only reason was because I ran out of room in my purse to lug it all home.   Should I be hash tagging this with \"SorryNotSorry\"? I'll do it after I get this new box of patties warmed up...  #SorryNotSorry"}
{"text":"The patties here are okay. I had the spicy beef patties, but found that it didn't even have a hint of spiciness to it. The beef filling I felt was pretty stingy, there was barely any meat."}
{"text":"Great quick n' cheap lunch option.    2 patties and a pop for under $5"}
{"text":"Interesting grab and go spot just off of Yonge. Where there used to be a full service Jamaican place is now a pattie stand catering to the working crowd or those looking for a snack.   It's simple: you get your choice of a few patties and heat levels, whether you want the pattie wrapped in coco bread, and if you want a drink.   I got the hot beef pattie wrapped in a coco bread for $3.50 including tax. The pattie was wrapped in a soft and warm bun and made the pattie much easier to eat and filling. Pattie is what you would expect while the coco bread was a welcome improvement.   The owner seems friendly, and always serves with a smile. This is my second time there and everything is consistent in quality. Would come back again for another light lunch or snack."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend while wondering around down town. The guy inside was so friendly and helpful. I opted for the beef patty inside the bread. The bread was soooo soft I could of eaten that alone. The patty was nice but I feel it could of had a bit more beef inside. They had a veg chicken or beef patty. Would def go back and try the veggie ones which looked really good and fuller than the meat patties."}
{"text":"Unfortunately you will not see any picture uploads from me for this.... Cause it was too damn tasty to stop and click a pic!  I'm usually looking to grab some food on my way home from swim lessons and this time I thought to try Patties Express. The guy behind the counter was super sweet and told us about all the varieties and spice levels available. We ended up getting the curry chicken and the mild beef. I absolutely loved the beef!!! Soooo good! I'm reading other people's reviews and wondering why I didn't buy a dozen!! Why?! Mr. H didn't seem like his patty that much and said it was just OK... :O  But I'm so coming back and totally trying it out with the coco bun next time :D this is definitely going to be my snack spot!"}
{"text":"can't believe I never been to this place till now. the smell of fresh baked patties are ongoing and draw you to store. For $2 a patty, you can't beat this price in downtown snack. Had both the mild, and white spice patty, both level of space is good for those who cannot take much heat. returned next day for more"}
{"text":"If you're hungry but you don't want a full meal, and you also don't want your snack to be a dessert, this is really your only option. And the patties are great."}
{"text":"Little shop- big taste! Stopped in there today while passing by and grabbed a patty for the road. Chatted with the humble owner and truly enjoyed the product!! Not only tasted great but filled me up as well. Great establishment, I recommend it 10/10 times!!"}
{"text":"The dough is good, but my issue is that the meat patties have very very little filling in them. My fav is the chicken patty followed by the spicy beef. The veggie patty was gross."}
{"text":"A cheap eat in downtown Toronto--a meal for less than five bucks, what?!  The man at the counter was very friendly. The shop is clean and spotless, a neater version of the patty shops in Kensington. The patties are nicely individually packaged and put in a paper bag.   I ordered 2 patties and a Coke for $4.39 + tax, which seemed reasonable. Wanted to try to get my veggie intake and ordered the veggie patty. I was terribly disappointed because the filling was so scant and it was mainly peas. Also this was described as \"spicy\" and even a spice-intolerant person like me would not give it that label! The beef patty, however, was much better. The filling is still less than what I am used to but was filling enough. The pastry was quite good: it wasn't too thick and it was crispy.   Would like to try the coco bread next time."}
{"text":"The shop is very small and cozy. I had a vegie patty, which was pretty decent for $2. The staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I tried out this place on a whim as was passing by their website mentioned they close early but upon inquiring I was told that they are open till 9 PM as they are trying out different schedules. I would call ahead though if visiting after 7. The place is clean and has a too the point setup. Not much space to linger and dine though so more of a grab and go kind of place.  I picked up half dozen for 8.95 and ordered a combo of Beef (Hot) and chicken (medium) spice levels as the friends I was visiting nearby don't eat hot food. My reference point for patties are mainly store bought and frozen type. These do fare better but not enough for me to convert to liking this item. The medium spicy chicken actually tasted spicier somehow (I guess chicken lends itself to spices). I don't have a reference point for what a good patties is supposed to taste or how to tell whether they are authentic but one can do a lot worse for a lot more in this area."}
{"text":"Just like Josephine, I found Patties Express when visiting Toronto from Vancouver. On my way out from Elmwood Spa..I was hungry and luckily Patties Express was right next door. Got my sister and I each a spicy beef, hot right out of the oven. Boy was it delicious. My last memory of a patty was a horrible one I had in Vancouver from some little food counter in Downtown Vancouver, it was disgusting. Once I had my spicy beef, I was hooked. Luckily I bought half a dozen home. The non spicy and chicken are both delicious too. Just quickly rebake at home.  Now that I've moved to Toronto recently, I made a trip to Patties Express and got a dozen to keep in the freezer and eat whenever I want! DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Patties Express offers a place for a quick, delicious, hit-the-spot bite. I ordered the extra spicy patty in a coco bun. While the extra spicy may not have the 'extra' that my burned-long-ago taste buds are craving, the patty was certainly well-seasoned and flaky. The coco bun was quite soft, although I heard a microwave going in the background and I hoped that it wasn't my bun defrosting.  Certainly worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place had the most delicious pattys  after having one me and my bf walked around for about 5 minutes then went back for 4 more. Prices were a great deal."}
{"text":"Was hungry for a snack after a long walk downtown. I've heard so much about this place and I love beef patties. Me and my girlfriend split a spicy beef patty that was 2 dollars. It was very nice and warm with a gooey filling. It unfortunately wasn't very spicy and there wasn't much filling either. It was decent for a snack but I won't be satisfying my patty cravings at this spot."}
{"text":"Nice fresh patties of chicken beef or veg for great prices. Soda and two patties for 4.50. Great deal! Little hole in the wall place means quick service and quite good."}
{"text":"Excellent patties for the price. Really friendly guy there too.  Quality: 8/10. Services: 9/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (Not an average)"}
{"text":"Well - let's just say I can't REALLY complain since other lunch options in the downtown core reach up to $10.  I've eaten quite a bit of patties before (and the ones from Golden Patty still takes the trophy), but this was fairly lackluster in terms of the patty itself. The coco bread was good - light, not too heavy, and just large enough to be satisfied for a meal.  The downfall here is... the patty themselves. I ordered the extra spicy beef and all I thought to myself was... where is all my meat? I ate through half the patty before I got a touch of it - which was fairly good. Unfortunately, there was not enough to enjoy the entire patty experience. I thought maybe this was just the one-off instance but after purchasing two to see, both were the same.  Decent lunch option but I wouldn't come back as there are other patty joints that is slightly cheaper and much more meat filling (Golden Patty!)"}
{"text":"Had the extra spicy ... and it wasn't ...  I'm giving this 2 stars , it's not terrible but it's not good ... the soupy meat inside was a little to gravy like for me ... Caribbean queen was my fav back in the day - home made. This tastes a little too canadianized no longer authentic."}
{"text":"Great beef patties; non spicy and spicy. Chicken and vegetarian as well.   $2 each $4.95 = 2 patties and a pop.   Staff are always friendly! Great snack or lunch!"}
{"text":"I went to two Jamaican/ Caribbean restaurants and neither of them had beef patties. I really had my heart set on them, but was let down... That is until my wife wanted some Indian food for dinner. We ordered her food and went down the street to sit and watch a show at buskerfest and eat her dinner. Out of the corner of my eye happen the spot this place. I am glad that I did, because they met my beef patty fix! I ordered my beef patty extra spicy, I don't know if extra spicy there is really weak or they handed me the wrong one, but I didn't really taste spiciness it all. That being said the beef patty was cooked right, crispy and flakey dough with a delicious well seasoned filling. It cost $2 for my beef patty fix, though I could've have gotten another patty and a soda for $5 total. If in the neighborhood, I would certainly stop again and grab a patty. In addition to mild, spicy and extra spicy beef patties; they also had chicken and veggie patties."}
{"text":"beef patty and coco bread...hot and fresh. loved every second of it. it was super close to our hotel and a pretty cheap snack while out exploring Toronto. service was fast and we wished we'd each gotten one instead of sharing"}
{"text":"This place has the best Jamacian Patties and I am so glad that I found them! It is super close to the Ryerson Campus and the prices are very student friendly. The mild and spicy are both amazing. Would reccommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here after seeing the sign and craving an evening snack. The beef patties here were perfect for what I wanted at the moment! I got the extra spicy one, and the spice level did not disappoint. The extra spicy beef patty was definitely spicier than the kind you'd typically get at the convenience stores. It has the kind of kick that builds on you at the back of the throat. The pastry around the beef had the perfect crunch to it. The price was reasonable too - $2.09 each.   The guy working there was friendly and there wasn't much of a line when I went around 9pm.   I personally wouldn't go out of my way to come here just for a beef patty, but it'll definitely be somewhere I'd stop for a snack whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place as I was looking for a quick bite to eat with no line up. I ordered the spicy beef patty and spicy chicken patty. As other reviewers mentioned, the patties are okay, nothing special. I found the pastry a bit on the dry side and it lacked filling. The beef filing was good, the chicken was bland. Not bad for a meal under $5 but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Patties are only $2 !! Great price for good quality food. You really get your money's worth. Everything is made from scratch and I love it. Good spot for some quick cheap food"}
{"text":"The perfect solution for every starving student at Ryerson. How I wish this was open when I was a student there!  I'm not sure how long Patties Express has been opened but this 'hole-in-the-wall' is easy to miss as it's tucked along Elm Street, just off Yonge Street. The name says it all: Patties Express. Simple menu of beef, chicken, and vegetarian patties at $2 each, or less depending on the quantity you buy.  I went with the spicy beefy patty, which had just a little kick. The beef to pastry ratio skewed more towards the pastry side for my liking, but the filling was salivating. I'll go with the extra spicy or try the chicken patty next time, and yes, there will definitely be a next time.  Victoria Park station still has the best beef patties in my opinion, but since I no longer live in that area, Patties Express will suffice."}
{"text":"Good and fast jamaican patties! Great place for busy days to grab and go.   Recommend the patty inside the coco bread (white bun). This was rec'd to me by others and I loved how it tasted as I never tried a patty this way before. Extra spicy is the best flavour to choose (if you can handle it)!  One star deducted for zero seating available if you wanted to sit.  Another tip is to be wary of biting the patty as the last time I ate it, the patty juice inside not only squirted on my shirt but also burned my hand (pipping hot)!"}
{"text":"Updating because I've already been here four times within the past two weeks and the cashier had recognized me. Still stand by my critique that the extra spicy beef patty could be spicier. Still gonna go back though."}
{"text":"THE BEST spicy beef patty I've EVER had. The filling was delicious, spread out (instead of being a lump in the middle) and actually had a kick, but it's the shell that's the star - flaky, tender and crispy... just perfect! Regret only buying one - next time I'm definitely getting the 2 patties + drink combo!"}
{"text":"Their patties are nothing special. And sometimes they are served too hot and the filling can burn! Watch out! Why four stars? This place is fast, cheap, and has a vibe I can't easily describe. It feels so... oddball.  The guy from Brazil who is always behind the counter when I go is just super friendly and ultra-enthusiastic about the patties.  When he delivers it to you in his almost baritone DJ like voice, with his eyes lit up, it's like he is slipping you gourmet food on a plate made of gold.  But it's a patty in a packet.  How does he do it, consistently, every time?  Honestly... I don't go for the food- although it is a quick, cheap fix.  I go when I'm nearby because every time I walk in and out of there I feel like I just stepped in and out of an eccentric Coen brothers movie scene. The Coco bread option for sandwiching your patty is a nice touch.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Really close to my lab. Not a bad choice for grab-and-go. Owner seems really friendly. Vegetarian ones taste so-so.  The beef one taste good. Chicken sold out:(  Seasoned well.  Craspy on the outside.  Warm and moist on the inside(altho quite a bit of air).  Pretty fresh."}
{"text":"Average at best. Patty is cooked  for too long so it's very crunchy and not enough filling."}
{"text":"This place serves great beef patties at a very reasonable price! I got a spicy beef patty with coco bread, and it was just perfect! This is a good place to just to grab and go. I would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Watch our visit here: https://youtu.be/y-HoH1rY0Ns If you have heard of Tastees you will be delightfully surprised. Super affordable, ($3) super great, super fast service. If you want a gourmet-esque great snack downtown and not burn dollars this is the place."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Your not going to get a full meal unless you eat a ton of patties. The patty and coco bread was sooooo good. Also a great price."}
{"text":"3/5  Decent taste filling with meh pastry.  It didn't have a lot of fillings but at least it wasn't bland or overly starch like some of patties I tried in TO. However pastry was dry, thick, hard and flavourless.  Wasn't bad but nothing to write home about.  Very standard patties and good place to fix your quick patty craving.  Recommend spicy beef."}
{"text":"Are you tired of Patty King*, those cheap Jamaican patties that are a familiar item of convenience stores, subway station stalls and frozen aisles throughout Toronto?  Then you need Patties Express, downtown Toronto's newest patties to-go go-to place!  Be blown away by the warm and juicy freshness oozing out of each bite of their beef patties. Eat happy knowing each freshly made patty is only less than $2! Order two and a soda for less than $5.  Hungry for a quick bite on Yonge Street? Stop by this tiny Elm Street takeout stand. Patties are standing by. Don't wait, eat today!  No nonsense friendly staff. No seating area though. Consult your stomach before participating.  (* the Patty King in question is not to be confused with the Patty King store at Kensington Market, which apparently has nothing to do with the Patty King International pre-made patties business.)"}
{"text":"Patties are fresh and delicious. Service has always been good and they do a good job making sure that they are consistent in the experience. Theyre pretty fast and the price is good. There is no sitting room, so you can only do take away.   If you want a cheap lunch or quick snack, this is the place to go.  Food: 4.5/5 - great patty. Would prefer a bit meatier. Service: 5/5 Price point: 4.5/5  Overall : 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Hot beef patties are to die for! The coco bread is really yummy too. I can't wait to try the extra spicy beef and the chicken patties! I will be back again and again and again..."}
{"text":"Talk about a little piece of heaven in a hand pie! Discovered this gem while strolling Yonge in the rain. So glad I ignored pizza pizza and Tim H's. Wandered in to find myself in Patty nirvana. Chicken curry, veggie, or beef--in not 1, but 3 varieties is spicy--and hit it 2 times in my 2 days. The two patties and a pop special was perfect. Filled my hankering for a bit of Brooklyn while I was in the Great North. The dough was flaky, fillings generous, and the spicy was just right. Glad they were open Easter Sunday and let me break my fast in the best way. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Even a great patty is still a patty? Not if you've had BAD patties. This is the best patty I've had in the city."}
{"text":"I have the utmost respect and admiration for people who love their craft and you can really sense that in George (okay, I don't know his real name but I am going to call him this because it's my go-to name). This guy is passionate about his patties and it shows....except that the results aren't all that delicious.  Patties always bring back fond memories of the middle/high school days. It's a nostalgic throwback that I have a hard time resisting but as I have scoured the city and tried patty after patty, it is apparent that a good patty is far and few.  Unlike most, you can actually taste the freshness in these patties. You don't get that this-has-been-frozen-since-the-last-ice-age kind of taste you usually come to expect. The crust is nice and flaky but maybe a little too thick and a tad on the dry side. What really did disappoint was the filling. No matter what you pick; chicken, beef or vegetables there just doesn't seem to enough of it and whatever little is there lacked flavour.  I would say drop by for that nostalgic feeling or if you must absolutely have a patty today but otherwise there are many more great options on this street."}
{"text":"The prices are great for what it is. Not sure of any patty spots around the immediate vicinity, other than by College street.  However the quality of the patties are definitely not the greatest. Thick, no flakyness, dense and flavorless. Staff super friendly and helpful, but I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST patties ever, amazing deal and the man is always so friendly. I come here once a week"}
{"text":"So I had read about Patties Express and was trying to pick a good day to go check it out. Also I thought it was located right in the heart of one of the academic jungles in Toronto known as Ryserson campus and not really wanting to traverse my way through throngs of campus denizens, I just never made it here... until a couple of weeks ago. I was walking from west to east along elm street trying to look for a much raved about Chinese bakery/cafe in the vicinity when I came across this place. Being hungry and having wanted to try something here, I just decided to look for the bakery another day. The man who takes care of the curry colored pockets makes the customer feel welcomed. I had a medium spicy Curry Chicken one on the first trip which tasted alright even though I ate only after sometime. Then yesterday as well, I came back here after getting some baked goods and this time decided to get the patty and coco bread sandwich. I picked the medium spicy Beef one, and the same guy from the first trip was here and he placed one that was coming hot out of the oven into the bread. That patty was so warm wedged up between the slice of fluffy coco bread. Yeah, I'll have to let it sit for abit next time so that the filling is allowed to set and will not ooze out like molten lava. And I like the texture of the pastry at Patties Express, it's firm and not crumbly so when I bite into it the pasty does not flake all over. The price is pretty reasonable and  it's decent for a comforting hand-held snack to eat whole walking and see what's happening along downtown Yonge Street. And like I said on another review. I'll be coming here if I don't want to go all the way to Kensington Market to enjoy a nice, soothing patty. Both times I've been at this place after 3pm and there isn't a line up to get one which makes me glad :-)"}
{"text":"Pastry not flaky.  Veg patty pretty dry.  They don't sell goat patties either :(  If you prefer more delicate pastry then skip this place.   I am thirsty after eating it."}
{"text":"Love the flaky fluffy patty with super moist filling! Patty + Ting soda.... yummmm :)"}
{"text":"I've been here countless of times already because it's a cheap and quick place to grab a bite to eat. The name of the place tells you all you need to know about it. It sells Jamaican beef patties. You can either get chicken or beef and there are varying degrees of hotness. If you are a person who can handle some spice, I would advise going straight for the extra spicy option.  In addition, they also have coco bread! Now I know what you are all thinking. The patty is enough, the bread will add too much dough and it won't taste like anything. But NO! That's not true. The coco bread is made fresh by the owner bright and early every single morning and brought to the store (so yes, there is only a limited amount each day). The bread is soft and slightly sweet, perfectly baked and then after the sweet soft cushion bread you get this flaky pastry from the patty. It is definitely something worth trying!   Okay this review is getting to be a bit too long. Unfortunately I don't have a picture for you this time but I'm sure to take a picture next time. The top it all off, everyone I have seen so far behind the cash register there is beyond nice."}
{"text":"If you are hankering for a snack, this is the express to stop at.  An immediate satisfying cure for the hunger pangs!!  I had the spicy beef patty with coco bread. Walk in, drop off 3.50 and walk out with the pipping hot bag in under 2 minutes. Each spicey bite is balanced with the sweetness of the bread. The filling of the patty is generous and moist, oozing out in places as you bite through the middle section. Mmmm.... delicious."}
{"text":"Great patties BUT filling is less and less over the last few months.  Service is fast and friendly.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Very average to me. Almost tasted like the boxed patties that you can buy at grocery stores. I had the medium spicy beef patty and also tried the chicken curry patty. Nothing special about the beef patty. The chicken curry patty had very little filling and didn't have a very strong curry taste. In terms of the spice level, I would say they are on the milder side of spice.   If you're looking for a good patty, I would recommend Randy's or Allan's."}
{"text":"Excellent patties!  A buddy of mine is a patty FIEND, so when we heard about Patties Express we had to give it a shot.  A tiny spot on Elm Street, this place is made for patties to go. Beef (mild, spicy, extra spicy), chicken (curry), and veggie (spicy?) are the options.  We ordered a 1/2 dozen and tried some of each. The beef patties were plump and moist, with enough filling that we were risking some overflow moments halfway through. Flavour was really good. Chicken patties were curry flavoured, and also quite delectable.   The price is right, and these are the perfect grab-and-go snack."}
{"text":"The best quick takeout lunch.  They offer an endless supply of freshly prepared, succulent Jamaican patties in beef, chicken, and vegetarian.   I'd post a picture but I smashed my two patties (extra spicy beef, chicken) too soon.    I got the two patties and a pop (under $6 with tax).   If you're looking for a tasty lunch or snack, pay a visit to my guys at PATTIES EXPRESS.  YOU won't regret.   They take credit, debit, and ca$h.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here last week. The owner or whoever the man was serving at the front was really nice. The patty was okay. Not bad at all. It was the spiciest they had and it had an okay kick. It was about $2 I think, I can't remember because my friend paid. I wouldn't really go out of my way for it but if I saw it again, sure why not. I'm really committed to Randy's which is close by where I live and one of the best I've had in the city. So idk I'm kind of indifferent here."}
{"text":"Had an extra spicy beef pattie and it was delicious! Perfect amount of crispness and the meat was flavorful! About $1.89, cheap but tasty."}
{"text":"Came here last year. It was pretty good but nothing to write home about. If you want a quick snack and you are in the area get a patty and proceed across the street for a bubble tea."}
{"text":"Awesome possum. These patties are great, meat tasted really fresh. The employee I met was really pleasant, overall great experience. Def recommend to anyone who likes patties and co co bread."}
{"text":"It hits the spot. If I'm in the neighbourhood, I like to grab a quick $2 patty. It's well-made, hot, and gets the job done. Don't ever go to a convenience store for a patty. Go here.  4 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"It is an amazing place for having snacks. I had spicy chicken and spicy beef and loved them specially beef one."}
{"text":"Are the vegetarian patties vegan? Or are they just vegetarian?   One of the cashiers said they were vegan, but it seems that we can't get a straight answer from anyone. The website is sketchy and when we ring the store up, no one picks up. Boo to ambiguity. Toronto is usually good at this type of stuff but it's just been a pain in the rear end for a simple question!  The vegetarian patty was okay. Kinda bland though and I would much prefer the ones I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Really fresh and delicious patties. I always grab a quick one as a snack on the go. I prefer mild beef but I heard the spicy has a really good kick too.   I love that they're made fresh everyday & that it's such an affordable option. Definitely worth the extra cents to buy here than eat frozen ones from home, also much tastier than the ones offered at convenience stores.   Caution: filling is super hot so be careful not to burn your tongue!"}
{"text":"My husband is English and therefore loves any type of handheld meat pie. Seriously, any. He loved this place so much. We were staying nearby for a few days and I think we stopped twice, maybe three times. It's a really good value - 2 patties and a pop for under $5. I tried the medium spicy beef pie and it was really satisfying and tasty. Friendly guys working there, too."}
{"text":"$2 for a patty. A bit more expensive than what i've paid for a patty at other places, but not terribly priced. The patty came straight out of the oven, which for me, justified the premium. Becareful, the beef is piping hot and it burned when I bit into it and the beef squeezed out of the other end."}
{"text":"We were on Yonge street and passed by this cute little joint. Found it intriguing and gave it a try. We had no idea before this what a patty was. We learned it is a Caribbean snack. We tried the spicy chicken. It's filled with lots of flavor. It was $2.19 Canadian, which is very reasonable. It's not a large snack, so we could have easily eaten more than one. The guy was really friendly, which really appreciated. This is basically a little stand, so you want to just get your patty on the go. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. I got a dozen freshly baked from the oven, so the insides were super hot and juicy. The spicy beef tasted mild to be called spicy imo. Also, not enough beefy flavour like at Randy's. I also tried the chicken curry. But not much of a curry flavour, it was a bit of a let down flavour wise. It tasted more like chicken soup in a patty. The crust was flakey crispy good though. Still good for some fresh baked patties in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for a quick snack or order a bunch of food for a cheap meal. I only tried a veggie patty but I have to say I was slightly disappointed with both the amount of filling and the flavour/vegetables. Next time I will try a chicken one as I've heard good things. Not bad for the price you pay and quick service though."}
{"text":"Great place to get patties, and I totally recommend you try it if you haven't already . I am very happy with the price and quality that I would get half a dozen patties everytime I am passing by or am in the area.  It's definitely easy to eat especially if you don't have time. The store owners are very friendly, there was a brizilan guy who helped us decide the first time my fiance and I were there and we had a nice chat with him about Brazil!! Very friendly and super passionate about helping customers.  The patties have always been fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pattie I've had. It is no wonder that this place always has a line up. It is always fresh and most often than not they have a batch coming out of the oven.   The spicy ones are the best but for those of us who cannot take too much spice the mild one is also very good. They are $2/pattie and they also have combos with a drink."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick snack to hold us over till dinner. We stumbled across this place. It is a tiny location with one gentlemen selling the patties. I picked spicy chicken and it was crazy good. I like the crumbly crust and the spicy filing was creamy. This really hit the spot for a quick snack."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Elmwood Spa, I see this Patty place.  It's a tiny take-out place with just enough standing room for about 5 customers so there's usually a line up out the door at around lunch time.   I had a bit more time yesterday after Elmwood, so I decided to finally give it a try.   As my first intention was to only get 1 patty,  I ended up getting 1/2 dozen.  I know my daughter and husband will not be please if I didn't bring one home for them to try.  I got the spicy chicken patty to eat on my way home which was piping hot and tasty.  It was a perfect lunch/snack if you want something quick, filling, and cheap!  It works out to only $1.49 for one if you get 1/2 dozen.  The chicken patties only comes in spicy but it wasn't too spicy so it might not appeal to those who like spicy ones.  The 2nd one that I had this morning was the spicy beef reheated at home was just as good."}
{"text":"Best patties I've ever had! Spicy beef or chicken is my favorite! You can't just eat one."}
{"text":"One word describes these patties. Wow! I was in this neighborhood and was looking for a hotdog vendor when I came across this place by accident.  There were several great options and I ending up choosing a vegetarian pattie which is probably like having a meatless hotdog but it was amazing. Enough spice to give it some kick and loaded with a generous helping of vegetables. This take-out pattie  joint is passionate about their food and it shows in the quality. For $2.00 this is one of the best snack food deals in the 6ix. The owner said the shop makes them fresh every day and it judging by the taste, he is right. Next time I am in this hood I think I will buy a dozen of them (they are that good) If you are ever at Elm and Yonge, you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! This place is awesome. This hits the spot on a very cold day. I bought the vegetarian patty on a whim and I'm so glad I did. It was rainy and freezing but this warmed me up and it was delicious. The bread itself was too good! Wasn't too spicy. I will def be coming back, even going out of my way to get another patty."}
{"text":"Perfect snack. Patties always bring me back to high school days, since I would get a beef patty literally (note the correct use of \"literally\") everyday between first and second period. This bit of nostalgia meant that the noticeably fresher patties at Patties Express was a huge delight!  BF and I got our little snack of 2 patties and a pop for $5. Great deal for a good lil snack! I picked the mild beef patty, for pure Nostalgia, and BF got the chicken. The chicken was a bit spicy, kinda curry-like. Both were great, and nice and hot to eat right away.  Side Story: As we eat outside on the bench, we are pestered by little birds for crumbs. My BF bestows some \"age-old\" wisdom to me: birds to do not sh*t on the people who feed them. And the age-old Murphy's Law kicked in 1 minute later, when a shot of birdsh*t narrowly misses my BF, and is the exact colour of the patties we just ate. This made for a good laugh the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"Cheap, awesome & convenient!  When you don't want to spend a lot of money for food, just swing by here! The guy behind the counter is extremely enthusiastic with what he does, I appreciate it. As mentioned, they have really good deals to choose from and I highly recommend the spicy beef patty!  I tried the spicy chicken and spicy beef, I loved the texture of the patty, how flaky it was. The filling was at the right amount as well."}
{"text":"Veggie patties were flaky and the filling was cooked perfectly.  When the grease and grime of Yonge fast food shops turns your stomach rest here and you'll be glad."}
{"text":"It's hard to beat the price for lunch downtown, $2 per patty. This is a takeout patty spot, there's no seating. There's often a lineup out the door, especially in summer, but it moves fast. Staff is always friendly.  The patties are good, but could be a little less dry, both the pastry and filling. Get the extra spicy, it's the only one with any kick at all."}
{"text":"Remember high school and getting patties for lunch? Well, this place is a much better #tbt to your high school convenience store patty. Got the non-spicy beef patty and coco bread; I think I would not get the coco bread next time and go for the spicy. Literally hole-in-the-wall and it's a decent snack for a decent price. Best part is that it's fresh, not frozen."}
{"text":"Consistent quality product have been there day and night with the same good results, as opposed to the patty having sat around for most of the day.  Great service for the most part and where else are you going to find a great snack at the price."}
{"text":"Good patties at a good value. I had the spice beef and was really happy with the taste. The first patty was almost perfect but the second one has barely any filling. They need to fill them up more if they want that 5th star."}
{"text":"$2 tax in for an amazing patty!  Had the spicy beef, it had just the right kick, amazing crust, enough filling.  Going to try the curry chicken next time for sure.  Would love to see a \"stuffed patty\" option with lettuce and tomato!  D"}
{"text":"Amazing patty, cheap and great customer service by Paolo. Other guy who works there, not so much."}
