{"text":"For 6.70 including tax I got a bibimbap which tastes great, soup, and a side dish. It was fast they were friendly, all around great experience. Would come here again and would bring friends. And would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We came on a packed Tuesday night and there was only one server who seemed very unexperienced. Service was very slow and unsatisfactory. We waited 30 minutes for our water and 10 more minutes for our pork dish... only to be disappointed in how little they served considering it cost $10.98 for a plate. Didn't even come with side dishes. It was difficult to get the servers attention too. The spicy fried pork was very hard to chew and was not fresh. Overall quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheap & cheerful is what you'll find here.  Food is clean-tasting and not laden with MSG. For this area especially, it's a Korean gem. 

Though not served in a stone bowl, Kimchi fired rice is simple and tasty. I hadn't meant to eat a whole plate of rice, but it kept me coming back. 

Loved the cold soup noodle and drank a lot of the soup. Toppings were standard, but I missed the Asian pear. Still, very satisfying on a hot day. 

Solid Korean at a decent price. Some really fantastic lunch deals going on too. Worth repeat visits!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best bibimbap ever.
I was so hungry walking downtown Toronto, and saw this Korean restaurant on Yonge street.
The lunch specials were so cheap and I just had to check out the store!
When I went inside the store, it was booming with people and even though the server was busy, they were super attentive.
There was only one server, and I totally understand how busy it gets in the shop during lunch time.
The smell of the restaurant was so good so I had to order right away.
I ordered one of the most traditional korean dish \"bibimbap\" and it tasted so good.
It was a little salty for my taste, but I understand because I've heard that Korean food is quite salty and most of the foods are fermented. 
I can't wait to tell all my friends to eat at this restaurant and throw my baby shower here too!
I will bring my boyfriend here, when I have one. But for now, since I'm single, I'll be dining here alone. 
Sooo, all you single thirsty bachelors, let's dine together!!! Dinner is ON ME!!!"}
{"text":"I always tend to come here to have lunch. 
Reason being that their food is fantastic! 
The people there are also very kind and friendly, plus, the whole restaurant has this nice warm vibe. 
I suggest people to come here if they are craving Japanese or Korean food because it is just simply delicious and the price is fair! :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean place to eat at for its price range. It has a small, but nice selection of free side dishes and extremely affordable food (usually around $7-10). Their tangsooyuk (deep fried pork) is amazing. I generally get the tangsooyuk and jajjangmyun (black bean noodles) but their stews and fried rice are good as well.

It's definitely not a place where you expect or get high quality food, but if you're craving korean food and you don't want to pay $10+ or don't want to go all the way to Christie, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, I like the Jajang Bap in particular, but the service is sub par unfortunately. Staff was sullen to the point of rudeness when I asked for the salad that the menu says I should receive with a lunch special. They just do whatever they want and get rude when you call them on it. Its sad. Otherwise tasty food albeit small portions."}
{"text":"I can always count on Danji for a quick bite when I'm starving. Their food is always consistently delicious, the service is prompt and friendly, and the price is affordable being a student. The interiors are warm, nothing to write home about, but cosy nonetheless. 

Favourites: Jajangmyun, and kimchi jiggae. 

8.5/10! :)"}
{"text":"Poor portions. Ordered a bi bim bap, and they only gave me one spoon of chicken! I asked the waitress to add more and all I heard was yelling from the chef and nothing extra was added."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, the food is excellent and staff are friendly.

Both dine in and take out.

Awesome Korean and maki on Yonge St downtown."}
{"text":"Within this area, this is probably one of the best Korean restaurants. I always lean towards the soups - kimchi jjigae (kimchi stew) & soondubu jjigae (Tofu Stew). Just don't get it with beef, because the one time I did, they used the same beef from their sweet marinated beef dish (bulgogi), which made my stew oddly sweet. Danji is definitely my go-to when I don't want to trek it to KTown on Bloor. The service is always good, and the food is cheap, and consistent."}
{"text":"Very cheap korean fast food, sake and beer. Service is quick and friendly. Dont expect a crazy nice set up or ambiance. Where you would go for a quick good quality korean bite. Their spicy pork/japchae is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've definitely had better and bigger portions for cheaper prices. The taste was decent, but like I said, I've experienced better. 
I got the black bean noodle and glass noodle for take out.
The wait was 25 min and the portions were definitely small.
They definitely use way too much oil for my liking.

I received a small \"sauce\" container for a korean side dish. It was potatoes w/a sweet savory sauce, to be honest that was the best part of the meal. That free side was delicious but DRENCHED in oil. (Refer to the picture I posted)"}
{"text":"Service is very fast and food is cheap.  Portion was of a good size and restaurant was clean. The only complain I have and the reason why 3 stars is that the food was way too salty. From the bibimpamp, to the kimchi, everything tasted of salt."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and had pork bone soups.  It tasted way too plain, felt like they've added too much water.  Did not enjoy it at all.  Out of all the Korean restaurants I've been to, this one serves the worst pork bone soup.  However, they have many other dishes and sushi rolls which I haven't tried.  

If you are going to order pork bone soup then don't bother."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup. It was really busy inside and you could see the back kitchen was well staffed. Service was fast and prices are average but the quality was low. The short ribs were super fatty, tough and too sweet. The seafood soup lacked much in the way of seafood.

Also, even though we did pickup we were surprised with the lack of sides - they didn't even give us kimchi."}
{"text":"The best pork bone soup for the price of $5.95+tax. I like how it is boiling as they serve it.. 
They have good lunch specials and very friendly server. 
They serve yummy side dishes too.
Great place if you are craving for korean food."}
{"text":"I've been to danji twice and while the food is fairly standard fare, I find that the portion sizes are too small.   Compared to other Korean restaurants around the area and that of K - town, the portion sizes are tiny.  
I ordered a seafood pancake for $8 and while it was tasty, it consisted of mostly batter and maybe one or two pieces of squid. That's not really acceptable. The size of the pancake was also about the size of a standard desert plate which is tiny! 

The first time I went to danji I tried to jajangmyeun which is basically just meat sauce over noodles.  It wasn't bad but certainly wasn't the best.   The second time I went which was today I had the cold noodle dinner special.  Again, it was edible but it literally consisted of a bunch of noodles, half an egg, and very few pieces of Shredded radish.  For $8 I really expected more.  You can get a very decently loaded bowl of pho for $8.

My dining partner ordered the japchae which was also incredibly small. It looked to be about half the size that other Korean restaurants serve but the price was the same. I get that they are a small mom and pop restaurant and that they have to skimp somewhere to be profitable but there is no excuse to skimping on food.  I mean, you are a restaurant for heavens sake. Your main product is food! 

The kicker and reason why they score a measly 2 stars is because they did not include any ban chan or side dishes of kimchi or the regular side dishes.  I am not Korean and my dining partner was Caucasian so I'm not sure if they thought they could pull a fast one on us and not offer us any side dishes. Everyone else in the restaurant got some.  So if they want to skimp on that then I will simply never return here. 

I don't recommend this restaurant.  There are other choices steps away that offer better value and with food that is above the decidedly average food served at Danji."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in the neighbourhood for Korean restaurant. Pork bone soup and kimchi soup is still my favourite. And I usually order spicy rice cake on the side for people to share. It's perfect as an appetizer because of the portion and the taste. Cheap, convenient location, and nice people! Service  can be a little slow if you go during lunch or dinner time. They only have one waitress serving the hall!"}
{"text":"Danji is a great place for cheap eats - will come back (the whole point of restaurant!). 
For 5.95 you can choose a bunch of things on their lunch menu like beef and rice, pork bone soup and jajang rice. It's nothing mind blowingly amazing, but the fact that it's downtown and a walk around from Ryerson Campus makes it a good meal for its price. It's been cold this winter in Toronto, so some gamjatang is great to fill you up with warmth."}
{"text":"My favorite korean restaurant in downtown. 
Best suntufu I've ever eaten! I go for the dish at least once a week.  Other dishes such as korean pancake, deep fried chicken and bibimpa were all good too. 
Quick service, decent price and convenient location."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5. I think that I will only come here during lunch specials because it really is what makes it worthwhile to come here when there's really so much Korean food options in the area. 

I ordered the jajangbap (so jajangmyun sauce with rice and fried egg on top) and it was great. The jajang sauce had a lot of fix ins but more potato than meat which is fairly understandable. You also get a bunch of banchans, but unfortunately on the day I visited there weren't any honey potatoes left so that was a bit disappointing. Aside from the affordable lunch price though I don't think the food itself is anything out of the ordinary, but nonetheless it's a great place if you're a student on a budget and don't mind ordering the same stuff regularly since the lunch specials are fairly limited in terms of options. Service is friendly but just a taaad slow even when the place wasn't too busy.

Tip: Cash only if your order is below $10! Though if you're desperate I hear it's possible to negotiate for debit. But since you're reading this right now, you should know better ;)"}
{"text":"The food is so affordable, it was totally worth the price. I had the bibim baap and the bulgogi(spicy beef). Both were good, i really recommended the bulgogi. Also, they have special lunch offers, at a lower price. Great for casual brunches"}
{"text":"you can't go wrong with pork bone soup since I realize that they all taste the same no matter which Korean restaurant you go. Lunch special is very cheap at Danji, about $7(tax and tips included) for a warm and filling pork bone soup and side dishes. Love the potato side dish they offer, very soft and sweet. Only thing is that sometimes the staff will rush you to order."}
{"text":"Very busy Korean spot on Yonge Street. We came for dinner on Tuesday, and were very happy to get a table because of just how busy it was. Not a lot of atmosphere and the servers seemed a little overwhelmed. 

We tried the glass noodles and I had the spicy chicken tofu. 3 banchans, kimchi, potatoes and bean sprouts. The food (after a bit of a wait) was really good. 

Conclusion: not the best Korean in Toronto , but a good lunch option in this area."}
{"text":"I called them and told them about the black hair in my food, the girl kept leaving the phone to talk to whoever without telling me, no hold, or anything.

Was on the phone with them and they basically asked me why didn't I call that day, BECAUSE IT WAS TAKE OUT AND I OPENED IT AT 12AM. I told them this multiple times. My hair is blonde so in no way could it have been mine either.

In the end nothing was resolved. She talked to me in a condescending tone the entire time and the person she was talking to was giving attitude as well, P.S. if you're going to talk shit when the phones on, make sure the person on the line can't hear it.

All I asked was to have the meal replaced and they didn't even offer that. It would cost them less than $1 to remake."}
{"text":"Good korean food! We go there at least twice a week. Pork bone soup is really nice, and also really cheap (5.95 for lunch)."}
{"text":"Ok when it's been like minus 3 kajiliionbillion degrees like it has this winter, all I want is some PBS (Pork Bone Soup).

There's nothing like some scalding hot broth brought to you still bubbling, loaded with meat and potatoes.   It's a messy ordeal that requires a bit of skill if you're a true PBSer.  Working at getting to the marrow and sucking it bone dry.

Danji may not be the fanciest Korean place, but $6.50 (including tax) for the PBS is a fantastic deal.  You get a few side dishes and a bowl of rice, and when its minus 2350 catillionbillion degrees outside, this is what the Doctor ordered."}
{"text":"If you want cheap eats, it's hard to do better than Danji. Well, there is McDonalds but that doesn't count. The food here is not the greatest, but it's certainly not terrible. It's a very \"bang for your buck\" restaurant. Lunch specials are $5.95 + tax. Wow! For this price you get a full meal.

They have all the Korean staples like pork bone soup, spicy rice cake, bibimbap, cold noodles, fried rice etc. Anything basic you'll find here. They don't have table cooking or chicken ginseng soup. They do have some rolls but not sushi. 

The side dishes are adequate. They only serve 3 side dishes. Combined with the lack of Korean words on the menu, it doesn't feel as Korean as other places. But that's not really a negative to me. 

The food itself is just so so. Bibimbap portion looks huge. Pork bone soup was not the best I've had but not the worst. Chicken Katsu is well...chicken katsu. There are not many ways to screw up chicken katsu. Most of their food items are \"quick kitchen\" stuff. 

It's not a place you'd go out of your way to try. If you work in the area and need a source of cheap lunch, this place is for you. Korean food is certainly going to be healthier than burgers and fries. Eat those veggies!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch special on a whim yesterday and it hit the spot. I generally subscribe to the \"dolsot or NOTHING\" philosophy with bibimbap, but the regular with tofu ($6.5) was good enough that I didn't miss the hot stone bowl at all. (Well, maybe a little.) Banchan was limited but the Gamja jorim (glazed potatoes) were delicious and inspired us to purchase the ingredients to attempt making the dish at home.

A lowlight: they do charge you to doggy bag your leftovers, even if you've already paid and tipped, which is utter insanity."}
{"text":"Danji is a cute, hole-in-the-wall Korean restaurant that I'd walked by several times but never noticed until recently, when I went for dinner a couple weeks ago, and again with friends last night. It's a small, cozy place that looks a bit run down but generally is quite clean. The servers are friendly and food was pushed out at a good pace. Both times that I've been was around 7:30p, at which the service was quite fast so food was on the table quickly. They only have one waitress (I get the feeling this may be a family owned place, or that they're understaffed). They helpfully place a jug of cold water at the table which is nice so we can all self-serve ourselves cold water, which is helpful when having hot food. The food is slightly salty, so be mindful of this if you're sensitive to excess sodium levels, but generally the food is satisfactory across the board."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are what keep me coming back over and over again to this place.  They're phenomenally cheap at under $7.  They include soups, large portions of meat and vegetables  along with affordable sides.  

The service is quick and cheap, they do offer take out, however you get larger portions and a wider selection of free side dishes by eating in the restaurant.  The food is very authentic and I often frequent Danji when looking to satisfy my craving for Korean food.  Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Why come here: You want a tasty, palette-cleansing, homemade meal for cheap and don't want to feel bloated after.

Why you shouldn't come here: You want MSG-infused flavour and a big show with all the sizzling stone pots and want to feel sick and bloated afterwards.

Okay, now that I've given you a guilt trip...onto the review.  I came here during my lunch break on Sunday.  I had all the intention in the world to go to Tokyo Grill but I saw it was cash only and this place took debit. SCORE!  

Atmosphere: Nothing to write home about, but it was a small, clean inviting restaurant.   3.5/5

Service: 3.5/5 Very friendly waiter 

Food: 4/5 I ordered the beef bibimibap and spicy salmon dishes.  As with most Korean places, this all came with banchan (Korean side dishes), which included kimchi, some kind of bean curd, potato and miso soup.  Miso soup was one of the better  Korean miso's I've had, all the other banchan was okay.  

As for the main courses: Beef bibimibap (lunch special) for $5.95.  While not served in  stone pot, this is still a large portion with all the standard rice, bulgogi, eggs and veggie.  It was very good and refreshing.  The spicy salmon was only $4.95.  It was essentially a dynamite roll with spicy mayo and it had a nice crunchy taste to it but could still taste the salmon. Lovely.

Price: 5/5.  I paid $12, taxes in, for all the food above. SWEET!!!

All in all, great quick lunch spot. Overal, 4/5."}
{"text":"I'm soooo addicted to this place! It's been a while since I've actually taken the time to write a review. But they're this good! I have their pork bone soup during lunch as their special $5.95 from 11am-3pm during the week. They're closed on Mondays. The pork literally falla off the bone, and it's so tender. Soup is perfect, not too spicy nice and hot for this cold weather here in Toronto right now. This little place is very cute and clean. Even their washrooms are well kept and very clean. We all know how Toronto washrooms can get."}
{"text":"Really tasty Korean food at great value! I tried the spicy bulgogi with rice and the seafood pancake. The bulgogi paired with some hot sauce was absolutely delicious and the pancake was really good as well! Sides were a bit thin but the sweet potato deserves a special mention. All in all, for $6.99+tax you can't complain! Will definitely be back to sample the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I live around the area and this is my go to korean place. Their price is very good for the amount of portions they give. I enjoy their side dishes as well and that is always a added bonus. Lots of selections too! Highly recommend for a simple dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Very well priced lunch - amazing bang for the buck. Had spicy beef with kimchi and special pork with kimchi - both tasted very good. They serve free bean sprouts, and kimchi. Small eating area but warm and cozy"}
{"text":"Obviously there are better Korean restaurants if you're willing to make the distance to Koreatown but if you're working in the are and just want to grab a bite to eat, this would be pretty decent. 

Their lunch specials are filling for about $9 (tax and tip included) and the food is fresh and well-made. Went with a coworker last week, I got the pork bone soup which I think should be a well done staple in any Korean restaurant and it was really hearty (didn't even finish it!). He got the bibimbap and reported also filling and yum. 

The staff is friendly, even the single waitress who seems overwhelmed during the lunch rush since she's the only one serving. You might have to call her over multiple times and repeat requests but she's so nice and apologetic it's not even an issue."}
{"text":"My go-to take-out kfood restaurant. It's cheap, filling and delicious. So far my favourite item on their menu is still good old bibimbap with beef. It comes with assorted veggies, a fried egg and some very flavourful bulgogi on top of white rice. It also has some korean hot sauce on the side. We ordered tangsuyuk the other day but the pork was a bit too dry to my taste. it was meh.
My only complaint is that i wish they would give out more banchan when it comes to take out - even kimchi would do. Now its only some Gamja jorim (but very sweet and tasty)."}
{"text":"I'm an addict. $6.95 bibimbap. I'm all about free so the included side dishes make me quite happy. The potato-ish side dish is my favorite, it's sweet, salty, and packs some good onion flavor. The bibimbap has super-fresh veggies and is nicely seasoned with sesame oil. If you're new, don't be scared by the \"hot sauce\", it's not so hot but it is awesome, pour it on liberally. I'm also a big fan of the yam roll. It has perfect tempura crunch and is drizzled with some killer sauce. The service is acceptable, not a lot of smiles, but the guy is quick and always checks in to make sure everything is ok. I like that they plop a jug of water on the table because I'm a drinker and get annoyed if I need to flag someone for a refill. The interior is pretty clean and the orange walls are bright and cheery, but it could use a make-over. Oh and lunch specials for $5.95."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch close to my work. I always order their special lunch menu which has a few choices at $5.95, probably the cheapest Korean food I found ever. Sometimes it can get quite busy at lunch, but the waitress (I see her every time) is always rushing and has a really good attitude. The food is your average Korean restaurant but what makes it a 4-star is the price and location. 

I also tried the Red Dragon Roll, which came with 10 pieces (? - maybe 8) and it was quite good! Would highly recommend this place if you are in the area looking for a good and cheap lunch :)."}
{"text":"Having eaten a good amount of authentic Korean food with my Korean belle, I was excited to see what Korean food would be like down town. On a weekday night, some time late after work, I went to Danji to get takeout. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with what I got. I ordered bulgogi and haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) - but these dishes weren't up to the same level as I'd had at other Korean places.

The Bad: 
The bulgogi had lots of other stuff mixed with it (onions, zucchini) instead of just bulgogi beef. It was also not particularly well grilled - it didn't have that strong grill flavor but rather more of a pan fry taste. The seafood pancake was also very limp, rather than crispy, and the sauce was overly salty (and I can handle really salty). For me, the cardinal sin was that the bulgogi was a little bit spicy but not nearly as spicy as it should have been. 

The Good: 
On the other hand, they give you miso soup and rice and one banchan dish (sweet potato) with a takeout order. The one banchan dish did seem kind of random - I would've liked some kimchi - but it was still a nice surprise. Their lunch special seems to be what to get here - so cheap! Alas, I'm not sure how good or would be given the quality of their other stuff.

One caveat may be that Danji, like other Korean restaurants I've eaten at in Toronto, is more attuned to local tastes. That would explain the less spicy, the mixed bulgogi, and the saltier seafood pancake sauce. After all, the gamja tang (pork bone soup) that is really popular in Toronto is very like many Chinese soups you can did elsewhere here. So if you enjoy this kind of taste, you'll enjoy Danji, but if you are more used to the Korean food in, say, California, this may not be the best for you.

Overall: Danji was nice and fast, but I'll have to give it another chance the next time I'm in Toronto. On my first experience, I wasn't particularly impressed, but I'm not sure if that's because I was expecting something different."}
{"text":"I asked for non spicy chicken soon tofu, but i got spicy, so i went back and told them to change one. And they just dump the old one back in the pot, and rinse the foam container, and tada, a \"new\" non spicy soup! Oh my, how generous! At least gave me a new container!! So cheap and they charge .50cents for containers, those things are like 5cent each, how cheap can you be

Usually i could eat a little spicy, no problem. But I wasn't feeling well that day, and i need something hot and I couldn't take anything spicy. Its not that I'm picky, its just unpleasant see them do that"}
{"text":"It's Korean fast food. Enuf' said."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Korean food and restaurant. This place just isn't good at all. I ordered the seafood pancake and bibimbap. The bibimbap had very little meat and taste was a bit off, some of the vegetables were that fresh either so not very good(2/5) and the seafood pancake was just terrible. It wasn't crispy like it should be or soft on the inside like it should be, on top of this it had a fishy taste that only come from frozen seafood that has been frozen for a while and went a bit bad (0/5). Lastly, the worst part is in an almost empty restaurant they brought us the bill before we even finished eating. I find this very rude even in an asian restaurant. If you are on Yonge and want korean, go to Yummy Bar-B-Q."}
{"text":"Second time to this place and the food is good and cheap. Had bibimbap the other day and it was great. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"We were here the other day.  It seemed like  they have very regular take out business.  A steady stream of folks would enter and order.  We stayed to eat.  We order japchae. (The clear sweet potato noodles) yum with beef.  I had the dolsot bimbimbap which was delicious!  We also ordered the bulgogi - another tasty choice. Good and cheap."}
{"text":"\"Salty\" best describes this place. Coming from someone with an Asian background, salty to me is like eating a brick of salt for most. Probably one of the saltiest meals I have ever had.

Although, I can't argue with the value (lunch specials). While there is a very limited selection, the price you pay is very good for what you get.

All in all, not worth your time if you want something tasty. If you're just looking for something filling and cheap...AND you happen to love water(cuz you'll be needing lots of it afterwards), go for it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE 

- nice location, right beside Wellesley Station. 

- lunch menu is awesome: price range $6 for full meal 

- my favourite is spicy tuna kimchi jji-gae. It is so good I went there 3 times a week. Oh I want it now... I also like the kalbi. 

- I gotta say that i like this place more then other downtown Korean restaurant. 

- pancake was so so 

- I give 5/5 because I want to go again next week :)"}
{"text":"Dropped by during lunch and got their lunch specials. Food was delicious, service was painful - probably cause they were packed and I guess they did the best they could. 

Lunch specials are from $6.99 - totally worth it. We got two Pork Bone Soups - the meat was soft and tender, not enough spice so it wasn't very spicy, but still very good. The one thing that annoyed me was they forgot my rice and bone plate while my friend got both. My other friend got the Bulgogi and said it was good.

There are tons of Korean restaurants in the same area and this has to be one of the best. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Danji is so packed around dinner time that the service will be incredibly slow... mostly because they only have one waitress. (That poor girl.)

It's a Korean restaurant that appears to be a family business, and the number of customers inside usually fluctuate to a crazy high number around dinner time. You get a jug full of water and a bunch of refillable side dishes, and they have my absolute favourite side dish, the SWEET POTATOES! It's very hard to find a Korean restaurant here that serves it, so this is definitely a plus. 

The food is generally quite good but arrives rather slowly. I must say, it's a lot better to order take-out from Danji than dining in, so definitely consider this option!

Tip: DON'T wear nice clothes here, the fried oil scent will stick on to you for at least a day.

Favorites: Bibimbap, Kanpoonggi (fried chicken)
Dislikes: Pork Bone Soup (a bit too oily and salty), Calamari (fried squid)"}
{"text":"The food here is good for the price you pay. The service may be bad depending on when you come during lunch. 

Many people complain about the bad service but in reality, the restaurant is just really understaffed. Since it is family owned, they only have one server (the daughter) running the front. She literally does everything from seating, serving and billing. Of course, this is no excuse for bad service. But to the people who are raging, have a heart. 

The food itself has decent portions for the cheap price. I usually drop by here for a quick and cheap lunch. The pork bone soup is specially good (not too salty, and at least 3-4 pork bones each time). 

Tip: 
- It is less busy after 1PM during lunchtime
- The pork bone soup is good and worth it
- If the server don't serve you water/soy sauce/whatever you need, give her a friendly reminder. From my experience, she will happily and apologetically do it for you"}
{"text":"Always quick and courteous service. Food is tasty and inexpensive. I usually get the sushi, it's pretty good for a quick bite. A much better option for lunch than a lot of the other fast food restaurants in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Hello lunch specials! 

Danji was suggested to me by my brother/sister in law, and I don't know that I would have gone in without a suggestion (don't judge a book by it's cover, I guess!). They have awesome lunch specials under $8, so it's definitely a place to check out for a quick/cheap bite! 

Another favourite there is the green dragon roll - it's so massive and avocado-y that even a big eater like me can have one and call it lunch! It is slightly pricier than a lunch special at about $12 per roll, but don't let the price dissuade you - it's a good value sushi roll! 

My one complaint about Danji actually comes from my brother/sister in law - though I haven't experienced this, they've told me that they went a ton of times and always got the banchan complementary. They went once and the server refused to give it to them - saying it wasn't included. They sat there and ate their dinner while every other person had received the banchan! Very odd, and while it kept us away for a while, we eventually came crawling back. 

So, in summary: GREEN DRAGON ROLL."}
{"text":"I used to come here every so often, and today is a good reason why not to come back. 

The only waitress that works there hardly even served us properly. She didn't take our order until 15 minutes later. We waved her down many times and she said she was coming but never did for the longest time ever. 

Once she was taking our order she stopped us half way and ran off somewhere else to do something.... Like literally wtf? She came back about 5 mins later to continue taking our order.... You don't just walk away from a table to serve other people. After she took our orders fully this time she forgot to even bring our water until another 20 minutes. 

When our sushi rolls came she didn't even bring our soy sauce for wasabi, or a small bowl for it until we asked. 

They're pretty cheap with how much they give you...
The bowl of rice wasn't even full... It was a sloppy half a scoop of rice. 

My kimchi soup hardly had beef... And less soup. 

Sorry but I used to like this place but you just pissed me off so im probably never coming back . 

BAD SERVICE


Sept 12 / 2015: 
Service has improved. Only thing is waitress sometimes doesn't understand English so can be hard to communicate. I ordered spicy salmon rolls, and I usually do every single time so I would know how they do it. The chef added cucumbers in it for the first time, and I couldn't eat it. I tried explaining to waitress that I couldn't eat it, and she kept trying to tell me that's how they make it and I can't cancel it... So if I'm allergic to something, and the chef decided to substitute it for cucumbers instead of its usual avocado I am forced to eat it? No.... Took probably 5 minutes for her to understand. Either way, they shouldn't have subbed for anything else other than what was written on the menu without customers approval. My rating was a 2 star before, but I bumped it up to a 3. It gets pretty crowded during the lunch special hours. I often go after those hours anyways and have no problem with waiting!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are amazing! $8 for bibimbap? Count me in. The bibimbap was pretty good too and they put in a decent amount of beef especially for the price. I also got 3 side dishes to start. The bean sprouts didn't seem fresh, the sweet potatoes were extremely sweet and the kimchi was very salty but hey you get what you pay for. The point is the $8 bibimbap was very good so terrible side dishes aside, I'd recommend this place for a cheap lunch spot. The waitress was confused and disorganized but it seemed like she was doing everything on the front end of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Took a long time for our order to be taken - only one waitress? but it arrived fairly quick. potatoes in the appetizer were tasteful but oily and my jap chae were a bit overcooked. I wish I knew chicken was dark meat or I'd rather eat vegetarian, dislike and never eat dark meat. The portion was of average size, didn't feel full afterwards. My husband says his bibim bap was ok. Don't think we'll return."}
{"text":"Summary: a student dining place, so cheap and big
Food: 3/5
Price: around $8/person for lunch special

I once ate a lunch here. I noticed this place is filled with UofT or Ryerson students, which mean this place is cheap and has big portion. It was very busy during the lunch hour. However, I don't like the food here that much. I ordered classical pork bone soup, which tastes a bit salty. It did not have any bean sprouts.
It is good for its price, but not that tasty."}
