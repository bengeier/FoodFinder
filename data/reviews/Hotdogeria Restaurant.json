{"text":"This restaurant now has new owners and the quality has gone from decent (with the previous owner) to pathetic (with the new owner).  Then entire staff quit within a month of the place changing hands and now, 3/4 of the eating area has been cordoned off leaving only about 5 booths open to eat at.  The entire place is run by the sole owner (both serving and cooking)... he has scared off both staff and customers.  Terrible, terrible, terrible.  It's only a question of time before this long-standing restaurant closes.  Too bad."}
{"text":"D'accord ce n'est pas de la haute gastronomie, mais si on sait choisir, c'est quand même pas mal. Tout les classiques du genres y sont proposés: hotdogs, burgers, poutine et déjeuner de trucker. Mais pour moi, c'est l'acceuil. Je me sens comme Norm dans Cheers, ils me connaissent et je me sens chez nous. It's nice to go where everybody knows your name!"}
{"text":"Two breakfast sandwiches and a grilled cheese, delivered within 20 minutes (granted, it was across the street, but still...) gives four stars!  Next, the namesake dogs..."}
{"text":"For years I drove by this restaurant, would read the name, and dreamt of one day going in. Hotdogeria... The name itself inspires romanticism. 

Well one day I decided to go inside. And do you know what I found? A really mediocre delicatessen. The word Hotdogeria has lost its magic."}
