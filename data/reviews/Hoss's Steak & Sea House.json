{"text":"I had not been to a Hoss's in quite some time and found my last trip just alright. The food was prepared well and the salad bar was rather fresh, I just did not really enjoy the atmosphere. I found the layout of the restaurant confusing and thrown together. Overall, just alright."}
{"text":"Used to go several times per month, noticed on several occasions that me or a family member got sick afterwards.  Can't say for sure that the food was the reason but stopped going there."}
{"text":"This Hoss's is so consistent with quality and friendliness.  The prices are very reasonable and we are satisfied every time.  I was sad to see the Hoss's locations around me close over the past 10 years, but I am so glad that this one is still going strong!  As long as this Hoss's is still standing, I will be coming in!"}
{"text":"Good value clean and frendly.  Good soft ice cream and brownies."}
{"text":"Went there two days ago, other editors the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The waiter brought it out and it looked literally like a can of cat food on a bun and smelled horrific. My family was with me, I told the waiter I wasn't eating that and sent it back. It honestly made me sick to my stomach the look and smell of it.
I sent a complaint to corporate, who in turn said someone would contact me but no one has. I'll never go back even if they would send me free dinners for a year, there is no way you will ever see me at Hoss's again."}
{"text":"AVOID....if you like real steak and not being sick. Order at the door is a solid warning, yet we ventured forth. Mistake. Had steaks priced as if we were at Outback, yet they tasted as if they were previously frozen. Salad bar was ok, as was the soup selection. Here's the kicker..within a hour I was ill..and it lasted for days. Wifes steak, sirloin at that, was full of fat and grizzle. Do yourself a favor, eat the dead raccon at the prior exit."}
{"text":"Was surprised at the changes made to the restaurant when I stopped in yesterday.  One of the changes made is we now order off the menu when seated. This is great for increasing their sales, but the service has diminished, at least with our experience. I noticed a couple of things and I'm not sure how long it's been since the changes:  took a while for server to come to our table. Granted, only reason why we come to hoss' s is for the awesome salad and we are used to coming in and going straight to what we want.  2nd, the server was very abrupt and not friendly or attentive. Very flighty and was never able to get his attention long enough at our table to ask for anything we needed (napkins). I've seen this particular server awhile back outside the store approaching another employee smoking and badmouthing his last table stating he's had the worse table and tippers, etc. Wonder why. And it's bad for business seeing this as you are about to come inside. 3rd, prebussing I noticed really didn't exist too much. Our server did come around once during our meal while passing through and again when collecting the check to clear off the stack of dishes accumulated. Lack of prebussing was not just with our table but sitting and walking thru I noticed larger tables doing the same and several dishes in front of them and they were clearly done. Then i passed the busboys with their carts (in middle of dining room) clearing off so many plates and bowls. I guess when you now hire bussboys, the servers slack off and don't believe in prebussing when before they bussed their own. 4th, surrounding tables sat with empty glasses meanwhile the servers could clearly be seen standing around near their soda station in the wait station. I noticed there's a computer there but they Def weren't on the computer. I've been coming for many years to this location and the salad bar and previous experiences are why I'm giving it a 2 star rating. If we were to have the same service/experience again, we wouldn't come back to this location."}
{"text":"My 3 year old LOVES this restaurant and begs to go there. It could have something to do with the ice cream machine. I went there often growing up but my husband will never understand the appeal so we stick to it mainly for lunch. The servers are pleasant and attentive and most make effort to genuinely engage with my child. They have some tasty dishes like stuffed chicken breast and I like the chicken noodle soup and garlic bread. I wish they had wine ;)"}
{"text":"It's been quite awhile since I have stopped at a Hoss's.  I am not a fan of buffets but I won a gift basket at a charity auction and it included Hoss items and coupons.  So I used my coupons. 

This restaurant had very friendly staff and good food. The buffet was tended and cleaned frequently. It included the usual salad bar items as well as deserts.  

I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Generally a bust.  They take your order as you walk into the restaurant, which is just weird.  One positive... the salad bar was pretty fresh.  But we had two disappointing dinners - a filet and another steak - neither particularly tasty.  My medium rare steak was raw - they did get it right on the second try.  We would never go back there."}
{"text":"Hoss's... Oh Hoss's. We have been eating at Hoss's as a family my entire lifetime! From Penn Hills (now closed) to Irwin, Allison Park (now closed) to Murrysville. Now Murrysville has been the one we visited the most after Penn Hills closed and our favorite servers moved to Murrysville. I LOVE this place. My favorite is the Italian Chicken Breast full portion with a baked potato! The steak and burgers are pretty good here as well. Highly recommend them and the salad bar with 4 different hot soups and hot food as well as the huge selection at the dessert bar is just fantastic! If you go you must ask for Betty and you tell her Matt S from the pop shop sent you!"}
{"text":"This location has changed a little bit since the last time I was here. Now they have menus and you order at your seats, whereas before you would order upon entrance. Our waiter Cory was super nice and attentive. The salad bar was super clean and the food tasted fresh and hot. I was a little disappointed that they were out of scallops on a Sunday afternoon. Nevertheless, for $30, we walked out of there full and pleased."}
{"text":"So, I'm staggered at how many times I drive by this place and see a full or nearly full parking lot.  Maybe because I'm not a native to the area, I just don't understand the appeal of this place.  

While the food is cheap...the food is...well...cheap.  I can't walk away from this place claiming I ate delicious food and I would argue this is the bargain-version restaurant of Golden Corral.  

Plus, the dated decor doesn't add any glitz or glamour - but it doesn't have to, as Hoss's knows what it is and doesn't claim to be a \"fancy-pants\" type place.  

I will say that the service is certainly friendly and attentive - which helps move the needle, albeit slightly.  

This will surely be a last resort spot in the Murrysville area, though I can't see going back to this place in the near future.  

It's cheap, buffet eats that I'm sure I would have loved back in college...just not a fan of it today.  

Sorry Hoss's - it's not you...it's me.  I think we will stay \"broken up\" after my dining experience."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with steak and a salad bar?!

The staff at this Hoss's is also very friendly."}
{"text":"I know Hoss's isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's a good fit for me.  You definitely can't go wrong with the soup and salad bar.  There is plenty on there to make sure you don't leave hungry.

This place looks fairly new, not that old setup some Hoss's have.  Prices are decent as well.  Really can't much more for this place that hasn't already been said."}
{"text":"If Texas Road House and Eat n' Park had a love child in the 1970's, it would look like Hoss's. This place has the 70's decor and that 70's orangish tint to it. 

They have two banquet rooms in it too. One is called the Franklin Room and the other is called the William Penn Room. Hoss's is so old that I fully expected to see those individuals in there as I peeked in. 

The food is pretty good and relatively cheap too. Me, my wife and two kids got out for $34.00. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Since the change in the menu I'm really unhappy and will most likely remove Hoss's from my \"go to\" list. Prices increased and food quality decreased. No thanks."}
{"text":"As a family we have never had a bad experience here. Everyone loves it! The food has always been fresh, hot and served to our liking. 
I do like the new look and feel of the restaurant. The have gone from line service to table service. A much better experience and the little ones get seated a lot faster. 
I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I mean, it's Hoss's. It's definitely a step above Ponderosa (side note: does Ponderosa even exist anymore?), but probably a half-step below Red Lobster. The website helpfully points out that there are no extra charges for things like \"sour cream, butter, [and] gravy\"... although I feel like a restaurant probably shouldn't need to make that clear to begin with."}
{"text":"Great soup and salad bar. Steak tips have always been cooked perfectly to my tastes. Great place for kids. Go there with my brother and 4 kids every time I'm visiting from Florida. Great desserts too!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a Christmas party last minute because the last place told us they really didnot want us.
The buffet is similar the the institutional  cafeterias at federal government . A bunch of cheap crap to fill you up.A lot of canned puddings, fruits,garbanzo beans, baked beans and of course the frozen ice cream machine.
I ordered the Kansas City Steak $17.95 and my spouse had Fried Shrimp. My steal had a bone on one side and a fat/ grisile on the other making the actual eatable part hard to get to.It was from an animal I' m sure who apparently froze to death and then had a ride on a band saw.My wife's frozen fried shrimp was just ok. We were with the family about a party of 14.My sister ordered the stuffed steak and what the hell?It was the thinnest meat stuffed with bread stuffing.  Pretty poor!
I remember the food being better 10 years ago, but now I' m supprised they do any business at all serving crap like that."}
{"text":"Hoss's is sort of the \"Walmart of steakhouses\", but I like them. If you can get over the drabby decor, you can really like this place. I like to pig out at their salad/soup/dessert bar. Their steaks are tasty even when compared to steaks at expensive restaurants, and their waitresses are always friendly."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Hoss's last Saturday at around 7:30pm and the place was an absolute zoo. With that being said, the salad bar was well-stocked and generally clean. One of the plates in the stack had cheese sauce still on it. Corey was our waiter, and he wasn't very friendly, but as aforementioned,  the restaurant was absolutely packed. I only had the salad bar; but my friend had the scallops and fries and was happy."}
{"text":"Going to Hoss's as a child used to be a treat I looked forward to going. But recently the brand has really gone downhill. I'm not talking about the lack of after dinner mints and smaller portions, which is also a truth of modern-day Hoss's. 

So let's dissect my experience tonight. 

Salad Bar: Nothing looked fresh despite the large crowd and it was all pretty basic. Hoss's seems stuck in the 80s where a salad bar is defined by iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots and some basic dressings mixed in house. Don't expect any arugula, sprouts or anything \"gourmet.\" They did have some spinach, but freshness was not an adjective to describe. Aside from the mediocre salad selection they offered some garlic bread and two low quality soups. I believe a watery \"French onion\" comprised of all broth and a \"minestrone\" were the soup de jour. in all fairness the salad bar is included with the steak so expectations were low. 

Steak: They were out of have the steaks on the menu but I was able to order a filet mignon. For $19.99 (7oz) it want horribly priced. However, I ordered my steak medium-well with a side of steak fries. What I received was a medium-rare at best cut of mediocre beef and soggy, oily fries. There is some subjectivity to medium-well but actual blood dripping out just isn't right. The 17 year old waiter seemed confused by my frustration but was polite in trying to fix the situation. I spoke to the manager to tell him I just didn't want it anymore and would gladly pay for the three pieces of salad I ate. He gave a canned apology and offered to replace it with any steak on the menu. I don't want to be associated with people who complain for a free meal so I declined and was on my way. 

Dessert Bar: I did not eat any dessert but it looked like vanilla ice cream from a soft serve machine, some stale cookies and jello. Yes, jello. 

Atmosphere: Mostly old people (60+) or families. However, the majority of the clientele wore cut off t-shirts and shorts. There was also more than a few families who looked like they averaged 250lbs a piece. Not to be rude for obese people but the whole scene screams lower middle class. 

Conclusion: I wouldn't eat there again if it were free. The food prices are well-above the low quality. 

However customer service was decent hence why I am giving it three stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Holy cow.  I haven't been to Hoss's in years.  I forgot how great this place is.  I felt like I was stealing from the restaurant for what I was paying for such a delicious and satisfying meal.  Honestly I did not even need the surprisingly delicious broiled shrimp.  That salad bar is to die for.

At that salad bar, there is an amazing variation of low calorie and healthy choices.  More than 3 different kids of healthy dressing options.  Not to mention, the French Onion soup was perfect for health conscious people because you add your own bread and cheese into it if you want.

Don't even get me started on the desserts.  They have an entire delicious section that is designated to sugar free and low fat!!  It was all so delicious.   Did I mention they have Diet Pepsi, Diet Mt Dew, and Diet Dr. Pepper as options!?  I loved it

I cannot wait to come back to Hoss's and be filled up by a rather healthy meal."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat back in the late 80s and early 90s. They had fresh steak and seafood and an excellent salad bar. Now the salad bar is still excellent, but the steaks and seafood (and I think every other entree) is frozen and sloppily prepared. I still eat here, but I'm really disappointed in the change."}
{"text":"Good place to stop after an indoor soccer match nearby...as the boy likes it, and I'm okay with it. Reasonably priced for the fare, and the service is okay. Nothing fancy, nothing extraordinary...it's Hoss's. This one is clean, the waitstaff is efficient enough, and the food is decent. The salad bar is maintained okay, snd nothing is out if order. All's well."}
