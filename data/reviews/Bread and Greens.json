{"text":"I absolutely adore this family owned and run restaurant. They provide fresh and healthy food options which are prepared and served with such love and care! Riverdale is fortunate to have such a convenient, friendly and healthy eatery!"}
{"text":"Bread and Greens is a new place, and they are trying to work out all the kinks.  Their menu is ever-changing, and they are adding more and more to it.  They use beautiful breads from Ace bakery (my favourite is the rosemary).  The salads are great, and they have some really tasty dressings (tahini lemon!!).    The only reason I haven't given them 5 stars is that because they are new and independant, they are overpriced.  I don't feel I get enough food for my money, except for the daily lunch special - usually around 7.50 for something like a large slice of lasagne, tossed salad and pop or water."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Simply great! House made soups. House sandwiches. Build your own salad. Nothing fancy. Just simple good breakfast and lunch for very good prices. Did I mention healthy? The baked goods are great! This place is a hidden gen of understated genius. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has the best fresh food, and is run by a lovely family. They have daily soups, all of their food is made to order and their coffee is the best around. Sandwiched beside a McDonalds, and Starbucks, they do well due to their great service and wonderful food. They have some great combination sandwiches and salads too."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and had their lbt, its their chicken panini with lettuce, peppers and brie. I also added a soup on their side for 3$ for their chicken noodle soup. The sandwich itself is decent but the chicken is way too salty. Chicken noodle soup had no chicken unfortunately..."}
{"text":"Came here once quite a few years ago and had the salad. I remember enjoying it so we decided to come have lunch since we were in the area. The employees are very welcoming and polite. It can be a bit more pricey but I honestly don't mind since they have a healthier and fresher menu. You can build your own salad or choose from their pre-made ones. They have quite a few sandwiches to choose from and they all sounded delicious!  Their B.L.T.C. on Multigrain toast was really enjoyable. They make everything upon order. I will definitely come back for that.  The Brie and Avocado Panini wasn't as flavourful but it was nice and creamy. Still delicious between the whole wheat Panini bread. I would love to try to Brie and Apple one next. It was hard to choose between the two!  I'm in the area every now and then so I would definitely come back and try out more of their menu. It's a good spot for a quick healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I love this little place. I ate here almost every day the week I was working on Danforth St. The owners are really friendly, the service is speedy, and the sandwiches are really fantastic. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I decided to walk into this place one day after I got my nails done. I always thought this place was a little sketchy, but it's really not. I have to say though, it is pretty pricey for what you get, but the quality is amazing. It's also a plus that this is a family-owned business because the increased level of customer service really shows.   You can really tell that they put a lot of love into their food. They care about what they're serving you and how they serve it up. The bread is really fresh and it's pretty soft. The ingredients that go into the sandwiches are also really fresh. I remember getting turkey, brie, and some mixed greens. Everything was pretty fresh and it all tasted pretty good. They also make most, if not all, of their spreads (if I recall correctly). I tried some of the tomato jalepeno type spread and it was amazing. So much kick for so little spread, but it wasn't too overpowering.   It's definitely worth a try. I wasn't feeling any of their pre-decided sandwiches on the menu, so I decided to make my own. This place is healthy, fresh, and great tasting."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to work near the Distillery District and either on my way to work or back home, I would pop in for a sandwich. The woman who owns the shop is such a sweetheart. The place has been open for less than a decade and they get their regular customers from the neighbourhood, but she picks up on new faces pretty fast and is very curious (and happy) when she gets new customers (how they found this place when they aren't from the neighbourhood, etc). Sometimes family members are there helping out with service.  It's unfortunate that a new Starbucks opened right next door. I've never had coffee here, but the tea is okay. However, if you're in the area and want a sandwich, the prices are comparable to that of Starbucks sandwiches (they also have daily specials so could be less) and they taste way better. Always tastes fresh and it's all made in front of you!  They also serve soups and salads. I think it's a lovely local shop, and in a time when everything is becoming franchised, local shops like this deliver charming human interaction."}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit for breakfast now on Saturday mornings. Now that Timmys has opened across the street they may need to stay competitive. $4.39 seems a bit pricey for a breakfast wrap, however it's made fresh and there is a place to sit.   They have a lot of gluten free baked goods as well as their custom grilled sandwiches.   If given a choice, Support the local businesses!   Unfortunately do close early. At 6pm and 3pm on weekends"}
{"text":"Love this spot. The Protein Salad is so good. Grilled chicken & goat cheese, slivered almonds, strawberries, cucumber and spinach. Loved it, price is great too. They play baroque-style classical music. It's comforting. :-)"}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick, simple and healthy lunch. (Think sandwiches, salads, soups.) Great place to get a quick regular coffee or tea. This is a family business and the folks working here are so sweet. Bathrooms are clean and spacious."}
{"text":"I believe this is a new addition to the Danforth family. Bread and Greens is a little sandwich shop near the beginning of the East end of the strip.   I tried a sandwich from there once during the Taste of Danforth festival, it was some cheese and avocado type sandwich.  The description sounded good and I thought it would be heated up a little, but it wasn't. Overall, the sandwich was ok, it tasted pretty good, but it's not a place that I would go back next time. There's so many worthy places to eat on the Danforth and I'm not sure this is worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Its an ok place. Nothing wrong with it, nothing exciting about it either. I had a apple and cheese sandwich. Sounded great..tasted average. I would of liked my apples sauted, or cut thinner. Instead it was big chunks. The sandwich was pressed which gave it a nice crispness and melty cheese. But darn those flavourless chunks of hard apple in-between.  I know you are thinking 'sauteed apple, thats high expectations for a place like this' but at Sky Blue Sky (see previous review) thats exactly what they did. And for $1 less than this place.  Overall this is a nice place, the menu looks great, but I think they could work on putting a little more 'love' in their food."}
{"text":"Had been meaning to try this place forever. Well, I did and I was not very impressed.  As I'm doing Atkins, I ordered the \"Protein Salad.\" The \"large\" protein salad. First off, it was not what I would consider large for a salad. Second, is the description of it in the window that promises hard boiled egg and chicken.  While they deliver on the egg, the chicken however is a few scrawny shreds. Hardly enough protein for anyone and also to justify the price. For ten bucks, one could buy two sizable chicken breasts and some salad greens and make their own but yes, we do get lazy sometimes and just want someone else to make our lunch for a change. Then afterwards, as I found here, I wish I had made it.  Staff was very attentive and friendly. It's nice not be ignored like that disaster at \"Mocha Mocha,\" so they get two stars for that."}
{"text":"Maybe 20 grams of chicken on the sandwich (possibly less), 1/2 a slice of cheese and a few leaves of spinach...oh yeah, on bread....yours for $9.00! Quality ingredients only matter when there are enough of them on your sandwich to taste!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent (I had a chicken panini and chili) and the price wasn't too bad.   I had a really awkward experience with the staff when I went in, though, and I'm not sure if I'd go back. The people making the food were several cute little elderly women, one of whom took my payment at the cash. I ran my credit card and she said it didn't go through, so she wanted it run it again. She said it didn't go through the second time either, so she called over a younger man to help. He ran a report and found that my card had actually been charged both times, and he was very upset because she's been warned not to take payment when she doesn't understand how to use the machine. I got a definite vibe that she was an older relative of his that he has to employ out of pity (or obligation, or whatever) but she drives him insane because she doesn't listen. He refunded the over-payment and it really wasn't that big of an issue, but I was in there for quite a bit longer than planned and left feeling awkward after witnessing a tense family dispute that was none of my business and not my problem."}
{"text":"I needed to grab a quick bite for dinner somewhere and I wanted it to be at least somewhat healthy. I noticed this place on the corner and thought perfect! But I was disappointed. The dressing tasted store-bought and it was something that I could easily make at home in the exact same way. The worst part was it contained 95% spinach with a tiny amount of chickpeas, apples, raisins and chicken. I was hungrier after I ate it than before. Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"Great healthy alternative to the standard lunch fare.  Today I had a Tuna Melt, a side salad of spinach, wheat berries, chic peas, corn, croutons & some kind of ginger peach dressing thingy  for under $C10.50  Recyclable take-out containers & cutlery to boot... :)"}
{"text":"So I've been living on the Danforth for over a year now and some how only discovered this place a few weeks ago.  I feel I have wasted many lunches on pizza and PB&J sandwiches when I could have been having custom salads and delicious sandwiches.  Have you ever had a BLTA?  Its a bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado sandwich.  And I'm a little obsessed with it, which is no surprise since it has my two favourite things; bacon and avocado.  It tastes amazing!  I really like this place and will continue to go here when i need a healthy salad or a satisfying sandwich.  I also love that they use a lot of organic ingredients and fair trade coffee.  Yes the price can grow as you add on, but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"VIBE  I needed a quick yet affordable breakfast. It's a nice place but basic. The brown leather chairs are comfortable and they have a TV. Bonus: the 10th season of Ellen was on. Has it been that long?!  Staff were very friendly and pretty quick.  I ATE A ham and cheese croissant. The croissant was in a plastic box that was clearly brought from the grocery store. On top of it, there was some funky garlic mayo that well, left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be ordering this again but I won't hesitate to come back here because I've had their sandwiches before and they're pretty good.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  If you're getting something basic for breakfast or a sandwich for lunch, I say go here. I haven't had their salads but it's something to try out. A great place if you want something healthy and an alternative to McDonald's (not exactly the place you want to visit after a Doctor's appointment and a disappointing BMI record)."}
{"text":"Simple, cute, not that expensive. Had a panini, quite simple at first, but the ingredients are good ones so it makes it worth it. Also the owners are nice and friendly. The coffee isn't great though, maybe a tea would have been a better idea, the prices were good. All in all, perfect for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I have stopped by for lunch or an after-work snack a few times. They have a great selection of set and create-your-own sandwiches and salads for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. I get the avocado and brie usually. It's so good that I have started craving it on a regular basis now! They have a good selection of homemade cookies for 65 cents. I don't think it's pricey, but then I like to support the neighborhood stores rather than chains"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and freshly made. With a lot of healthy options. Also they have bacon. And organic fair trade coffee. You will love it. Forget the neighbours Starbucks and McDonalds. Come here for something much better."}
