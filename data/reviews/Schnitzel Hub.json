{"text":"Friendly service.  They certainly have schnitzel served a variety of ways but mine was a bit overcooked.  The servings were large."}
{"text":"Another family event and another success! We had set menu in the private room. We shared appetizers and everyone had a main of the menu. The food was great as always, very good service and creative drink menu, very cozy and comfortable atmosphere especially in that cute private room. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend, who works in the plaza and has his lunch there almost every day, so one day I decided to go there and try something new. We went there with my husband on Friday night. The place was bright and very clean, and the server said they opened not so long ago. Service was fast and friendly, we also had a nice conversation with the owner who cooks all the food.  My husband tried the goulash soup and perogies and I had a schnitzel with mushrooms and bacon in red wine sauce (Jeger or Jaeger, not sure). It was totally amazing! The meat was really tender and there were hundreds of mushrooms on it; also they have sweet potato fries which I loooove. Definetely coming back or ordering from there!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try the Schnitzel Hub today after we noticed it recently while visiting another restaurant in the complex. It was a quaint 24 seat (including 4 at the bar) restaurant that was almost full when we showed up at 6:00 on a Saturday night.   The eastern European menu features a good home style, stick to your ribs fare like Goulash, Perogies, Sausages, Cabbage Rolls and a variety of Schnitzel. After mulling over the menu we decided to split the Peppered Beef Carpaccio and the Holstein Schnitzel. The Holstein included a sunny side up fried egg with a couple of Sprats (a  small little herring style fish but not salty like an anchovy). It was served with an nice buttery spaezle and a veg of  roasted carrots and rings of a round white veg that may have been turnip, but my wife said it wasnt in order to get me to eat them. I ate them, they were good.  Their small bar had a variety of homemade infused vodkas that ranged from the fruity to the spicy to the healthy made with flowers, roots and spices. She told us that they do their artisnal infusing at their other site in midtown Toronto and have about 40 different choices to choose from. We decided on a flight of 3 including a cucumber dill infusion, an organic dulce infusion and one with lingonberry flowers and such. The flower one was quite nice, i liked the organic dulce (and had to explain to the waitress that it was a seaweed) but the cucumber dill was something else. After we tried it we realized the bottle was obviously mislabelled, what was sold to us as cucumber dill was actually an infusion of garlic, onion and chili. It was really very good with a nice kick but the waitress didnt believe us that the bottle seemed to have been mislabelled.   The lone waitress was a young lady who, while the restaurant seem to fill 22 of the 24 seats in a short time span, was very friendly and courteous never losing her cool with the sudden rush. She is a good ambassador for the Schnitzel Hub.  We will definitely return with friends and family in the near future."}
{"text":"I love all the food that I've ordered here. That includes Wiener schnitzel, the schnitzel with the eggplant (forget the name), potato salad, cucumber salad, cheese and onion pierogis, spätzle and the best thing on the menu is sauerkraut. I have always hated sauerkraut, my boyfriend ordered it and I tried it and now every time we go I order it. The food is so simple and so delicious. They use a lot of dill in their dishes including in the butter that comes with the bread before your meal. It's not as cheap as I expected a simple food like schnitzel to be and I'm still ok with it as its delicious."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant tonight. Was quite disappointed.  Had heard great things from a friend and decided to bring my whole family. We made a 9 person reso for 6:45pm. When I showed up close to 6:50, they hadn't even started arranging a table. Regardless, they set up a table quickly, so that was fine.  Then I overheard them tell another table they were out of chicken schnitzel..... I couldn't believe this... How do you run a schnitzel restaurant and run out of chicken schnitzel?? Anyways, I asked the manager directly (the woman who seemed to be the manager) if this was true.  One of our party only eats chicken (no veal, etc)- and the fact that they were out of chicken meant we couldn't stay. I was assured that while they were out of chicken, they were bringing some from their other location.  So we stayed- ordered drinks and beer and enjoyed.  Then when we went to order, to my surprise, they announced they were out of chicken.  I called over the manager again and she insisted that the delivery man from the other location had arrived without chicken as both locations were now out of chicken...!  After basically asking for the bill so we could find another place to eat our dinner, she had an idea - take the chicken from their sandwiches (so they were lying when they said they were out of chicken) as use it for the schnitzel plate.... She also offered not to charge for this meal.  We were satisfied with this suggestion - tho can't understand why she didn't just suggest it in the first place.  We all ordered schnitzel and I ordered their home made perogies.  The schnitzel was delicious (I tried it and everyone finished their portions).  But when my perogies arrived I noticed there was no sour cream.  I found this weird and asked for some.  They then notified me that they were out of this too. Quite disappointing. All in all, the food was very good and everyone enjoyed. But I can't understand how you run a schnitzel restaurant with no chicken schnitzel or sour cream...."}
{"text":"Finally my hunt for some gooey \"Cordon Bleu\" is over. This place also has great pirogies and a nice selection of German beer."}
{"text":"Probably the worst tasting Ceasars I've ever had. They are more like a bloody Mary and just taste OFF"}
{"text":"4 of my coworkers and I came from the Winterlicious 2017 menu. I loved the décor and atmosphere of this place, it had this cool rustic and classy vibe all put into one. It was great!  Food  First I have to mention that tables get complimentary bread and garlic butter. I know it's not the biggest deal in the world, but, I honestly really enjoyed it. The bread was nice and warm and the garlic butter was whipped and tasted amazing.  Okay, so I go the following items from the Winterlicious 2017 menu: * Potato Cheddar Perogies * Jaeger Schnitzel * Homemade Vanilla Cheesecake  The cheddar Pergoies were awesome! The portion size was just right and caramelized onions were a nice added touch, very flavorful and filling.  The Jaeger Schnitzel was amazing and it was huge. The sauce was outstanding and the veal, in my opinion, was cooked to perfection. It was totally worth the price as far as I was concerned, no skimping going on over folks.  The homemade cheesecake and sorbet was unreal. The cheesecake was so most and full of fluff. Whatever nuts or toppings they had underneath the sorbet was a great touch. Honestly, this was amazing as well/  Drinks Great selection of drinks, the infused Vodka sounded interesting but I didn't have it. Instead, I opted to have the Radeberger Pilsner which I enjoyed and the glass it came in was cool as well.  Service  Hands down one of the best servers I've had, I think his name was Alex if I am not mistaken. Not only did he give amazing suggestions, but, he was witty, charming, and really funny as well too. He took the time to explain everything to use, engaged in friendly conversation, and overall provided a very complimentary positive experience. He was outstanding.  Overall  Based on everything above, I would be more than happy to return and I plan on doing so myself."}
{"text":"I've never had a schnitzel prior to coming here but after eating here I'm definitely a schnitzel fan.   Jager Schnitzel (veal) - huge portion, served with a mushroom red wine gravy which was so delicious I wish I had more. The spaetzle went really well with the jager schnitzel.  Meat peorgies with caramelized onions - I was drooling over the onions. The peorgies tasted very fresh, I loved the texture. A must try item.  Dessert was lacking. I had an item I do not know the name of but it looked like 2 crepe rolls filled with cream cheese. It was a heavy dessert dessert and my mouth felt very dry after eating it. I definitely will pass on this item but everything else was awesome.  Service was superb. Our server had a geniune friendly attitude and she was very knowledgeable. She made many good suggestions.   Overall I'll definitely be back to try all the other items.  Bring lots of friends so you can order and try all the schnitzel portions are huge. Atmosphere was really nice as well. I felt like I was in a classy but not pretentious bistro. It looks very cozy and clean.   service 5/5 food 4.5/5 atmosphere 5/5 uniqueness 5/5"}
{"text":"So today I have decided to re-visit a place called schnitzel Land - I have found out that it was closed for couple of weeks and reopened under the same management /owners with the name schnitzel hub - so be it.  I ordered goulash soup which was decent taste was good, should have been left a bit longer on low heat so the meat will be even better but still good all together. I would have loved to see a bit larger portion of soup in such a large plate but that is me - I'm a big guy - btw, love the portion on the Schnitzel.   I also ordered Schnitzel- the chicken version (Americanized as the origin is veal) with salsa/Spanish heat and let me tell you - IT WAS HOT SPICY !, I enjoy hot and spicy food but this one was so hot that I couldn't taste the Schnitzel itself ... So I removed some of it and found out that the schnitzel was actually good. The main course came with mash potatoes which I thought needed to be finer - either you mash the potato so you do not taste pieces or just call it mash potatoes \"style\"  It would have been nice to have a vegetable on the plate as well ...like steamed .....? The server was very efficient, nice and came to verify that the food is to my taste.  Place is after renovation and is clean with nice ambiance /look   All together ok, good and will probably be back when the craving for home schnitzel is back."}
{"text":"Omg the food here is amazing!!! The service could be better but it wasn't awful. We ordered a bunch of apps for the table including the fried cheese fritters, the duck, and the calamari. All of these were really good, but I probably wouldn't order the cheese fritters again, it wasn't really worth the price. Their speciality is house made flavoured vodkas that you can order in flights.You have to try a flight if you're here, it's fully worth the price. I also ordered one of their Cosmo cocktails made with lingonberry vodka.  For a main I had the schnitzel with fried egg and sardines. It came with roasted roots and spatzel. I would definitely order this again. The sunny side egg on the schnitzel is the best thing ever. I had a sour cherry crumble for dessert as well which was really tasty. I can't wait to go back and try some other things."}
{"text":"Ordered through JustEat and something is wrong with the ticketing system and they didn't send out mashed potatoes.  I'll be honest though - the food is amazing. I love spaezle and Wiener schnitzel more than anything and this place is super authentic. Really tasty vegetables. A little over priced but really really good.  Sauerkraut is awesome and tasty. Sausages - wish there were more.   I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the price and the missing mashed potatoes/lack of customer care in the error."}
{"text":"Nice spot with a relaxed decor. Perogies are homemade and delicious. The schnitzel was nice and thin and tender. Friendly service. I could have done without the country playlist. Small private room in the back."}
{"text":"Best veal and chicken schnitzel in Toronto!! Coming back time and time again and leave so satisfied each time. The sides are absolutely wonderful and personal faves are the home fries and the red coleslaw (with caraway seeds!). The servings are plentiful too! I wish they could open a location downtown..especially in the financial district."}
{"text":"Really good schnitzel! Have eaten there several times now and today ordered delivery for the first time. The food was hot, fresh and very tasty! Highly recommend to try it!"}
{"text":"It's a hit-and-miss kind of place. I live in the area and have both had take-out and have been there for both lunch and dinner. Take-out was awful: the veal sandwich was so greasy, i had to throw half of it away. On my last dinner there a few weeks ago, I had the beet salad which was delicious. My friend had the sausages and loved it. I've tried a few of their schnitzels in the past year and as an Eastern European myself, they weren't that great -- I think only once was I satisfied but made sure I didn't order any goopy sauces (plain has been the best for me so far). It's a bit pricey for what you get, but overall I'll likely go again -- just not take-out."}
{"text":"If vodka, Biergarten or Eastern European food means anything to you then Schnitzel Hub is the place you want to be. The diversity of cuisines has expanded in the St. Clair and Yonge area with Schnitzel Hub's second location.   Unlike the Schnitzel Hub's first location in Vaughan, this new spot offers a full bar, many more seatings for groups as well as a private dining area.   For vodka lovers, you'll be surprised to see some artisan house-infused vodkas at Schnitzel Hub with crazy flavours like lemon & ginger, candy, smoked bacon and even honey & chili pepper! I suggest you sip these infused vodkas to really taste the flavours.  Personally, I enjoyed the lemon & ginger but many others were raving about the horseradish!  Now, onto the food offerings. This restaurant prides itself on creating homemade, authentic meals from Eastern an Central Europe with a focus on schnitzels.  I must say the portions here are very generous so it's a great spot to go for dinner.  Our meal was great from start to finish, of course my favourite part of the meal was the schnitzel! I'm not sure about the sour cherry pierogies because I'm not a huge fan of cherries and I felt that it made the pierogies extra soggy but my friend that dined with me absolutely loved it.  With a warm and inviting atmosphere and great food and unique drinks, this second location of Schnitzel Pub will quickly become a neighbourhood gem in the St.Clair Ave area!"}
{"text":"A small and lovely German restaurant. We discovered this place based on the excellent reviews on Yelp, and it didn't disappointed us.   We were there for a late dinner, restaurant was nice and quiet. Server told us they were very busy earlier that they sold out of Goulash soup! This was one of the items that we really wanted to try and had high hope for, I guess we'll have to re-visit this place soon to try it out.   We ordered the potato & herring salad, meat pierogi, and the Canadian chicken schnitzel. The portions for all three items were very generous. I really like the meat pierogi, the meat was very juicy, it's probably one of the best pierogi that I've had in town. I was also impressed with the schnitzel, would definitely come back and try other food on the menu!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery, chicken schnitzel with mushrooms and red wine sauce and perogies. It arrived quickly. The schnitzel was delicious and worth it."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch - my husband and I shared a veal Canadian schnitzel and a cheese and potato perogy, which was just the perfect portion.   The size of the schnitzel would have been too large to finish on my own.    I found the schnitzel crispy and light tasting.  Not too salty, not too greasy.   The home made garlic butter that comes with the complimentary bread was a nice touch.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp GTA International Supper Club had there first underground meeting so I joined in on the venture into German cuisine territory!   The over all experience for me was between 2.5 Stars to 3 Stars, so I averaged it out to 3 Stars!   The menu is quite nice but there is not much for people with restriction on meat in any form (such as Vegetarian, Halal and Kosher). I could not find anything on the main course either vegetarian or seafood related, so my decision of not checking the menu in advance had caused a problem here and I was Hangry! so I asked the waitress and she stated that I can get an eggplant in any of the options on the Schnitzel. The price was the same as a regular meat schnitzel but instead of meat the was an eggplant deep fried. So I went with that option as there was non other to satisfy my hunger.   The service was extremely slow as there was one waitress and a cook. The waitress was friendly and tried her best to cope up with a large crowed as us (which wasn't that large). The other thing which was not appealing, the food came in stages and some people were done eating when the last person got their food.  The restaurant is very clean and small. The place can fit about 25 people to the max and has parking.   Whereas, the food is concerned; I ordered a Parma Schnitzel (subsituted meat with eggplant). The Parma schnitzel has zesty tomato sauce and cheese on it. On the side I went with Spaezle. You might ask what a Schnitzel and Spaezle is? well A schnitzel is a boneless meat thinned and deep fried and Spaezle is a German version of dried Mac and cheese. The food was fresh and hot, the portion sizes were quite good. The price point is moderate but can be justified with huge portions of food provided by the restaurant."}
{"text":"I bought perogies to take out from Schnitzel Hub. Instead of giving me the potato and onion ones I ordered and paid for, they gave me cheddar. They admitted to the mix up but that's about it. I bought 3 orders of it that they messed up. They haven't replaced them. They have ignored my complaints and my complaint to the BBB. They don't care about their customers. STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are ok.   \"Goulash soup\" is left over vegetables and broth. Totally not authentic.    Beet salad has 4 pieces of beets and is all lettuce.  Beet salad is again totally not authentic.   Pork schnitzel is tasteless.  Only Torontonians that have never been to Germany or Europe would like this food!"}
{"text":"Holy Schnitzel Batman!! Last night a group of us assembled for a taste of something new, central european cuisine at the recently rebranded, redesigned, renamed and reopened Schnitzel Hub (formally Schnitelland).  It's a small restaurant with seating for about 25, but it feels warm and homey - truly a place you feel welcomed. I made reservations for our group and they were great at confirming and reminding me of the reso and double checking numbers in advance.  Upon arrival, I went to check in and discovered that when you check-in on the Yelp app they provide $1 off of a pint of Hacker Pschorr beers - sweet!  A fun fact about this place is that they infuse all their own vodkas with a variety of flavours. This was to be one of our \"must-try's\" but by the time we finished our meal and beers there wasn't much room for even the smell of delicious flavoured vodkas.  Now on to the food! To begin I had an order of their perogies (the potato and cheddar filled ones), boiled and lightly fried and topped with fried onions - they were magical, but a portion for $10 was a good started to share given that there were about 10-15 in the serving.  Following that, I simply couldn't visit a spot with a namesake such as this without having the wiener Schnitzel, and being a purist, I wanted to be sure I had the OG-Schnitz (also the best name for a Bavarian Rap superstar) aka the regular/plain weiner (veal) schnitzel.  As my friends before me have mentioned, the schnitz here is HUGE... the portion sizes are full plate and easily more than one person (or Wayne C) can handle on their own. I'm pretty sure I ordered spätzle as my side but you wouldn't know it because the massive portion of spätzle and cooked veg was covered by an even more massive portion of schnitzl. I got through about half before tapping out.  The ONLY minor item I think they need to work on is adding more staff, our one server was really great and did her best to serve our table and the others in the restaurant, but with only one cook and one server, food arrived in waves with long gaps, she was apologetic and really did her best (I think we all tipped her well as a thanks for her hard work). Management just needs to provide some more support which will in turn help with turning over tables faster.  Great Schnitzel and a great night!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"The food was was good as what I had in Germany! And excellent service too. The chocolate martini was like a dessert, creamy and with a Nutella like chocolate spread all over the glass. We had potato cheddar pierogies to start (definitely recommend!) and I had the pork Wiener schnitzel with spätzle. The schnitzel was perfectly juicy with a delicious breadcrumb crust, and this is the first time I finally found German standard spätzle in Toronto! :) we went on a Sunday night and it was very quiet."}
{"text":"The food was good, portions were large.  The place was clean.  I really wanted to more positive things about this place, but the service was so bad that we won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend it.  We ordered a sausage platter appetizer and asked which sausage was which, they all had a different look, if we liked one, we would know what to order more of next time.  The woman delivering the food had no idea,  the staff seemed to have very little knowledge of the menu.  Our waitress was serving tables all over the restaurant, and a very large table at the other end of the dinning room, I asked for a refill on my pop several times and my wife never was asked about a second beer.  There was another waitress that was serving a table next to us, I asked her for a refill and she snapped \"I am not your waitress\".  We asked the hostess the same question, she did the same. Neither passed on the information to our waitress.  It wasn't a very positive first experience here.  Our server was fine when we saw her, but she needed to have a section and not tables all over.   I give it a three for the food and being clean, but service has to improve, it's too late for us, but with some improvements this could be a 5 star"}
{"text":"I stopped in by chance on a Saturday afternoon and got a takeaway order:  basic schnitzel with spaetzle, potato cheddar pierogies, and a beet arugula salad.  The ambiance of the place is glossy but comfortable, and the owner is warm and friendly.  About the food now.  The veal schnitzel itself was great and of an average size for a schnitzel.  The plain spaetzle that accompanied it appeared to be leftover, i.e.. warmed up in a pan.  It was very so-so, somewhat flavourless, and the portion was rather small.   The plate should have come with some sort of vegetable side, hot or cold, as well.  (Perhaps I have been spoiled by the tremendous offerings we had in Toronto when Hungarian town at Bathurst and Bloor was thriving.)  It was a small portion of pierogies as well.  I wasn't impressed with the quality of the pierogies either.  Thankfully, they came with a bit of onion on top.  They were ok, but I likely wouldn't order them again, not here.  The arugula beet salad was very tasty, but the serving was small again.  Certainly not a meal in itself.  All in all, the food quality and portion size do not equal consistent value for money.  My bill was $40, including tax.  I think I could have done better for that amount."}
{"text":"Not bad, not outstanding.  I'd probably go back again one day but not anytime soon.  They do a good job with the schnitzel.  The portions are a good size and the beer selection is decent.  It's a tad pricey for what it is (lunch was like $27 all in?) so I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 but this is in midtown Toronto so everything is overpriced for what it is.  Nice décor and service and I like the faint euro dance music in the background.  It helps you forget where you are."}
{"text":"The veal is excellent. The portions are considerable, no need to order starters. Although  I am told that the goulash is worth a try. The service is hospitable, the ambiance was relaxed.   I felt great finding this place and if I lived this far north I might make it a permanent dinning out spot."}
{"text":"Was so pleasantly surprised.  A very untraditional take on the schnitzelhaus but absolutely loved it.  Alex our waiter.  100% professional.  First class service.  I had the beef stroganoff which was a delight.  The schnitzel selection is extensive and you can chose from veal pork chicken or eggplant done in a variety of styles.  My companion had chicken schnitzel done \"canadian\" topped with wild mushrooms and cheese and the taste was out of this world.  I had the vanilla bean cheesecake for dessert which was smooth creamy and satisfyingly portioned.  As I am not a drinker I did not sample the selection of flavour infused organic vodkas but those so inclined I am sure they would be fun to try.  Definitely recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"I went there a week ago with my wife and my brother and his wife.The vodka and the Beer was good and reasonably priced. Now the food.My wife had the cabbage rolls and found them not bad.My brother and his wife shared a player of sausages and were pleased. I ordered the Holstein shnizle and found it dry and tasteless (obviously frozen) and the sparkle was bland and burned. The advertised smoked part was in fact a sardine straight from the can.I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Nice local restaurant with German/European fare. Ordered chicken schnitzel and was pleased with the portion size. Staff person was very attentive and checked in with us often. It's a small place and might consider a take out order next time. Overall, enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Huge portions, food was fresh and yummy but nothing outstanding. Would go again tho, curious about all the homemade flavoured vodka!"}
{"text":"These things are pretty big. I struggled to finish mine. But then again, for $20 for a schnitzel, you'd expect something substantial. I easily would have preferred a smaller size for less $, but that's not an option. If you don't come with an appetite, you're most probably going to be taking a doggy bag home.   Taste wise, I thought it was okay. The schnitzel itself seemed pretty normal. However, what elevates these things are the toppings. I had the Jaeger, and also tried the wife's Parma... both were good. They also have quite a lot of garlic, which I love (although not sure how authentic this all is... it was very different to the schnitzels I had in Munich beer gardens)  They have a yelp  check in deal for $1 off the beer. Pretty big parking lot (shared with other places). Accept s credit card  If they were a little cheaper, I would have given 4 stars. I'm not sure if I'll return...maybe if I wasn't very hungry and just was going to share one with the wife."}
{"text":"We ate here while visiting Toronto.  As someone who knows about Eastern European cuisine I can say the food is exactly how it should be.  I had the chicken schnitzel, hubby had the pierogies, salo platter for an appetizer.  The presentation and the service were excellent.  Will visit again when we come back in December."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink last Monday.  They have 4 German beers on tap, including a nice wheat one and a good lager. Decent ambiance (including a chess set) and service. Place was pretty deserted. I'd like to go back and try the Shnitzel!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I liked the place better before the overhaul. It used to have a home-y feel and the previous waitress was a lot friendlier and more attentive. Ever since the change, they have been messing up my take-out orders and I just don't enjoy the experience as much anymore. It's convenient for lunch because it is close to my work but it is also extremely over-priced. $11+tax for a portion of perogies (and they forgot the sour cream) is not reasonable in my opinion. Probably won't be returning for a while, if ever."}
{"text":"Hey,  Stopped in while working in are.  Enjoyed the veal schnitzel with a white cabbage salad.  It was very fresh.  I look forward to return and try more."}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding parking at this location since its in a busy plaza. The restaurant is very small only have 5 tables. It was fully packed when I went so the service was shitty.  Food wise, I got the Canadian veal schnitzel with spazel and it was very good. My bf got the chicken wiener and the taste was very blend and the meshed potato wasn't fresh. They did gave us a salad on the house for the wait and it was nice. I got to say the food portion size is VErY big, it could feed a whole family so it's definitely meant to share. I probably only ate 1/3 of my plate and called it quit. They also have a variety of flavored vodka, which I didn't get a chance to try but seems very popular amongst all the customers. I would want to try the porgies next time if I do go back. But overall, I enjoyed my food, not so much for my bf and bad service."}
{"text":"$54.00 gets you : -12 of the smallest perogies Ive ever seen -a bowl of tasteless Goulash soup (canned would have been better) -Dry Chicken schnitzel sandwich (not even a whole chicken breast was used) -Chicken schnitzel over a bit of spatzle (also lacking the meat)  They also forgot to add coleslaw  I will not be ordering delivery from this place again, I feel a bit ripped off to be honest. For $54.00 I could have gotten much more, better tasting food elsewhere. The amount of chicken was not worth it at all."}
{"text":"One of my best dining experiences. The decor is stunning and the food was amazing. You can tell it's fresh and homemade. The service was also really impressive. Why aren't I giving them 5 stars? Have you seen the washrooms? Sad but true it matters, they seem to have forgotten to finish the renovation. I would still return because the food was so good but the little things matter."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, but the quality of food does not match the price tag.  The food does not taste at all like it does in the home country.  The restaurant might do better to focus on one national cuisine and do it properly."}
{"text":"Schnitzel was good. Perogies were good. Beer was good. Service was excellent. But it is overpriced for what it is. I'm sure I'll be back one day, but it isn't at the top of my list of places to dine at Yonge & St Clair."}
{"text":"Kris U hosted the first of the International Supper Club CMYE for 2015 at Schnitzel Hub in Thornhill.  This is right on the border of 905 and 416 and I have very fond memories of this area since I used to work up in North York/Thornhill years ago.  This large strip mall complex is directly across the street from Centrepoint Mall near the north west corner of Yonge and Steeles.  If you can imagine this strip mall being a clock, The Schnitzel Hub would be right around 11:30.  This mall is pretty large and has two sides and parking and driving around this complex is done in a counter clockwise direction.    The restaurant space itself is pretty intimate.  While our party was  a dozen with connected tables, there was only about 3 more tables in the restaurant one of 4 and maybe 2 more of 2 as well as the bar.  The bar itself is a pretty site.  They serve more than a dozen types of infused vodka that are visible along the bottom row of bottles.  The bottles are labeled clearly.  We were a large party that took over more than half the seating of the place.  It's safe to say that it's not the usual thing for a dozen people to take over this space.  Again, it's an intimate place but the seating arrangements were comfortable enough.    We had ordered but our orders were prepared and served not at all the same time.  It's understandable that a small place isn't capable of serving a dozen dishes at once with only one server for the entire establishment.  Still, I received mine first and between myself and the last to receive theirs I was just about done mine and half of my wife's meal.  Also the other patrons in the establishment would also be affected by our large party.  So as far as for large parties, I'd have to say no it's not that great.  For kids that's probably another no.  It's more of an adult scene and an adult menu.    The food is good.  In hindsight I wish I had ordered something else however.  My wife and I ordered close to the same thing but it actually ended up being the same thing.  What I mean by that is I had ordered the \"Veal Cordon Bleu\" which is a veal schnitzel stuffed with Emmental cheese and ham.  What I received was actually the same item my wife had ordered which was the \"Veal Tiroler\" which is also a stuffed veal schnitzel with Emmental cheese and wild mushrooms.  I had received a stuffed version which is really a schnitzel which is then rolled so to speak.  While I enjoyed my food I had wish I had received what I had ordered.  I wasn't going to send it back even though I had received mine first and it could have been corrected because the place seemed back logged already.  The side my wife had ordered was spaezle which is like a fried pasta while I had mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes seemed really minute compared to how much spaezle was on my wife's plate.  If you're looking to get full(er) get the spaezle as it also tastes great.  They also came with a side of roasted carrots which were very good.  Overall the food is good.  I have had better and the prices are decent for dinner.  Portion wise I think the non stuffed dishes are a better deal though.  Why?  The servings looked bigger, were less expensive and overall there was more food just by looking at the plates.  The flat schnitzels cover the plate so all the sides are underneath, the rolled schnitzels are on the plate but take up space so it looks and seems like less food overall.  My mashed potatoes was maybe 4 oz by volume (half a cup) which is minute compared to the amount of spaezle my wife received.  My dish had a large lemon wedge on the side which took up even more plate space.    Compared to the other portions servings, mine IMO was small.  I end up eating half of my wife's anyway because she can never finish.  Still it took me 1.5 meals to feel satiated while others that had only one meal were full.  Yes I can eat a lot but one plate for me wasn't that much, probably because portion size (for the money) mine just seemed like less.  There was a Yelp check in for 1 dollar off one of their German beers.  The beer was good, I had 2 different ones, (pilsner and dark) served in tall stein type glasses and each was 7.50 a piece.    Overall the food was good, the portion sizes I found to be inconsistent and the service because of the volume of the place was slow.  Value wise, it's ok but a little on the pricier side.  Still it's a big change from your normal everyday fare out there."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim since it's so close and I pass by the street often. Never really had German food before. There aren't many German places in the GTA and I love to try new things.  I had the Weiner Schnitzel with spaetzle and sauerkraut. For $20 I expected a bit more. Size is a 3 dimensional measure. The \"area\" is certainly large, but the thickness is very lacking. Or perhaps that's intentional to keep the schnitzel crispy? I don't know since I'm no schnitzel expert. But I do know that this thing is not worth $20 in my books. The spaetzle and sauerkraut were ok. The schnitzel itself was pretty good. But I'd prefer something more like Tonkatsu which is definitely crispier. Tonkatsu is about half the price at most Korean/Japanese places. The seasoning were good but neither the schnitzel or the sides were things I would crave.  I'm not giving up on this place yet. I won't order schnitzel again but might try the other things like sausages or peirogies. $20 and not including a drink is a lot to ask imo for something not so difficult to make."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Friday. The place was super busy! We got seated immediately but it took awhile for the server to come to our table and get our orders in. When we finally ordered, we waited quite some time to get our food. We probably waited for 50 minutes to order and get our food. When the food came, it was really good. Reasonably priced, good portions and yummy. I got the veal schnitzel with egg and smoked sprat. The smoked fish was so delicious. I love the veal cutlet. Really good portion! It came with some type of noodle/pasta thing (don't remember what it's called). That one I'm not really fan of. It's looked like scrambled egg and tasted really bland. It needs some type of sauce. I kinda wish I got the mashed potatoes instead.  But the veal cutlet is on point. Very crunchy and cooked right. With sunny side up egg and smoked fish, it tasted delicious.   Would go here again to try out different food...maybe the sandwiches. But it's very busy during lunch time so their service isn't at all that great."}
{"text":"Came here last night for Winterlicious 2018. After doing another winterlicious restaurant a few days ago, my expectations were set so high for this place, and it did not disappoint!  Our reservation was for 7:30, but we arrived pretty early at 6:50. Thankfully they had no problem taking us early! We were sat across from the bar at a cozy table and water was brought to us by our server right away. We got a delicious German beer as recommended by our server. It was served in an awesome German beer stein!  Because we looked at the menu beforehand, we ordered shortly after sitting. To start I got the perogies, for my main the pork schnitzel, and the strudel for dessert. All dishes were so delicious, and hands down the best perogies and schnitzel I have ever had in my life! The schnitzel was so big, I took the last quarter home.  The vibe and atmosphere was really nice. My boyfriend liked how they had a TV with the hockey game on at the bar  it was also SUPER convenient to get to using public transit!  This place is a real gem, especially if you are craving schnitzel or perogies! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I came here for a CMYE with the elite crew. I ordered a plain veil schnitzel with a side of mashed potatoes and washed it all down with a pint of beer which was $1 off for checking in.  Schnitzel was fresh, tasty, delicious, and properly flattened. Staff surely did a great job beating my meat. Portions are 'murican. Location is cozy. Waitress was friendly and helpful.  Quality schnitzel at a reasonable price. If you are craving schnitzel then this is the place you should go to."}
{"text":"We really love Schnitzel Hub - since we discovered it a few months ago, we are now always looking for excuses to make our way to this great restaurant. We are huge schnitzel fans and this place serves some of the best schnitzel we've ever had anywhere. The sauerkraut is crazy good, the spaetzle is brilliant, even the bread and butter is incredible. We've tried the chicken, veal and even the eggplant schnitzel - it is wonderful, light, thin, flavourful. You can tell they care about quality and show good attention to the little details. Also the portions are HUGE. The restaurant itself is clean and nicely decorated. It is a quiet and pleasant place to have a nice meal. And the service is always attentive and great. We've been for lunch and dinner - and we will be back. Love it."}
{"text":"Went to Schnitzel Hub on Friday night with friends, the appetizer, we ordered a few to share but absolutely favourite was baked Camembert cheese. Drink selection is great and we all loved the infused vodka martinis. I had Beef Stroganoff for main and it was delicious. Unfortunately i couldn't eat any dessert because I was too full, but will definitely be back to try their Lava cake, it looks amazing."}
{"text":"Cake tax! The food was good, the service was terrible. We were a party of 6 and one of us brought brownies and funny little birthday plates to share with the group. We got our bills and that's when our server told us that's not allowed. Our mistake apparently was not asking if we could eat the homemade brownies at the table in the empty restaurant (one other table of 4). Our bills were then taken away and on our new bills we were each given a cake cutting fee ($1.75) and then told that the gratuity was now included because we were a party of 6. The first bills we received DID NOT have the gratuity included. We were basically forced to give a tip because he knew we were upset. I understand if we had asked for a knife and plater to put the cake on  but it was brownies with our own plates. A stiff warning would have been sufficient since we were unaware that it couldn't done. Too bad the service sucker,  it was my first and last time going to this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious lunch and everything was delicious.  Would definitely recommend it.  The ambience is rustic and the staff are friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"What a great place! Went on a Friday evening and was really surprised to find it was not busy. Started with some cocktails and meat perogies. Drinks were fine but the perogies were amazing!  A great portion for sharing and well presented.  They make the perogies in house.     We both had the schnitzel for the main course, I had the chicken and my boyfriend had the veal.  Both were excellent.  Large portions, perfectly cooked with great sides. Took half of it home for later,  and was hoping to have some apple strudel but they were sold out.    This is a great place for a date, or when you just want some good, no frills food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Schnitzel Hub is as defined in the Yelp Dictionary as a \"Dilemma\".  An unsuspecting first-time customer to Schnitzel Hub would be caught off-guard, however a RETURN VISIT of the alert consumer will have the scenario of two possibilities:  1. Do you get an order of Schnitzel to SHARE, whereby you'll have to watch your companion eat 50% of your Schnitzel while you have insufficient protein consumption?    2. or, do you get an order of Schnitzel for your OWN, leading to Schnitzel-ITIS and protein surplus all the while watching your companion suffer the same fate? 3.5 **stars**  In retrospect, I should have unbuckled my belt...       Look and you'll understand.                  !                  !                  !                  V"}
{"text":"I  giving this place 1 star because my server was really nice. My meal, on the other hand, was shockingly bad. I recall eating here a couple of years ago and my chicken Weiner schnitzel was decent. This time, I ordered \"The Canadian\" chicken schnitzel with cheese, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. I chose mashed potatoes as the side. My meal came out quickly. Unfortunately, the schnitzel was greasy and not crispy at all. The toppings were disgusting. The onions tasted almost like apple sauce and had the same consistency. The cheese was tasteless mozzarella (I think!) and wasn't melted properly. The schnitzel alone would have been bad enough, but the toppings resulted in the dish being an epic failure. The mashed potatoes were the best part. They were, however, served plain. I asked for gravy after I realized that they were going to be the highlight of my dinner and I was served a small bowl of what I think was some combination of oxo and soy sauce. So very bad..."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and had the Jaeger schnitzel (veal) with spaetzle and the onion pierogies. Overall, the food was very good, but the portions were small (read: reasonable) given what I have come to expect from a schnitzel house.  Though I can't find any real fault with the restaurant, the price did seem a bit high given the quality of food and service, which is why the rating isn't higher. We ended up spending $75 for lunch for two adults, including drinks (they have German beer on tap), tax and tip. Even though I didn't feel like there was great value for money spent, the food was nevertheless very good, and I think I would go back."}
{"text":"We had a 7:00 p.m. reservation for 4 people, but when the 4 we arrived we found they had not actually reserved a table and told us to wait an hour for someone to leave this tiny restaurant, and were not seated until 8:00 o'clock. We would have left but as my friend is disabled, it would have been difficult so we stayed. We asked to speak to a manager or owner, but were told there was no one. Another party of 4 people who arrived after us who also had a reservation who were told there was no table for them did leave (smart move). The schnitzel was oily and greasy, the food overall heavily salted, all in all we agreed it was the worst meal we had eaten in any restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious dinner with my UofT colleagues. Loved their 3 course menu and I love schnitzel so 2 great seasons to come here. I loved the décor here and you notice it right away. It has a cool rustic feel to it and they have the wood trunk cravings from trees on the wall which is quite interesting.  I love their drink menus as they have various drink options and a full service bar. I ordered one of their drink specials which was the Munich Gold that came in a nice stein glass- a great German beer to order here. For the Winterlicious menu, I ordered the steak tartare with hand-chopped raw angus beef, served with onion, capers, quail egg yolk and chef's secret spices, served with roasted beef bone marrow and baguette. The chicken jaeger schnitzel - a crispy breaded cutlet topped with hearty bacon, mushroom, and red wine sauce and perfectly paired with traditional spaetzle and roasted heirloom root vegetables and lastly for dessert homemade vanilla cheesecake. After we placed our order, our server brought us complimentary bread with garlic butter while we waited for our meals. I was impressed with the steak tartare, it was quite delicious and flavorful. As with the beef bone marrow, it was really rich and good. I definitely made the right choice to get this appetizer. We kept ordering bread cause it was quite good and I usually order more to ensure I am actually full at the end of my meal. Little did I know the portion of the schnitzel when it came was gigantic. Literally it was a huge piece of chicken. The chicken schnitzel was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. Totally worth the price and was it more than a general portion for the entrée. Lastly, to finish off our meal I got the cheesecake. Great homemade cheesecake and loved their raspberry sorbet which adds a nice touch to the dessert. Service was great and our server was awesome. He was funny, charismatic and super gracious in ensuring we had a great dining experience. If you are looking for great schnitzel and beer, this is the place to eat at.  Highly recommend it and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed as a Russian .  I uber ordered : 1. Borsh 2. Cabbage rolls 3. Chicken Kiev + mashed potatos. 1. BORSH - 1/5stars - Recipe didn't include Beet which is the main ingredient of the soup, and no kidney beans. FAIL. 2. CABBAGE ROLLS - 1/5stars - grinded meat tasted like rubber, tasted Cheap and dry.  3. CHICKEN KIEV - 3/5 - was the best dish out of 3. Huge rolled Chicken breast . Tasted fresh. Mashed potatos was on point.  Overall : not recommending to anyone. Going to Yummy Market instead."}

We order our caesars they make out of home infused vodka.My Father order smoke pork hock its was  huge size and taste amazing to easy to share for tree people. For dessert hot chocolate lava was yammy. Thank again Schnitzel hub."}
{"text":"Came here at 9:20pm..waitress said kitchen is closed..I checked on the door, it says Friday the restaurant closes at 1130pm..not impressed at all"}
{"text":"So good after having a hard time finding new places in the GTA. We had the Sesame Chicken Schnitzel that came with a fried eggplant and we had the biggest codcakes I have ever seen that came with chipotle mayo. All of it was perfectly fried and the cod cakes were so soft and warm and very fresh.I also liked the spaetzel and sauerkraut sides. A lot of food for some after dinner snacks =). Will be back."}
{"text":"First time there for dinner.  The meals we had were simply huge. A plate for one would easily feed three people and although the taste wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special. To justify the enormous portions, they charge high prices.  When a couple came in, seemingly a few minutes before us, they were discouraged From splitting a plate by the server. She did offer the lunch size (not on the dinner menu) but these lunch plates were also very large for one person."}
{"text":"Having seen this venue a couple of times passing by the plaza and the interesting window image they have of a schnitzel with a sunny side up egg on top we decided to give it a try. Well we were pleasantly surprised. Tried the goulash, hearty with lots of meat and one the schnitzels which had a sort of hot salsa like sauce. Portions are rather big. Service was efficient. Place is clean and tidy. Food was fresh and tasty. Will definitly go again"}
{"text":"This schnitzel is the real deal! With so many options it's worth every penny. You can choose the protein and the toppings.  The inside of this modest hub is quite classy with both quaint tables, group tables, and a laid-back lounge with a fully stocked bar.  I decided to try the Canadian schnitzel as it sounded like an interesting combination. Not being in the mood to sit at a restaurant on my own I got mine to go. When I opened the container, the presentation looked unappealing; however, the taste well made up for it.  The combination of the savoury wild mushrooms in combination with the sweetness of the Carmelized onion was delicious. Add some melted cheese and some juicy protein and you've got a great meal.  Price point is a tad on the high side; however, the food is crave-worthy. Working in the area And so many options still to try, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service: poor - waiter took order, server served our food. We had mentioned during initial order that we would also be ordering. 3rd meal for take out.  We never saw our server or waiter during our meal.  I wanted to order extra sauce, and was told 'we don't do that'??  Food: okay, but not worth a repeat visit"}
{"text":"We came here for $38 Summerlicious menu as we were starving in this area of the city.  I grabbed the gravlax carpaccio, veal jaeger schnitzel and we split the dessert options while the lady got the eggplant parma schnitzel.  To be honest, most of it was fairly forgettable.  The cherry perogies dessert was interesting, coming with whipped cream and tossed in brown sugar and cinnamon -- not sure if I would order it again, but now I can say I've had perogies for dessert... ? (shrug)  However, the star of the show (as you guessed) was the veal schnitzel, which was topped with a mushroom & red wine sauce and sitting on top of a bed of spaetzle.  It's deep fried meat on a bed of carbs - you can't fuck this up.  It was a much larger portion of schnitzel than I expected and batter was crispy.  Good deal for Summerlicious -- not so sure at their regular prices.  There are a few German beers on tap and they have a 13 oz $4 happy hour special as well.  However, not my first choice for a place to drink - it's an odd mix of service staff in ties and vests, a sleek looking bar, pop music as ambiance... while you eat deep fried meat and drink German beer out of a boot.  Anyways - solid but tad pricey schnitzel.  Not bad."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Beef stroganoff was rich in taste. It's very rare to find such good quality cuisine at such reasonable prices.  Staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this place because among everything else is not pretentious as are the Italian restaurants down the street and across Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic wiener schnitzel - which comes with mashed potatoes or spaetzle and you can choose from veal or chicken.  I opted for the cucumber salad as a side substitute.  The veal schnitzel was delicious - large portion, fresh, crispy and the lemon slice adds a nice touch.  The cucumber salad was nice and refreshing, with lots of dill.  The only down fall was the salad made the schnitzel a little soggy underneath; I would recommend ordering the salad in a side dish.  My friend ordered the chicken wiener schnitzel and she also really enjoyed it.    I visited this restaurant twice before the renovation --I preferred the atmosphere before since it was more hip and modern. The restaurant now has more of an old school traditional european look.   The menu also changed, which is disappointing because before you were able to get salad & fries as a side.   Regardless, the food is still great and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The inaugural Yelp GTA International Supper Club held its first meeting at SchniztelHub in Vaughan.  I am a great fan of any meat that is pounded down to a pancake thickness, then breaded and deepfried.  I personally have never had schnitzel at a restaurant before and my wife and I were excited!!  SchniztelHub is located on Steeles in Vaughan, in the back part of a very busy strip mall.  Once you see the clock tower in the parking lot you know the SchniztelHub is right below it.  The actual restaurant is very small in terms seating.  A quick estimate is about 25 seats (which is quite small for a dine in restaurant).  There is a bar which is fully stocked with home infused vodkas.  If your not familiar with infused vodkas...its basically plain vodka which is poured over different ingredients (fruit, spices, candies, bacon....yes bacon..) The vodka is left to sit and the flavors are \"infused\" with the vodka.  Our group did not get to sample the above, but you can order them in a single form or in a flight (a sample variety in smaller glasses).  They also featured Hacker-Pschorr brewery (German) which made an awesome complement to our meal. Our group ordered various types of schnitzel which can be either chicken or veal.  Choices such as Jaeger schnitzel (plain) to a Parma (covered with cheese and tomato sauce) to Cordon Bleu (stuffed with ham and emmental cheese) along with the ever so tasty German take on Mac and cheese \"Spaezle\". The food quality and portion sizes were excellent. Our Parma schnitzel was such a big portion that me and my wife shared 1 order and we still had leftovers!! We also ordered Pierogis as and appetizer.  The filling of the pierogis were tasty and the dough was perfect.   The only downside was the speed of service. Our server was friendly and took care of us the best she could, but the turnaround is a little on the slow side.  There was only 1 server taking care of the whole restaurant and 1 chef, so when the restaurant became busy the service slowed to a crawl.  Half our orders for the table came out, then we waited for about 30 min till the next set came out.   I know this is very hard to manage with a small service area, but it is something to keep in mind if there is a reservation for a group.  If your craving european cuisine and are in the busy Steeles area of Vaughan, check out the SchniztelHub!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to any schnitzel places in the city so I decided to try this place out almost a year ago as per a recommendation from my friend Dima.  The place is located at the back of the Yorkville North plaza which is in front of the Canadian Tire on Yonge & Steeles.  Lemme tell ya, this place is awesome.  I have come a few times after, even bringing my cousin and his new wife there too.  This place is everything you want... Schnitzelized in SCHNITZELand!  Huge portions, many selections, great staff, homely, cozy feel for a restaurant.  Today, I dined in and ordered the Parma Schnitzel with 2 side orders of Potato Salad.  That's right, 2 of the same side orders.  Each schnitzel dinner comes with 2 sides.$15.95 plus tax.  Parma Schnitzel - 2 crispy, juicy GYNORMOUS chicken schnitzels with mozzarella, cheddar, tomato sauce, drizzled with parmesan, pesto and oil.  Fresh as hell.  Just yummy.  Potato Salad - this is simply delicious.  It has a strong, creamy flavour which I absolutely love.  So good I never want a different side order... just another potato salad!  Little bits of crunchy in there along with chunks of potato.  Magnificent.  It is such a great complement to the meal.  I'm going to leave it off there.  The picture below speaks for itself.  I couldn't even finish the thing.  That's how generous the portions are.  It's great and I'll be coming back again and again.  Come on down to SCHNITZELand if you want fresh, simple and delicious food.  Get ur grub on!!!"}
{"text":"Really fresh food and very big portions. You will not leave hungry!  I had the schnitzel and perogis. Both were very good. This type of food is very typical Eastern European. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Zomg - I think my stomach exploded - but in a good way.   Thanks Kris for hosting the GTA First international Supper Club CMYE - at such a cozy place.   Schnitzel Hub is a small place but can probably accommodate 1 large group of people with maybe a handful of 5 - 6 smaller groups of people comfortably.   Menu is small - 2 pages - 1 page is pretty much all Schnitzel in its various forms of glory. The other page - appetizers and a handful of different versions of pirogies.   Pricing is moderate - with most of the schnitzel running you about $20 post taxes before tip a plate. But comes with a choice of either mashed potatoes or spätzle and sweet glazed roasted root veggies.    Portions  - HUGE - most of the schnitzel is larger than your average larger size dinner plate. I had ordered the cabbage rolls - only because I wanted a different taste - and the cabbage rolls were probably 2 to 3 times larger than your average garden variety cabbage rolls. I barely managed to finish 1 roll, and had to pack the 2nd to go.   Food - solid - I like the fact that they have such a small menu - since it gives them a chance to focus on quality. The staff - it is just one person in front and 1 person on the kitchen cranking out the food. I will say that even though the food was slow to come out - it was because it was made fresh and carefully, which is what is most important.   It was nice to have spätzle again - I was having a hard time finding a place that serves it, since I got back from Germany - but this place does feed the spätzle craving just enough to make the craving stop."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  I visited this place with a couple of friends. I ordered the chicken schnitzel with cucumber salad (special request for salad because it wasn't an option in the menu). Normally it comes with spaetzle or mashed potatoes.  My friend ordered the veal schnitzel and another friend ordered the meat perogies.  The food was definitely \"a-ok\" but I didn't like that the schnitzel was sitting on top of a wet cucumber salad which made the schnitzel soggy.  They gave a lot of cucumber salad which was very tasty and included a lot of dill.  The portions were large as well.  The atmosphere was family-style. My friend who had come when it was \"Schnitzeland\" had mentioned that the atmosphere was better before as it seemed more \"cool\" and modern...but I supposed they probably wanted to make the restaurant more family-friendly. Majority of the clientele who come here seems to be Eastern European as well, so it must be authentic...?  Service was good. They pour water for you when you run out and are generally attentive.  Pricing is comparable to other restaurants that sell schnitzel, but I found it to be a tad on the pricier side.  All in all, I'd return here again."}
{"text":"A rather small but very cute resto with a German feel.  Not the best for big groups but definitely a date spot or to hang with very small groups of friends :)  To start we got the goulash - it was flavoured well and not too salty, I'm a huge fan of anything tomato-y so the enjoyment factor of this dish was greater than usual for me.  The beef morsels were also tender and went deliciously with the medley of veggies.    For the main, I had the Canadian chicken schnitzel with mushrooms, caramelized onion and mozzarella cheese.  It came with a side of mash - I thought the schnitzel was a little cold and a little dry.  Ironically I enjoyed the dish more when I reheated the half that I couldn't finish at home - it definitely tastes better when warm/hot.  I thought the spatzel side dish that a friend ordered looked neat - egg noodles in little knots that you could choose as a side instead of mash.  I would also probably try a veal  Jaeger schnitzel next time I'm back - this one had mushroom, bacon and red wine sauce.  Hard to go wrong with bacon after all"}
{"text":"The food is very good. New taste to torontonians who are so use to sushi, koreans, wings and ... Very cozy place with great german beers Try it"}
{"text":"I had high expectations when coming here but the experience just sucked....first off this place is sooooo tiny, probably a max of 16 people with only 1 server that took forever to serve us when there was only 3 other tables It's a cute environment none of the less  I found the food to be quite pricy for what it's worth like perogies were $10 and they were nothing spectacular, then the waitress recommended a off the menu app which was sausages and saucerkraut, that cost $21 for 3 sausages, seriously.....there was a cheese infused one, pork and I think beef, nothing special, taste like the frozen ones I get at the supermarket..... Now with the schnitzel, there were I believe 7 different types, there was 5 of us so we ordered different ones to see how they taste, first off the schnitzels r hugeeeeeee, almost covered the entire plate....in terms of the toppings they have, not impressed at all, egg and fish on a schnitzel do not mix at allllllll....the schnitzel was nothing special, good but not great and wasn't a experience that I expected....our meal of 5 schnitzel, 2 perogies, sausages was about $150......  Never again....."}
{"text":"Very weak schnitzel. Got the Wiener schnitzel meal which was around $15 - overpriced for what you got. Meat portion was small by schnitzel standards (should have been a max $10 meal for the size) but the main issue was that it was soggy even though I had to wait for take out so I'm assuming it should have been made fresh. Side of coleslaw and spaetzle were the only saving grace. Will stick to Country Style on Bloor for schnitzel."}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant. (Maybe 8 or 9 tables)  Went with a group of 6 and we all enjoyed the food and want to return.  The menu is not large but has a number of options, including about 6 different Schnitzel types. The portions are very large, we could have easily shared one Schnitzel between two people. The porgies were an excellent app that was large enough to share or alone as a meal. We each had leftovers to take.  Customer service was very good although there was only one server to take care of the restaurant.   There is also lots of free parking in the plaza this restaurant is in."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for a german night out. The holstein schnitzel is delicious. Came in hungry and came out too full to finish the meal.  The gold german beer is great too. It is a very small resturant with 1 server for bar and food."}
{"text":"Been here before and after the remodel. Prior to the remodel, the prices were better. They had sizing options as well. Now a days though, schnitzels cost $20 or more, not including any other apps or sides. The food is decent, portions are large and the place itself is small. Keep your group visits to 3-4 people max. Larger groups may have to take their food to go."}
{"text":"Schnitezel Hub is a tiny restaurant in a big plaza near the Yonge & Steeles corner. I've tried most of the Asian restaurants there and we decided to stop in here Saturday at around 3 pm for a late lunch/early dinner. The restaurant was completely empty (makes sense considering the time) and it was a nice small but cozy place. We had the Goulash Soup & Perogies (they were out of meat so I had to settle for the sauerkraut filling) and the Jager Schnitzel. Perhaps I'm not that familiar with Polish/European food but the Goulash was quite simple and boring. It was essentially a tomato-based vegetable soup that the server suggested to eat with sour cream. I don't know about anybody else, but he recommended it as 'delicious' but honestly it was too homely for me. The perogies were also nothing special. The outer dough layer was quite thick and even though the sauerkraut filling was tasty, there was really nothing special to say about the perogies.   My companion had the Jager Schnitzel. It was quite big, covering a large plate over some spaetzle. There was barely any pork flavour in the schnitzel, it wasn't crispy enough and the gravy was quite plain. The spaetzle, although clearly homemade, had barely any flavour other than the fried butter taste. Perhaps our expectations were too high for the schnitzel, but we expected much better than a standard schnitzel you can get at any restaurant. Me Va Me's schnitzel down the road on Steeles and even up in Vaughan is much more flavourful.   All in all, hearty and homely food but honestly, nothing special."}
{"text":"NEW AND UPDATED REVIEW as the restaurant renovated and changed menu, food items, etc.  I don't know why they would change the menu when they renovated this place.  Totally different menu, they got rid of their home made French fries and the meals don't include the sides as before.    The only good comment I have is that the Goulash soup was ok this time but literally half the portion this time.  The Schnitzel is still a nice size but now only one piece and with no salads.  Mashed potatoes have no flavour unless you put the dill butter that comes with your bread.  Made me sad that they made such a drastic change to this place so my last 5 star review is now a 2 star."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I am beyond impressed. If you like traditional European food done right this is your place. The beer selection is fabulous as well. I had the Weisse and it paired perfectly with my meal.  I was only able to order the salmon carpaccio and a chicken schnitzel but I can't wait to come back and try more. I could eat the house made vodka salmon carpaccio for breakfast lunch and dinner.  The service is fabulous and professional, the music is perfect and I could not be happier. Alex took great care of my friend and I ensuring all our slightly annoying requests were taken care of. You need to go here is the bottom line. Even if you've never tried schnitzel I encourage you to do so now by visiting this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food tasted pretty good but I couldn't believe how little beef was in the BEEF stroganoff.  Three thin little strips.  The rest was all noodles and vegetables.  Not cool.  $24 buck for less meat than would feed a cat."}
{"text":"We went here for the heck of it and my wife likes eastern european food. She really liked this place. I thought it was very good as well. Has a lot of unique foods as well as interesting flavoured vodka. I will have to come back here again sometime."}
{"text":"Cold schnitzel with a wet cardboardy breading obscuring a decently tender interior, slathered in so much horseradish (and was that ketchup?) that was so overwhelming I actually thought of rinsing the schnitzel under the tap because it verged on inedible  If I hadn't eaten out all week, I would have thrown it out and gone to Subway  They gave me the wrong order even after I had suggested that this probably wasn't my sandwich.  Had trouble making change for my ten-and-five.  Order wasn't ready on time.  I bet they just panicked and gave me someone else's schnitzel  Suburban euro-chic styling that seems straight out of a Vaughan power centre.    I don't like criticizing restaurants because I get how time- and money-consuming the food business is, but if you can't accurately swing a deserted Tuesday lunch schnitzel on a bun, it might be hopeless."}
{"text":"The portions are generous and the prices not too bad, so I would go back when in the mood for schnitzel. The service was a little slow and the server did not come by often enough. I was disappointed that they were out of pork! I had to pick veal. They also don't have rahmschnitzel (schnitzel topped with cream sauce usually mushrooms-based) which is very surprising, so I had to settle for the only other schnitzel with any kind of sauce."}
{"text":"After a recommendation from my bf's co-workers, we wanted to check it out based on their compliments to the place.  Being lazy, and HAVING to watch FIFA, we ordered delivery. the food was a solid 'good', however, I know anything delivered, (especially fried) will suffer greatly. We had the plain schnitzel (no sauces, etc). Ordered beef and 1 chicken. It was good, but I am SURE it would've been sooo much better to eat in. Sides- potato salad, fries, spatzel, white coleslaw, beet salad. My bf didn't like the sides at all - I give the a pass (7outa 10). Based on previous review, we ordered potato salad, all a matter of taste, but I found it way too salty and way over dressed (to each his own).  Bottom line - I am sure the main event (schnitzel) is great if you dine in. It was still good for take out, don't expect it to be crispy - b/c that's impossible for take out (not their fault). I would recommend and encourage anyone to eat in. We, do still feel it was good and AMAZING value (cheap, in my books - double schnitzel for well under 20$! -- c'mon! :) ) Little tip - if you order take out/del and order fries - they're really good warmed up on a frying pan.  What I love is they don't have an extensive menu~! They do schnitzel, and specialize it in!  IMHO I think they could do better on their sides and maybe offer a fresh salad on the menu. Totally worth going to. .. I'll update when/if we dine in"}
{"text":"This place serves up European eats in the midtown area.   The resto itself is nice but seems a little dated, wishing it was more modern. The menu had a lot of great items such as schnitzels, perogies, cabbage rolls, and other Eastern European dishes.   We went with a original veal schnitzel and the perogies. Both dishes were average to me. The schnitzel was quite oily but tender and the perogies were tasty but again very average.   Overall if you're really craving this type of cuisine then check it out but not sure I would go back here for any reason."}
{"text":"If you like schnitzel, then you've definitely come to the right place. They have a good number of variations on schnitzel beyond just your basic breaded piece of meat. I had the holstein schnitzel which came with an egg on top of the meat and smoked sprat which are kind of like anchovies. The piece of schnitzel they give for a lunch portion is HUGE. It comes with a side of spaezle or mashed potato. I tried spaezle for the first time here, and although I have nothing to compare it to, I have to say I thought it was just kind of... bland. Not sure if it's supposed to be like that or what. I also found the texture to be interesting, kind of chewy and doughy. Again, maybe that's just the way it is, but I don't think I was a huge fan... although it was still kind of oddly addicting to eat.  The actual schnitzel was good, I got a veal cutlet (other option is chicken) and it was thin, crispy, lightly breaded which I liked because who wants to be eating a ton of fried breading.  Service was decent, no complaints, standard.  I don't think I enjoy schnitzel in general enough to come back specifically to this place, but kind of a neat place to try out."}
{"text":"A friend and I had stopped by for dinner a 3 weeks ago during long weekend when I had a craving for Schnitzel. I've been planning to eat my way through Toronto Schnitzel joints.  This was the 2nd place I went to.   It was very quiet,  the restaurant was on the smaller side but charming and clean.  The waitress was polite and friendly. It was long weekend Sunday so it was quiet. We were the only table but a few people who ordered take out came in.   The food was delicious we ordered a schnitzel and strogonoff and split the meals. Though I came for the schnitzel I ate most of the strogonoff which was delicious. The oven roasted veggies were flavourful and caramelize perfectly. I have been dreaming of this dish since I had it and will be going back very soon.   The schnitzel was large in portion and fried perfectly but tender. We ordered it with spaetzle (noodles) with the strogonoff and it tasted like the one my best friends mother used to make.  I grew up eating schnitzels and spaetzle in my early childhood years and it reminded me of the ones I used to eat so I had a happy heart and tummy.   This restaurant is at the back of a plaza and people might not know about it which is a shame. The food is delicious and definitely worth the price.  I have a feeling it's going to become a favourite place of mine."}
{"text":"The food is good, main issue was we placed our order and was not followed,  we order online under Uber eats and selected several sandwiches, one of my kids wanted plain chicken schnitzel sandwich and they instead loaded up Mayo mustard,  lettuce, tomatoes, needles to say my kid did not want to eat it. Same for the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch the other day. I am always on the lookout for a Schnitzel restaurant since it is one of my favourites. The menu is short but with enough selection to temp most palettes. A goodly choice of vodka, to my surprise. My server was prompt, knowledgeable, professional and pleasant. I felt quite comfortable as a single diner. The meal was very good, the Schnitzel delicious, home fried potatoes and a slaw. An additional plate of bread and garlic butter made me a happy person. The martini excellent.  I was too full to consider dessert."}
{"text":"We had 1 veal and 1 chicken schnitzel. The veal was ok, just a little bit chewy. The chicken schnitzel was pink inside so we had to send it back to cook it more. Pretty disappointing... For side dish I ordered french fries, but I got baked potato sprinkled with dill all over. (Nevertheless to say I hate dill) Our server, Andrei was excellent, very attentive and professional. The other positive thing was the nice decor and good atmosphere."}
