{"text":"Food was good. A bit spicy . Good for people who like strong flavors . Their mint chutney is awesome. I wish they had more menu items. Curry bowl only has paneer for vegetarians, which is not good for non paneer lovers like me. We ordered chicken biryani nd pav bhaji Both were good"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have ever had. Usually, I am not a big fan of pizzas and found them to be bland. I had the Chicken Tikka pizza 3 to 4 times and felt compelled to write the review. Chicken tikka pizza and fresh orange juice left an indelible impression and woken up my taste buds. Every time I am in the area, I make sure I try something here. Food is Fresh, Fast and delicious at a price I can afford. Can't ask for more. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Super convenient from my work. The staff are always friendly. Clean restaurant and quick service. Food is excellent - everything I have had on the menu has been great, so far. I probably come here two or three times a week and will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"As someone who is not familiar with Indian food I thought the food was good. Don't come if you are in a hurry. I placed an online order and arrived a half hour later and was still told it would be 10-15 min. It ended up being 20 min after I arrived and all I ordered was 2 small pizzas."}
{"text":"Ehh.. is all I could describe it. Ordered a wrap from them it was just okay and had hardly any meat in it. Wasn't bad or anything but not impressed."}
{"text":"Been ordering takeout and was good. Recently the chicken 65 quantity is very less. Last week I got a mix of vegetable biryani with chicken pieces in it for a chicken biryani order. Seemed old as well. My girlfriend & me, both got stomach upset for eating little of it & been off to work. Need to sue this place. Please give quality hygienic products or shut down. Not ordering or going here anymore."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant as stop by to have lunch while way back home to Atlanta. Chicken Biriyani tasted like spoiled. Goat biriyani was fine but not much mixed spice plane rice. Felt like microwaved one. There was no chef which is not correct running restaurant . Guy who was running on counter also preparing food. I won't suggest this restaurant."}
{"text":"We placed an order through postmates for chicken biriyani, pav bhaji and chicken 65. The bhaji was stale, slimy and smelly. We took just one bite and had to toss the rest. The chicken 65 was over cooked and very rubbery. The chicken in the biriyani was extremely bland and dry and so was the rice.   Note to restaurant: taste is relative and we can get past the bland taste of the biriyani but the fact that the bhaji was stale to the point of being smelly is a definite NO! We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"First time going today!   I ordered the vegetable biryani and samosas.  Definitely on the pricey side..  total: $16.13  I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetable biryani at all!  Something was just a bit off for me and gave me a stomach ache.  Very very strong flavors!!   The samosas!! AMAZINGGG!!!!!!!!  They were fried to perfection and the filling was incredible! Andddd they were rather large ! **2 come in an order. They don't specify it anywhere on the menu but they are plenty for 2  Either the rice dish or the samosa came with this yoghurt sauce, something I do not eat because I am vegan, but I took them home and ate them with hummus and they are just as yummy! Even alone."}
{"text":"Worst food ever  Very poor food quality..  they are giving frozen food and don't even heat it properly. We went today \", they didn't even serve water and charged for water also ...that two double the amount. Will never recommend to anyone!!  I was so disappointed from the service provided by your team, I will make sure I will never visit again. Specially if you guys can charge for water, what else I can think."}
{"text":"It's pretty much new restaurant, on the way to farmers market we visited this place. It's really cool and fast food kind of place, limited menu and every thing is on affordable prices.          We just ordered chicken tandoori/ kabob pizza it's really delicious, we like it and  it's really yummy !! Next time we are going to try others items. Since it's a new place just came into market so not sure how long they keep clean and serve  delicious food. Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Indian eatery! The paneer curry with rice and paneer wrap were a hit. This is my new place for Indian food. There's only a handful of Indian restaurants in Charlotte that are worthy of 5 stars, this is up there. Thank you Pudina for having flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"A new place for all Indian food lovers. Loved the veg biryani. Indian style pizza was pretty good too though it missed the pizza base sauce-esp with some Indo-Italian masala. Also very good service. Hope they continue to serve authentic flavors."}
{"text":"Amazing. Why hasn't anyone done this before. Pizza with authentic Indian ingredients and flare. Not only pizza but other more traditional Indian dishes of equal great quality. Food came out fast. Great flavor and presentation. Prices are very reasonable and the owner is nice and friendly. More of a good food style interior but that's not a bad thing. Located inside a more corporate setting this is a hidden gem. You gotcha try this place. Open 7 days a week!!!!"}
{"text":"A neat hidden place at the ground floor of a corporate office, you wouldn't notice if you are passing by. We had Paneer tikka pizza to go. The pizza tastes good when eaten hot, as the base is thinner than usual pizza and gets soggy if reheated later. On other occasion, I had their day's special curry combo with naan and rice which is a good value for money. We called 2 mins after their closing time and they were kind enough to still accept the order for take out."}
{"text":"Italian + Indian = Chicken Tikka Pizza  Order this, you won't be disappointed.  Don't forget to order some samosa's, it comes with 2 per order, but they're HUGE, and I got full just by eating them."}
{"text":"Bad experience ! Pizza was way to dry and hard ! Even the box it came in was softer than the pizza itself! Never going back again! Way tooo pricey! Medium pizza nd can of coke 19$ some change WOW!"}
{"text":"Nice casual eating restaurant. Food options are limited but everything is great . We loved the pav bhaji and Indian style pizza in mint sauce .. sitting space is good . The only issue is with finding the place it's little hidden on the back side of building with no proper directions marked . We had to call them to confirm where are they exactly located ."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Was on travel here and was craving for Indian style pizza. Tried and Enjoyed the Pantera Tikka and the Samosa. Try it and you will like it"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path flavorful Indian restaurant with home-style cooking that is delicious!  The Pizza is a must when you come here!!"}
{"text":"Got hungry and decided it was time to order some food.  Pudina delivered it literally and the delivered on the flavors as well.  I got a veggie pizza which was full of flavor, had a nice amount of spice to it and a great crisp.  The other dish, while I am not sure what it was consisted of a red sauce and rice with vegetables.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I couldn't stop eating it.  The rice was well seasoned and paired with the red sauce made for a dynamite combination.  I would most certainly order from here again as well as stop by and dine in.  The menu here is pretty diverse, has vegetarian options as well as traditional Indian fare. Yum..."}
{"text":"Pudina is my new favorite.  It combines Indian food and pizza, two of my favorites.  With pizzas, the crust is thin and crispy and perfect....the paneer tikka pizza is addictive.  I love it.  I've also had their samosas  which are some of the best I've ever had...they are crispy and light and fresh...not greasy and heavy like I've had at other places.  Paneer biriyanis is great.  Excellent for vegetarians like me and for carnivores.  Great service and food, reasonable prices.  Pudina is now on my short list of favorites.  You can also have their food delivered by Bite Squad."}
{"text":"Had chicken tikka wrap and fresh orange juice. My friend had chicken dum biryani. Food was good. I like the ambience more. Pocket friendly!!"}
{"text":"I saw a sign for this place on my way home one day and said that I would give them a try for lunch one day. Well that day came...   When I arrived I saw the cashier adjusting previous receipts so I politely asked they were behind on orders. He said there were a couple of orders in front of me but I would receive my food in 15-20 minutes m, at most. After paying for a grilled chicken wrap and fries (approx. $9)... I sat to wait. Only then did I realize that there was only one man making the food and he frequently had to step out to help the cashier because he was moving super slow and packing up orders as to-go when the customers were sitting at tables and waiting for their meals.   The two men were nice and apologetic regarding the wait times. But that doesn't change the fact that this place legit needs more people helping out!!   My wrap was thrown together the contents barely luke warm. I didn't eat my fries at all... then taste like they were sitting out without a warmer.   I'm not sure I will give them another try."}
