{"text":"We had the roast beef sandwich with potatoes and it was fresh and delicious!   Also ordered hand tossed pizza to go for family that was enjoyed as well.  Renovating restaurant and menu that is worth a visit."}

{"text":"We had a great experience here for my Grandfathers 90th birthday party. We had about 20 people In the party, and it went great. Jill was our server, and was awesome. The food was really good, great tap beer selection, which I was really surprised about.  All in all, it was a great choice to come here. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I gave it a 3 out of 5 because their is potential here. The food was okay. My husband and I each had a fish entree. I had the Boston Scrab. A cod filet with herb bread crumbs on top. Good flavor but was not cooked properly. Fish over cooked and bread crumbs on top we're mush. Decor is out dated. The restaurant part was clean and waitress was nice. Did not go in the pub area."}
{"text":"This is a great bar/pub atmosphere on an open stage weeknight. Staff is attentive and the entertainment is free and cool!"}
