{"text":"I was a huge fan of the former tenant in this space.  I had visited Grovewood Tavern, many times for brunch, dinner and Happy Hour.  I saw recently on Yelp, that the space was once again occupied, so I was curious to visit.  Definitely more of a bar than a restaurant now, different clientele, small bar menu, BUT the food was GOOD!  My husband and I both had the chicken philly sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was cooked to order, fresh veggies and handcut fries.  I am anxious to return, to try the various combination bowls offered."}
{"text":"Don't be confused by the name like I was. This is definitely not the \"Grovewood Tavern\" that it used to be. It is a new place with a new owner and a similar but different name. The high quality food that the prior owners were known for has been replaced with generic bar food. My visit was a huge disappointment."}

Location:  This neighborhood bar is nestled in the North Collinwood area....think Waterloo District.

Mood/Ambiance:  This place has a very at home-ish vibe from the moment you walk through the door.  Think Cheers.....complete with friendly comedic regulars, mostly wood decor and a Sam Malone attractive owner/bartender.

Entertainment:  It really depends on the night.  I would suggest following them on Instagram, facebook and/or calling ahead.  I have seen live bands, comedy shows, karaoke and a DJ depending on the night.  

Happy Hour: Long Islands, Margaritas & house wine $3.00. 2$ Miller and Budlights.  5:30pm-7:30pm Tuesday-Saturday closed on Sunday and Monday.

Fare:  The menu has changed for the better over the last month.  They have always offered chicken tenders, burgers, fries and wings.  Basically the food you expect at a bar.  Recently healthier options have been added.......and I love it.  There is a delicate balance to watching your weight and loving food and I have found that balance in the tex mex bowl.  There is a chicken, pork or shrimp version of the bowl.  I am in a very serious mutually satisfying relationship with the shrimp bowl.  The quinoa, the corn.....you really just have to try it!  Your tastebuds will love you for it.

Tip:  The soft chocolate chip cookies are soft and warm out the oven and the kitchen closes at midnight."}
