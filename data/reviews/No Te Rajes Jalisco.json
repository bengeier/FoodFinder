{"text":"Tiene Buen sabor la birria de Chivo y las porciones son bastantes grande. I'll definitely be coming back here! Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Very nice service. It was just very loud and I didn't like the singing lady asking for money and a man asking if I wanted to buy DVDs. Very annoying when you're trying to eat."}
{"text":"This is our third time stopping by when we come on family vacation. Every time we have had both excellent food and service. But this time was the worst experience I have ever had. I never write bad reviews but this was just over the top. When we got there our waitress seemed a little upset. When we started ordering she asked in a very pissed off mood \"what do you want?\" Every time we asked for something she would roll her eyes and walk away only to bring it like 10 minutes later. Never coming back again. You're better off trying Islitas next door, better food & service."}
{"text":"Visited while on family vacation. Food is very good, but customer service sucks!! After we were served, not once did the waitress asked us if we needed anything else. When we payed we weren't even thanked. Probably not coming back!"}
{"text":"13.95 for what seems to be a large bowl but more like a small or medium not to mention the lack of flavor. Now, the gorditas let me just say they were smaller than the already small plate for 2.95 I guess it was alright for a first timer but I'm not coming back again."}
{"text":"I got a large Birria de chivo (goat meat) it was the best so far that I have tasted in Las Vegas. We went in the morning ... Gets full fast you might wait for sitting. You can get the food to go if i'm not mistaken. They do have sitting outside. Far from my house but worth the drive for birria."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good we came to grub after the swap meet... the only thing is that it's way too hot inside we ended up eating outside.. service was quick and the food didn't take as long unlike other restaurants"}
{"text":"Don't like the food at all , waste of money super super bad food don't taste Mexican at all !"}
{"text":"food was good, we ask for Birria and it comes with enough meat and consome, the Jamaica was ok but i try better
But the service well..... everythinbg was ok until the check, that they charge us $52dls for 1 plate of birria a cerveza and 1 jamaica water, our bill was $23 dls which i took a picture before we give it back to charge. 
when i ask why from $23 dls went to $52 dls not even with the $18% tip goes that high, she kind of look and said that was my bill then after looking correctly she said that she made a mistake and charge me another bill but that it was voided, swipe my cc again with the correct amount, while charging my account a message came on her screen ans ask me to read it (\"this is a duplicate charge do you want to continue?\") i cancel the transaction and ask her to look please because her computer state that it was another charge already with my cc.

she start arguing with me and saying that she didn't charge me doble and the transaccion was cancel and charge me then the 23dls for my actual bill , while looking in her computer my name came up in another table and ask her about it she continue arguing. ask her to open that transaccion on the top said re-print receipt 
with that i ask her for the copy \"which she didn't print it \" and ask her to viod the transaccion that was not even my table or food i order 
i start calling my cc company which they had 1 transaction of $52... dls another 2 of $23 dls ask them to cxl the transaccions and i was going to talk with the person again of the restaurant 

Lady contiue saying that it was voided when my cc company was on the phone stating that they have not void the transaction , then the gentleman on the phone said they just void the transaction 
Ask her for the bill with the transactions cancel she never printed, i knew the transaction was cancel since the gentleman on my cc told me. but she never printed a void transaction then start arguing more and saying that they were not stilling. \"told her i am not arguing with you and i never said you were stilling, mistakes happens and i just wanted a printed copy just not say that it is void and you didn't charge when i have my cc over the phone and my statement said otherwise 

in conclusion  MY TIME WAS WAISTED , POOR CUSTUMER SERVICES , AND I WAS CHARGE 
ANOTHER PERSON BILL , WILL NEVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"Pesima birria , buen servicio pero la birria estaba muy mala .
Difícil de masticar 
Muy dura
Aparentemente se ve bien pero en sabor le falta."}
{"text":"Bien Rico. Mi esposo pidio birria de machito. Yo la pedi de chivo con res, la birria de machito se me iso mas buena que la mixta. Para la proxima pidire de chivo solente. Los niños mi hijo pidio enfrijoladas riquisimas. La ñina chilaquiles igual ricos.... Las porciones son grandes. Tortillas echas a mano!! Maybe las tortillas si pudieran estar mas delgaditas. El jugo de naranja era jugo fresco recien esprimido las Aguas frescas esas estavan muy dulces."}
{"text":"Well....I should of read the reviews BEFORE I came here today.

Service - Our server was a brand new one. Didn't catch her name but you could tell she was lost. She came and cleaned our table and asked us what we would like to drink. She never came back... 20 minutes came by and a second server came. She asked us for our order and drinks and guess what....she never came back as well. I'm not even kidding when I say that 30 minutes passed by and my husband flagged down a THIRD server. We asked her if she could bring our drinks because apparently the first two servers forgot or didn't care. 

Food - One word....TERRIBLE! The beans were horrible, the rice had no flavor AT ALL and the birria...no comment!! I asked for birria de res and the meat was completely hard and chewy. It had a lot of nerve and the flavor was not my cup of tea. My husband ordered birria de chivo seco...he wasn't to happy as well...

Will we ever come back? Nope."}
{"text":"Was recommended to this place and now I know why! I am very very picky when it comes to Birria! This place hit the spot! Friendly waitress's and plenty of lemon to go with it! Pow!! The only Birria I have had better was from my love Lorraine ;) Homemade!"}
{"text":"Food not that good, service was bad, place had 1 customer sitting away from my table, forgot my phone in table before I went out door I went to my table and my phone was gone.. only person near my table was waitress who had cleaned up table as soon as I got up and I know stole my phone.. I'm never going to eat there.."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, worse birria ever, also customer service uff! WORSE! 

I am giving them 1 Star because there's no \"0\" 

I will not go there if I were you!"}
{"text":"Maybe I should have listened to the reviews,but I wanted to give this place a chance since birria de res is one of my favorites ...I came here with my family last Sunday 3/25/18..we walked in and sat down outside in the patio since the weather was nice...the waitress came out gave us the menu and salsa and onion,then i think she forgot about us because she didn't come back till like 20 minuets later.. we were gonna leave but decided to stay since we were hungry and already there,we ordered birria for my girl and I..and I decided to get my daughters a burrito... the burrito was $9 so I figured it was huge and just ordered one and told them to cut it in half (my girls don't eat much).  .... burrito was small and definitely not worth $9.  Birria had more caldo than meat and definitely not worth $15....  at the end my bill was $72......2 birrias 1 burrito 2 small tacos and drinks.......food was ok.. I've had better......and service was bad....sorry but I probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I almost drive to LA for real birria but I found this place, it's a little slow service but it's great birria and I got a full order wich is $13.99 and is a lot it takes time to  finish it. Coming from New York city  they don't even know what birria de chivo or de jalisco is, now I'm in Vegas again and won't suffer from lack of jalisco food in nyc is mostly puebla food, nothing wrong with it but is different from my region Colima, jalisco, michoacan....go try it... 4* for slow service they need extra hands."}
{"text":"Usually service makes up for lack of food quality but in this case I was disappointed in both. We sat ourselves with no greeting \"hello , how are you , welcome,  nothing!? Birria d chivo I ordered pointing to the small bowl , comes out lukewarm with only two tortillas. I ask for rice that's an extra a la carte charge. She asked if I wanted something to drink I said water she brings out a bottle of sams club water I'm later charged $1.50 for it and it's not even cold. I ask to reheat my birria she throws it in microwave but takes 10 min for it to come back to my table while the lady is on the phone. Meanwhile my wife is already done eating her chilequiles con huevos $11.99. My Chivo wasnt tender as I expected a lot of fat and gristle that comes on the rib meat. I go to pay the bill she charged me for large bowl $13.99 which was really small , I wonder what the small bowl looks like maybe my 4 year old daughter cereal bowl lol. Not recommended and will not return. $37 for lunch for 2 should have went elsewhere.."}
{"text":"First of all got here and no a single waiter offered us a seat. We came outside ordered our drinks. 20 minutes pass by and no drinks ( literally). Go inside and ask for a different waiter and to see the place not so packed so it's not like they had and excuse of them being \"busy\"... we got a new waiter drinks came out and guess what?! They brought the wrong drink to me and our food came out and they didn't have the orders complete. Very unsatisfied with the service and food. Would not recommend to come here."}
{"text":"Buscando un lugar para desayunar en compañía de mis tíos . Soy estudiante de la universidad de Nevada y súper ocupada y aveces duro tiempo sin comer mi comida mexicana .  Llegamos , a este bello lugar con mesas de muchos colores . Adriana , nuestra mesera nos atendió con mucha paciencia y la mejor actitud que una persona pueda tener.   Gracias Adriana , mis chilaquiles con carne y la birria de mi tios estaban deliciosos!!! 

Nos vemos  muy pronto"}
{"text":"Been here a few times before but I think this was our last. Birria de chivo for both my husband and I. The broth was good but the meat was hard and dark and left a funky after taste.  Not a good sign when your eating goat. Too bad, we used to like this place."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Never seen a waitress consuming a beer while working the waitress should be professional during work hours and not letting a guys touch her she was also very rude she took my drink and tortillas away before I finished the rest of my meal. The birria was terrible I ordered a large bowl for 13.95 and it's small to medium portion with not enough meat it's mostly the consome and the meat was very dry like it has been reheated a couple of times and the gorditas are not worth 2.99 they are very small I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"In a group of friends  (3) first timers. We decided to try this place out. We are very happy with the Birria. Definitely recommend this. 

En un grupo de tres personas decidimos venir a comer. Estuvo muy rico la comida se recomiende. Todo muy bien"}
{"text":"The birria was ok, hits the spot.  The waiter was nice and attentive.  The chivo (goat) birria plate is 13.95, I like the fact that the bowl is shallow, because it comes with plenty of \"consome\", however there just wasn't enough meat served.  I saw a picture of their birria bowl in display on their wall, you can see the meat floating on top of the plate.  On our bowl we couldn't see any meat whatsoever on the top.  Another issue, during our meal we were approached by 2 solicitors selling jewelry and perfume, the perfume guy was super rude.  

Overall I think I would go again because the birria was alright, but I'll probably take it to go"}
