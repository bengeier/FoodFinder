{"text":"Tried the grilled rainbow trout sandwich and it was already starting to get soggy although it had just come straight out of the kitchen, so may not be good for takeout.  Unfortunately i counted only 8 seats in this cafe, so that may be your only option.  The sandwich was a little meagre on toppings with mostly mayo and some chunky head lettuce, and the sandwich doesn't come with any sides, so only good for light eaters.  The jerk chicken was tastier, but also quite meagre with the mango salsa on top.    Overall it's okay for a quick light bite after yoga which i take it is their target market, but to me doesn't even come close to the sandwiches at Fast Fresh which have greater variety of breads, toppings, the toppings are generous, and they include a nice side salad, but the closest one would be at the Eaton Centre.  Richtree and California Sandwiches are okay alternatives nearby (although not necessarily better), or there's all the mediterranean pita wrap places available in the area."}
{"text":"Also in the groupon boat.  I'll start by saying the breakfast croissant was really good and I quite enjoyed it.  That said, I'm not convinced I'll be back after I use the third of the groupons.  Firstly, their sign outside that says \"free coffee with a breakfast sandwich\" does not apply if you're using a groupon.  Such is life, I guess, but there was no fine print anywhere to suggest this and the cost of buying a coffee almost offsets the savings from the groupon.  Instead, I got a mocha to go with, but instead of the espresso he appeared to grind for the purpose, he used drip coffee, so the mocha was really unimpressive.  Oh well.  At least the sandwich was good, and I now know not to try and order coffee there when I use the third groupon I still have."}
{"text":"This place just opened and so far so good. They make their bread fresh on site and cool their own meats on site as well. The roast beef au jus is fantastic. A new regular lunch time spot for me and my co-workers."}
{"text":"I used a Groupon and ordered a turkey club sandwich and a chocolate banana muffin. The sandwich was okay, not very much mayo but the bacon was fresh. The muffin, which I ate a few hours later, was extremely stale.  Not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon that gave me three vouchers worth $10 each so I came here with my co-worker to redeem voucher number 1. He had a roast turkey club on rye, toasted, with swiss cheese. He decided it was good, but he wouldn't pay the regular price for it which would have come to $10.41 with tax instead of the $6 he gave me. I got the ham & swiss on a croissant with tomato and lettuce and I was very pleased.   I used voucher number 2 to get breakfast and lunch for later. For breakfast I had the fried egg sandwich on rye bread with cheddar cheese  and tomato and lettuce. It was $3.25 plus an extra $1.25 for the cheese so it came to $5.50 and came with a free coffee as do most of their breakfast options until 11 am. I would say this is a good price for a breakfast sandwich and a coffee and comparable to going to Tim Horton's across the street. For lunch I had the tune sandwich on a baguette with lettuce and tomato for $5.99. I must say that I liked both sandwiches and would definitely get them again.   It wasn't very busy at either times when I went, but I called ahead to place the order so it would be ready when I got there. At $5.99 for both the ham & swiss and the tuna sandwich I will definitely be adding it as a quick go to lunch option."}
{"text":"Came here with the false assumption that this place had croissants (big sign outside that said they sold the \"best\" croissants in the city). Walked in, and they had no croissants. Huh? We stayed anyway and I ordered a tea and my mom ordered a hot chocolate. The tea was fine (how can you fuck up tea?), the hot chocolate was too sweet, artificial, and before we could sit down to enjoy our drink order, we were told that we had to leave because they were closing--at 5:45pm. So my mom trashed her hot chocolate (not worth taking to-go), and we went next door to Starbucks. What a complete flop."}
