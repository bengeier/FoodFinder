{"text":"I've eaten at this establishment a couple of times, and the food is delicious! The menu feels very complete and has all the traditional favourites I look for at an Indian restraunt. The decor isn't the best but once the food comes it's irrelevant. Staff are all super nice and accommodating. Hidden gem in Chestermere if you're looking for good Indian food.  I can recommend the Chana Masala, Saffron rice, Butter Chicken and Garlic naan!"}
{"text":"Good takeout and delivery restaurant for Indian food in Rainbow falls, Calgary.  Restaurant has a few chairs and tables for a quick bite but does not have formal table service.  Price and quality are very good.  I ordered masala chicken, dal makhani and tandoori roti for 2. The chicken and dal were good.  The tandoori roti was very soft on the inside, crisp on the outside and delicious .  I plan on returning a few times to check out the other items on the menu Good first visit!"}
{"text":"This relatively small restaurant is quite good. We ordered Paneer Butter Masala and it was really very good. The garlic naan was amongst the best I've had in North America (tip - tell them to make it crisp :)  Service was pretty fast. The gentleman in the restaurant was friendly and helped us to choose the right vegetarian dish.   Perfect in short!"}
