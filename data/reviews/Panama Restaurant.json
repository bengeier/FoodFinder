{"text":"In terms of quality of the food I honestly can't complain, I've tried plenty of greek food and this is very good. Prices are a bit high, but the quality is there so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went for a work lunch with 2 others. Food was good. Staff was friendly, helpful and funny. Food was served efficiently. It's not haut cuisine but for a greasy yummy Greek place it's really quite good! Better than marathons!  I got the roasted chicken."}
{"text":"I don't like to go eat there but I must admit I LOVE their loukoumades. The food is alright, nothing special but the place can be very busy and noisy. It's not too expensive but I prefer going to other places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Panama many, many times. Very consistently good, authentic Greek food. Good service etc. I definitely recommend it. Now, after all the times I've been there I ended up trying their roasted lamb which is only available on Fridays and Saturdays (if I'm not mistaken). Lucky for me I ended up there on a Saturday. The lamb was \"to die for.\" I can't wait to go back. I've been dreaming about it. So good..."}
{"text":"I love going there for lunch with the family. The lamb chops are great, as is the chicken and greek salad. Plus it almost looks like a real Greek taverna."}
{"text":"We asked a few Greeks in Montreal what their go to place was and several mentioned Panama.   If you're wondering about the name, it was purchased by the the current Greek family. While they changed the cuisine, they kept the name. The interior is large, clean and can accommodate large groups.   We arrived on a Saturday night and it was packed solid. We didn't have reservations and we're almost turned away, so I highly recommend you call ahead. The only reason we got a table was because we agreed to leave before the next reservation, which we were fine with.   The service is casual, fast and friendly. We ordered several appetizers, including the Horta (endives). They were finished with the right amount of olive oil and lemon. Also ordered the Horiatiki salad, mixed appetizer platter and mushroom plate. All were delicious and generous portions.    The main star of the shallow are freshly grilled meats and seafood in the open kitchen. Don't forget to try the lamb chops, whole grilled fish and lemon potatoes.   Great place with great value! Perfect for families or large groups."}
{"text":"Soooo good!!!!!!!!!! Ordered chicken pita plate was fantastic!! The chicken was so well marinated , vegetable rice cooked to perfection, dark brown long french fries with a bit of their peel left on sooo good!!! We were watching every plate go out and we were drooling with aww to try everything from zucchini fries to plate of variety meats, to cheese dip, greek salad.Waiter so nice and service is excellent. Refills our glasses 3 times with water. Gave bread with butter on the table if you ask. Love seeing an old greek man in the kitchen you know its authentic and real.Delicious delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great decor, food seemed fresh, relatively generous portions, service decent, but all on the pricier side. Great pikilia, ace calmari, however, the souvlaki skewers were overcooked and pork skewer was saltier than Montreal winter sidewalks downtown. If I hadn't already filled up on said entr√©es and only ordered souvlaki, I would have given this place fewer stars (pity for those who only have the souvlaki platters)."}
{"text":"Panama is a fancy Greek Restaurant. This is NOT a Casa Grecque type of Greek Restaurant. It is more expensive then other \"fast food Greek\" locations. However its worth the price. The garden salad is amazing. I had the lamb, and it was mouth watering delicious.  The staff is really friendly, and the restaurant is nicely decorated. I had a great time."}
{"text":"Fairly disappointed. The chicken brochette plate was nothing to write home about: it was dry, small and tasteless. The sides were average at best. 15$ for a plate and it didn't come with tzatziki. Waitress was friendly for five seconds, but never came back until we flagged her down for a bill after trying for 15 minutes.  In short, the price of the food should go down or the quality/taste should go up.  On the positive side, the food looked relatively fresh. I was about to say that the restaurant was clean, but then I remembered that I had to wipe crumbs from the seat with my hands."}
{"text":"Haven't been there in a couple of years and I must say that this time the service was terrible. Your order is basically thrown on your table and the waiter is already halfway across the restaurant before you can say a word. When you finally get the hold on one you get attitude and the management too. The food is ok but the attitude and service ruin it. Sorry"}
{"text":"My mom had the chicken souvlaki platter, I had the pork. In both cases, the meat was quite overdone -- better than underdone, but extremely dried out and I could taste the charred fat.  The potatoes and rice were okay, but nothing special. The salad was pretty pathetic: it looked like sandwich lettuce with some store-bought vinaigrette slathered on top. The only other vegetable in it was carrots; no onions, no peppers, no tomatoes, no feta. Just lettuce and a few carrots -- not exactly a first class Greek salad.  The service was adequate but they seemed to be in a rush to get rid of us, despite the restaurant only being half full. The ambiance was nothing to write home about -- despite the relative emptiness of the place, they chose to seat us right between two noisy large groups of customers. In retrospect we should have asked to be seated farther away, but really, what were they thinking?  The most insulting thing was that they charged us $4.95 for tzatziki that should've come with each of the ~$15 souvlaki platters.  Overall this place was not cheap and the food did not live up to the price tag. I've had better souvlaki at chain restaurants like Nickels. I'll never be going back and would suggest you try another Greek restaurant, maybe one of the ones on Parc a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Panama is the only reason why I go back to the hood. This family-owned restaurant is one of the few places that makes Montreal a great culinary experience. Everything on the menu is a classic, made the right way."}
