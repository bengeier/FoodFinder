{"text":"Tried the Mondo Burrito (chicken). Would not recommend this to anybody. Chicken was a tasteless mush. Staff was nice."}
{"text":"I recently went to the reopened establishment (new management) and hope that they do well.  The service was excellent and I could tell that it was a family franchisee.  Slightly cheaper than mucho burrito which has been around longer in the area.  Suggestion - offer to warm up / toast the taco shells.  Takes 20-30 seconds in a toaster oven and makes them much tastier.  I wish them the best but they are stuck in a plaza that is quite far from the main road; in a corner so you'll have to be looking for them to see them."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!   I get the ground beef enchiladas every time and I have never been disappointed.     The place is clean and the staff very friendly with a great menu selection."}
{"text":"Did not care for their fast food. .do not like potatoes in our Mexican food egl burritos and tacos l like taco time much better for Mexican fast food. .have never gone back and the one nearest us on home Rd 16th Ave closed down now a new tim Hortons :)"}
{"text":"Service was very polite, but distracted.  The only seafood option at Taco \"del Mar\" was \"Alaskan fish\" which turned out to be 2 tiny frozen, breaded fish sticks that were microwaved (yes... MICROWAVED!!!) and placed atop my Cabo Salad.  The \"cilantro ranch\" dressing tasted like 1000 Island with something spicy added to it, and there was little else to the salad.  It was arguably the worst food I've ever been served in a restaurant.  Unbelievable waste of 7 bucks.  I have never left a negative review before, as I believe in giving compliments when deserved and forgiving mistakes, but this was really that bad.  Duty to warn..."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time for lunch this week, and when I asked how long this place has been open, I was surprised to find out it's been two years! There was only one girl working who was very polite, and efficient. Even though there were a few people in line, I didn't have to wait for more than a few minutes.  I made a joke to the girl saying this looks like a mexican subway, to which she replied they are owned and operated by Subway!   I had their shredded chicken burrito ($7.50) and made it a combo with chips and guacamole ($3 more). The food was pretty decent, I have had better, but for the quick service, and price I would go in again. Ingredients were fresh, guacamole is made in store."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. I got one porc and I fish taco. Both were gross. They were absolutely soggy, low quality ingredients.  The tray it was served on smelled like a disgusting old dish rag."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a taco del mar. You may have preconceived notions about what that means. I did too.  Then I came here, and realised that regardless of whether there's a jays game or not, I can actually get seated on a patio, get a pretty damn good pork burrito and two beers.   Will it get 3 stars in Toronto Life? Nope.  But are RSBG, SoCo, Aria and others in the area 5 times as good to match their price premium? Not any time I've been there.  Take it from a neighbourhood resident, if you're looking for a quick bite on a patio and a couple cold beers, this is the best deal you will ever find down here."}
{"text":"What a great place for fast food Mexican. The buritos and tacos are delicious (have had the shredded beef, shredded chicken, fish, and pork) and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Also, one of the few places that offer corn tortillas.  Their loyalty program is a nice bonus (get your card stamped for every $5 of purchase and receive a discount after 10 stamps) and now that they offer churros they are officially my favorite taco joint in Aurora.  Make sure to take advantage of their daily specials, especially Fridays: Two fish tacos, rice & beans and a pop for $5.00...can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the daily special. It is a great deal. There are many options and the food does not take much time to be ready. I went last night for dinner and had the platter. Great to have rice and beans with your meal. My friend had the chicken quesadilla and it was good to see that was nicely grilled and enough cheese in it.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Maybe there is a learning curve given how new the location is, but most of what I ordered was inedible :o(  The menu looks fantastic and clearly the concept is solid but something major is getting lost in the prep process.  The guac was the worst thing, and the fish taco I threw away because the 'fish' was an inedible brick.  No heating, grilling, broiling etc of any kind took place...just assembly. I am confused as I ordered an enchilada/taco platter.  Luckily I had a cupcake from elsewhere to chase the nightmare away..."}
{"text":"Worst food/ service i've ever experienced. First time in Toronto and we were starving so we decided to eat here. The tortillas we got for the tacos were RAW. The man proceeded to tell us it wasn't and charged us extra for no reason. Don't come here."}
{"text":"In recent years, burritos have gone through an evolution...I would say it started with the magic that is Burrito Boy and spread far and wide.  So nowadays, expectations for this flour-wrapped concoction are high.  It is in this regard that I cannot bring myself to give what Taco Del Mar calls a \"burrito\" a good review.  It was filled with potentially-canned refried beans, they were out of guacamole (mind you I was there very late) and the end result was (for lack of a better word) \"blah\".  The wrap wasn't crispy and toasted as we've become used to, and none of the flavourings particularly stood out.  I'm also not a fan of \"rice\" in the burrito - so that was a turn off.  All in all, it was tasteless and left me very disappointed.  This may have been a somewhat adequate burrito circa 1991, but not in this day and age."}
{"text":"Taco del mar is a taco place beside sherbourne and bloor. Its inside is very nice and clean. The food is normal pretty good. I have tried the tacos ,burrito,nachos and quesadilla . I would rank them in this order: 1.nachos (big enough to be a meal) 2.tacos 3.quesdilla 4. Burrito (try getting less rice)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant staff is great food is the best Mexican food I've ever had. What else do u need. Go check it out you will love it."}
{"text":"I usually only have food from Taco Del Mar as takeout.  Tonight was their chicken taco and enchilada combo with rice, sour cream and guacamole.  The chicken taco and guacomole were really good, the enchilada good, but the rice was either very dried out or not completely cooked through and barely even warm.  If we lived further away, I could understand that it had cooled off, but we're barely two minutes away.  Other than the rice, it was good and a large portion, so make sure you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Mondo Burrito (which is their Large size) was on a Sunday special for $6. That's $3 per person. It was already late for dinner so didn't want a whole sit down kind of deal.   Got the white fish (fried battered fish), and topped it our way, white flour tortilla, tomato, lettuce, guacamole, refried beans, rice, mild lime sauce, and sour cream.   The burrito felt like a 1 pound and half. They use the speed ovens to heat,  similar to the ones at Subway.  My take, not bad tasting for a cheap meal. But not amazing either compared to lets say Burrito Boyz.   I think it's an ok choice if you're deciding between this, a pizza at Panago next door, or a hotdog from the vendor at the corner."}
{"text":"If there was an option for zero stars I would give place that. I created a yelp account just so I could review this place. I have never in my life had such terrible service. Ordered a bowl without rice, basically a salad. The brown guy who was working there gave me a sprinkle of lettuce I kid you not. When I asked for more lettuce he quickly replied that would cost extra. I said okay just give me more and I got yet another sprinkle. Same with the chicken. When I asked for guacamole (its included here) he rolled his eyes and gave me a serving the size of a toonie. I walked away immediately. Literally the worst service I have ever received in my life. I only cane here to avoid the line at chipotle. Huge mistake."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting!  Had nachos and beer today at lunch with some coworkers.    Nachos were cold and completely soggy!  More like goop!  You couldn't even pick up a nacho as they were so soggy and gross.    Skip this place!"}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian burrito and it was really good, I was a bit disappointed with the hot sauce because I expected it to be hotter but with jalapenos it made it better.  The tortilla chips were a bit too salty but good overall, the queso dip (we had asked for salsa though) was good and as you would expect.  Understanding the employees was difficult and they had trouble understanding us but overall I would come again."}
{"text":"Decent enough. Got the enchilada plate. Could have had bigger enchiladas but very tasty. The food was nothing special but was quick and tasty. It was busy inside and the woman serving me was smiling and chatting  to a regular so it had a nice vibe. Living closeby it's a good place to drop in when I'm craving cheap Mexican but I wouldn't travel any distance to get there."}
{"text":"This is pretty popular downtown lunch spot on the second floor of 5th Avenue Place. They sell the usual fast \"Mexican-esque\" food like tacos, burritos, taco salad and quesadillas. The food is really good and it's a place where you can grab something relatively quick, even when the line up looks long. I had the Mondo Burrito which was delicious. It was $7 dollars which is a little expensive, but it was large and very tasty. Thought it was a fair-ish price.  It kind of bugged me that they charged for sour cream and guacomole on top of burrito price. In my opinion, that's just lame. Isn't \"Mexican-esque\" food supposed to come with \"Mexican-esque\" condiments? It's an ok place, however, if they didn't charge for said condiments I would frequent this place.  TDM closes early, have never seen them open after work so dinner here is likely not an option."}
{"text":"Makes Taco Bell seem gourmet. Gave 2 stars because they're licensed, so you can drink away the fact that you're eating dog food."}
{"text":"The food is so unappetizing that my and my friends and family made an inside joke about it.  Me: Ever been to Taco Del Mar? Them: No? Me: Well, DON'T!  It's like they formatted their restaurant after Qdoba or Chipotle. I sincerely recommend you go to those two restaurants instead of Taco Del Mar.  Never again.  1/5"}
{"text":"I was in the North Mississauga area and was looking for a new place to have a quick dinner.  Taco Del Mar sounded interesting and I decided to check it out.  The place looks like a surf shop turned taco/burrito food shack.  Interesting decor, definitely sets their Taco Bell competitors apart.  I was greeted with a friendly smile with both of the guys working the counter.  They menu was extensive from tacos to burritos.  I ordered  the fish tacos and combo sized it.  The fish tacos took a while to make as they cook the fish to order.  The tacos were ok, nothing really special.  I was not a fan of the tartar sauce they poured on.  Chips and salsa were medicore, no real flavour in the salsa, it was missing that kick.  Would I visit again?  Maybe, I would have to consider what other food options are in the area first."}
{"text":"The father/son combo that runs this place is great - super friendly and they're serving up some good healthy food.  The Mondo Burrito is usually my choice, and they'll load it up anyway you want. I always get extra Jalenpenos or Gauc and they never charge me. The kids always get the hard tacos, and they love the salsa and nachos that comes with it.  Place is always clean, never too busy (from my 6-7 times there) and is decently priced for what you get.  With McDonalds right next door to it, it's definitely the better choice."}
{"text":"This is my third time of this location. They have improved in the decor. it used to be quite minimalistic. The food is good. The staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Nice that vegetarian tacos come included with guacamole but that's about it. Nothing special in terms of taste..."}
{"text":"When I moved here from Southern California (actually just a few miles north of Tijuana - we used to get those killer taco trucks in the parking lot at work - oh how I miss those!), I thought, hey, Toronto is a diverse city, there will be good Mexican food like we had back in Cali. I was wrong. We've tried several rated as \"best\" in Toronto and left completely disappointed. So imagine my surprise when I found this place, and what is quite possibly the closest to So Cal Mexican food here. Sure, it's not perfect, but man, it's great for fast food, great for Mexican, and they seem to be the only restaurant who understands how to make a good enchilada. Please - if you guys know of a better So Cal style Mexican food place, let me know. Cos so far, this is it.   Service quick, food tasty and portions generous. Not a huge amount of seating, but eh, it's fast food. Don't expect cloth napkins. Just really tasty enchiladas you can cram in your face.   PS. Yes, we've tried Rebozos. No. So far off Mexican food that it made me sad. I also avoid all those places rated as \"good tex-mex\" because...no. That's not it either."}
{"text":"Mushy questionable protein and poor service. I had to argue to get more than rice and tomatoes in a burrito bowl."}
{"text":"Wow this place has gone downhill with a vengeance.  Used to go here twice weekly as it was affordable and pretty good.  Now can't stay further away.  Had good poisoning on a taco del mar lunch day and was suspicious but didn't 100% attribute to taco.   Now after cautiously returning I am doubled over the toilet again.  This time I should have known.  The meat was stale and cold and taco shells so ridiculously stale.  Also the employees are so forlorn looking, the manager was there once and really had a domineering manner, I can't imagine his employees are well treated.  I will not be going to this or any other taco del mar franchises again. Guess we have to wait for decent mexican somewhere mead yonge and bloor."}
{"text":"One of the worst fast food Mexican places I've been to. From a operational standpoint, they have two people working, one manning the cash register and the other preparing the food.  With the lack of staff, the one employee had to prepare food for the customers waiting in line and also prepare all of the Ritual  orders. This led to longer than necessary wait times for the food.  They have daily specials, but they are overall pitiful. I ordered the fish special on Friday. The fried white fish looked like it came from Costco and since it was warmed up in a microwave, it came out very soggy. All of the ingredients were mushy and/or overcooked. On top of all of this, the portion size was very small and not filling at all.  I think the only reason people come here is that it happens to be close to their offices and its really the only \"Mexican\" type restaurant around."}
{"text":"Love this place! I believe the only location in Toronto. There is almost no variety around Sherbourne and Bloor. Glad that this came along. Plus they have a option to make your Burrito wet! I've only seen it in pictures till the day I finally got one. It's great! Always my go to Mexican before I go home. Great staff too!"}
{"text":"Taco place for sure. They have your daily needs for a taco and churros and they're licensed to sell alcohol. They have beers like Corona, Heineken ans bud ($4 domestic and $4.50 import).   They also have daily specials: Mondays $6.50 Baja Bowls Tuesday $6.50 / 3 Tacos (your choice of meat) Wednesday $6.50 Burritos  Thursday $6.50 Taco Salad (w/ meat) Friday $6.50 Favorites w/ Fish (eg. Fish taco) Saturday $6.50 Fully Loaded Meat Nachos Sunday $6.50 Meat Quesadilas  I'd say they're better than Taco Bell but after all they're just another fast food place so don't have restaurant level expectations.   Good idea is to grab a few favourites and walk to harbour front and enjoy by the water. They do have a mini patio out front in summer times if you want though. Don't forget the churros for a sweet ending!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and the servers friendly. The beans are lard free! Plus for vegetarians like me. The burrito is standard... it's nothing special, and the flavors don't pop... but if I'm craving a burrito filled with beans and rice and guac, I can walk over to TDM. I like the price on the combo special, and the punch card for every $5 spent. (Double punches on Mondays!)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile given that I work out a mere two doors down at the local Goodlife, However eat a burrito either immediately prior or following a session at the gym has always seemed a little counter productive (I mean the burrito is a 1LB after all).  Walking in, staff were eager to assist and once i informed them that it was my first time at ANY Taco Del Mar, the owner/manager was happy to walk me through their approach to the burrito world.   As instructed it's best that you refer to their menu board from right to left to fully appreciate the \"flow\". One thing that struck me over and above other burrito purveyors was their prices. I was astounded at how much cheaper a meal here was compared to the likes of Chipotle, Burrito Boyz and others.  I went for a chicken burrito on a spinach tortilla and loaded it up with guacamole (add $1) and all the other free toppings. The guac is mixed in house daily, but to save time they do use an avocado paste prior to mixing it with all the guac accouterments.  Overall, I'd say this burrito lands about level with it's competition, so naturally I would award it a 3 star BUT given that the price was lower ($7) and the owner/manager was so patient and welcoming I'm giving them a bonus star!   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impress with Taco Del Mar.  It is a tiny shop around 4 tables.  Place was pretty dirty when we got there and there was only one other group there.  Newspaper on the floor and all around the tables.  Unclean tables with people's leftover.  Food itself didn't stand out, felt like I could make somethign better tat home.  Def tasteless and I was highly disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"I went last night for the first time, got the salad special and chicken burrito. The girl seemed to be pissed she was there at 9pm but although she was in ahurry my food took so long, burrito was cold and i mean tortilla completely raw. The Baja Salad special was a joke, two tiny burn dry pieces of frozen fish on the top not worth it. Had a pizza delivered instead. Maybe another location next time"}
{"text":"Definately a 2 with a strong hope for a 3 if they get their act together. Their problem is that Chipotle Grill is a block north and Burrito Boyz is 4 blocks North and both are far better."}
{"text":"It's good not great. Never very busy. Burritos are well priced and sized. Service is what you would expect from a guy working at Taco Del Mar.   Docked 2 stars for quality of the ingredients, looks kind of gross with the meat sitting in containers all day being scooped and served to order versus chipotle or burrito boys cooking fresh quality ingredients all day."}
{"text":"I put this rating smack in the middle. I have had  good service and some not so good. The food varies. Fish Tacos are not good; they used what looked to be a frozen fish stick. The tacos salads are great!  Tacos themselves are  right in the middle as well. The tacos are a bit over priced for the size you get. The ingredients are fresher than other chains. Overall, I will continue to go there for a taco salad and a beer. I threw an extra star on it because they serve beer!"}
{"text":"Love taco del Mar, but this is the worst location I've ever been to. Unfriendly and unprofessional service. Bathroom out of service. Food was still alright though."}
{"text":"Hit the spot! Great tacos and friendly service. Go for the guacamole for sure! We love some tacos!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with the girls from work here today and it was delicious! I had a burrito with carne asada and all the fixin's just like I like it. It's like Subway in that respect, but edible, or Chipotle, but less rigid somehow. The chips and queso were alright and the iced tea was STRONG and tasty.   The patrons were, shall we say, eclectic: from the unusual man in a business suit who danced his way out the door to \"Kokomo\" (which was playing at the time) to the grey skinned and skeletal heroin addict who combed the garbage in full sight of everyone. Eeeeep. Ah well, final memories of Tempe as I not so tearfully change jobs. Hello, NoSco..."}
{"text":"Is the rice supposed to be crunchy? It was... crunchy. Boyfriend's baja bowl was just ... salty and crunchy although reasonably okay. I ordered a fish burrito but I'm not sure if any fish made it into the burrito. Everything here tasted fine, albeit disappointing. The Price was right, though! They were also out of guacamole which they didn't mention til my burrito was half made. Meh."}
{"text":"Dudes. I spent half an hour at 1804 E Southern Ave looking for Taco del Mar and could not find it. supposedly it is in the same complex as the yoga studio and nutrition center, both of which i did find. I was totally jonesing for a taco but alas, left the Basha's strip mall quite unfulfilled.   Perhaps Taco del Mar is one of those 'members only' places, or an old timey speakeasy but with tacos. Or was there simply an invisibility cloak thrown over it yesterday? I don't know, but I am still craving a good taco."}
{"text":"$6 for two hard corn or flour tortilla tacos, sounds like a good deal if the taco itself we're a good size. Only, the tacos are really really small, kind of like two bite brownies but tacos. I won't deny that selection of meats were better than Taco Bell? They have the traditional ground beef, pulled pork, pulled beef, and chicken. The ground pork was really good, not dry and nicely seasoned. The pulled pork was tender, and definitely my favourite of the four because of its density. Not so heavy, a bit dry, but still easy to swallow when made with lots of veggies and sour cream. They sell beer here, If y'all don't know, I love my beer! $4.50 for Import and $4.00 for domestic. Tacos and beer, who would have thought? The owners we're adorable, very happy and informative when it came to my 99 questions about the meats. The restaurant was clean for a fast food/takeout  restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not writing this review to be mean, but I truly disliked this place. The place needs a facelift, it's struggling in comparison to any of the other places in close proximity- and yes I understand it's much cheaper. I tried it on a Tuesday when they even had a special, so it was cheaper than usual even. The decor is a little bit of a timewarp, and it wasn't very clean- there was 1 person in the place; usually a major red flag but hey 2 tacos for like 5.99 what the heck? Then I realized it was 7pm, so I almost walked off. I was drawn to a sign that was implying there food was somewhat healthy. Wrong. Now for the bad part- the food. Really sad and bland, reheated food. Those tacos were bad, and I'm not very picky. The beans might have been the most pathetic thing I've ever tasted, and were a little burnt from sitting in that pan all day. How do you mess up beans if you're a Mexican restaurant? I guess the 1 star should go to the nice employee who nobly served me the jail food. He had a very defeated look, as if to plead with me to RUN. He was nice though- he would be wise to apply at one of the many stellar places right in tacos del mar backyard. If I was the owner of this establishment I would probably renovate and reinvent the joint quite a bit, the rent can't be cheap in this area and there is quite the competition."}
{"text":"Honestly it wasn't that good, had some favour but meh. I had large burrito and for the price I had bigger and more filling at big bite burrito or mexican boy.   It was wrap odd that it fell apart on me. Mine been the liquid making the it too soggy, anyways probably won't be back, price or food isn't appealing"}
{"text":"ok.. the location is very important in this review!!  I love this location. One.. the service is great for a fast food place.. you always feel as though you got your monies worth.   I love the mondo burrito - it keeps you filled for HOURS. My other fave is the two enchilada platter.. for fast food this is so refreshing.. it just seems a little more authentic and definitely much more tastier than the Taco-Time close by.   You gotta try this place at least once.. be careful with the hot sauce as it's quite spicy.. and the GUAC -- mm sooo goood!   like I said.. I like this location.. but i've tried one by sunrdige mall.. I found then to cheap out on the meat and just didn't taste as good.   I'd say be ready to fork out about $10.. but that's the same amount you'd spend at the Edo's next door.. and Mcdonalds on the other side? I'll pass.   Ps. go with an appetite."}
{"text":"I love both the owner of this place, and the food.   The owner is a funny, great and caring guy. Every time I go to Taco Del Mar, I'm really impressed about how welcome he makes you feel and how hard he is trying to make his business work.   His food is really yummy, and a great price to boot.   I LOVE the shredded beef taco.   I tried the Nachos today, and they were okay - wishing I had gone with the Taco's (Yumm!)   We have had a salad there too -- another good choice.   If you are looking for some good food, at a good price, with some good mo-jo to boot; please head over to Taco-Del-Mar!"}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican so I went here. Great price for the amount of food you get!! The only guy working was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Wow, this is only the 2nd time Yelp misled me.  Before Yelp had a high rating for a place that I found sub par, while I think Taco Del Mar here is underrated.  It's very clean, have lots of fresh ingredients, have a variety of platters/combinations, enchiladas and daily specials.  I had the Friday Fish Taco (2 tacos) special, and decided to get one hard shell and one soft shell.  There toppings looked so fresh.  I got one with guac (extra $1) and one without.  Both of them were absolutely delicious.  Verdict: best TeX Mex place near the area."}
{"text":"The popular Tex-Mex chain that had their beginnings in the Pacific Northwest has officially opened their second location in Toronto's downtown core.  Good selection of tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, and other sides makes this somewhat of a lower cost Chipotle alternative.  Food and service is good, and I didn't taste cilantro in my food.  Busiest hours tend to be weekday from 11:00am - 2:00pm, and the lunch crowd tends to be mainly employees from Rogers and those working at the office buildings across the street.  Rogers employees get a 10% discount if they show their employee ID."}
{"text":"Chicken Burrito Guys - completely changed my opinion on the food here!  I still had a hard time understanding the staff, but they are super polite."}
{"text":"It's fast, it's good, it comes swaddled in foil so you can unwrap and eat and unwrap and eat and unwrap...and...eat. More customizable than Chipotle, with options for vegetarians and vegans to boot, it's a Taco del Mar burrito! Hooray!"}
{"text":"So today I went to Taco Del Mar to get something small (Chips and queso with a drink) This Cashier that works there for a while (Brown girl with thick accent) was slow even though I been there a few time, but this time was the last straw. Does not seems like she knows what she is doing even after all this time. Food taste decent, but service is bad. Short lunch break and made me wait for long time (3 person before me took around 20min just to pay (not including making the food time)) Get better employee/ cashier plz. Wait + Cashier attitude made me lost all my appetite"}
{"text":"I just went for the grand reopening and had a free large steak burrito(usually $7.00). Small is $5.50 good fair pricing. Score! First off anything free in this capacity I'm Leary of,but the new owner went all out in his approach to draw the neighbourhood business. Hats off to him for absorbing today as a loss-leader. I had the steak burrito stuffed with rice,black beans,pico de gallo,lettuce&sour cream on a flour tortilla.  The steak was moist & seasoned well and the other items were fresh. It was stuffed the way a burrito should be! Score another point(cause when I go to mucho burrito depending on who you get they skimp on the filling). Anyway back to Taco Del Mar, I hope they survive this time; based from my experience today they should. After all the other locations are known to be good.  We now have 3 Mexican cafe style resto's in the same block which should prove to be an interesting vie for business. I am giving 4/5 stars today based solely on the quality & taste & friendliness of TOday. I will go back to assess it again & see if they play Mexican music like mucho burrito( which is one of the draws for me-~makes it Mexicana atmospheric; or some kind of music Cali surf stuff even."}
{"text":"Over the weekend I took my bike out and road the canals towards Camelback Road.  I stopped at Taco Del Mar on Camelback and 40th Street.   I sometimes stop in the middle of my ride to have lunch at this location.  I am always satisfied with the tacos.  I got three tacos - chicken and shredded beef.  The food is light and tasty, yet simple without all of the fillers (e.g. cheddar cheese and sour cream).  I always enjoy stopping here when I have the chance.   The atmosphere is simple with a surfer theme and a television in front.  The portions are modest - not too heavy, not too light.  The salsa selection is very good with green and red salsa in various strengths.  Reasonably priced at about $5.00 to $8.00 per person.  A great stop for a simple and fulfilling lunch."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going, but I'm very disappointed. The ingredient quality, especially the meat seems very poor. The service is friendly, but the food is bland, the the serving size isn't a great value. As much as I am not a fan of big chains, I would go to Chipotle before Taco Del Mar any day. There are much better options for Mexican."}
{"text":"I come here for their chicken taco salad, you could say I'm a regular haha.  For a meal under 10 dollars (including guacamole), this place is on point. The service is fast, the food is consistently good, and they even have specials on certain days.  My only negative criticism is that they use iceberg lettuce for the salad, no nutritional value there."}
{"text":"After dealing with a 20 minute line for food (you can tell the area is ravenous for more food options), I ordered a Pork Carnitas Mondito Burrito combo. The burrito was decent but I couldn't understand why I could taste cilantro when asking for no cilantro.  When eating the nachos and salsa side dish that came with the combo, I realized that their salsa has cilantro in it (at least the medium salsa anyways). So even if you don't like it, you're essentially stuck with it unless you go with a sauceless burrito. I guess if cilantro is your thing than this might be a good burrito, but I was underwhelmed in the experience and doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I almost gave them one star  but the food wasn't bad. The service is horrible. I was third online the first group their food. the second person ordered his food when they got to me the guy didn't take my order and went to ring out the first group. then when he started to began taking my order he stopped to go make the first groups things. Once he came back I ordered.  when he passed to the second person she stop making my stuff to go to the back to replenish things that had nothing to do with her section then she came back finished My order. After that I was passed on to last Girl to Check out. she then went to the beginning process start making people's food so literally the 4 people after me orders were completed before I paid. Not to mention the two people that were in front of me were gone before rice one grain of rice touched my burrito."}
{"text":"I think 2.5 stars would fit this place. Didn't try their tacos but had the quesadilla. Wasn't bad but wouldn't recommend anyone going out of their way for this place. They have specials each day which makes for some cheaper eats."}
{"text":"I'm probably giving the place an extra star for the customer service but I think that's fair, right? I used to work in the same complex and was a regular to say the least. I'm also quite proud that I managed to turn a few co-workers onto the place and urge them to try it over the same old, same old over at Subway.  At any rate, it's a very decent mission-style burrito and I was glad to have it as an option, before there were many in the area. We now have more than a few but I still think it's better than Mucho Burrito, BarBurrito and Taco Bell if not quite as good as Fat Bastard or Burrito Boyz. I'm not in the area as much anymore but it's still more than decent grub and the staff is still as friendly as ever, bumping it up from a three to a four star for me."}
{"text":"The Sevice was really nice, this kid very respectful and he got the order right, the hit sauce was very hot and i loved it. But the food, I can live without, nothing really that make me wanna go back."}
{"text":"Skip this place. I waited in line for a few minutes as there was only one employee at the counter. By the time I was at the counter and it was my turn to order, I'd already spent too much time waiting in line so I decided to stick with it despite seeing how stale everything looked. There was a dried crust/film on top of and around the sides of almost every dish of beans and meat. I ordered a large chicken burrito. The chicken contained a lot of cartilage. The chipotle sauce was watery and tasteless, as was the sour cream which came out of a squeeze bottle and definitely didn't have the consistency or taste of sour cream. I asked for medium-hot salsa, but the only choices were hot and mild. The hot salsa was barely mild. THEY WERE OUT OF CILANTRO!!! Finally, they didn't toast the tortilla before or after wrapping so it ended up a soggy, raw, chewy mess. Oh, and the \"large\" burrito was about 5 inches long and very thin - not large by any measure. It takes some nerve to serve this up to paying customers. Nothing against the people that work there, but the owner or franchisee really needs to step up and get things fixed. This is absolutely heinous. I wasn't made physically ill, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I work in this plaza and have always wanted to come in. Yesterday I was craving a burrito so I decided to finally go. O-my-god. Delicious is all I can describe! I got the chicken burrito, skip the beans on a whole wheat wrap. It tasted very yummy. It was definitely a more basic taco/burrito place for sure, since i'm used to the deliciousness of burrito boys. However they did not disappoint. Just the right amount of spice on the chicken. The lady who served me was super nice and even gave me a discount for working in the same plaza!  I'll definitely go again on my lunch break in the near future! :)"}
{"text":"slightly better than TACO BELL.... not saying much! Might be owned by Subway; feels like the 'subway version of tacos'. boring, bland. A one time experience; so many better options in the city, unfortunately Bloor/Sherbourne is a DEAD corner/spot, so you would have to head to Yonge St for something decent."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Love their specials. They customize your dishes so thats an added bonus. The only complaint would be that sometimes their rice doesn't seem fresh. It seems hard, like its been out there for hours."}
{"text":"I absolutely luv this place! Customer service is fantastic- seriously a great team works the lunch time rush. I'm always greeted with smiles and the friendliest service.  Food is delicious and very tasty. I crave it and try to head over there at least once a week because it's so awesome. I'm a big fan of the pulled beef soft tacos- delish! I highly recommended it and tell everyone I know about them."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is still open, much less my having eaten there out of desperation today; I was in the shopping center, starving, and figured the last time I ate here 3 years ago that it couldn't be that bad... well, was I ever wrong. 3 years ago I had a hard time figuring out what to order because I'd never been there and all I remember is wanting to avoid any of the 'wonder-meat' sitting in the steamer.  I just got a taco salad, and it wasn't very good.  ANYTHING you order here (other than what came out of a can) is pure slop. Any meal will be swimming in soupy stuff because one look at their meat and ALL of it's literally swimming in liquid. The guy behind the counter continually kept stirring each bucket of meat, which looked like soup, as though stirring it would keep it fresh.  When you choose a meat, a spoon/strainer combo's used in order to minimize the water you get with your meat.  Once you get your platter of gruel and sit down, as you eat, your plate's just swimming in soupy crap left over from all the meat being steamed all damned day. The menu is so limited that you just stand there wondering WTF to order - it all looks the same, probably because it IS all the same:  TOTAL SLOP.  Like I said, it's just mind boggling how this place does ANY business much less how it stays in business.  But hey, they CATER!  This place honestly makes Taco Bell look like a family owned 5-star restaurant.  Do yourselves a HUGE favor and never ever eat here.  If you do eat here after reading this, the ol' phrase \"I told you so\" will be spinning around your head, and you'll feel like a total idiot to boot.  The only positives I can say about Taco Del Mar is:  - the guy working behind the counter was nice as nice could be; and - the fresh vegetables (lettuce, Pico de Gallo etc) were in fact, fresh.  Just don't get anything with meat in it -or- if you want meat, ask the server to put it in a separate bowl so you don't wind up with half a cup of brother (or whatever) mixed in with the rest of the slop.  I think this place would serve the local restaurant community best if it was kept around to show others how NOT to run a food business -- if you find yourself needing to get some shopping done at Fresh 'n Easy or a Brazilian wax job next door, atop in Taco Del Mar and take a good look around.  Once you've looked the menu over and get a good gander at the meat behind the glass, ask yourself how in the world this place has stayed open as long as it has... commercial property around there ain't cheap by any stretch, so I just can't figure it out.  There sure aren't a whole lot of Yelp reviews, I think once people do find their way to Taco Del Mar and decide to grab something to eat, maybe once they're finished eating they know they will never return so it's not worth Yelping about."}
{"text":"$8.50 for two chicken tacos with chips, cheese, and medium drink. The tacos are pretty good. My only qualm is that the tacos are stuffed so much which makes them a bit difficult/messy to eat. Other than that the food is tasty. The chips were served warm which was nice. I wouldn't go nuts over the tacos here, especially if you've have had tacos at an authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This Taco Del Mar location just opened within the past month or so. I'm not sure if this Taco Del Mar is associated with the american chain at all since the take away menu looks like it was printed off by someone's personal home printer.   I digress, back to the review.   The restaurant was clean (As it should be since it just opened) and has just a few tables available for seating.   I ordered the Mondo Burrito (vegetarian styles), this comes with the Tortilla, seasoned rice, refried beans, cheese, lettuce, Pico de Gallo and guacamole ($7). The beans were warm but the rest of the burrito was cold ... refrigerator cold with way too much guacamole. Don't get me wrong I loves my guac but the ratio of the fillings were clearly off. Sorry not much else I can say about it other than it is what you expect it to taste like, nothing more, nothing less.   My Hubby ordered the Mondo Tacos which comes with 3 tacos, within the tortilla there was meat, cheese, lettuce and pico de gallo ($7) and again all the tacos (meat included) were cold. Also not much to say here, other than it is what you expect it to taste like, nothing more, nothing less.   You are probably wondering at this point, why the 2 stars??? I was going to do 1 but, I understand that new restaurants sometimes need to get the kinks out. I believe that this may be one of those occasions. But maybe it isn't, for now they get the 2 stars, if I decide to go back I'll be happy to update my rating, but for now the 2 stands.   For now my review much like my feeling for the restaurant is lukewarm, like the food. I would rather go to taco bell (and that's saying a lot) then to darken the doorstep of Taco del mar in the next little while."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend. Extremely slow (but well-meaning) service (20 minutes for 4 burrito combos to go), which explains why they were empty at lunch time and the people who came after us, left.  Burritos, bowls, salads, tacos, quesadillas and nachos available.  Plus some breakfast versions os burritos, bowls and quesadillas on the menu (the baked goods, a cinnamon roll and a muffin, did not look fresh or appetizing at lunch).  Decor is cute surf/ocean, but while the name and decor imply seafood, they list fish on the menu but when we inquired about the meats, fish was not one of them.  Some of the meats looked like the top layer was dried out and one was really oily.  It's quite pricey for what you get.  One scoop of meat looked to be about a quarter cup (2 ounces?) and was pretty sparse. That was the Mondito for $5.50 ($6.25 for steak).  For an additional $2 you can add extra meat.  The Mondo, which is $7.00, has a bigger tortilla and might have more meat.  It's $2.50 or $3.00 more for a combo.  While I thought the chips were fine and the toppings were good, all 4 of us were disappointed in the amount of meat (or lack of) in our burritos.  My friend has already been posting about her negative experience on Facebook.  Don't think we'll be going back.  Positive:  unlike Mucho Burrito, the guacamole is included."}
{"text":"I can't even give this place a two! Dry food, dry rice, old tomatoes and the lettuce was the only fresh item.  The corn tortillas were dry and not heated so they crumbled before we could eat. Never again"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I ordered a chicken quesadilla. The chicken looked like slop. More like pull pork but more wet you could squeeze a cup of liquid out of the meat alone. It had no flavor, very bland and wet. The food looked like it has been sitting there all the day. The vegetables has gone bad and the sauce was spoilt. What a waste of money. I should have gone back for a full refund."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday Feb 12th at noon, and there was no one in the restaurant, that should have been my first hint.  Ordered two soft tacos, beef, and chicken.    Meat quality is similar to Taco bell = bad news.  The pulled chicken and runny salsa made my taco a dripping mess.  Management / staff were helpful, and friendly, which was nice.  Will not go back.  Go to mcdonalds next door, or edo, or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Meat was definitely not carne asade (as advertised) but instead pot roast. I know this is a predominantly white area, but lying to customers about the type of meat being served doesn't seem right.  I expected them to have a sauce bar (like most Mexican restaurants do) so that's a big disappointment. However I cannot complain about the price, it was extremely affordable in comparison to other Mexican establishments.   Note to future customers: their idea of an enchilada is a taco with green sauce on it-- not an enchilada, enchilada."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst run restaurants I've ever been to.  The customer service is really bad.  I was in line to order by burrito and as I place my order, one of the servers runs over and tell my server to stop doing what she's doing and take the order or some other person who comes out of nowhere.  Not sure if there's some priority service in place.  After that, the server messed up what I wanted a couple of times, including forgetting to put the sauces.  The worst came when they transferred the burrito to the grill.  They had a weird system of moving the burrito from the original foil wrapper that they started with to another wrapper that was used ahead (usually covered with sauce and spills from the first burrito.  It was just odd.  Finally, when the person wrapped by burrito, it was rushed and it broke before it was even put into the foil.  All in all - the food is a bit below average and coupled that with really bad service, I don't think I'll ever go back.  I've been here a couple times now to try and give it a shot, but each and every time has been a disappointment."}
{"text":"East Indians making Mexican dishes.  My world has turned upside down.  'Wet' Mondo Burrito is the way to go.  It is full of awesome.  You get to choose from black beans or refried,    Beef, chicken or etc.  It also has rice, hot sauce, cheese, and for extra sour cream and guacamole.  It's one hell of a burrito.  Give your coworkers notice because it creates a very close version of mustard gas when it goes through you."}
{"text":"Want MICROWAVED fish for your fish taco?? GO HERE!!!  This place had a dealfind coupon for $12 which gave us 2 burritos, 2 chips and salsa/cheese and 2 drinks.   I ordered the fish while the wife ordered the carne asada. I was shocked that they dont cook their fish to order like burrito boyz / fat bastard do .. but they microwave fish fingers that look like your grocery store variety.   Taste was so-so. Something I can make at home.   NEVER COMING BACK .. coupon or no coupon."}
{"text":"I dig Taco del Mar.   It reminds me of a few of the burrito places I used to frequent in the Bay Area when I lived out there. They even have the option for Mojado Style (i favorito) which takes the finished burrito and soaks it in enchilada sauce and melts cheese on top. It's just as tasty as it sounds.   If you're on the run. it's easy to pick up a burrito to-go in foil and eat it while you drive. (Though, it might be a good idea to sport a napkin over any sensitive clothing items. I'm not good about this.)  Cheap burritos . . .  ain't nothin wrong with that!"}
{"text":"More like 2.5  Had the veggy burrito for $8,69 with a drink. Taste was decent. Price reasonable, but was Luke warm. I asked for double toasted so tortilla should be warm and toasted. It was more like \"soggy and almost cold\".  Nothing I would rush back for. Barely acceptable lunch."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. It's such a simple yet fantastic burrito that you will get with just the right amount of ingredients. It can be a little pricey for \"fast food\" but it's definitely worth it if you're in the mood for a good burrito!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a meal here while staying at the Delta Hotel nearby. There was a heck of a line with the nearby Convention Center hosting 2 popular events but the staff did a great job of dealing with it. My meal: Pork burrito and 2 fish tacos. Not bad, liked the burrito more than the one I got from Chipotle the night before. Nothing mindblowing or anything but if you're craving some \"Mexican\" food and you're in the area, it'll get the job done!"}
{"text":"Low quality - high quantity. The lunch specials are worth their value. Taco Del Mar offers a customer loyalty card; after 10 lunches, you get $5 off your next meal. The servers are friendly but they can't speak English properly, giving it an authentic foreign experience in terms of communication!"}
{"text":"I came here because I was looking for a new fast serve burrito joint to try out and I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the service and quality of food I received. The guy who served me was very nice and had quite the sense of humour! The burrito itself was quite good, and better than I expected from a place like that. There wasn't any hint of dryness or chalky-ness, which personally I find hard to avoid at other burrito places. Definitely give this place a check if you want a change from the likes of Burrito Boyz or Barburrito."}
{"text":"I've seen this place for a while and have been meaning to try it out.  I didn't realize it was a chain....it has more the independent look.  It seems like a rubio's knock off.  Food wasn't as good, but a decent alternative.  Prices were average.  Service was very friendly.  Overall, it was decent."}
{"text":"I had the tacos today. The meat wasn't too bad but the sour cream and chipotle sauce were extremely watered down same worth the nacho cheese.  I felt as if the store is not doing very well financially, ni toilet paper in the washroom, sauces being watered down, empty pop fridge etc....  what would you expect when serving a mediocre product.  Never going back"}
{"text":"I was really disgusted with this place. I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 12:30 PM and there was no one (not exagerating)  there.  But we were hungry and hot so we stayed. I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MAR...just frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it.   It's breaded and precut...couldn't they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasn't completely processed?  The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didn't like at all. My husband's chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria.  The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid.  I think they let the tea bags go bad or something.  Gross and how annoying that they  don't have seafood.  Wahoo tacos from La Jolla please come here to AZ!!!"}
{"text":"chipotle's a block away, do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"Ok...I love this place.  Food is good and flavourful and great prices.  The people who work here are always super friendly and tend to make you feel like they have known you for years.  If you are looking for tasty inexpensive food and amazing service you will find no where better."}
{"text":"asked for pork carnita and beef. makes two pork canitas. i rectify him. i ask for all toppings except chili peppers.  asks me again. sure i tell him.  i then see him put chili peppers on. no chilis pls. looks down in confusion! and just takes a BIT of the chilis off.  also tortilla stuck to the foil, added to the crappiness of the taco making it damn messy. would have also liked the taco grilled since the tortilla was all soggy tasting.  TLDR: felt like i was talking to a wall.  three times to make an order. serious? food sucks here too.   do not recommend."}
{"text":"Cheap. Average taste. Not the best mexican food though. Good for days when you don't want to eat McDonald's and want something cheap. But their taco bowls are delicious and a must try. Wish their salsa was a little hotter."}
{"text":"I'm 52, I've lived in AZ for 40 years and this was: THE WORST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE EVER EATEN! Prison cafeteria's surely have more sophisticated fare. It appears that everything must be sourced from a North Dakota Presbyterian luncheon. The worst chips, salsa and queso and thinner than water (is that possible? Apparently so! I even gave them back the queso and they offered to give me more and I said no thank you, but they said they'll give me some that was not watered down. Seriously? Who waters down cheese sauce? The three slow, unmotivated, cell-phone using staff made the whole experience just plain crappy. Fire the lot of them, close the place down and start fresh."}
{"text":"Found out about this business through Yelp and I decided to give it a shop. I was very satisfied! It wasn't too busy, but the food was good and the service was friendly. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were delicious. One of my co-workers had the steak tacos and said they were even better. The owner took special interest to come and talk with us (since they weren't too busy), and I would most definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Disgusting, spongy tacos. For some reason, they wrap them in tin foil, which sticks to the soggy tortillas and makes it very hard to unwrap them intact. Way too much sauce, which spills all over the damn place. The \"meat\" (beef in this case) barely tasted like meat.  Walk a few more minutes up to Chipotle (by way of Lower Simcoe, up to Front) for a much higher-quality product."}
{"text":"I have been to this Taco Del Mar once before and went again this weekend, so I felt it was time for a review.  First of all, TDM is a great middle ground between Taco Bell and Chipotle. Its quick and easy, and they have a wide variety of options.  This particular location is pretty cool. The decor inside is fun and it has been very clean both times I have been.  They have veggie options and use lard free beans. I always get the veggie mondo burro and have not been disappointed at all. They are a great size with great flavor.  Another cool thing they have is an iced tea machine. You can select four different tea flavors from the machine, including green tea. They also have a little salsa bar with a few different salsa options and jalapenos."}
{"text":"Five coworkers and I came here a few days after they opened.  We all agreed on a few things : 1) The food was cold.  Chicken, beans, even after heating the burrito on the grill, the fillings were cold.  2) Service was awful.  It was close to impossible to understand the people making the burrito, and they even seemed confused as to who should be doing what.  3) Food quality was so-so.  Portion was decent."}
{"text":"It seems that a lot of people have had bad experiences at Taco Del Mar. I can't say that my experience was so bad.  After returning from living in Mexico for awhile, I stopped by Taco Del Mar for a quick lunch to go. The service was super friendly and they were really good with the crazy drunk that was loudly questions about every bloody food choice available to her. The selection is good and the portions are large! And right now they have a lot of good deals and coupons you can take advantage of.   But at the end of the day the food was good. Nothing special, but still decent. I know I'm biased from having just left Mexico, but I still think that by Canadian standards, the food is nothing spectacular but will fill any lunch cravings."}
{"text":"I was working in the area for the day and needed a place to grab some quick lunch on 130th, the land of the soul sucking power centre. I'd been made wise that Taco Del Mar actually includes the word \"vegan\" on their menu, so I went in, expecting a mediocre (though vegan friendly) burrito. And, mediocre is what I got.  It was eerily dead, to the point where not even all of the seating was set up. I was given blank stares by the two employees standing behind the counter as though they had never seen another soul in their lives. I was not greeted. I ordered a vegan mondo burrito.  The staff member applied my selections very wrecklessly. However, he was at least knowledgable that I couldn't have \"meat or cheese\" and repeated this to himself more than once. The toppings I selected were guac, rice, black beans, lettuce, salsa, hot sauce and it was packed full. The total came to just over $8, with no sides or drink. The negligent staff member did not even wait until I was finished paying for my order to grab his phone and start texting. He did not offer me my receipt or EVEN WISH FOR ME TO HAVE A GOOD DAY. I would have stayed in and eaten and read, but I instead headed back to my office as I felt so damn awkward. My burrito, though full of seemingly great stuff, tasted like hate a little bit and was not super satisfying or flavorful. The rice tasted like Uncle Ben's and there was way too much of it, though I rarely expect much from fast food the once a year that I eat it."}
{"text":"My wife and I and I tried this place when it first opened. I was very unimpressed with how slow the service was and how small their burritos were for the price. Also my wife found a hair in her burrito. When I mentioned it to the staff all they said was sorry and that was it they did not give us our money back or make a new one. I will never go back to this place again. Trust me if your in pickering and want a good burrito dont go to this place go to fat bastard burrito at whites and hwy # 2 way better food and value."}
{"text":"If you need food on the fly, this is a great place to get it.  It's fast, it's Mexican and it's cheap!  You'll find all the normal choices here, including tostadas, burrito's, quesadilla's, chips etc. etc. but you can customize them to your liking, which is nice.   I've never had to wait long for my food either, which helps if you're on your lunch hour and want not only enough time to order your food, but to eat it too!  I'd recommend this place for a fast, tasty lunch that won't put much of a dent in your wallet."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Ordered fish tacos...and its literally a fish stick thatsbeen frozen in a taco shell w cold cabbage n warm fish sauce. The worst"}
{"text":"No this place isn't fancy, but they do make good veggie burritos (and guac isn't extra for once) at a very reasonable price! I've been here a handful of times while working at events at the Metro Convention Centre and I've always enjoyed my lunch!"}
{"text":"I really didn't enjoy this place. I went to the one at Fashion Square. I found it to be the worst quesedilla I ever had. I dont know how you mess up a quesedilla, but by-golly they managed to!"}
{"text":"As far as lunch options goes, this is fast but not affordable or great.  So of the lunch trifecta, it's a pretty bad option for the Mississauga corporate area.  This particular fast food place is in the same plaza area as Walmart and Starbucks.  Getting in is easy... getting back out means you have to fight the traffic of the other places while trying to preserve your sanity.  I got the fish taco option and I was really disappointed in it as I've heard good things out of my US counterparts.  It's small, dry, and overall flavourless.  It's also a bit on the pricier side for fast food.  Sure, there was a lot of vegetables in it (tomato, lettuce, olives and random other things) but none of them tasted like they're supposed to. I guess they were all underripe and just tasted like ... water.    The restaurant is clean and the food came quickly after ordering but that's the only real positive to this place.  Not a lot of people were in the restaurant and most people just did take out.  If you're wanting Mexican food in this area, I HIGHLY recommend El Sombrero over this place any time"}
{"text":"Another chain restaurant that gets a better than passing review.   Taco del Mar is a block from my office--one star They're always friendly and get my order right--two stars Today the person behind the counter recommended a great burrito--three stars They offer a wide variety of average Mexican faire at reasonable prices--four stars  Some people may not agree with me, but Taco del Mar is what it is, fast food. When I choose to eat here it's because it's convenient, not because they offer the best Mexican food in the valley. It fills a need. That's why I give them four stars. If they had crappy food and crappy service it would be another story!  If you're on Camelback at 40th and you're hungry, pull in to Taco del Mar."}
{"text":"Good food, but I can't really justify giving any fast food restaurant more than 3 stars.  Wednesdays seem to be pretty busy around noon because they have a daily burrito special.    They will ask you if you want to add guacamole for $1.  If you're interested in an add on, I would pass on the guac and ask them to \"make it wet\" when you order a burrito.  They will add enchilada sauce, queso, and shredded cheese on top of the burrito.  Note: you will need to eat it with a knife and fork, but it is so good!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten a mouthful of sand, but if I did, I can't imagine it would taste much different than the rice and beans served at Tacos Del Mar.   If it is the goal of TDM to produce the most bland tasting Mexican food on the planet, they are doing a pretty good job.  In addition to the rice and beans, not much can be said for their dry, flavor-free steak as well.  If you're into eating cardboard, I suggest you try TDM's steak tacos. You'll be in heaven.  I'd give the place one star if it weren't for the friendly employees. Those bastards."}
{"text":"If anyone's from the US and been missing Chipotle, here's your answer. Went in really hungry and loved the burrito bowl. Tasty and fast Mexican food, give it a try."}
{"text":"Taco del Mar is an ok place for Mexican food. It's the only Mexican take out place that I know of nearby so it is an ok place to go for a taco or nachos, but it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Went by for a quick Sunday lunch. I got the regular shredded beef burrito and my wife 2 tacos, one chicken and one pork. The staff was very friendly and the food was prepared quickly. My wife loved the tacos, but I wasn't as keen on the shredded beef. Will definitely go back for a chicken or pork burrito. Lots of good daily specials too!"}
{"text":"Isn't surf and turf normally steak and seafood?  Yea.... their surf and turf was a fish taco and chicken quesadilla.  Mind you - that totally hit the spot, but surf and turf??  Anyhow, this is an awesome spot.  Lots of great options.  They even had a pork mole burrito!!!  Who has that?  I just recently noticed it and I'm totally getting that next time.    Fast food/healthy mexican is something we could all use a bit more of in our lives if ya ask me - but so is their service.  The kid was so freaking NICE to me I thought someone from their corporate office must be in town.  Yea, THAT kind of nice.  And yet, he was a kind of mellow that most folks don't get naturally.  It could have been all the cool regge tunes giving him some flash backs.  All I care about is he was nice and he made one heck of a quesadilla."}
{"text":"The staff cared very little. The food was not completely covered when we walked in, which would explain why everything but the fish was cold when we sat down to eat. The service providers didn't know what types of beer were available (even though it was behind them). To explain- my partner asked for a lager and the service professional didn't know what that was. And that would have been fine, except she was not polite.  We are from another country, so I was looking through the Canadian coins in my hand to pay for a small item.  When I was paying for this spare bag of chips, she said, \"just give me the dollar,\" as I looked through my change, trying to identify the dollar. Impatient... when no one else was in the restaurant. I had tipped $3 on the bowl I had bought just 10 minutes before. So I didn't understand why she behaved that way, like I was inconveniencing her.  We both have been in the service industry for more than 4 years. The service here baffled us. The bathroom was gross too. Odd that this place can stay open downtown if this is regular for the location."}
{"text":"Ah. This isn't anything great, but it's not horrible. It's a nice and CLEAN taco shop on 40th and Camelback (NWC) that has a good seleciton of tacos (duh), burritos, and basically everything else that is Mexcian/American. The tacos are good sized and the salsa is tasty. The service is friendly and the food is good. Solid 3 star review for me."}
{"text":"So...I was hungry for Mexican food, more specifically a burrito.  For being in the Southwest and so close to Mexico, I am constantly disappointed with the quality of offerings in the PHX valley.  Once you eliminate the local sit-down joints (quality places like Los Olivos) and the chains (don't make me say their names) there is not much left.  The lunch truck crews can be good, but are often inconsistent and the Filiberto's (and the like) just don't do it for me....so....I thought I would give this place a shot.  Yeah, I get it its a chain.  Yeah, it has a similar experience to the \"burrito chain that shall not be named\"...but this place is good.  I got chips and salsa (well, pico de gallo) and a veggie burrito (really a bean and cheese burrito with fixin's).  The food was good, clean, tasty and generally yummy.  It is located in the shopping center with a Sprouts Market.  Okay, let me give it a review run-down:  food:  good service: good, polite, nice price: under $10 for burrito and chips/salsa decor: cheesy, literally because it is yellow would I go again:  yes, maybe in a few weeks should you check it out:  if you are in the neighborhood"}
