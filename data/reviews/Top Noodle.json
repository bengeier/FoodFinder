{"text":"This place has the BEST pho saté in town. The broth is to die for. Always has great customer service. Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  The Pho Sate Beef (#23) is awesome.  I have eaten this dish at probably 30 different Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary and this is my favorite.  The service is always friendly and sometimes the cook comes out to ask about your meal.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years and I've had great customer service every single time. The food is excellent and the price is even better. This place is definitely a must try if you're craving for pho or other vietnamese dishes. 
My last visit here was a couple of days ago. When I came in, I was greeted instantly and seated right away. I agree with the other review that the servers are always friendly and the cook would sometimes come out to ask how your meal was which I rarely get at restaurants, so I thought that was nice.
I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Use to be my favourite pho place the saté pho was to die for but with my last couple visits (2-3visits) I have to honestly say the place is going downhill and fast. The beef in the pho is very low quality tough and chewy fatty cheap shit. We walked in it was empty but every table was dirty with big soup bowls and squeezed lime. The area is also sketchy forest lawn  so go with a gun, large group or a martial artist friend. Sorry bud but you gotta step it up there's lots of competition out there for pho, just my 2 cents I've eaten at over 100 different pho restaurants around the world including my trip to
Vietnam"}
