{"text":"Tex-mex menu but great flavor (rice, beans, meat) and generous servings. Really clean with very nice service. Definitely the best of all the -berto restaurants I've tried in Phoenix so far! I recommend the green chile pork combination platter and am excited to try more here."}
{"text":"I love going here with my family. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. The food is always fresh and the portions are pretty grande. I've never been disappointed with anything I've gotten. I do wish the vegetarian burrito had veggies in it- not just rice and beans, cheese lettuce, and tomato. Best horchata around though."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the meal. The tortillas were nice and fresh, and everything was seasoned perfectly. The horchata was refreshing too! Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I frequently get a breakfast burrito here on weekends. I wish that they would open earlier on weekdays so I could get one before work sometimes (they open at 9). I've had enchiladas for dinner here before and the beans and rice did not taste fresh, which was very disappointing. It's not a busy restaurant amd the staff are friendly. I really hope this place thrives once the complex next door starts being filled."}
{"text":"Salsa and horchata is super good.  The carne Asada burrito has a lot of flavor.  The staff was really friendly and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito with pico and guac is on point! Out the door $8 later with a burrito the size of a baby's forearm in my belly! I recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"After 6 hours of driving hubby and i needed to refuel ourselves.  We were not interested in a sit down establishment in downtown Phoenix and dealing with the crowds near the Talking Stick stadium.  So glad we found this place at 9pm. Bean and cheese burrito hit the spot so well the hubby ordered a hard taco afterwards. He really liked the beef: it was tender and flavorful. I went for the carne asada french fries so trendy nowadays. It was loaded and I forgot to tell them to hold the sour cream so it was everywhere but I still ate it. I like french fries and will eat all varieties but my least favorite is the thin cut which they use. It didn't stop me from finishing it."}
{"text":"This is a solid option for Mexican food in the downtown area.    The restaurant is a couple doors down from the Desoto market.   For \"fast food\" Mexican they are ahead of the Curve, bold flavors and quick service.   Parking is a problem for those looking to carry out.  Better than most fast food Mexican places,  would gladly return."}
{"text":"BEST horchata ever. Breakfast burritos are yummy too. I had the machaca and egg burrito- it was good but the machaca could have used a sauce it was a tad bit dry."}
{"text":"They don't understand English. When my delivery order was wrong and I called, they didn't understand me. I had to drive to the store to speak to them to get my order fixed which defeats the delivery option. When I got there, they still had trouble understanding that I wanted extra egg and no meat in my breakfast burrito. I probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid food at very decent prices.
Everything is fresh and very tasty. Idk how Mexican loaded french fries are but it's a really great twist, the meat is seasoned and the ingredients are so good that you don't need any extra sauces. The chile rellenos and the quesadillas are good but not the best I've had. The sauces (both red and green) are very watery and not spicy.
Service is super friendly which always makes the experience a lot more enjoyable. 
The place is bright and clean and quite large."}
{"text":"Very authentic and affordable. The staff was friendly and willing to fulfill our requests. Tacos were crispy and fresh. Rice was fluffy and beans well seasoned. We will definitely eat here again when in town. A must try!"}
{"text":"1st time to this location.  Tasted just like other location.  Best grilled chicken tacos on grilled corn tortillas. They had pico de gallo and guacamole with lime and your choice of red or green salsa.  These are my favorite taco and all locations make exactly the same.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Went here the other night. I was disappointed with the food. Got a  #3 enchilada plate. The beans were hot and delicious!! Although after the beans nothing else was good. Enchiladas were filled with cold shredded cheese that wasn't melted at all and rice was bland and sparse. I also got an adobada taco the meat was dry, hard and not flavorful to say the least."}
{"text":"Rodiberto's is nothing if not versatile.  Like so many local Mexican food spots with the Berto suffix attached to their name, this Downtown Phoenix version offers a little bit of everything.  Tacos, tortas, burritos, chimichangas, menudo, and even taco bowls.  Its a menu that will likely take you a good 3-5 minutes to peruse before ordering.  I'm of course of the opinion that those establishments that try to do everything great often don't do anything great.  But in deference to Rodiberto (assuming there is such a man) and his conveniently located restaurant a few blocks from my apartment, I made a trip for a quick dinner on a Saturday evening.

You'll find Rodiberto's dressed with blinking rainbow light windows on the west side of Central Avenue and Garfield Street.  There's parking in back (though you have to walk about two blocks around the buildings to reach the main entrance) and for now the restaurant bumps up to a busy construction site where The Stewart Apartments will one day reside.  Truth be told I've walked by this place hundreds of times and have steered clear largely because it seems like the place is always empty.  I could probably count on one hand how many people I've seen dine here in all that time.  Maybe the work week lunch crowd is big here?  Maybe the construction crews in the neighborhood are keeping this place afloat?  I honestly have no idea how this 60 seat joint stays open, but nevertheless its still here.  They must be doing something right, I guess.

After looking over their Yelp account and seeing that the owner most proudly advertised his Carne Asada Fries, I largely shrugged that off.  But when I asked guys at the counter what their staple item is and they confirmed it was indeed Carne Asada Fries, I set my suspicions aside and agreed to order this strange concoction.  To wash it down?  Why, Horchata of course!  Total cost for the food, drink and tax came to about $13.  Seemed a little pricey, but no matter.  I'm committed now.

A few minutes later, a tray of two hot sauces, napkins, plastic ware, and a plate containing a gargantuan pile of ingredients arrived at my table.  I now understand the price point as this plate of food is absolutely huge.  On the bottom, at least two hand fulls of fries.  On top, mounds of carne asada, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream.  Its the kind of plate that I can easily picture the tired, the desperately hungry, and the inebriated types fawning over.  More specifically, the Downtown college crowd (which may explain why they offer Downtown college kids a 10% Yelp Discount here).  The dish wasn't bad, but it was shall we say, a bit much.  I finished it, but it wasn't easy.  The Carne Asada was cooked well, though the cheese wasn't particularly melty (cold in spots actually), and the sour cream was a little runny for me.  No complaints about the Horchata as it was perfect, and the meal portion was (obviously) very generous.  It was all a perfectly serviceable meal, but I would probably feel a lot better about myself if this had been eaten in the service of soaking up booze or curing a hangover.

For those uninterested in my dish, there's at least three dozen other options (if not more) on the menu to choose from so feel free to explore.  Long story short, I'd say Rodiberto's is pretty much exactly what I expected.  No frills, straight forward, inexpensive Mexican food along the lines of Filiberto's, Isberto's and other Berto's you would find around town.  The fact that Downtown's increasingly sophisticated culinary scene has one is somewhat miraculous.  I wish them well, though I can't say with any confidence when (or if) I'll have the urge to make a return engagement."}
{"text":"First time visit, if a guy lives in Phoenix, ya gotta scope out all the Mexican food stops. I met Bruno, We're gonna get along just fine.

A new beautiful ten story apt/condo building is going up next door. BRUNO is HAPPY !!"}
{"text":"Insanely good, do yourself a favor and don't order wrong. All you need to order is the carne Asada burrito. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican food joint. Authentic food, served quickly. Food portions are enormous. Had a chimichanga and the carne asada burrito. I would only have ordered one enter if I knew the size of the portions, one is enough. Great spot to eat Mexican food! Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"I had the veggie burrito which was packed with beans, rice, pico and guacamole. It was decent sized and very filling. Service was quick and the place was nice and clean. My buddies tacos looked (and according to him) were on point with the fish tacos as the winner. I would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Very typical menu, but it's definitely very yummy. The service is great and the place is ALWAYS clean. I recommend the shredded beef taco plate with green salsa to all the taco maniacs (myself included) out there!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was abysmal. Took nearly an out for people to receive their food"}
{"text":"Decent but suggest ask tortillas be cooked well done or at least softer. Hard to bite thru burritos so many layers. Very fast"}
{"text":"Not sure why the 4 1/2 rating.

The food was absolutely okay, nothing special, and no one spoke enough English to answer a couple of basic questions."}
{"text":"The best chicken burrito I've ever had! I saw all the other reviews and was skeptical that this place would just be another \"Berto's\" place like all the other, but the food is super flavorful, and you can taste the homemade in their tortillas."}
{"text":"I am happy to report a FIVE STAR rating on this newcomer to the RoRo community! I went in for dinner, and noted the massive menu including any possible authentic Mexican dish I could imagine including five different quesadillas, my fave.  I got the grilled chicken supreme quesadilla and a Mexican Coke.  They also have seafood and breakfast. 

My meal was served to me with a smile in a comfy, super clean, and all new upgrade to what was here before. Rodiberto's is and will continue to be a very welcome addition to my hood! I am glad we have this option in walking distance of the row.  I hope others will join me in supporting this yummy endeavor so he will be around for years to come."}
{"text":"Super Authentic.  Had ground beef taco. Oversized crunchy shell came out warm   Overfilled and delicious.  ALSO ordered Carnitas burrito.  Meat was succulent and flavorful LARGE size for. 6$ burrito. Here during Friday lunch. I'm only gringo here ... that says a bit for authenticity, yet crowd was light.  Believe this is a new venture on the periphery of ASUniv.   Super friendly mom and pop vibe. Lady cook flashed me an inviting smile as I was ordering.  Great value and TASTE here. Now they just need some word of mouth...Don't hesitate with this gem!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! These guys are so sweet. I've been a customer for about a year. Their super nachos and green salsa are ridiculously good. So good that I order from them at least once a week since I found out they are on UberEats. On top of that, their customer service is great. They even wrote me a personalized note on my food tonight. They truly appreciate their customers. Can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"I had a plain ground beef taco. It was sizable with deliciously greasy beef tucked in a tasty crunchy shell. 
Big fan."}
{"text":"Soooooooooo good! I had the carne asada fries and they were so incredible. I'm in love. Seriously, go to this place if you're in the mood for deliciosa comida mexicana"}
{"text":"They make the best fresh tortillas with made to order ingredients. Because of this, the food can take longer than you're used to at other taquerias...but it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"This place has the best veggie burritos in town! They also are a cheap price. I often order postmates and get it from here."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Extremely clean and friendly. Food was great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"First place I stopped at for lunch upon arriving in Phoenix. Fast service, nice staff, great chile relleno!"}
{"text":"Don't know how this place gets a 41/2 rating.  Called in a to go order at 6:40 on a Sunday night and they ask me how fast I can get there.  I say \"How fast to you want me to get there\", and they say 10 minutes.  I say \"great, be there in 10\".  I get there, and find out they have no clue about my order, and proceed to tell me it will be right out when it's obvious they haven't even started it.  Get home and it's barely warm, with the Chimichanga tasting like it got a whole 10 second dunk in the lukewarm oil.  Chicken filling is bland with little heat.  All and all pretty bad food.  Gonna stick with El Norteno from now on."}
