{"text":"I enjoyed having lunch here, it is clean, modern and very new which brings in a feel of luxury while being very affordable. The plates are small which is very good if you want to share. Very good food, tasty and brought very quickly. One of the best restaurants around specially the Pocky they bring to you at the end."}
{"text":"I struggle with this review because I have to give an honest rating based on my experience and I love the Macleod location so I will just not be back to this one.

The restaurant had the feel of a cafeteria or food court since it is really wide open with lots of tables and chairs lined up. With no soft furnishings such as booths the place echos and even with the restaurant only being about 1/3 full it was difficult to hear. 

The food didn't feel fresh and like it had been made hours earlier than when we ate it. The rice on the plates of 4 sushi rolls stuck together like they had been assembled for hours on end. 

Our waitress was pleasant but didn't come around a lot so there were a few items we were short on. 

Whoever designed this place must have split personalities! The front is all decked out in a Japanese theme and then? They have Picasso prints hanging on every inch of every wall. I don't understand the correlation...

Where is Peter and where is my Pocky? :-("}
{"text":"I love Kinjo! It's my favourite Sushi restaurant in Calgary. I was super excited to see that it opened in the NE and it did not disappoint. The service is great and it has the standard perks of a complimentary sushi sampler plate and Pocky. The food is super fresh and I love their huge selection of food. Some of my favourite dishes are: Seared Salmon sushi. Tuna Sashimi, #9 Scallop sushi, Signature roll (dynamite roll with avocado and smoked salmon), Volcano roll, Ginger shrimp and Magic Steak."}
{"text":"We have been 3 times, twice for lunch and once for the tuna show on Thursday evening. The sushi is good, the service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is casual and fun.

We also love the atmosphere, although some people have told me they think it's too \"Vegas\" We enjoyed the tuna show, and think it would be great for a group event with sushi lovers - or with kids and families. We gave a gift certificate to our neighbours and they had a great time and loved the food, they even received a free entree. YOu'll often get free sample foods with your meal which is great as you can try different things.

I love that we have a consistent Japanese resto in our area now that has a full menu of cooked and raw foods. Because the menu is so varied you'll never get in a rut.

{"text":"Easy to order serve quick. Loved the interior and food. Servers were really kind and nice (and they greeted people with 'Iratsha Imase (welcome in Japanese!) Sushi was fresh and nice loved shrimp tempura. Chicken karaake was little bit over cooked I think. My husband hates Japanese food but he definetly enjoyed here :)"}
{"text":"Glad to have a Japanese restaurant up in this area. As commented by another reviewer already, the location is a nicely designed, and very nicely decorated. The restaurant is large, open and welcoming.  The portion sizes was embarrassingly small.  Not good value at all."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here on the suggestion of one of the people in our group since it was relatively close to our hotel by the airport. Upon getting here, we were taken aback as the building inside and out looked VERY elegant and well decorated, I got a little angry at our friend that suggested it since I thought it was gonna cost us an
ear and leg to eat lunch, but I was definitely wrong! 

When the 6 of us sat down and took a look at the menu, we saw that the prices for the sushi, rolls, and overall everything on the menu was cheaper than stuff in edmonton! I was super excited by now since I hadn't had sushi in a long time. 

We started off with a few bottles of warm sake, WHICH BY THE WAY IS MUCH BETTER AND EASIER TO DRINK WHEN COLD!!!! (I don't drink often) 

I then started ordering things from rolls, to tempura, to teriyaki and the works. The food came out timely and the server we had we great as she kept making sure we were good and the alcohol kept coming to our table. By the end of the lunch, all of us were stuffed to the brim and our server was still very courteous and kind even if we were a little inebriated :( 

The bill came to about $300 with 6-9 bottles of sake, and 25+ things off the menu to feed 6 hungry people. All in all it was definitely a great pick for a good sushi lunch."}
{"text":"This is Peter Kinjo's fourth location, and it's just off Deerfoot and Country Hills Blvd. I haven't been to the N.W. location in Dalhousie, but I believe this is his biggest store to date. It's big bright and airy.
I spoke with Peter the owner yesterday, and he was pointing out the art (paintings) that he had on all the wall's. He has at least 150 pieces of art. (some Van Gogh).  I also met his business partner Yukiko yesterday.
Peter was telling me that eventually, there was going to be more seating on the second floor. At the moment, the only thing located up there are washrooms.
Also down the road, he tells me that there will be an outdoor patio with a retractable roof. (That will be cool).
The food at Kinjo is the same as at his other locations. A good assortment of sushi, and grilled foods.
You get the usual 4 piece sushi sampler after you are seated, and finish with Pocky's after you're done your meal.
On this visit we had tamago sushi, california roll, spicy tuna roll, chicken katsu, fried rice, magic steak. The food has been consistently good at Kinjo's, and if you know and have had the opportunity to meet Peter you'll know what a showman he is. ( I believe that this has been the key to his success).
I really have seen how Peter's hard work has payed off for him over the years. I still remember his first location that opened years ago. (The former Tim Horton's on Macleod Trail south) to the Dalhousie location, to Midnapore, to The District.
He has one more planned for the deep south in Mahogony.
I'll be back soon !"}
{"text":"I do not understand how this place is so highly rated. The prices are expensive,portion sizes are small,and most sashimi is poor.there are far better sushi places to visit in this city. I have heard that the tuna nights are impressive though I have yet to experience."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite.
Service is great here. Although sometimes the avocado in the rolls are not fresh (brown). Photos are not synonymous to the actual dishes, often looks different. Cool renaissance theme. Love when Peter comes by with Pocky!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Best menus And ordering process I've had at ANY Asian restaurant I've ever eaten at in my entire life.  Fast service.  You can tell they care about their craft.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"We been to this location many times. The food is ok but expensive for what you get. Service is always good however the noise level is very loud. If it's not busy you can here the music blaring above you. 

Use to love this place especially getting the free pocky and free samples but there's less expensive places out there to eat."}
{"text":"Nice & bright open concept restaurant. Decor are colorful with a mix of The West & East, but don't feel any theme of decor. Maybe just call it \"fusion\". Up stair public bath room is just like an art paintings gallery. Foods are good to great as usual, serving very fast (early). Its the newest & biggest one in Calgary. Recommend to go there."}
{"text":"I am fully in love with this place. The whole decoration makes me feel super comfortable (specially with all the Van Gogh paintings!) it's a big restaurant with plenty of light. The service was nice and fast, and the food was really good as usual. You did great with this new location! :)"}
{"text":"An amazing find. Thank you, Yelp. I stumbled across this restaurant while searching for a much needed meal after a flight that found me in Calgary. I took a chance and damn if it didn't pay off.  I gave NO complaints. The food and service were both excellent. The restaurant itself is beautiful. I would return again and again if I lived here."}
{"text":"Good bang for the buck. 
As far as sushi, it was just okay. The Lobster roll was our favorite, but the specialty rolls were just okay. Our server was very sweet and when we had an issue with food, she handled it better and more appropriately than her manager."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the food at this place. The price is about par when compared to other places. I like the idea that they give more wasabi and ginger when asked for refill. Their little \"sample\" treat is always a highlight for me as it helps the super indecisive mind. However, do they ever change the type of samples they give? They have some new types of sushi now. I enjoy the occasional new items. Change things up and make us engaged! The store in general is really clean. A downside here is the lack of booth availability and noise. Even when it's medium busy, the noise level is still quick high which makes it difficult to chat with others. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I've tried Kinjo's Dalhousie and McLeod locations before and I remember the sushi and service being mediocre but the hot food was good. I decided to try the newly opened Country Hills location as I could not be bothered to cook on a Friday night after a long day of work. The line was long but the wait was short. The restaurant is modern and huge. The Van Goughs paintings were an interesting touch. We ordered some sushi (tuna, salmon, male dragon roll) and hot items (gyoza, karage chicken and magic steak). The sushi came out first, and wasn't bad. It was better than the other locations. The rice was soft and the fish was fresh. The fish portions were reasonable for the price. The hot items came out slowly one by one after we devoured our sushi. The karage chicken was dry and just when we thought they had forgotten our gyoza and magic steak, our server, Fanny, checked their progress for us. The gyoza came out but the magic steak never came out. We asked Fanny to take it off our bill. She brought us the bill and apologized for the kitchen \"missing\" the steak. I would've been more amused if she said it \"magically\" disappeared. 

I must admit, I was impressed this time by the quality of their food but their service is still spotty. The staff are young which means you can expect some degree of unprofessionalism. One young server even brought a volcano California roll to our table that we never ordered. She circled the room once and came back asking us \"Are you SURE you didn't order this?\" No, young grasshopper, we did not. As for the long wait for our food, I can only attribute that to half the staff being too busy singing Happy Birthday every ten minutes."}
{"text":"Terrible service - ordered appetizers - they didn't show up until 10 minutes after we paid the bill - despite asking for them.... 
no discount, or offer to take them off- got them to go instead.

Why is the pocky gender based? I'm a woman and I love pocky, but if my dining companion wants one too and they happen to be male, why can't they have one? Or have the option to purchase one?"}
{"text":"Very delicious sushi rolls and fair priced. Friendly staffs great service.  Must try!"}
{"text":"We came here for the Thursday blue fin tuna auction and were not disappointed. Most of the food was okay. What makes them deserve the 4 stars instead of 3 is the atmosphere and friendly staff. Peter seems to be enjoying himself these days. I applaud him for opening such successful restaurants starting with the Macleod Trail location back in 2004/05 (I can't recall anymore.) I like their small portions allowing you to try a bit of everything. The kids enjoyed their chicken udon bowls and edamame beans. Of course they were given Pockys and that just makes Kinjo the best sushi restaurant for kids in the city hands down!! I love their complimentary sushi dishes they bring out at the beginning before anything is ordered. Definitely coming back. It's been a while since I've gone to Kinjo and it was the first time at this beautiful $3.4 million location! Wowza!!"}
{"text":"Loved our experience here! We ordered an assortment of food from the Benihana roll, to tempura avocado, to chicken fried rice. All delicious. Our 1 yr old decided to have a fit once we placed her in the high hair  the staff immediately came over and brought her a cute fruit tray carved out as a monkey and some sweet cookies. Staff was courteous and very attentive. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Alright I have to be honest,  I wasn't a fan of this chain.  I thought the sushi was just mediocre and they sell because of their great staff and service.   I heard about their bluefin tuna cutting night and as much as I was excited,  I was super hesitant as well.   But if you know me,  you know I love my toro so at $3/pop, I couldn't resist.   My expectations werent  that high because I've tasted the best otoro in Taipei and Tokyo already.  

As I walked into the restaurant,  I was greeted right away (I admit service is great).  They gave us 4 different pieces of rolls to try so another bonus.   Then I went straight to ordering the bluefin tuna combo set.   From the looks of it,  I can tell the fish is going to be pretty good.  As I take my first bite of the fatty otoro sushi,  indeed the fat just melted in my mouth.  I was thoroughly impressed!  I had to come back and order some more.  I didn't enjoy the Seared tuna because it was more like tataki instead of torched and the tuna was dry.  The maki was just meh but the medium otoro was pretty good as well.   So I would recommend just ordering the fatty and medium otoro and the negitoro.  This place definitely deserves a second chance from me! With this price,  you can't get a better quality piece of otoro anywhere else in the city.  Come Thursday night when the fish is the freshest...I should get free sushi for this!"}
{"text":"The bluefin tuna cutting show is a fun experience! ...  Well,  unless you're a vegetarian... 

The best part is eating it after they cut it! (order from the Bluefin tuna menu) 

New place is huge, and is very open (which can get a bit loud).  

Bluefin tuna show is every Thursday @ 6:30 but they take the fish out at around  6:00pm. It's a good idea to make reservations close to the the cutting table if you want to get up close and personal with the fish, but once they start cutting everyone stands up anyways.  They do allow some photo opportunities with the fish prior to cutting.  

Super fun experience!!"}
{"text":"I first noticed the setting was very nice.  It had high ceilings and a spacious area, booths which I liked personally and the hockey game on tv.  The food is of good quality but also pretty expensive and I could live with that, it's a fair trade off.  What turned me off about this place was how they gave women only a pack of Pocky.  I am not sure what the point of this gender bias is but you can see how people would be up in arms if it was the other way around.  Obviously its not dollar factor as it costs only a few dollars retail and they probably buy them in bulk so costs are even less.  At their prices they can afford to be fair.  If the Pocky never came I can see myself back.  Now I won't be just on principle."}
{"text":"What can I say when I found out Kinjo opened not 2mins from my house I was overjoyed!!!  I love their Dalhousie location so I was super excited to try out the new location in my neighbourhood.  
My husband and I dined here last night and from the moment you walk in the doors it's the most inviting atmosphere.  We where greeted right away and seated, and she explained the drink menu to us and that this location has their largest selection of drinks.
The décor is very vibrant and inviting, lots of tables and lots of staff who are very quick to ensure you are enjoying yourself.  The kitchen is amazing, I had a view and counted 14 chefs and I love that I can watch them create their masterpieces.  The food was amazing and we had three plates on our table minutes after placing or order.  So quickly in fact that I had to check to make sure it was ours!!!!  The fish is fresh and nice large pieces.  I love the fact they have regular and sweet soy sauce!!  Their menu is nice a colourful with vibrant pictures.  
Very happy to see the pocky guy!!!  Such a treat to end a great meal!!!  
It was not too overly busy but it is a new location and was a Thursday evening.  We are going back tonight with our neighbours and I'm so excited!!!
Thank you Kinjo, you made my day!!!  This is the only place I will go for my sushi from now on!"}
{"text":"Great place and the food tasted good except the food was a bit cold and salty. Overall th place and staffs are friendly"}
{"text":"Wow, just wonderful. Please open a restaurant in Miami. Great food, low prices, cool vibe and atmosphere. I'm in love!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's been amazing. I haven't been during peak hours but the service has very good to excellent. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. As for food quality I have found the sushi to be as good as anywhere else. Let's talk about the ginger beef. WOW!! This is what my mom has and now I can't have it anywhere else. I don't know why it isn't like other places but this isn't even ginger beef. It's like little bites from heaven. It's light and tasty. Not covered in crap. Who knew this is what it's suppose to taste like? Maybe I'm wrong and ginger beef isn't supposed to rate this good. Well I think you get the point. I have only been to the north location but I would try any of them. Prices are very fair. Give them a try.  PS. Ask for Jason. He's always great."}
{"text":"Some sushi was awesome some was alright. The food kept coming fast on the other hand not so much the drinks the waitress herself barely came around. We ordered too much so took the rest to go, wish I would have checked the to go bag because a lot was missing so we paid for stuff we didn't get and I didn't get to try the avocado tempera along with few other items. So check your to go bags!"}
