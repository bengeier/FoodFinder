{"text":"Really good pizza with nice crust. Interesting specialty pizzas. Fast delivery. Online ordering."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been ordering from here for as long as I can remember. Great customer service and they deliver quickly. Only ever had one problem and that was with one of their delivery workers. But it was nothing big. So if your looking for good pizza at a fair price here's the place to go to!"}
{"text":"Although some of my friends and nieghbors rave about this place, I can't ever seem to get a Pizza that inspires me to pronounce my love. The pepperoni rolls are mediocre to good, but perhaps it is just my personal taste. Many many people swear by it so if you are in the south hills, try it! They have a limited seating option or take out to try it. The people who work there are very friendly, local people so that is a plus. I assume others will rate it much higher."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quaint yet dignified. The food is superb with top notch salads and the freshest ingredients. The pizza is the perfect balance of cheese, sauce, and seasoning - a delight to the tastebuds. I was served by the most beautiful red haired woman and I fell in love instantly. Sublime service. Remarkable food. 10/10. 5 stars. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I used to order from here all the time And the food was excellent. Now the last eight out of 10 times when my food was delivered it was not what I ordered. My pizza was cold and I live maybe 5 minutes away if you happen to catch a red light..I ordered a salad that was supposed to have meats and cheese and got a box full of lettuce.. I've called to tell them my food was wrong and they have made it right each time...the problem is I would like to get the food I order right the first time..the last straw was the lettuce box lol and cold pizza ..I called almost a month later to get food they promised to replace the only problem is it took 3 phone calls ask where my food was and 2 hours later to get it..there excuse the second call was well it's Friday..get more people or don't deliver!!!!!! We actually ordered from Big Guys was delivered an was great pizza was done eating and the other food didn't show up for another hour..skip the Mediocre food Horrible management and go to Big Guys."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza but if you want the best pizza in pittsburgh goto Slice On Broadway!  The best pizza hands down and the Nicest people work there. Seriously give it a try and you will thank me later, over and over again."}
{"text":"We order here at least once a week

I think they have the best pizza in the south hills and always gives that garlic flavor.

They have some pretty good specials for larger orders but you do pay for the quality of food.

We usually pickup but they also have delivery and a very limited eat in spot."}
{"text":"I would live in this little house of a shop if I could. Yummmm.  My favorite item on the menu is the Margarita Pizza. The sauce is so simple, yet divine.  The kids love the wings.  We order here at least once a week.  Seating is very limited, just one or two little tables so it's best to get your order to go unless you are just eating a quick bite on the run.  I can find a cheaper pizza, but I can't find a better pizza. You get what you pay for, but believe me.... It's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and saw this place when passing. It is slightly higher priced but you get quality ingredients and it is packaged well to keep it fresh!

We ordered a veggie pizza and wings. The pizzas toppings were fresh and the crust thin. The wings were excellent for delivery wings. The delivery driver was very courteous as well."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. I could not stop eating it. Loved the hawaiian with Cap and Parma. Crust was wonderul with just the right number of crispy bubbles near the edge."}
{"text":"My wife was looking for a place for a good calzone. She's pretty particular about how it should be made and they nailed it!! More than 1 person can finish and it had everything she remembered about her 1st calzone she ever had. I got an Italian and it too was perfect! This place rocks!!"}
{"text":"Close to work so it's convenient. The lunch special is reasonable priced. However, the pizza tends to be on the greasy side. With that said, pizza is like sex. No matter how bad it is, it's still good."}
{"text":"The Pies look amazing Rodney .... fabulous .. You are artist ... You have paved the way for a modern day classic Pie better than the original marg. I can see it in the pics ..people just don't know the reality and then your using a unconventional oven woe , my hat is off too a genius. They know there enjoying pure passion if they have a clue. I would suggest good luck too you Rodney but you don't need any ..If those guys only new what you are cultivating they would never give you less than 5 stars ... Thanks for teaching me ...a few of your secrets I am truly honored too have met you. The meatballs are amazing also. Everything was amazing maybe the only question ..the hoagie roll. But again that buffalo mozza pie looks perfect. Your the first too truly create a pie from a unconventional oven too resemble a classic baked pie. That's just something revolutionary .. I don't think others understand what you have achieved."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizzeria in the area.  The crust is perfectly thin and chewy with crispy ends almost like wood fired but not burnt.  The perfect amount of cheese adorns the top. The only thing I didn't like was that there was actually too much pepperoni, which really makes my son happy so it works out well.  I Recently tried the Italian calzone and cheese calzone and both were an amazing blend of high quality ingredients melted together to perfection.  I particularly love their Greek salad which is best served with lemon wedges and olive oil, though you do have the option of other dressings.  Some may think the prices are a little higher than a traditional pizza shop but for good reason.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. They use the best ingredients and the crust is excellent. They have excellent hoagies and wings. I don't think you'll be disappointed . you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here several weeks ago.  Pizza was some of the best I've had in ages.  Real pizza, not the stuff that comes from the chains.  (Papa John's, you can offer me whatever discounts you want, that stuff isn't real pizza...)  That said, the pizza was pretty darn pricey.  With a couple of toppings, I seem to recall a pizza being close to $20.  I'd certainly order from Ardolino's again, just bracing myself for a bit of sticker shock..."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. I usually eat a slice in my car as I can't wait. I live in mt Lebanon but the drive is worth it. The only topping I ever get is pepperoni but I think theirs is the best."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza but I only gave them 3 stars because they don't deliver to my street in Bridgeville! Annoying!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ardolinos is very good pizza. My wife and I enjoy their pizza and would take it over any of the chain places any day. 

Its a little pricey, though. Without a coupon, anyway. Definitely find a coupon before you go or call and you'll be set!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and calzones hands down! Superior quality ingredients make this our favorite pizza place! Friendly staff, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, really friendly staff.  The crust is a perfect mix of crispy, thin, & doughy.  The sauce is on the tart side, no sweetness.  We also had some fries and buffalo wings.  I really liked the fries, the wife said the wings were OK.  We will definitely be back to try more menu items. Unfortunately we live just outside of the delivery range, but it's still close enough to be convenient for a pickip, or they have a nice small dine-in area."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing to write home about.  Do yourself a favor and drive 10 minutes north on 19 to Mineo's in Mt Lebanon.  Nothing against Ardolinos but with such great pizza so close why eat average pie?"}
{"text":"Good pizza with quality toppings.  Crust is thin similar to a NY style.  

Lady at the counter was very helpful and pointed out some specials."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ardollinos has been a family favorite since my daughters worked there. Any chance we get when we are in the area. We stop  the lunch specials are great and the pizza and hoagies are to die for. The staff is very friendly and you never have to wait. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"As pizza goes in Pittsburgh, Ardolino's is above average. Prices are reasonable.  Sauce is pedestrian and dull. Cheese is a monolithic experience; not a mix of provolone, Romano and mozzarella. The pizzas require a few shakes of parm, oregano/basil and red pepper flakes. Otherwise it's a no-can-do! 
 The hoagies are pretty good, with generous portions. Salads are as expected. Wings are done well, saucy and spicy. 
The thing Ardolino's does best is online ordering, accurate  filling of orders and FAST reliable delivery. Pizza arrives quickly and is oven hot! Wings are always steaming hot. Delivery drivers are courteous and pleasant. Pasta offered is penne tossed in bland red sauce, no cheese toppping. Kinda nothing special. 
The folks working there are very helpful on the phone, willing to please the customer. 
It would be great if they offered a NY or Jersey style pie (a bit sweeter and spicier). Or a Red Top pie."}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery from here and I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend and I ordered buffalo chicken pizza, a steak hoagie, and breadsticks. We loved the pizza and breadsticks a lot. The hoagie was okay but it was a bit try and needed more sauce on it. They gave us ranch, marinara, and garlic sauce-all tasted great and their ranch was the bomb! We will order again from here for sure. Delivery was on time and didn't take too long."}
