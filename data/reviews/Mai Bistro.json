{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 6 people. It is a go-to restaurant of a friend who lives by the area and it is a hidden gem that I recommend you go to before more good reviews make it a go-to place for many more people. The plates are mainly asian with some latin influence. They are meant for sharing but we felt that they could be eaten individually as well (except for the Argentinean steak and fries - that was delicious and should be shared). We had fresh spring rolls, lemongrass pork, fried calamari, pad thai, wok fried green vegetables, thai fried rice, yellow curry shrimp... everything was good. My favourites were the lemongrass pork and Argentinean steak. And the desserts... I'm a dessert person and they were some of the best I have ever had. They only had 2 desserts - tres leches & port wine poached peaches with ice cream. Both were perfect. We were amazed that this place was not busy at all. Service was friendly. Even though this restaurant is very far from my comfort zone in the east end, I would come back again and again."}
{"text":"2nd time back after a month and ordered same dish. Argentina Steak and fries. Very tender and moist and done exactly as I asked.  Comes with skin on fries.   Tried the green tea creme brulee for dessert. A first for me and was not disappointed. It had a light green tea flavour and not overwhelming. Small place which makes it great for dates or small groups of 4.  Although Not much privacy as tables are quite close together.  Good asian fusion variety on the menu. Parking is in the back and convenient."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a lovely dinner here on the weekend. We started with Japanese Fried Chicken which was delicious and then shared two mains. One main was a trio of shrimp tacos which were very well done and the second was an Argentinian Steak done to a perfect medium rare. We added some stir-fried bok choy and we had a perfect amount of food. Definitely a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and amazing, I was pleasantly surprised with the asian twist on the Tapas.  Loved the Ceviche could have easily ordered two of them.  We were well attended to could not have asked for better service.  Chef did a good job  Ordered:  Pork Tacos, Ceviche, Fried Calamari, Grilled Shrimp, Pork Tacos, Steak Tacos  Will definitely be coming back wished every dining experience was like this one."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick dinner at this neighbourhood bistro.  Tasty grub.  I had the lemongrass pork and calamari starter.  Excellent service,  reasonable price, good selection.  Next time I'll try the Argentine steak. Decor and atmosphere just right. I will return."}
{"text":"Really good food but very expensive for what you get. The service also takes a long time for such a small establishment. Would I go back? Maybe... those viet tacos were amazing!"}
{"text":"I liked the food here but service is very  slow. Not a good place foe lunch I'd u are working"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food!! They have phenomenal soups, salads, and entrees! Everything I have had here as been fantastic!! Friendly helping staff and a nice atmosphere!! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Can't believe we've never been here before. The food was awesome great service. The food is a bit pricey but everything is made with care. There are a lot of really cool interesting and dishes from Argentinian steak all the way to my Asian inspired Mexican food. Go"}
{"text":"Drove past this restaurant and found the \"latin and asian tapas\" idea interesting so gave it a try. It was nothing short of excellent. My husband and I started with the crispy calamari and knew we were in for a great meal. It was the best calamari I've had in years. For our mains, we shared the Fish Tacos and the Argentinian Steak. Both meals were cooked to perfection and delicious. The fries that came with the steak were to die for! Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this new restaurant. The chef made a point of coming over to the table and checking on us and the waitress was attentive without being annoying. Completely recommend Mai Bistro and will certainly be visiting it again in the near future."}
{"text":"Here are some highlights from my blog review (link to full review below)   The food and service was great, so great that we ordered take out for the next day!  Here is what we had  Shrimp and Crab wonton ceviche ...After trying this, I was determined to make it through some mains and dessert!!  Organic Ontario Lamb curry spring roll ...So flavourful and reminiscent of something a  fine dining Indian restaurant would serve. Oh but its sooo much better wrapped up in a spring roll.   Grilled chimichurri Calamari with baby greens ...It was soft, tender and done in 1 minute!!   Thai style fresh blue crab fried rice ...Lime, chunks of blue crab, rice... so unbelievably flavourful we were debating ordering one more so we didn't kill each other. But then the beef came...  Braised beef with lemongrass and potato ..We ordered this to take home for the next day. Yes people, it was that good.  Cajun fish with crispy wonton noodle..  It was pan-seared, nice and crispy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside.   Peach, Port Wine and Mango Ice Cream ...OMG. What a great dessert. Absolutely loved it.  Check out my full review with pics at - lilmissbubz.com"}
{"text":"Excellent food in Islington Village. Have been several times; The Asian/Latin menu is interesting and the food is wonderful. The plates are small/large tapas and tacos, reasonably priced. Restaurant decor is nice and noise level is low; you can actually hear your companions' conversation while you enjoy dinner (if you want a hipper place where you yell at your table mates, have to lip read what the waiter is saying and don't really care what the food is like, there is lots of choice in this city). For food quality, I would rate 5 stars. Service is friendly but could be a bit more polished."}
{"text":"This is my 3-4 time here now and just love it. Food is always awesome and the chef nygen would come out to speak to his customer whenever he's free. We came on a weekday this time and so it wasn't super busy. Food was awesome! And the Japanese cheesecake is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had their fish tacos, yellow curry chicken chow mein and Thai style fried rice with real crab meat. The fish tacos were delicious and are good tapa size. Although the fish tacos were good, I've had better at other places. I loved the fried rice, it was perfectly seasoned and there were big chunks of crab meat. The curry chicken was very unique and delicious. There were dough bits in the noodles which the chef said were gnocchi. Who would think to put gnocchi in chow mein? It was probably the best dish we ate.the chef/owner came over to our table and gave us a complimentary piece of Mexican tres leche cake. The cake was so moist and delicious like a pound cake. I will definitely come back again. I saw their lunch menu and saw some items I would like to try since it's not on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We were a party of 6 and we all ordered different items on the menu including fish, pork and steak tacos, curried chicken, Thai beef salad, oysters, crab and shrimp spring rolls and lamb spring rolls- all amazing! I especially recommend the Thai beef salad. The chef came out and chatted to the tables, and spent a lot of time with us telling us about his story and his inspiration. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So many great things to say about this lovely little place in Etobicoke!  - The food is original and very tasty. We had the Argentinian steak with fries, fried calamari and shrimp tacos. Ended with their tres leches cake. Yummmmm.   - The ambience is...unexpected. Definitely date night, quiet, relaxed and comfortable.   - Service is top notch. It's run by just a two-person team but you're never in want of water or waiting too long for your food. We even met the chef/owner! Outstanding.  It's great to have genuine places like this in the neighbourhood. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time at this place, and I felt like I have discovered a gem! The ambience is very cozy and sort of stylish, at least they try. It is very clean.  Two of us on a summer Tuesday evening, and we ordered four small tapas, one large tapa (pad thai) and the viet pork tacos.   All dishes taste fresh. The salad was so crispy, calamari comparable to top notch Italian restaurants. I also really enjoyed the organic options, since that was associated with a wellness initiative.   I am currently waiting for the pad Thai as I am writing this review and already to rate 5 star just for the amazing service and taste. Tapas came one by one with almost no pause in between, which is impressive.   It is a shame that this amazing restaurant only had a few customers, maybe it is the area (families not many single people that eat out often), maybe it's the timing being Tuesday night. I like this place better than susur lee's restaurants. Not only is the menu more inspired, but the price is also much more reasonable.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This is a great local bistro.  The food is excellent and the fish tacos are amazing.  We go here often as our \"lets grad dinner out' place and have never been disappointed.  Everything is made fresh for you.  Staff are friendly and service is good, but can get a bit slow when they are really busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this gem when looking for a local place for our anniversary. We were really intrigued by the Asian Latin fusion, and were not disappointed.  The food was delicious, the wine was reasonable and the service was fantastic.  We decided on an early dinner on a Monday, so there were only a few other people inside, which allowed for the chef to personally visit our table.    We order three small tapas, including three cheese wontons, grilled calamari, and mango salad.  All of which we perfectly cooked, and seasoned.  Each bite offered a different flavour.  We both ordered a large tapa, which we shared, Pad Thai and the Grilled Argentina Steak.  We were really surprised with the Pad Thai since it was so fresh tasting and balanced.  The Grilled steak was to die for, with a butter sauce I could have eaten with a spoon.    I can honestly say I have a hard time choosing a favour item from the meal.    The only reason I have them 4 out of 5 was the decor.  There is certainly nothing wrong with the current decor, and the restaurant is very clean, but there is some room to improve the ambience.   My husband and I have found a new local joint."}
{"text":"Good foods, great services, beautiful decoration and warm ambience. It is a great place to treat your special someone."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, ceviche, calamari , tacos and vegetable bowl was especially delicious"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers  mentioned this is truly a gem in Etobicoke.  Ah, the lemongrass pork. I would definitely go back just for that dish alone. It nice to see the chef actually come out to greet customers. Everything we had  (party of 6) was delicious but the pork was outstanding! Thank you for this delicious culinary experience!"}
{"text":"This place truly is a hidden gem in Etobicoke. The food is eclectic with dishes that showcase influences from South America to Mexica to Southeast Asia to East Asia. I came here with my family and was pleased with our overall dining experience. Everything we tried was really tasty, well prepared using fresh high quality ingredients and with beautiful presentation.  My favorite dish was the fish tacos. The service was attentive and good. The decor seemed a little dated but the restaurant was spotless. The only thing I wish is that the portions were a slightly bigger as I felt the pricing was a bit high for what you got."}
{"text":"The staff are very warm, making many great recommendations. The food were flavourable and good portion size for sharing. There was nothing we ordered, that we would NOT order again. If available, I recommend leaving space for the Japanese Cheesecake. The other stores known for long line up cannot beat this wonderful dessert. Chef cooked many years in South America, incorporating many flavours which goes super amazing together somehow. There were no short cut in any of the dishes we had. The karaage chicken is also the best I had to date in Toronto. Forget about izakaya!!"}
{"text":"This review is for a Saturday dinner. We were a party of four; I was the only meat eater in the group. They have a separate menu for vegetarians which was kind of interesting. The food was really good. I had grilled calamari as my small tapas and coconut chicken curry as my big tapas. Both were really tasty. My vegetarian friends also liked their food selections. Overall, a really good experience."}
{"text":"We found Mai Bistro on a restaurant app, and it sounded like an inviting place for us to check out. It was a busy day at work and we were really looking forward to a nice meal.  Upon entering this inviting establishment, we were very warmly welcomed by our friendly hostess.  Our server was very attentive and made several personal recommendations for both beverages and food, which was wonderful, seeing as it was our first time there.  They specialize in Latin-Asian tapas, and it was a lovely surprise to find four different types of sake on their menu. We started with the Japanese style fried chicken, which arrived very quickly. The chicken was juicy and subtlety seasoned. We also tried the grilled shrimp small tapas plate. The shrimp were just right, and they were served on a delicate bed of mixed greens. Flavorful and nicely seasoned.  We debated over what to have next, and were eyeing our neighbor's meals trying to narrow down the options. This is how we decided on the pad Thai. It has always been a favorite of ours, but we usually only order it downtown at one of our old spots. We have to give Mai Bistro a huge round of applause because when the dish arrived, our table went silent except for the sounds of pleasure emitting from our full mouths. Soooo flavorful, with just the right amount of heat (we ordered medium), and just down right scrumptious!!! Best Pad Thai we have ever had!!  One would think that we would be finished, but no, it was one of those days where work never ends, and when it does you are ready to devour the table itself!  So we ordered yet another dish, which was the grilled fish tacos. Our super awesome waitress suggested if maybe we would like to make it four instead of three so it would be easier for us to share. What a great idea. The chef himself came to our table with the dish, which was a nice touch.   We are not normally dessert people, but after having watched all the other diners order dessert, we gave in. Our helpful server explained us the different desserts they had to offer that evening, and we decided on their three milk cake (which has a very nice sounding other language name).... It arrived and did not dissappoint. It was not too sweet, and it somehow disappeared very quickly.   The chef came around after we polished off our dessert plate, and mentioned that he had just made the chocolate cake that morning... we had just I over hear him say to another staff member that he wanted to make sure that they saved a piece for him to take home for his daughter.... So we shrugged and said to ourselves, why not? So we ordered the dessert special which was a chocolate cake. Wowsers!!! The chocolate cake was not too sweet, it melted in your mouth, and was devoured with a few moments!   Thank you very much to our delightful hosts for a wonderful dining experience!  It was so refreshing to see find a place with such warm service and such yummy food.  We will definitely be back and give their many other dishes a try :)"}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai and the Argentinian steak with shrimp and fries. The dishes are not served at the same time (is that a tapas thing?) so we started with the  Pad Thai and it was bland and very ordinary. The steak & shrimp was much better but starting with the Pad Thai gave us a bad impression. Also we went when it was very busy and had to flag a waitress down to get our order in...worth another try if we have that kind of money to spend but we know of many other places with better food and service for the same $$$"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for food, my studio is in the area and I saw the restaurant daily, for whatever reason i hesitated going at first but when I finally did, I was in for a treaat!!  Great friendly staffs and delicious fusion food. I'm often there for lunch as the prices are better for my budget. My go to dish is the vegetable pad Thai, I've had the chicken pad Thai and am normally a meat eater. But there is something special about they vegetable dish, I really like the multiple textures of the dish, it makes my taste buds happy. Generous portions  Another dish I also get sometimes is their beef pho soup lunch special. I need to go back and try their dinner dishes so I will leave that for the next review!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. Interesting mix of Asian and Latin cuisine. All food is served on communal plates - tapas style.   Be warned: if you are hungry, fill up on carbs at home before coming here - the servings are super small. Even the \"large\" serving portion is incredibly humble.   The service is not too friendly but not rude. To the point, maybe slightly pushy in terms of trying to rush people out of the door before closing (Friday - 10:30 pm close time).   If it wasn't for the miniature serving portions, this would be a gem in the West-end."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, for lunch and large functions, and every time the food is really good and the staff are super friendly! Their pad thai is really unique and has a nice flavour that sets it apart.   Also, if you are a fan of sweets, try the homemade cake!"}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly owners, relaxed environment. Excellent value. Wonderfully fresh fusion of fun, healthy, high quality food."}
{"text":"I am now a regular at this restaurant! All ingredients are so fresh and the chef is very creative with his dishes.  However, some items on the menu are better than others.  MY GO-TOs: Thai Beef Salad, Spicy Jerk Fish (with rice instead of fries), Karaage Chicken, Calamari and Cheese Cake!  You won't be disappointed.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Went there with my boyfriend. We had the special-Mahi Ceviche. It was amazing, very fresh and flavourful, so we ended up having a second order of it. Also we tried the Argentinean steak and Vietnamese Tacos. Both were great. The Steak is a must have. The chef came out and greeted us. Friendly staff and Nice decor. Will definitely be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Mai Bistro is located near the north east intersection of Burnhamthorpe and Dundas just west of Islington Ave.    My old stomping grounds.  The village of Islington is my old stomping grounds in a sense that it's the area my high school used to be before they took those acres and acres of land and turned it into residential land where towers and town homes are now.  The village of Islington has murals on the sides of buildings much like Philadelphia to remind you of how things used to be when things were a bit different.    I swear I had no idea this place existed.  While I live in central Etobicoke there are just so many places to eat in this city that little places like Mai could fall between the cracks.  Mai is a small, intimate place with nice lighting and serves small plates and \"large\" small plates as well.  Basically their menu consists of tapas but it's a mix of all sorts of things.  Fish tacos, Argentinian steak with chimichurri?  Yes we ordered those.  If you want a nice variety of things to share why not?  This place is a nice experience and they also have a nice variety of libations to compliment.  While I'm not really big on small plates (haha) the thing is we literally just ate before coming here.  We had a large small plate for dessert.  Sometimes small plates are just the way to go and if you're going to go that route this is probably the place to do it.  Oh and it's also in central Etobicoke so they're probably the closest place to my home where I can get something that has legit chimichurri.  Looking back at this place, this is probably a good place to bring a date.  Small eating and drinking, intimate..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Food is amazing, I like that it's Asian & Latin. I've been here twice now with different clients as I work down the street. I met the owner on my last visit. Very nice, personable and appreciative of his customers"}
{"text":"Wanted to make sure I wrote a review for this restaurant since my family and I had a satisfying experience here.  The restaurant has free parking in the back which is convenient with motorists.  We sat outside since we had a toddler and did not have to worry about other customers overhearing any screaming or crying.  Main observation was that all items we ordered were delicious, and were cooked by the chef who is also the Owner of the restaurant.  The chef seemed to put a lot of attention into everything he cooked and paid us a visit on a few occasions to bring us items we ordered and check in on us.  It was definitely personalized.  I ordered the Argentinian steak with fries.  The steak was cooked just right (i ordered medium) and the meat tasted fresh.  Also, there was a nice subtle asian spice flavor to the steak.  The french fries were hand cut which made the whole dish satisfying.  Also presentation of the dish looked great as well.    My wife ordered pasta w/shrimp and it tasted great.  Even my son, who is a toddler, enjoy his 3 steak tacos.  We ordered japanese cheesecake for dessert which tasted good but not sweet enough for those with a sweet tooth.  Also, the waiter was very attentive and gave my wife some nice suggestions on the different types of beers offered.  Overall, we left this restaurant very satisfied and was one of our better dining experiences while visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Thai and Latin American? What is this madness? After dining here, I realized it was genius. All the dishes I tried here were good!  The portions are small, but it's quality over quantity here.  Kale salad $8 - This was one of the specials and it was a simple yet tasty pile of kale with sauce and cheese on top.  Garlic shrimp $18 - The rice was chewy and went very well with the dish.  Vegetarian Pad Thai $14 - Great sauce and perfectly cooked noodles.  Tres Leches $7 - Sweet and spongy.  Japanese cheesecake $7 - Amazing cheesecake! The texture was a mix between a regular cake and cheesecake. It was very creamy and delicious.  There's a parking lot in the back of the restaurant with plenty of spots during a weeknight.  You'll see a large painted sign on the wall of the building that says Mai and an arrow pointing to the back entrance.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"This restaurant is like that wine study that people will say cheap wine taste great if served in a way that plays to their ego. Good decor decent drink list averge food bad service."}
{"text":"The mango salad is fantastic. We stopped in for dinner on Monday. We ordered off the short tapas menu and enjoyed everything. The service was friendly and quick. But never pushing.  I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This restaurant was pleasantly surprising. We went in with an open mind and we were blown away with the service and the menu. Wonderfully prepared food, great combinations of flavours and textures. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I also were intrigued by this new restaurant, and went by last week. It was empty while we were there, but we were told they only opened last Thursday. It will take a little while to get their name out there (I can't find their website, but am sure they had one) StillI have a feeling they won't remain empty for long!  We had the Shrimp & Crab Wonton Ceviche, Green Papaya Salad with Home-made Beef Jerky and Fish Tacos with tomatillo salsa and Avocado. All were delicious and served attentively. In fact, our only complaint with the service, was we were served a little too fast!   The chef even came out to deliver the jerky I had asked to take-home. He let us know it had been made fresh in-house and not to let it sit in the fridge. I ate it the next day and it remained delicious.   We will be back and recommend anyone in the neighborhood pay them a visit."}
{"text":"An interesting little place - chosen by my Event Planner girlfriend who always seems to take us to spots that she hears lots of buzz about.   It's a small-ish space that's not sure if it's a Mexican, Asian, Argentinian or Caribbean...but that seems to be part of its charm.  The Chef himself came out to explain our dishes and he made our Mango margaritas, which were yummy!   We went on a Thursday evening and we were the only people in the place by the time we finished - it felt like a private party.   We ordered edamame and fried calamari appetizers to share and between the 7 of us ladies, we ordered fish tacos (one fried and one grilled), jerk fish (gorgeous and so tasty!) and an Asian noodle dish.   All of our food was really very tasty. Service was friendly and we spent about $40 each, (which covered drinks, apps, main, tip and tax). Pretty affordable. There is free parking in the back and street parking on Dundas is free after 4pm.   I recommend you make a reservation to let them know you are coming and that they are prepared for your arrival!  We received good service because we were the only table there - but I hate to think what would have happened if more folks came in.  All in all - a delicious, fresh and pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Amazing ambiance! Absolutely a must! Our new favourite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"The chef is a very personable fellow. Hell speak to you and share his life. The food itself is very good and a different combination. I felt the food was a good fusion and complimented ceviche and bbq pork chops. It was a bit more expensive. Deserts are well received as well. During dinner, food took some time. I don't have any suggestions for improvement."}
{"text":"Wow. This place exceeded all expectations. The food was fantastic. The atmosphere is great, too. The blackened fish and calamari were both outstanding, the pad Thai was the opposite of the typical sloppy, sugary affair - Mai's was complex and flavourful. Everything else we had was great, too.  If you haven't been, go already! We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Incredible food. The chef came out and was a gracious host.  We had a party of 6 and everything we had was fantastic including the grilled pork, Thai beef salad, lamb curry spring roll, shrimp and crab filled spring roll."}
{"text":"Went here while traveling for work. To be honest, I expected it to be better from the reviews and the menu. It was still good, but feels like it has a lot of potential to be even better!  Some of the dishes, like the spring rolls, were not described very well in the menu. I think their menu descriptions need a revamp. The steak was definitely the most delicious thing! And the dessert,a matcha cheesecake I think, was very very good   I'd come back if I lived in the area, but next time I visit, I'll try something new."}
{"text":"Great place for when your craving Japanese/Mexican food - a unique food offering! The food is very flavourful and enough to fill you up if you came in starving like I was.  Don't forget to get the Japanese cheese cake which is delicious."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious, but painfully expensive! Come for lunch if you can because the exact same dishes are slight cheaper!   First off, all the food was expertly cooked and prepared! All the proteins were cooked perfectly and the rest was well dressed and seasoned. We had the grilled calamari (this is delicious and nicely understated), the grilled shrimp and mango salad (there were only three shrimp and a small portion of mango salad...underwhelming and way overpriced), the chimichurri steak and fries (perfectly prepared steak and frittes, the chimichurri was kind of boring and not super authentic tasting, but overall this dish was delicious), and the pork tacos (which were like Vietnamese tacos, good, but not worth the cost). The Maijito (vodka and sake) was really yummy and not too strong, but very sweet (brace for the hangover).  Service was good, but nothing to boast about. The ambiance is nice and definitely has a more fine dining feel than the outside suggests.   I would definitely come back, but only for lunch!"}
{"text":"What a treat!  Especially in Etobicoke!  Food was beautifully prepared, taste was excellent and flavored, good combination of Asian tapas. Shrimp and crab cerviche was so good, and fish tacos and watercress salad with beef too!  Will go back again."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Food and service is outstanding. All the food is made fresh in house. I can't wait to come back...."}
{"text":"Really want to give it a 3.5* but worth more than just a 3* on Yelp.  Interesting combination of food.  Went there for lunch and the place was empty when we arrived with just one other table by the time we were done eating. Hence this is not a touristy place.  The lady recommended the fried calamari, shrimp and mango salad and chicken pad Thai to share for me and my friend which is what we did.  Fried calamari were good but small portion. Sauce was just mayo and siracha.  Shrimp and magi salad was also tasty but again small portion with inky 3 shrimps.  Chicken pad Thai was the worse...taste was blend and I felt that I could have easier done better myself. Keep this item.  We added the shrimp and crab ceviche at the end which was refreshing...again very small.  I know this is supposed to be a tapas place so portion are small but it is a bit on the pricey side so I do expect a bit more food than that.  Overall decent restaurant. I would go back if I'm in the neighbourhood but won't make a detour to go eat there."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  The fried chicken was perfect!  The steak tacos tangy and savory!  Bok Chou was smokey and wonderful.  I could still be eating the mixed grill!  The grilled squid was the best I've had.  This is a must eat place!"}
{"text":"I am feeling super bad to leave a negative review but I am just hoping they can improved in the future and more people to like their food.  We came in in a late night and we are too tired to decide what to have, so we ordered something classic.  Grilled Calamari, Argentina style Steak, Pad Thai.  Grilled Calamari salad is the best out of the three dishes. I could not resist to finish the whole plate by myself and which almost get into a fight with my partner.  The appetizer gave us a good impression on their food and made us thrilled and excited for our main dishes. When my partner's Argentina style steak arrived, I was shocked by the price tag and meat selection they decided. It did not deliver the same quality with their $25 price tag. I hope they can change another style of meat or part, otherwise, it kills people satisfaction  instantly, especially when they earn high rating.  Pad Thai, in general is blend and nothing in there really amazed me.   My partner and I also did a little feedback for ourselves, we think probably we had a bit overhead expectation on a 4.5 star rating restaurant and in which it causes us feeling disappointed after all. In either way, we would still love to come back and try the other food on their menu in order to deliver a fair and non-bias review."}
{"text":"Asian - Latin tapas, what a great fuse. This little restaurant really did surprise me, and this area needs more of this. Every dish that we tried was original and very tasty with great flavours and textures. We ordered:  Shrimp and Crab Ceviche $9.50 - great flavours and texture, but can use more chips. Green Mango Salad with grilled tiger shrimp,Thai basil, and chili dressing $9.50 - our favourite. Grilled Spicy Jerk Fish, mango salsa with crispy fried potato $17.00 - least favourite, but was still very good. Fish was a tad overcooked. Grilled Chipotle Tiger Shrimp Tacos $16.00 - very authentic with the flour tortilla. Looking forward to the fish tacos next time. An order has 3 tacos.  For dessert, we were told all the cakes were made in-house. We ordered the Japanese cheesecake, and boy was I glad I did. I have yet to try Uncle Tetsu for the sole reason the wait is insane, but I must say, this is by far one of my favourite cheesecakes. It was both fluffy, like a sponge cake, and creamy and cheesy, like a western cheesecake, all at the same time. I'm salivating just thinking about it, and I can't help but wonder if I can order a whole cake! That would be amazing.   Service was friendly, polite, and attentive. The chef was indeed a character. He was passionate and very personable. He came out a few times to deliver the dishes and we had great conversations with him throughout our meal. Great guy, Manh is his name!  Will be back.  Parking: There is parking at the back, or there is street parking."}
{"text":"Just happened to pass by this very empty little bistro down the street from my home. Was a little concerned about it being empty, but walked in and was greeted warmly right away by the cutest recently landed Korean girl.  The decor was amazing. Beautiful and well thought through. The lighting piece above the bar was awesome and I want it in my house. The paintings were lovely too and shockingly started a great conversation between me and the hubby (our first art chat!!)  We had our choice of seats, so we took the corner booth near the door, which also gave us a great view into the open kitchen. Menus were distributed (Asian Latin Tapas) (on paper for now as they are testing the waters) and drinks ordered.   We ordered fried calamari (10$) and the shrimp ceviche (10$) and were very surprised when a free bowl of curry chips (6.50$) came in tandem. We think it was either a freebie as they had just opened, or a freebie because they were empty. Both the calamari and chips were hot and crunchy and absolutely to die for delicious. The ceviche was cold and creamy and perfectly balanced. A bit light on the salt, but that is fine dining for you!  For dinner I ordered the recommended marinated chicken with olive salad (16$). The hubby got the Argentinian steak with fries and added a side of shrimp (18$ +8$ for the shrimp). Both were absolutely perfect! The steak was a bit chewy, but it was due to a bit of connective tissue and not the cooking (which was perfect). The chicken was moist (brined maybe) and fall-y apart-y in my mouth-y.  After, we were offered dessert wine or coffee, we politely declined as we were stuffed to the gills. We did have a lovely chat with both Chef Manh (formerly of Supermarket) and Gina (the cutest server ever!) and after about two hours, found our way back home.  Came to 100$ total, including two beers and a glass of house red. Loved it and cannot wait to go back. Maybe tonight."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing best fusion place I've been to. If you are in Toronto and you like fusion food this is the place to be. You have Asian and Latin cuisine in one place. The small and large plate style is a very good way to share dishes. The spring rolls were light and crisp, the curry was seasoned to perfection with a hint of sweetness and finally the tacos were so good and light and well seasoned. I like that I didn't fee overly full everything was nice and light. The customer service was superb. If I ever come back to Toronto I will come and eat here again."}
{"text":"Really good food. We ordered the japanese fried chicken. It was delicious. Then we had the grilled calamari, I fought with my wife over it, simply awsome. Then we had the grilled beef taco. Best taco ever. Finally we ordered the salad roll with shrimp and mango. Again exquisite. The service was good, even with the small kitchen and fairly buzy place, the food came fast. I would recomend the place to friends and enemies. Food was fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly service. If the portions are little bigger,it could be a 4 star."}
{"text":"We just came back from eating dinner here and it was absolutely fantastic. The food is so lovingly prepared and completely delicious. The flavours are so well thought out and perfectly complemented each other. It was also a huge plus that they had a vegetarian menu! We ordered the portobello and goat cheese (my favourite of the night), the baby greens and king oyster mushrooms (the sauce was so delicious), the lemongrass pork (fiancé devoured it), and the grilled tofu with chimichurri and veggies. We were so impressed with the quality of the food and practically licked our plates clean lol. For dessert we had the tres leches (highly recommend) and the cheesecake (not as mind blowing as everything else and very yummy still). My fiancé already can't wait to go back to try more stuff off the menu. The chef is a genius!"}
{"text":"Wow. I had stomach problems and this people made me a custom dish which was absolutely fabulous! I wish you guys all the best. See you tomorrow"}
{"text":"This is a really cozy restaurant that serves very interesting food. Can't say I've ever had Asian/Latin American fusion tapas before. It was really good, we went for lunch in a group of 8, ordered almost one of everything off the menu. Highlights were the grilled calamari, cheesecake (very much like Uncle Tetsu's), karaage (super crisp and moist without being too oily), the lemongrass pork (so flavourful), the seafood platter and their hand cut fries were also very excellent. This is definitely a good place to go with a larger group because then you can get some variety in dishes."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and her little one and we all thoroughly enjoyed the drinks, the food, the service and the atmosphere. This is an excellent little spot."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in... is this place considered Etobicoke? Geography aside, it's an intimate place with great tapas!   Small restaurant so definitely would not recommend groups bigger than 8. Free parking lot located behind the place which was very convenient. All the dishes we had (which was literally half of the menu) tasted great, not one bad dish I'd avoid, which was impressive! However, would like to note that their \"large plates\" are still actually very small and should be shared with no more than 3-4 people. Because of this, one might find it to be a bit pricier than expected, but nothing outrageously expensive. Our party was quite hungry and had to order a lot of repeat dishes so everyone could try a little bit.   Tapas are more of an Asian vibe, and my favourite dishes were the grilled calamari and lamb curry spring roll, but honestly you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. My only disappointment was that I didn't get to try their cheesecake! I'll definitely have to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Beautifully prepared and full of flavour. Large and detailed menu featuring authentic south american dishes and japanese style dishes. Lots of tapas varieties. We had the jerk fish served with a really fresh mango & tomato salsa and fried ribbons of patato. Light and sesoned perfectly. Also the lemongrass pork was very good, and a fried rice and crab dish.  My friend also loves theri pad thai and fish tacos.  We were all to full for dessert but shared an excellent  tres leche cake with fresh strawberries and pomagranit seeds.  The chef made a special mojito with cucumber and sake, as well as lime and mint. Perfect when the patio opens soon.  Not too busy - yet. I am sure it will be as we wil be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time tonight....  Delicious!!!  Atmosphere:  Warm. Cozy. Elegantly decorated. Location was great. Lots of street parking available.  Food:  F'in fantastic! We shared 4 tapas between the two of us. Shrimp ceviche. Mango salad w shrimp. Pork tacos. Angus steak. All were packed with flavors galore. We were full but a nice full where you get tons of delicious meat and lots of fresh veggies and do not feel gross from oily food. The steak was perfectly cooked and the accompanying sauce was mouth watering. I do prefer flour over corn tortilla though so that was a meh for me. Who would have thought latin asian fusion is so perfect. Becareful of their hot sauce dish on the side...holy mama it is hot. They were giving free dessert cake but we were too full to eat it. The chef gave us a spoonful sample of his japanese cheesecake as we were leaving and way better than uncle tetsu. Definitely will come back!  Price: 4 tapas with tax and tip was 80. We were super full. Well priced for quality and portion size.   Service: We came near their closing so we were the last to come in and two tables were there before us. Waitress was friendly and food came out promptly with good timing between the tapas."}
{"text":"As we on our way to the Toronto, Ontario airport, hubby found this place on Yelp. After a lot of time searching for a good Asian dinner, hubby found this little charming neighborhood restaurant nearby and based on the chef's culinary background, we knew this would be a solid restaurant.  Since this is an Asian fusion tapas place, we ordered a few. - Grilled tiger shrimp mango salad with Thai basil, chopped fresh tomato, thinly sliced lettuce with chili dressing (very good and light, sweet, salty and tangy at each bite) - Grilled Argentina style steak (was my least favorite, nothing to wow and was the most expensive dish, but hubby liked it).  It's served with chimichurri butter and hand cut fries.  - Grilled spicy jerk seasoning with grilled tilapia fish with mango salsa (another light dish and substituted the fries for rice, (really like this dish, light) - Grilled steak tacos with salsa, fresh cheese and avocado for my little guy (but there was no avocado).  The lemongrass pork with rice and Asian slaw (tastier than the steak). - Tres leeches cake (I wanted to see how this compares between their version vs. the Mexican Tres Leche which I am familiar with) was a very wet and sweet cake.  The winner is the chef. The chef was classically trained by a Japanese chef so I think this is why his desserts aren't as sweet (which I prefer).  It's more like a light sponge cake topped with whipped cream and fresh sliced strawberries and filled with light condensed milk at the bottom of the cake. The chef's wife saw me took a picture and she told me if she knew ahead of time, she would garnished with flower to make it prettier, very cute of her.  Prices range from $8-10 for small tapas. The large tapas range between $12-$21. We picked the most two expensive dishes on the menu.  Highly recommended this place to anyone.  Sort of on the way to the Toronto airport, they have parking lot in the back.  I would recommend reservations, since this is a small neighborhood restaurant and does get crowded mostly from their regulars.  I wish I could live close by this restaurant so I can be one of their regulars too."}
