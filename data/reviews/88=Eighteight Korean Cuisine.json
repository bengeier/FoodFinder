{"text":"Do yourself a favour and order #22 Pork Do Bap!!! Incredible value at $7.50 including side kimchi and tea. The portion size is amazing and the taste is spicy Korean delicious. 

Wan Jan machida!  Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup with instant noodles. Noodles came on the side so as not to get soggy. I approve. Also, instant noodles in pork bone broth. I mean, the MSG soup is tasty and all, but in pork bone soup? I really should make this more at home. Noodles with pork bits. So tasty.

Decent number of pork bones. Pork on the tender side of things, which is always a good sign. Super flavorful broth. Not too salty. Not too spicy. A goodly amount of pork flavor.

I've also had their bibimbap on and off over the last few years. That's pretty tasty too, and the portion is quite generous, if memory serves me correctly.

Great choice for eating in. They do have daily specials as well. Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"New-ish Korean food court restaurant.  Seemed pretty quiet when I went (the Chinese BBQ place two units down had non-stop customers due to lunch rush).  I got the jajangmyeon meal for $6.95+tax.  Came with miso soup and a really small plate of kimchi.  They had a canister of hot tea (?) where you had to help yourself.  Overall, the meal wasn't bad, but it could've been better."}
{"text":"This place is like Chinese cooking with Korean dish ingredients, or they have god awful recipes.  It's like someone saw Korean food on TV and tried to cook it with no knowledge or experience of cooking Korean food.

Ordered:  kim chi rice, spicy bulgogi"}
{"text":"The young man behind the counter was quick to take my order and the food didn't take too long to make. The pork bone soup was hot and delicious. I wasn't able to finish all my rice and asked for a lid for the styrofoam bowl to take home the rest with me."}
