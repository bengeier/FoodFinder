{"text":"Great atmosphere, outstanding service, delicious food and ohhhhhh the pumpkin cake!!! We'll definitely be back...."}
{"text":"Super delicious and definitely recommended. I order the shrimp and they were sooo good. I willl be visiting whenever around Chandler Mall."}
{"text":"good food, just got it to go so cant comment on the service.  staff was helpful over the phone though.  came rec'd to me by a greek!"}
{"text":"Waited for an hour during lunch. They took my order, waited forever, and ended up having to leave without eating because I needed to get back to work."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and each time has been fantastic. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice, and my server (I think his name is Nick) is one of the best servers I've ever had at a restaurant. On top of that, the food is always delicious. I've tried a few different kinds of hummus, their halloumi cheese, baba ganoush, and chicken shawarma, and I've been consistently pleased by all of them. Their pita bread is delicious--always warm and well-seasoned. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experiences with the following:  Greek salad (perfectly dressed), falafel, spanakopita, grape leaves, hummus, baba, & chicken lemon/rice soup (omg this was perfect). Yeah I was hungry. (Had a sampler plus some extras. Annnnd plenty leftover!) Seriously each item listed above was delicious.   Service: Waitress was prompt, timely & friendly. It was in the middle of the afternoon (the dead zone where sometimes side work or a shift change can cause service to suffer) and we still were taken very good care of. :)   Things that weren't so great:  The chicken souvlaki my friend ordered was extremely dry. Great flavor just tough. :-/   The baklava was cloyingly sweet (yes I know it's a dessert) & hardly any pistachios or pistachio flavor at all. Only could handle a bite of the honey cinnamon sweetness.   I would definitely recommend & come back."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. I eat here once a week. Unfortunately, recently their food portions have gotten smaller and smaller. I have kept going back, in hopes it was just temporary. Today's chicken souvlaki pita had only four small pieces of chicken, 3 pieces of diced tomato, and two slivers of onion. What I was once able to share with my toddler, isn't really enough for just me. It looks like I will have to go down the road from now on."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Probably the best Greek restaurant in Chandler. Food is great, but what impresses me most is the service--very friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"I have had dinner here twice, the first time the service was excellent, and the food good, the second time the food was still good, but the service was a bit inattentive, even though the restaurant was not crowded at all."}
{"text":"We found this great piece of heaven on yelp while trying to find good local food. This place lived up to the hype!  The spicy hummus was the best I ever had. I also had the pork ribs and my wife had the grilled shrimp, both plates were awesome. They serve hefty portions which I like because you get your money's worth and more. The staff was very nice and personable and answered any questions we had for our first visit."}
{"text":"Great place. Great ambiance. Love their patio but inside is cozy as well. Waitstaff is very friendly and I like the prices and the food. Mediterranean Garlic Shrimp wasn't my favorite most of the other food tastes fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"This place was good.  Thanks fellow yelpers - you were why I tried it.   I had the Souvlaki Platter, I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to order.  The lamb was tender and flavorful.  The platter came with a salad and potatoes all of which were tasty.  This restuarant was very reasonably priced for the amount/quality of food.   The atmosphere and service were both good."}
{"text":"This is an ideal spot for a date - cozy, intimate and food that invigorates the senses! We shared an assortment of appetizers: Baba Ghanoush, humus, falafel, dolmathakia and spanakopita. All the appetizers were really good and I must I say the dolmathakia were the best I've had in the valley. Our main course was the Lentil salad with chicken and tabolui salad - sooo good. I have no idea what spices were in lentils but wow they were really good. There was a hint of cinnamon or maybe it was nutmeg, I'm not sure but whatever it is it definitely works."}
{"text":"I love their pitta club sandwich. A lot of food for the price. I also love their greek fries. My daughter loves their version of the grilled cheese sandwich. Everything else is pretty much the same that you'll find at any mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. The platters are great and the potatoes are my favorite. I also love the Greek salad and the wine selection. They also have some great appetizers.  We always get really great service whenever we are here. The wait staff is always friendly and they remember us any time we return."}
{"text":"I was here last night and came back the next day as they reintroduced me to Greek and Mediterranean cuisine and it was wonderful! The service is spot on. Great little place."}
{"text":"The overall feel of the restaurant was nice. The server was very nice and extremely careful about my food allergy. The hummus was very obviously homemade and even the plain was probably the best hummus I have ever had. However the falafel had great flavor but was a bit dry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Excellent food, service is fabulous and friendly.  Portions are bigger than I've ever seen and the price is quite reasonable. Who ever heard of baklava cheesecake? The best of both worlds but only available for special occasions. I'm glad we came in on father's day weekend! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The last time i had Gyro was in Paris France a little over a year ago, at about 1 am after a long night of partying.  It was insanly good! I having a rare craving for a fresh Gyro again,  but was not confident that i would find a good option in Chandler. However, i was pleaswntly suprised and very impressed with the staff, the quality of the food was great and fresh.  I plan on eating here again.  Next time,  i will plan on having some ouzo, i think they have some?   We need some Greek woman working in the place though, to many men!"}
{"text":"Consistency of food is not what it used to be. A couple times food has been overly greasy and lukewarm.  Other times it'll be good. Hopefully, this not a trend..."}
{"text":"My friend and I met for lunch and had a great meal. We both had the chicken Schwarma pita with Greek fries!  It was amazing!  For sure going to be a frequented restaurant of choice by me!!!"}
{"text":"Not a current discovery, but I haven't been Yelping this year.  After major disappointments in Greek and Middle Eastern food in the Valley, I was thinking of keeping Pitta Souvli to myself. I don't want it too crowded for me to get in, but I don't want it closing either, though it seems to be in no danger. Happy hours get you drinks and some  appys at half price.  I thought the humus was bland.  It's too small for groups over 6 or 8. They have a small but good wine and beer list. Odells 5 Barrel IPA - my new fav! And I don't like IPA's.   Over the past year I've had the Gyro Platter which I adore. The meat is crisp but juicy. And instead of fries, it comes with their marvelous roasted red potatoes and a little salad. Stuffed Red Peppers, 2 meals worth of goodness. The stuffing was meat & rice, just like mom used to make. Lamb Souvlaki, tender & well seasoned and cooked. Mushroom Souvlaki... I thought it was boring, just mushrooms.    Sorry there wasn't more. I keep going back for my gyro and roasted potato fix, and I drive from Gold Canyon, folks, it's not next door.  The prices are low, even with our beers, and we've decided to put it at the top of our list whenever the question is asked, \"What's for dinner?\""}
{"text":"Really good Greek food!  Love the Chicken Shawarma.  Great amount of spices.  Have also had the Nutty Chicken Salad, which was good (but not as good as the Shawarma).  Awesome pita bread and hummus.  Wish they had a little more patio seating during nice weather.  We really wanted to sit on the patio, but they could not accommodate our party of 4 because they already had a party of 4 on the patio."}
{"text":"What a great little place tucked into the corner of the Mountainside Fitness complex. I'll admit I drove by for years and never stopped in. Since that first time, we've been back a half dozen times. That lamb burger keeps me coming back, it's fantastic!  It's family owned and operated which is also a huge bonus. Support local families!"}
{"text":"Good place to come for Lamb skewered rare, A bit on the pricey side. All in all seasoning on Lamb could be better, to make it 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"Ordered items to go. Gyro plate (3.5 stars)olives and feta (3.5 stars) and spankopita (5 stars). Gyro meat was just a little dry in some spots. Quick friendly service."}
{"text":"We go here ALL time.  Must try their specialty hummus.  We normally get the Greek Salad with Gyro meat, but we have also had several of the appetizers.  I would highly recommend the Greek nachos, they are insanely delicious."}
{"text":"Just ate here today for lunch for the first time . It was fabulous!  By far the best Greek restaurant I been to.  For an appetizer we ordered the baba ganoush. It was so flavorful. The eggplant had a wonderful roasted flavor. I also ordered the happy hummus platter with spicy avocado hummus. It was delicious!  This was enough food for 2 people.  The staff were all very personable. We will definitely be going back here again!  Thanks Pitt Souvli!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place! I like their lamb burger (which they don't always serve).  The service has always been great and the food is very good. They have nice specials and different flavors of hummus depending on which night you go.  We are a family of four so we've never had a problem with seating, but the place is a little small for larger groups.  We used to live right down the street, but now that we are living in east Gilbert, it is definitely worth the drive to get there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place! We've never had a bad meal in over a year of going here. The grilled chicken salad is the best I've ever had! My husband likes the Lamb Burger. I've only eaten in the restaurant once but the service was great as well. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place. Great food, friendly service, good prices ... need I say more!"}
{"text":"Great food, and the staff is always on top of making sure you're taken care of! Very very polite and friendly people."}
{"text":"We just got take out from here after seeing it on Yelp. I didn't even have an account and felt compelled to sign up so I could write a review. We both got the falafel pitas. I think it was cooked hours earlier and re-fried and given to us. Little hard rocks of  falafel, disgusting. The hummus was not very good either, and some of our favorite Mediterranean places we go to just for the hummus. Considering it was also empty inside I would say that this is one for Chef Ramsey to visit. Would have given it 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, and wonderful service. Family owned business...will definitely return!  :-)"}
{"text":"What a Fabulous place to eat!  It's our neighborhood \"go to\" for a great meal, quiet & relaxing atmosphere, consistently delicious food and very attentive staff. We have frequented Pitta many times and have never been disappointed. If you're looking for a great date night destination-you can't go wrong with Pitta Souvli"}
{"text":"Eat here. That's all I gotta say about this place. It's locally owned, friendly, and most importantly, delicious! The hummus is delicious, the greek fries are to die for, and the lamb burgers...oh my. I've tried lots on their menu and have loved it ALL.  Eat here. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Needed Greek food tonight and since My Big Fat Greek closed I was searching for someplace yummy.  Originally from Detroit where there were amazing Greek restaurants on every corner.  This place was very fresh and really yummy.  Even my kids ate everything on their plates and they are picky!  Plus Elly who helped us was amazing.  Really patient and  helpful.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The amount of food is pretty impressive and the staff was super friendly. The falafel was dry and extremely salty though. Otherwise the rest of the meal was great!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time today. The ambiance is very nice - not too formal, but a nice selection of regular tables and high tables. They were testing out some new wines today so we got to sample 4 wines and give them feedback on them (no charge! (for the wine or our feedback :) ).  We split 2 dishes. She got the falafel platter. The falafel's were done to perfection - nicely toasted on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. They were very tasty as well - not bland at all. I had the gyro flatbread. The meat was tasty and tender. We made the mistake of getting the baklava for desert - which we couldn't stop eating - so we were stuffed! The baklava was honey sweet - but not so wet that the honey was dripping. And was very nutty tasting. All in all a great experience and we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"In the corner of the shopping center at Alma School and Germann (Northwest Corner). Hard to find but the best find yet! Referred there by my mechanic- DELISH!!! Great service better food!"}
{"text":"BURIED TREASURE? This weekend I went strip mall crawling in search of new eateries with interesting tap beer selections.  Found a Greek place buried in the worst location I have seen in a long time. The landlord should pay the business to occupy this space not the other way around.  Anyway, I walked in and was surprised to see this little place had four beers on tap with three I hadn't tried yet.  The beers were good.  The service was good.  The owner stopped by our table several times to chat us up, which was fun.  I liked the atmosphere.  Greek music was playing, the décor was warm, and the owner was working the crowd.  Had a really nice mom and pop hole in wall feel.  Not too busy, not too slow, just right.  This is a new business that hasn't been open long.  I hope I am not jinxing it with this review.  The food was really good!!!  The owner delivered our entrees and the aromas alone were worth the price of admission.  That food was hot and smelled good!!!  We tried the Lamb burger and some kind of Greek lasagna.  Both were hot, fresh, and spicy.  Tried three desserts the crepe, some kind of stuffed puff pastry and got the baklava to go.  All good, good, and good!  The owner brought over a shot of chilled ouzo to finish off the meal.  This place is buried treasure!  Bottom line:  I had a blast at this little place and can not wait to go back and try some different menu items or just sit on the patio and sample the draft beers on a nice day.   If you go; look for the bike shop on the NW corner of Alma School and Germann.  Trust me, the bike shop is much easier to find.  The restaurant is next to the bike shop. Cheers."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant with 5 other couples on a Saturday night. The restaurant is small and appears clean. The a/c was SET at 86 degrees. We have the exact same thermostat at home so I know for sure it was SET to 86. It was so hot in the restaurant that the waiter had sweat rolling off his face while he was talking to us. Gross. The ice in our beverages kept melting so fast that we would ask for more ice. That has never happened to me before. When we asked him about the temperature, he said 'the manager was not in 'to turn the a/c lower (even though the thermostat was right above our table!) but he 'felt our pain'. Then he wiped his sweat again. There was a tall, stand up fan in the corner by the bus station so clearly this was not an issue of the a/c being out for the night. I mention this because it was hard to relax and have an enjoyable meal because it was so stinking hot in there!  The food was good but I found the serving sizes to be a bit skimpy, especially the meat portions. I ordered the pork skewars and I would be surprised if I had 4 oz. of meat. The greek salad was tasty as were the appetizers. I felt that they also skimped on the pita bread served with the meal which is funny because pita bread is very inexpensive. I would consider trying it again, with a coupon, in the winter. On our way out the door, we met the owner. Interesting... The waiter said there was no one there to take care of the a/c issue. Hmmm."}
{"text":"Fig hummus appetizer - wonderful. Chicken shawarma- tender and flavorful. Perokia for dessert - plate locking good. Service - attentive and polite. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and loved it! Everything was great from the lovely little patio to the very friendly staff to the great food! The special chipotle hummus was amazing and my husband got the gyro sandwich and I got the shrimp platter everything was great! Our waitress accidentally forgot something in our order but when we mentioned it she apologized and fixed it right away which I thought was awesome and we felt that we were treated great! Will definitely come back again and we will be bringing our families!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff and kid friendly menu. Nice outside dining area. I personally like the chicken kabobs, pitas, nachos and French fries. If you're looking for a relatively quick, healthy, hot affordable meal this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Ordered lamb burger medium, but next time I'll ask for med-rare. It was very good. Greek fries pretty awesome. Also got chicken shawarma platter, a bit dry but the favors were nice."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here...LOVE it! Fresh, tastey food with friendly service in a pleasant and clean atmosphere. My new favorite in the area!!!  Good management always makes a better atmosphere...and the employees are wonderful too!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times for lunch and dinner, and each time was a very good experience.  Last night we stopped for dinner.  We started with the grilled Halloumi, a firm and slightly salty sheep cheese.  It was served with pita wedges and tomato slices, all seasoned with  oregano and olive oil.  It was delicious, the cheese really was grilled and held up well.  They have an entree with Halloumi and mushrooms, I plan to try it next time we are there.  For entrees that night I had a special, grilled Mahi Mahi, and my wife had the lentil salad.  Both were good sized proportions but not overwhelming.  My wife was very happy with the salad.  My fish was slightly overcooked, not surprising but disappointing.  It was acceptable, though, and I really liked the garlic & olives seasoning.    (An aside -- why is it that no one in AZ can properly cook fish?  You'd think that since we have to use mediocre fish here to begin with, being a desert and all, that everyone would try extra hard to get it exactly right.  Sadly, that rarely ever happens, and never twice at the same restaurant. But I keep ordering and hoping... )    On the other hand, the chocolate chip cheesecake we had for desert was incredible.  It was light in texture but still full of flavor.   I know it was extra good because my wife kept trying to claim my half.   The staff is always very friendly and helpful in making choices.  It's not a big place so if you get there about 6 or later you may have a short wait.  But it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever eaten here, even though I live right down the street and frequently drive past it... What a mistake I've been making by passing this place up! The service was amazing, our server was polite and our drinks were never more than half empty. The food was terrific! We had baba ganoush, chicken shawarma, and the falafel platter. Everything was to die for and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time visitor today for lunch. Great service and food. Had gyro and Greek fries. Fries were crispy and all food was hot. Lots of chopped tomatoes and onions on plate, which I could add to my gyro, if I wanted. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and it was so delicious! Fresh, well seasoned dishes. Spicy avocado hummus with hot tender pita, yummy. Would go back just for the hummus!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the service was outstanding! Nick was our server he made a great impression off the bat. The place was well decorated and looked really nice with a huge patio. The food was outstanding I had the black been hummus and the euro platter. Both had a great flavor the euro was outstanding and the salad was well don't with the feta cheese I will be back."}
{"text":"Saturday happy hour was excellent. Greek nachos, cilantro avocado specialty hummus, Mediterranean garlic shrimp, saganaki, and a bottle of wine were all excellent. The recommendation of the saganaki by our server made the entire meal. I'll drive back to Chandler and Pitta Souvli just for that."}
{"text":"Looking for a good Greek restaurant and found it!  Fresh food, wonderful authentic flavors, cute atmosphere, and service was personable and friendly!  Shared  a plate and it was attractively divided without asking.    Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Okay, so it's been a while since dining here and I just left so this review is fresh.  Wow! The food is fantastic and the service was on point. Just to give you context, I ate here with my wife, three, five and 1 year olds and my father. Yes, we were a packed house.  Our server was so kind that she brought some pita out right away...the kids were really hungry. We put our appetizer order in and it came out right away. Good thing because the kids were restless with hunger.  After we all ordered the food took about 10 minutes to come out and it was phenomenal! I had a greek salad w/chicken, wife had a gyro pita and father had the lamb shwarma platter. We liked our food so much we shared with each other. The lamb was super tender, gyro meat was probably the best I ever had (even the wife was impressed and commented to the server) and my salad actually tasted like a salad and not drenched in dressing.  What a great second time experience and how accommodating the staff was with the kids. Thank you Pitta Souvli...you earned my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Don't plan eating there if you have a party of 6 or more for dinner. The hostess (male) will not accommodate you what so ever. We wanted to try it for the first time due to the high reviews, but that will never happen."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but I hate bad service more. Six of us came here for a work lunch...and an hour and thirty five mins later still didnt receive our food. We were ignored for an hour while we looked on at couples getting seated AND SERVED after us. One of us walked out while the rest weathered on. We obviously asked for our food to go at this point. It had been 20 mins since we asked for everything to go before we figured out they completely botched one of the orders. Im writing this as we sit here trying to make jokes and salvage our \"lunch\" break. Long story short, very poor service, bland hummus and lost customers."}
{"text":"Service is good. The food took a bit longer than it should have. What really drove me away from this restaurant is what happened after the meal. The waitress tried to pick up a very heavy plate and spilled white sauce all over the other person eating with me. Her pants were ruined. She did get napkins but never offered us a comp or a coupon or anything. I would have expected more from a restaurant. Needless to say we will not be dinning here again. Good thing there is another Greek place right down the road."}
{"text":"They have the best dolmades I have ever had. They also have something called Greek nachos that is made with a topping of mashed black beans mixed with melted cheese. The whole thing is sprinkled with feta and really flavorful tomatoes. It's absolutely delicious, and I've never seen it available anywhere else. The decor is somewhat fancy, so it's a nice place to take a date. Everything I've had here is good, down to something as simple as the lemon potatoes. The service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Great small, family-like place with excellent food and service. Quaint outdoor seating area that felt like a romantic oasis with plants encompassing it. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my mom and enjoyed it.  I love their pita bread and the dessert we got, Galaktoboutiko was very tasty.  The lentil soup was very tasty and had a touch of cinnamon, a surprising taste in a soup yet satisfying.  I liked the Greek fries, but the vinaigrette or whatever was supposed to be added to them was only evident on one fry, other than that they had a spattering of feta and some nice tomato chunks.  I do agree that their Tzatziki was a little on the meh side...I've had better at the Greek's Grill.  I liked my food and will be happy to go back."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best restaurant in the valley. Definitely worth the drive from Scottsdale. Fresh ingredients. My favorite dish is the Cyprus Salata.. and the lentil soup. I've never had anything I didn't like here."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while looking for a place for lunch. It did not disappoint. Friendly staff, large portions, food tasted fresh and was cooked as asked. I wouldn't say it's the easiest to find, a bit hidden on the corner among stores and trees. If it wasn't for the stand up sign pointing where to go I would have probably just driven by and not noticing. If the weather permits, they have an outside seating area, very intimate and nice. Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very nice.  It's located in a strip mall location.  The downside is just a bit pricey for the baklava.  The rest of the food was very well prepared and fresh.  One of the best parts is the chicken plate, but the spicy hummus as a appetizer was just perfect.   Try it...won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I guess this place is great if you don't know how the food is prepped. I'm not a fan of olives and I love tuna salads but they normally come together unless requested other wise. I asked them if they could make me a tuna salad without the olives but they quickly denied saying no. I asked what the reasoning was and they said because it is pre made like that. Which tells me there's a possibility it's not fresh. I asked them if they would at least be able to pick out the olives and they said no. So I decided to ask them how old the salad was and they didn't even know. They had to check and it turns out it was made 8/20. Which is now five days old. Not as fresh as I would expect a restaurant to have. I told my friends about it and they all seemed pretty disgusted. The way they even brought it up or didn't bother trying to find a resolution or accommodate was the best part. Great customer service you guys."}
{"text":"Amazing appetizers!  Great portions.  Perfect customer service. Will be back again soon"}
{"text":"If you still haven't tried Pits Souvli, GET THERE! Or, calll for carry out or delivery. Always fresh and delicious!  Our first choice for Greek food in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"Like so many other reviews, we find this place top-notch.  Excellent food and service.  We eat there at least once a week and it's consistently reliable.  Tip:  If you do a lunch, upgrade to Greek fries.  They are perfect here."}
{"text":"Everything from the appetizers to the service is fantastic! Try the angel hair pasta and the chicken shawarma. Happy hour all day on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices. Family owned. Serving sizes are large. The \"lamb burger\" is a treat."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Chicken Shawarma Platter and hummus hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place due to the reviews on here but I advise you, do not eat here unless you want to be ripped off. Let me start by saying that if you're actually greek and grew up eating greek food, you will not like it here. I honestly took offense to how bad it was haha. Not authentic tasting at all. The greek salad was mostly tomatoes and barely anything else. Greek fries were a rip off. Somehow their feta was actually disgusting, maybe because they also put a ton of tomatoes on everything. We ordered 2 orders of saganaki and one of the two looked very shriveled, old, didn't come with lemon, just looked unfinished, and was 1/3 the size of the other that looked somewhat normal. But both were hard as a rock to cut through. Also, people are stating that the serving sizes are huge. That may be the case for the fries and salad, but the spanakopita was a rip off for the price.   All in all, if you want good authentic Greek food, don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Was so sad we we moved father away from this little gem. We always try to have lunch or dinner here when we are back in the area. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Tuesday night gyro special is awesome, of course I add in a Greek salad for myself. The shrimp appetizer is always great, and I believe that it's on the happy hour menu too. My favorite, is the Greek Chef salad. For some reason, I always seem to come back to it. My husband loves the lamb and typically gets a lamb dish. I can't think of a single thing that we've ordered that we didn't like."}
{"text":"Wife and I went a few times... Nothing really jumped out at us as great.  However, nothing was ever bad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Delicious and large portions. Greek salads have so many tomatoes and the very best feta cheese. We had the pita club sandwich and honestly it is enough for 3-4  people. Go there!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner for the first time at this restaurant. We walked in and were greeted very warmly. We were seated immediately and offered drinks. Our waitress Shannon was very friendly and knew the menu very well. The atmosphere had a very nice bistro feel. Our food was very fresh, nice size portions, and reasonably priced. Overall great experience we will definitely return"}
{"text":"My wife picked up so I cannot speak to the decor, service, etc.  I had a gyro pita and the grilled halloumi (grilled cheese and pita) appetizer.  The appetizer was good.  The portions were small, especially for the price.  I have never seen this dish anywhere else, it's worth a try.    The portions on the gyro pita were VERY small for the price.  The meat was a little dry and lacked character.  It seemed especially \"commercial\" for lack of a better term.  Like the mall.  Would be decent \"Greek style\" fast food, if they charged fast food prices.  In their defense there does seem to be a trend lately of middle eastern/ mediterranean places overcharging.  I suspect a conspiracy of some sorts."}
{"text":"Overall, portions are on the smaller side and the value isn't quite there. The beef souvlaki pita that we ordered contained 3 pieces of beef, so we were quickly left eating just pita and veggies. The side servings of potatoes and salad were ok but a little one-note. We also ordered spanakopita which was greasy and saturated, and the gyro platter which was, again, ok but not great. I might be spoiled by the value and taste of other Mediterranean places that I've been to, but if that's the case I'll happily stick to those."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this restaurant by accident. And what a find it is. Absolutely delicious, fresh food with a beautiful outdoor eating area. A new fav for us!"}
{"text":"I went with my family on a Monday night. We were seated quickly on the patio. Our server was so attentive especially since we had a toddler with us. The hummus was creamy and flavorful ans was the tsziki. I combined the two and it was delicious!  I had the greek salad. It was a wonderful size but had a few too many red peppers. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. Others in my party had wonderful gyros. I will be back."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service at a super reasonable price. They have special deals Monday's-Thursday's (half off wine bottles, 3$ off lamb burgers, stuff like that), and are pretty accommodating to any needs you may have. The service is super friendly and the food is super good. Well worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Super nice people, great food and a great value. Check the daily lunch specials, too! Dine inside or out.  My only problem with this place is the fact that I have a had time NOT stopping here when I'm in the area. Even if I'm not super-hungry. It's just too hard to resist. Give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro to-go. Very friendly staff and super fast service. The food was delicious. No complaints here."}
{"text":"One of Chandler Arizona's truly hidden gems. I've now been there more times than I can count. The service, atmosphere, and of course food are consistently fantastic. Their regular menu, along with daily specials, never disappoint.   In my opinion, it is one of the best restaurants in Chandler."}
{"text":"I was in Chandler on a business trip and looking for a healthy vegetarian restaurant; Pitta Souvli exceeded my expectations. I had the grilled Halloumi cheese and mushroom platter. But it comes with potatoes and pita bread, and I'm looking to avoid carbs (yes picky I know). I asked if they could sub those two with extra salad, or hummus, or baba ghanoush, or anything. Yep, whichever I wanted, so I picked baba ghanoush. The meal arrived and it was absolutely delicious. The greek salad was very good; tasty with lots of oregano and not overdressed. The baba ghanoush had lots of smoky flavor and a great texture. They added cucumber slices to replace the pita bread, so I had something to dip up the eggplant. The Halloumi cheese was wonderfully grilled. Overall the food was excellent. I ended up with gluten-free as well; so you could get that here even though it's not something I look for. The service was great too. It wasn't busy and the waitress could see I was alone & felt like chatting, so she and I talked some about books we've been reading. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with wife and kids the other day. So glad we found this place hidden at this small strip mall. Great food options at a great price. Nice outdoor patio. Only thing that s that is not visible or at an obvious location. Hope they are here to stay."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've visited this restaurant.  It's just a block away from my place, and every time, I've had terrible service.  No one in the place knows how to greet a customer.  The last time I was in there with my family, I saw a man standing by the door for at least seven minutes before he walked out.  It wasn't even busy.  We are from California and we eat Greek food all the time.  We were so excited about having one near our place.  Unfortunately, after tonight, I told my husband I never want to come back.  I walked in around 8:30.  They close at 9:00.  We were ordering to take out, but the person at the register, without even a proper greeting asked if we were eating in.  I had to tell him three times we were ordering to go to calm his nerves.  I guess he thought we were going to be a late customer, and I get that, but come on......it was only 8:30.  The last time we were there, we ordered our food before the table next to us, however, they ended up getting their food a lot sooner than we did.  The food was meh....I've had better, but not worth the money and definitely not worth the service.  In this economy, I refuse to pay for anything not worth my hard earned money.  I'm going else where."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour deals on wine and some appetizers. We ordered a bottle of wine ($13.50!) that was delicious. We ordered the pesto caprese bruschetta ($5.00) and greek fries ($3.00) that were both on the happy hour menu.  The bruschetta was very nice, and greek fries were cooked well and crispy, but could have used more garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice for flavor.  The feta cheese used on the dishes was very tasty.  For meals, we ordered a falafel sandwich which was authentic with hummus and tehina that were nice, a chicken schwarma that was just right, and a pesto caprese burger which was outstanding. The desserts were good too, our favorite being the one with phyllo dough filled with mascarpone type cheese...mmm.  The prices were affordable, the staff were very friendly albeit a little slow, but it was a laid back enjoyable evening spent on the patio."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, very clean and food was delicious. Service came with a smile which in my book equals excellent. From what I remember, our party of four had lamb, rosemary potatoes, Greek fries, gyro pitas, and a halloumi mushroom platter.  I'm looking forward to trying something different next time."}
{"text":"Doesn't disappoint. Consistenly excellent w exceptional service. High quality food w reasonable prices. A real find"}
{"text":"I like this for a lunch spot - they've got tasty options ... AND, guess what?  They have LAMB WEDNESDAYS!  I Looove Lamb!!  Their lambrurger is awesome; their lamb chops are great (just order them cooked med rare, trust me) and it's just nice to have a place that offers tasty lamb dishes close to work and for a special price (on Wed's).  I have tried a few other things here and they were tasty, but I stick to my lamb.  The ambiance is nice, relaxed, and darker inside - but still bright enough for a 'business lunch' (ie. it's not \"romantic\" dark).  They also have outdoor seating area, which is great when weather is nice.  Staff has always been nice, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Affordable. Great food and service. Simply perfect especially for a quick meal and drink when on the road."}
{"text":"A couple of words that will make your taste buds incredibly happy - Greek salad! ... So so good!  I've been to Pitta Souvli a few times now & have tried the chicken kabob pita, chicken shawarma pita, & the most recent time, the Greek salad. I was impressed with the chicken on the sandwiches but didn't care for everything else on it so I figured the Greek Salad might be worth a shot. I got a small one and was really disappointed in not getting the larger size since it was absolutely delicious! The salad has lettuce, tomatoes, olives, onions, feta cheese, and dressing. As previously mentioned the chicken is really good so I like getting the salad with it.  The prices are fairly high, especially considering how many Mediterranean places there are to pick from now, however it's family owned which is nice. As far as the service goes, I've only been by the restaurant to get take-out. They're really friendly, however unless you're dining in, I'd recommend calling ahead since the wait times are typically pretty long."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for years, even through a couple ownership changes.  The quality is always consistent.  Best hummus and Greek chicken in town.  The outside seating is great during patio season."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite restaurant ever! The food is fresh and authentic! The staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"A little greek gem that's family ownedand operated :) Food was really tasty,  got their hummus special,  the roasted red pepper & cilantro hummus,  falafel with fries. Yummmy! I'm glad or waiter suggested to go with the special hummus today.  Service was amazing and ambiance was nice and chill.  Great spot for a quick lunch.  Def will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Gyro & burger tastes great, steak fries pretty good, could use a lil bit more seasoning. Only complaint is portion size, gyro meat kind of small & the steak fry a lil small for 2.50."}
{"text":"Super friendly, great ambiance and the food is delicious. The owner recommended the lamb burger and it did not disappoint.  It was a melt in your mouth burger. Also the dolmades were out of this world. Great happy hour and daily specials.  Our server Elly was so knowledgable and friendly. We will definitely be back.  New favorite!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Customer service is amazing. Food is amazing. They have great daily and weekly specials. They also have great wine specials. If you haven't eaten here you absolutely must!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I first time visiting and happy to say won't be last. The food here is awesome! We ordered the Chicken, Angus Beef and Lamb platters and it was all so good. Greek salad was fresh and feta cheese was sharp and creamy. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is sort of hidden but is a true treasure.  I tried a beef pita and it was a super value for the money - very large portion sizes - more than enough for most people.  Service is excellent.  I will definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"Came in a couple of weeks ago with my cousin and we both really enjoyed what we had ordered. We came in during the \"happy hour\" and got 3 appetizers: Baba Ganoush, Tzatziki and Feta & Olives.  My fave was the feta and olives. I liked the Tzatziki but it was a little too minty for my taste.  If there was a way for the mint to be toned down a lot, it would be much better. The pita bread was very soft, fresh and warm. Very complimentary. I'd love to come back and try the Spanakopita, Mediterranean Garlic Shrimp and perhaps see if the Tzatziki could be less minty. Delish!"}
{"text":"Super cute little restaurant tucked away in a strip mall. The interior was very inviting and felt like home. We ordered take out which was ready very quickly. The person taking my order on the phone was very polite and friendly.   Don't get me wrong, the food was good. I had more of an issue with the prices and portion size. I feel like I have gotten equal quality take out for a much better price."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend several years ago, and it used to have awesome food. I hadn't been here in at least a year until this past week, when I convinced some coworkers to go. Unfortunately I think I embarrassed myself with my restaurant selection, because the food has gone seriously downhill. I ordered the chicken shawarma platter. The potatoes were bland and seemed to be basically boiled, cut up, and tossed in some herbs. The chicken itself was dry and tough, and the \"secret sauce\" that was boasted about on the menu was some kind of odd tasting remoulade. The greek salad, pita triangles, and tzatziki sauce were all OK.   Giving this two stars instead of 1 because at least our waitress was friendly and attentive. Because of the food, I do not think I'll be back. I didn't recognize any of the staff from the times I had been here in years past, so maybe it changed ownership/management."}
{"text":"After passing this daily on our way to the nearby health club, I decided to try this with a friend. What a nice place. Contrary to another review, service was prompt, attentive (almost too much so) and we had no complaints. In fact I took a menu so that some day after a health club visit. My husband and I can stop one day soon."}
{"text":"This place has the best greek fries!    I come here occassionally when I'm going to the nearby global bikes shop.  It's tucked away with an understated sign, so you need to walk nearby to stumble on it.    I've been here many times for dinner and lunch.  The staff is friendly and prompt.  The food has a lot of variety, with great portions of every greek food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I would definitely eat here again. They have two things I really like, good food and Coke products.  Having lived in Chicago most of my life I am very hard on restaurants.   This one has many good qualities.   The owners actually work there. This was the first time I ate here even though I had been by it many times. Once I even looked at the menu. It did not have Saganaki on it so I did not go in. I continued to eat at The Big Ft Greek although in the past year the quality had gone down and the prices had gone up.  Now back to Pitta Souvli. It is in a strip mall hidden in the back where they probably don't get any drive by traffic unless someone is looking to buy a bicycle next door.  My friend and I started off with the Hummus. It was a decent size serving for 2-3 people for about $4. The taste was good and it did have the slight sesame flavor of real hummus.  The next thing we got was the Egg Lemon Soup. A Chicken and Rice Soup ($3.50 for a cup) with egg and lemon. Very good flavor and not over salted.   I had the Beef Souvli or Beef Kabob Sandwich $6.50. The beef was flavorfull and tender and not one piece had that vein or fat that you get in many sandwiches. The seasoning was very good and not overpowering.  My friend had the Gyro $5.50 and Fries $2.50. Again very good flavor and not supper greasy. The fries were crispy and seasoned with season salt. Not too thin or too thick.   The service was excellent and the prices were reasonable.   While we were their we met the owner and his wife. They had both met working for Big Fat Greek. George was from Cypress. He told us that most of his employees have been there since they started over a year ago. They have many specials and everything is made fresh. They do have Saganaki. It is a special item that is only on the menu a couple of times a week but if you ask for it they will make it anytime. They age their own cheese for it on the premises.   Next time I am going to try the Lamb Souvli as George promises that it is some of the most tender lamb you will ever eat. I would also like to try the Greek Potatoes as well.   Please eat here as many of the places I like cannot survive in a city were everybody prefers National Chains over quality family owned businesses.  If you care about decor as well as food you will like this place as well. Me, I just care about the food and not the atmosphere. Being from Chicago I'll eat food standing up at a counter in a modified garage if the food is good.  Eat here. If your disappointed you have no Idea what good food should taste like."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Mediterranean restaurant ever! My husband and I use to drive a good 45 minutes to go to a downtown Greek restaurant but not anymore! The best gyro I have ever had and the tomatoes were so ripe and juicy which is hard to get in Arizona! It is pretty hard to find saganaki but they had it and again it was the best I ever had! Plus the staff was super friendly and efficient. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So, I don't really looooove Mediterranean food...but this place was goooood!  I think that part of the problem is that my primary Mediterrean food experiences have been at crappy little strip-mall food-court venues which, as I'm sure you can imagine, aren't QUITE the best food in the world. How it happened that I really had no sit-down Mediterranean food experiences...I don't know. And granted, this place wasn't exactly a \"top-shelf\" Mediterraean dining experience...but it was a far cry from the strip-malls I was used to. The restaurant itself had an sort of industrial feel to it, with pipes and exposed brick, yet somehow seemed light and airy as well...definitely a friendly and casual atmosphere, very appealing for lunch.  I came her with coworkers for lunch and ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Platter, which was simply wonderful! It came with 2 grilled chicken skewers, pita bread, roasted poatoes and a little greek salad. All of it was amazing! All very simple, but incredibly tasty...the chicken was grilled perfectly, the potatoes were tender and flavorful, the pita was warm and soft and even the greek salad was tasty, which is saying a lot because I don't normally love greek salad. No complaints whatsoever!!  The service was a little slow, but otherwise it was a wonderful experience. My coworkers ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Pita and the Chicken Salad as well, and both enjoyed them a lot, so really it seems like the food is pretty right-on. I think this place will become a weekly lunch must, not only because it's tasty but also because it's not terribly expensive...a dynamic duo if I ever saw one!"}
{"text":"This one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I've been coming here for a number of years and introduced lots of friends and relatives who also now consider Pitta Souvli a favorite. Wonderful appetizers and entrees which include dips, lamb and gyro meat, etc. I think their prices are fair and the service is excellent, everyone is very pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place! Classy but relaxed atmosphere. Excellent hummus and falafel, which makes or breaks a Greek restaurant. One of my favorite local places."}
{"text":"We've been dining here regularly for five or six years. We hoped the change in ownership would not mean a change in quality, but the last three visits have been seriously disappointing, and it seems clear it isn't a fluke. The babaganoush was the main reason we would visit, it was a delicious thick dip with chunks of eggplant. Now it and the hummus have been thinned down to almost a watery consistency and the hummus seems to be completely devoid of garlic. The falafel has also been over-processed, it's a fried paste patty. The final straw came when I ordered my once beloved Garlic Shrimp appetizer this last visit. What was once a sizzling dish of large whole shrimp, with tails, simmered in tons of garlic and olive oil, is now a handful of the same tail removed frozen shrimp I can buy a bag full of at Fry's tossed in with a little oil and imperceptible garlic. It wasn't even heated enough to remove the freezer taste. There is no longer anything special going on here and we will most likely not be back. It was a good run, but Pita Jungle's hummus and babaganoush now trump theirs. I am not sure if these are cost cutting measures, or some sort of catering to toddler palettes, but we no longer feel it's worth our money."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and they have happy hour on the weekend! We had the Greek Nachos and a bottle of wine! Can't wait to try some of their main dishes, which looked fabulous."}
{"text":"Best greek food in Chandler. My favorite dishes include the specialty hummus, chicken shwarma pitta w/ greek fries, and the lamb platter. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though!"}
{"text":"This was an unexpected find!  The location is a bit difficult to locate as it's sort of \"around the back\" but it's cute as a button inside.    Our server was friendly and attentive.  My chicken souvlaki was delicious.  I was wishing we had room for dessert!  If I find myself in this neighborhood again,  I will definitely stop back in."}
{"text":"So almost 1 year later, we return. And I wonder why it took me so long. The service is great, non pretentious, friendly, informative & just really nice. The food is impressive. Not too much, not too little, just right in every aspect... cooking, presentation, portion, etc. When you walk out of somewhere & the 1st thing you think is.... have I Yelped this place? - You know that it's really made a mark on your feelings, your thoughts, your need to share with the world the information of a place that is getting it right! It is in the back or side of a strip mall (surprise - welcome to AZ), but when you walk in you are transported to a quaint, welcoming atmosphere, including the patio area. Definitely a hidden gem that I wouldn't pass up!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Pitta Souvli about 4 times per a positive review from someone else and are glad we did. It's a locally owned family restaurant.  The food is always good , people friendly and priced fairly based on portion and flavor. I typically get the gyro platter which comes with a small salad with fresh cucumbers ,red peppers and feta cheese. Monthly they make this baklava cheesecake which is amazing. We take advantage of the happy hour prices on bottles of wine which is a nice addition. They also have various flavors of hummus on a rotating schedule. Those haven't disappointed, the fig and Avocado are 2 we tried and liked"}
{"text":"Busy place, slow service, and bland but tolerable. I think they pay more attention to the decor more than the food."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh, delicious as well as beautifully presented! The portions are very generous. You always leave full and content and wanting to return to try something new on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and boy was I surprised. The food was delicious!  The Lemon Chicken and rice soup was fantastic! Their Pitta Gyro sandwich with the greek salad - outstanding.  I love their menu and the multitude of items you can get and just pick at with a table full of friends.  Its a little small inside but they also have an outdoor patio. They have a wine bar which I'm sure would be nice for dinner time - or lunch if your a lover of wine.  We will totally be back here for dinner some night soon!"}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago and forgot to review, family emergency. However, I'm craving great authentic Mediterranean cuisine and I will definitely be coming here don't pass this place up AT ALL! The gyro is unmatched compared to other places I have tried, it's in a league all it's own. The hummus was fresh and creamy, pitas were soft and warm. Greek fries were out of this world. Reason for my review is I absolutely adore local restaurants that put so much attention to details and I would hate to see them go. Local is the only way to go!! Keep up the great job guys"}
{"text":"They totally blew it tonight!  We had a bad experience about 4 years ago when they messed up our order and did nothing to fix it.  We gave them another chance tonight and they disappointed again.  Our family of four was seated on the patio for about 15 minutes and no one came to serve us.  We were forced to walk out!  We used to really like the food here but will never return again due to the horrible service."}
{"text":"This place was really good! We were pleasantly surprised, since the strip mall exterior did not exactly bode well. We came in just after 5 on a Friday night and the place was packed. Service was very good, attentive and prompt.   We ordered the happy hour appetizer of tzatziki, which was small but delicious. Great pita bread too!    For entrees, we got the chicken souvlaki platter and the chicken shwarma platter, both with Greek fries instead of the regular potatoes. The Greek fries were awesome. Worth going back, right there. The feta was not as salty as it often is, which made them awesome. Both kinds of chicken were good, the souvlaki better than the shwarma. Massive amounts of food, but so yummy.   I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The Fig hummus is fantastic. We also had chicken schwarma platter and the gyro platter which was fresh and flavorful, the platters came with delicious salads and amazing rosemary lemon potatoes. Service was great. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Pitta Souvli is without a doubt my favorite Greek restaurant in the Valley. It is locally owned, has fantastic customer service and the food is amazing. I am a vegetarian and this place always has delicious options for me. However, pre-vegetarian days were filled with their tuna salad which is out of this world :) Don't miss out on an order of the greek fries when you visit!"}
{"text":"Great Family owned restaurant. Service is friendly and attentive. Food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Super yummy! And amazing service! I ordered a bruschetta I don't remember the name but it was honestly one of the best I've had. I also ordered a plain red sauce spaghetti which they gave me a huge portion of and lots of bread. I wasn't able to finish it but it was amazing! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with my family here today. The food was excellent, loved the gyro platter. Service was amazing also!"}
{"text":"Service is a 5 star rating. Food is a 3 unfortunately.  We went at opening on a Saturday and the tucked away restaurant filled steadily. We were instructed to sit wherever and we chose to sit on the patio. The patio had black metal furniture with outdoor cushions on the chairs and an array of different plates at each setting.  Small ficus trees were in planters and lined the patio perimeter. Quickly after sitting, the waitress brought menus for us and the 2 other parties who entered at the same time. Our waitress was fantastic and was always on top of everything for all the guests. She continuously refilled everyone's drinks, and appropriately asked if food was good and if she could get us anything else. The other staff that brought plates and cleared them, were great as well.   The food- I am no stranger to Greek or Middle Eastern food, and we had high hopes for this restaurant based on reviews, but it was just ok food. We ordered a Sampler platter that began with a P and had Dolmades, falafel, Spanakopita, hummus and baba ghanoush. The Spanakopita did not taste fresh, seemed reheated and underdone phyllo dough. The dolmades were a good flavor, hot, served with a bit of marinara(which was odd) and we didn't see meat, the Falafels were very dry & crunchy and tasted not fresh, the baba was very garlicky but good and hummus was a typical plain but good, but both were much creamier than we are used to and the pita bread was very good and freshly warmed.  Since everything was just okay, at that point I ordered only a Greek Salad, which seemed fresh and produce was chopped in large chunks. Nothing to write about and my husband ordered the Gyro plate. I have never had gyro meat like that, never ever. It was large weird cuts, pretty bland, pink in middle and a weird texture(almost soggy). It was not a typical gyro meat. Fries were large and tasted fine. I don't know what happened, felt like we got the leftovers from a new cook. We won't be back.  Again the service was excellent, but that is it."}
{"text":"We loved it. Came here with Greek family and they LOVED it!! Try the sampler appetizer plater....great variety! Portion sizes are very generous, and the staff is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some colleagues last week and had a delicious lunch. Everything is homemade, fresh, and clearly made with love and care. I got a lamb plate with rosemary potatoes and greek salad. We also got a special avocado hummus that was pretty incredible with the fresh pita triangles.  The only thing keeping this from five stars for me is that I felt the portions could have been a bit bigger for the $$. But quality wise, no complaints at all!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic experience!  The food was extremely tasty, and very filling.  The owners even gave us samples of two different dishes just to get our thoughts on them.  One of us had the Chicken Shwarma, one of us had the grilled Greek wrap with Gyro, and the third of us had grilled eggplant and Halloumi cheese.  We all three loved it!  Great food, affordable price, and fantastically friendly folks.  We WILLbe going back again!"}
{"text":"Okay food, unattentive service , way overpriced and really not much better than any quick gyro to go joint.  Why can't places like these provide a simple nice experience?!? I would not go back."}
{"text":"First visit here and it was tasty. I had the salmon dinner which was good but a bit well done for my taste. I like my salmon a little more moist. Service was good. I can't wait to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and found this little gem on Yelp. Ordered the Spicy Hummus Platter with half chicken and half beef. Absolutely delicious.  Accompanied by a glass of their Greek Blend White Wine.  Cute patio, perfect weather, and my server was awesome. Gave me a tasting of the wine before I ordered as I couldn't make my mind up between the Chardonnay and their special Greek blend. I'll definitely be back and bookmarked as one of my faves."}
{"text":"When you go off looking for \"new\" places to eat,  it's easy to be pensive about those places that lie outside of the typical food chain. When I think \"Mediterranean\", what comes to mind easiest is Pita Jungle. But sometimes something catches your eye, a smaller place, a single location. This was definitely that place.   The atmosphere was brilliant, down to the beautiful outside table settings enclosed in a little bit of nature. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly, quick with service, and extremely knowledgeable about meals that appeal to different tastes. Watching other customers, I could see a few were regulars, and they were treated like old friends.   And the food! I had the Caprese Burger, medium, and it was fantastic. The burger wasn't skimpy on the meat, it was cooked exactly as I had imagined, and the ingredients and cheese taste amazingly fresh.  The Greek Fries were amazing as well, and we're - not - in a skimpy portion.   My girlfriend had one of the Flatbrreads, which she had expected to be one of those personal sandwich sized pieces, and was pleasantly surprised when it came in the size of a small pizza! We couldn't get over how each ingredient on the Flatbread could be picked out and tasted individually, nothing blocked out anything else, and it all just looked so vibrant.   And the dessert ! Oh, the dessert was fantastic! Since we couldn't decide between the Baklava and Pourekia, the waiter suggested a half and half plate for the same price as picking one and not knowing about the other! The phyllo dough was delicious, the fillings were fresh, and the honey just made everything so much better. We ended up sitting there taking everything in for almost two hours--a real rarity--and we never felt rushed to move on. We will DEFINITELY be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We always get takeout here, the food is delicious, but the restaurant leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"These guys are great! Pitta Souvli has been serving fresh Mediterranean cuisine since 2007. It is owned by a family that has lived in the Chandler area for years and has built a loyal following. What makes them great is the genuine customer service, the fresh ingredients and great prices. Don't be fooled by the fact that they are in a little strip mall. This place has a nice warm intimate feel to it. I usually get a pita sandwich and a side order of hummus when I come here. But they also have a variety of pizzas, salads and desserts. This is one of those places that you don't feel bad about being stuffed when you leave because it is all so healthy. It's a great place to stop in for lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Always something different on the menu; love this place. They have one of the delivery apps too. If you like mediterranean, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best baklava I have ever had, and I have been to Greece and Turkey several times.  Baklava cheesecake also to die for if they have it in.  Also, a different hummus every day!  We love trying them all.  Dinner is great and pretty big, but also pretty healthy.  I would highly recommend.  A great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"We hit the jackpot finding this restaurant.  Quaint place.  Absolutely wonderful service.  Food is absolutely delicious and phenomenal. Would highly recommend this place for a fabulous Greek meal"}
{"text":"A fun visit to Pitta Souvli! Had the chicken schwarma which is good but just not the same as Doobie's. But since Doobie's closed, this will have to do. My son had the falafel platter which was good, but the trouble with falafel is that if they are over done, they are hockey-puck-like in texture. Our companion had the special which was a mediterranean burrito. It was awesome.   We live in El Mirage so it's over an hour drive for us to get to Pitta Souvli but it is worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant I've ever been to! I always get the appetizer platter that comes with grape leaves, spanikopita, falafel, hummus, etc. because they're all so good that I can't choose just one thing. The owners are friendly and food is always served fresh and quickly."}
{"text":"Love this place! !!  The food is wonderful! So Delicious!!!! Beautiful patio...can't wait to come back! The Greek fries are GREAT!  So is the spanakopita...the best I ever ate."}
{"text":"Best gyros I've had in the East Valley so far.  The place is nice, but the service was very slow when I went there with a group of people for lunch.  It was my first time there, and maybe I caught them on a bad day?  I'll definitely be back again..."}
{"text":"I've been eating Pitta Souvli over the last year or so, and this place just doesn't ever miss a beat. Hands down the best Mediterranean food in the valley, and I've been everywhere. The hummus is exceptionally wonderful and my favorite go-to has always been the lamb. One of my favorite things about the lamb is how much they insist to not get it to go, but to enjoy it in-house like it's meant to. They really take pride in their food, and I wish more places did.  On top of the best food that never fails, is the service. The owners go to great lengths to make sure the customer experience is just as good as the food. The staff is AWESOME.  If you're thinking about trying Pitta Souvli, just get in the car right now and get your grub on. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I admit my spouse is a bigger fan, but the food is fresh and authentic in style. We go often as the lighter fare is a nice break from traditional american cuisine.  They regularly have coupons in the val packs which arrive in the mail monthly making a full meal out hard to resist."}
{"text":"I eat here about once every three months. Love it. Food is always fresh, servers are great, atmosphere is cozy too. Good food, fair prices."}
{"text":"The food is always fabulous. I love the atmosphere and warm smiles. They are a bit pricey but so good. I've had their food catered and everyone raved."}
{"text":"My bf and I went to Pitta Souvli this past Thursday evening around 6pm. It is a small, locally owned restaurant (with additional patio seating) tucked in the back corner of a strip mall. The ambience and decor are very relaxing and not over-done  -which could mean the focus is on the customer service and quality of the food. The wait staff were very attentive and pleasant.  We ordered the Greek Nachos and Chicken Gyro Shawarma Platter.  The nachos were light, but filling and were not over-powered by the feta. The chicken was tender, juicy, seasoned, and over-all tasty. The red potatoes that came with the platter were very good, almost like smothered potatoes - but not a gravy, more like a olive oil and herb mix.  Overall, I thought the food was flavorful and tasty and it's not pretentious -  beats a lot of the other chain \"greek\" places. And the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Very good place. I ordered the hummus and a gyro pita-- both of which were very good. I made my order to-go so I didn't get to sit down and observe the service or anything, but I can say this place is very very cute. Great little lunch spot. Only thing that kinda bugged me was that I had a coupon for a discount on an appetizer and the girl wouldn't honor it because I had a take-out order. But whatever, it wasn't that big of a deal. I'll probably be back if I ever get a craving for some decent Greek food."}
{"text":"We had lunch here a couple of weeks ago, and it was very nice. Nice patio area, and the service was very pleasant.  Gyro was quite tasty and plentiful.  We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We like to support the local restaurants and this place never disappoints. I enjoy all of their salads & the melitzana tower with eggplant & halloumi. My son/husband like the gyros and they also have a good kid's menu that includes milk & juice (not just soda for those of you who actually don't feed your kids soda!). The black bean hummus and warmed pita are always delicious."}
{"text":"Charming little restaurant with a wonderful staff. They have the absolute best lentil soup I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Very good food, if it was cheaper I'd eat here every day.  The Gyro is about $9 and is big and tasty, but $9 for a gyro?!  Best to go here on a Tuesday, 2 gyros for $10.  I wish they had that special every day.  They have a grilled cheese  over pita appetizer that is to die for.  When my wife described it, it didn't sound great.  When I tasted it I was convinced.  Also, the Greek fries are awesome, but HUGE, plan on sharing.  My wife points out that the Greek chef's salad is also awesome."}
{"text":"What a great find! We enjoyed the food. It's nice to have a local Greek place that has table service. The beef and chicken souvlaki platters were yum! The lemon potatoes are great, if you enjoy lemon (and we do!)  They took good care of the kids too! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great hummus, great wine, great atmosphere. Hidden little gem that I love visiting."}
{"text":"Im Greek so I know what good Greek food is about. The food there is excellent.  The food  has a bit of a different twist; probably because the owner is from a Greek Island; and the cuisine is slighlty different.  Its about as good as youre going to get out here in the valley for Greek food.  So unless you want to go to Chicago's Greek town on Halsted street; this is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great atmosphere, kind service, amazing food. Not a salad lover but their Greek salad that comes with the platter is amazing. The pitas are the best I've ever had. The meat was tender and juicy. Very reasonably priced, would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Really great neighborhood spot very authentic Mediterranean Cuisine gyro meat is fresh and  not too saucy clean presentations. Chicken kabobs are great."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Everything we tasted was fresh and delicious.  I'm used to Greek food being greasy and heavy, but not here.  Everything was light, and the schwarma was almost like eating a salad.  Great atmosphere as well.  Also you have to try the cheescake.  I know that's an odd choice for a Greek place, but they make it in house and it's delicious.  We also enjoyed the Greek fries.   The feta cheese made it perfect.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New Owners really take pride in their food and restaurant. Great service, tasty food. Lamb dishes are my favorite but it is all fantastic. Don't miss this gem of a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great option for eating or taking out.  We've eaten here on many occasions and the food is delicious.  This is not a quick dine place, plan on relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere and drinks.  We have also have take out here - it is packed well and tasty!   We love the specialty hummus.  The cilantro is my favorite."}
{"text":"This restaurant just became my new addiction, it's a gem.  All around fantastic!  I just started a new job in Chandler and was looking for a place for lunch and tried this place out. It is tucked away in a strip mall near an Auto Zone.  It FAR exceeded my expectations from food to service to ambience.  The restaurant is beautiful yet comfortable with a lovely patio and relaxed atmosphere.  I was immediately welcomed by friendly staff.  The menu selection is great and it was hard to choose.  I chose the lentil salad. A very generous serving beautifully presented. The lentils are warm and cooked to perfection and are really flavorful and frankly blew my mind. This is not your ordinary lentils or your ordinary lentil salad, it's spiced to perfection.  Some lucky person's mother cooked these lentils I am sure. Served with warm luscious brown rice and fresh greens and flavorful tomatoes, with a generous sprinkling of feta cheese. It included 4 triangles of warm fresh pita bread.  This wasn't an ordinary salad it was serious comfort food. Service was gracious and friendly. I am really looking forward to going back (tomorrow maybe?). I will look no further for a favorite lunch spot or take home dinner spot - I've found it."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for convenience and it tasted great! It was the Tuesday special Gyro / Chicken Shwarma Pittas :)"}
{"text":"In the amount of time that I just waited on hold to place a to go order, I could have just driven there and ordered. Thanks for nothin!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  Great food and company.  Vegan options are available just ask for recommendations.  I love the lentil salad!  Other vegan options are falafel, stuffed grape leaves and try the greek fries (ask for no cheese for vegan diets).  Prices are very reasonable and they have happy hour.  Save room for dessert.  The lentil salad I ordered and took home lasted me 3 days."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for really yummy  mediterranean food.  Not only is their food delicious, the staff here is very nice, and efficient, making for a pleasant dining experience.   I love their Chicken Souvli.  It is marinated to perfection, and always comes out juicy and flavorful. The salads are wonderful as well.   The added bonus is, I feel like I'm eating healthy when I'm here."}
{"text":"Awesome food for a great value.  The PS staff members are awesome, especially Nick.  He remembered our names and orders after not seeing us in almost half a year.  Great place to eat and hang."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Tonight was my 3rd time eating here, 3 different dishes, all fantastic. Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I usually go for quick street food when it comes to Greek, but I wanted a nice relaxing meal. Had to order the lamb souvlaki because, you know, lamb. Ordered it medium rare and it came cooked to perfection. Juicy and tender and well seasoned. Impressed, as most places screw up cooking such small pieces of meat. Not these guys! Lemon potatoes were also excellent and the side salad was the tastiest I've had at any Greek joint. I feel like they used a quality olive oil...and the generous amount of feta didn't hurt! Wish I had room for an appetizer or dessert. Will definitely come back here the next time I'm visiting AZ.  The only negative is just a pet peeve of mine from my beer snobbery - good beer served in an ice cold glass. Cold kills the flavor and they have some good stuff on tap, a shame."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this restaurant when me and my date were looking for a place for dinner. The selection that night seemed pretty average, nothing really stood out as a must have. My veggies weren't overly buttered like most other placed and they do have a decent beer selection. I wouldn't mind coming back here every now and again when the mood hits me right, but this place doable."}
{"text":"I go here with a friend of mine often and we order the Happy Hummus Platter and share it. It is not only delicious but also fresh! We have also had the greek fries and the chicken pita which are also amazing. The service is GREAT, the waitresses are so friendly and they keep our green tea filled! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate at this place when I was in town. Not only is the food over the top, but so is the customer service. We had the sweetest waitresses which made the whole experience that much better. I highly recommend this place to anyone in need of satisfying a hungry tummy!"}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place; it's our new local spot for Greek food! Our server was sweet and attentive, and the owner was very friendly. My husband and I ordered a Gyro platter and a plate of Greek fries, and it was enough for the two of us to share. The gyro meat was tender and so flavorful. The prices were very reasonable, and I'm excited to go back during their happy hour."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Love this place. My husband and I try to eat dinner here at least once peer week.  The food is always delicious. I especially love the shrimp appetizer. Happy hour is awesome and they have a great wine selection. If you like cabs, I really love Old Soul. Besides the food, what keeps us going back is the service. The restaurant is so quaint and personal. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. So happy to have a great neighborhood restaurant close to home!"}
{"text":"I was craving Greek food for some reason and decided to give this place a try since it was nearby home. We made it for happy hr so we ordered a bunch of things thinking that their portions would be small but we were wrong...it was like whoaa we ordered way too much! We got the  Spanakopita, Greek fries, Greek nachos, Falafel Mee Tahini that came with pita breads, & Hummus which also came with pita breads. Lots and lots of carbs!!! Mmmmmm! It was so filling! .The happy hour prices for these are well worth it. Greek fries or Nachos for like $4 bucks? Everything we ordered had feta cheese on top with big slices of tomatoes and everything was tasty. Especially with their Tzatziki sauce. Next time I stop by I want to try their Greek salad and something on their dinner menu."}
{"text":"The food here is always consistent. The service is fast and friendly. The lunch portions are great! The saganaki is a MUST! They also have a chipotle hummus they serve on occasion that is amazing."}
{"text":"I've only had their special salad with couscous and I add meat. It's AMAZING. I crave this salad. Everything is fresh and crisp. Add gyro meat because it's super juicy and moist. It's a small place but I enjoy going!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice people, comfortable atmosphere. Lemon chicken rice soup was good. Chef's Greek salad was generous and I was impressed by the quality of the mixed greens. I would happily order this again. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the pita. I got what I assume to be one very small pita cut into quarters with my soup and my salad. It wasn't bad. It was serviceable but had no personality or love in it at all - exactly like it was delivered in a plastic bag from a factory. If I make the assumption that Pitta is the same as pita, then I would expect the restaurant namesake item to be more remarkable. Go here for the food but certainly not the pita.  You can do better than this, guys."}
{"text":"While in Chandler on business a couple of my coworkers from PayPal took me here for dinner.  What a nice surprise.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I ordered a Greek Salad and I enjoyed every bite.  It s quaint little Greek restaurant tucked into a strip mall.  Well decorated and comfortable.  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is looking for Greek Food.  Thank You for a great experience."}
{"text":"i love this place.  i've been here a handful of times.  the staff is always very helpful & sweet... my boyfriend recently brought me in for valentine's day and it was perfect.  they were a little busy but that's expected.  i had a glass of greek white wine that started things off right... we ordered the red pepper hummus with cucumbers and hummus... and it was delicious.  the cucumbers were fresh; the hummus had the perfect amount of spice.  yummy.  my boyfriend had the pesto burger... which was absolutely amazing.  i know, i know... burger at a greek place.  but trust me!  the burger was cooked to perfection and he said it was the best burger that he's ever had.  maybe i'm lying about that... but it really was yummy.  i had the ahi tuna & greek salad... which was on the valentine's menu.  good... good... i'm pretty stuck on the gyro but it was a nice change of pace.  a little lighter than what i'm used to but still tasty.    i was able to order some baklava to go.  ORDER THE BAKLAVA.  i haven't been able to find any that compares... it's that great."}
{"text":"Dropped by today for lunch. Had the Grilled Vegetable Platter. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. Definitely recommend if your skipping meat. Especially on Fridays during Lent. The patio was cute but needed music to set the ambience. Our server was sweet. Loved her black & white striped top. This should be the uniform for all severs. Classy & professional."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Where do I begin? The humus was awesome. The main courses were all DELICIOUS. The atmosphere was inviting (the patio is to die for), and the service was incredible. There is an extensive wine list and a good selection of beer as well. The new owners have done a fantastic job. Hands down, this is one of our favorite places. It's a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"This place is much improved from the first time we dined here. The new owners have really made this a great little place to eat Greek food. The food and the service are very good here and I highly recommend giving them another try if, like us, you weren't that impressed with the restaurant previously. By the way--the belly dancer is gone, too."}
{"text":"We've been to Pitta Souvli three times now and have greatly enjoyed it all three time.  If you want crazy, over the top flaming cheese on swords, go some place else.  PS is comfortable and family friendly with fresh, tasty food.  We've enjoyed three different hummuses that were awesome. My favorite was the spicy pesto hummus, but all were great.  I'm a gyros fan and have had it twice - moist with the perfect amount of caramelization. The pitas have always been fresh and perfectly grilled to hold up to what you put on them.  Did I forget to say everything was fresh?  Crispy vegetables in the salads, just made tzatziki and tasty freshly made roasted potatoes.  We've also had the pork and the chicken souvlaki. Everything had been very good.  Now the desserts: baklava, carrot cake and peach cheesecake.  Need I say it again?  All were just what we needed.  It's looking like this will probably be a regular trip from Maricopa!"}
{"text":"I do think the prices are a bit high on some things... only the smaller plates and \"sandwich type\" foods are under $10... all entree's are higher than $10. Many of the entrees are overpriced by 10-20%. The food ranges from good to great - no telling what it will be until you try it.  They don't have saganaki on the menu but they have it... you sould pass anyway, it is not that good. I had better at the yearly greek festival, really!  The potatoes they give with all entrees are so-so. They should offer a sub of one of their other apps - these are MUCH better.  I recently had an entree special, stuffed pork chops - they were excellent. Good portion for the $15, very satisfied with this dish.  I've also catered a large party with a mix of their platters, etc... good value for these and good quality and flavor... recommended."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I love me some Mediterranean food.. and this spot might just be the best I've tried so far!  Came to check it out after meeting the owner, Lisa, who mentioned trying out their vegan options. After finally making it in, we ordered 4 appetizers, which are $2 off from 2pm-6pm. Score! We got the falafel plate, the bruschetta, Greek fries, and hummus sampler.. all were phenomenal! Highly recommend the bruschetta.   The restaurant is clean and beautiful.. and everyone here is very friendly. Just adds to the overall wonderful feeling. And the nap afterwards was epic!  10/10 would come back"}
{"text":"The hummus and bread was delicious. We had the spicy avocado hummus. You don't get a lot of hummus or bread was the only downside. I'm used to getting a generous serving at Mijanas or Haji Babas. The meals, on the other hand, are very generous in portion sizes. Some come with salad and bread. The tastiest thing was the gyro pita sandwich. I had the chicken souvlaki (SP?). It was alright. Came with tasty potatoes. Next time, I plan to get the gyro wrap. You really just can't beat hummus and gyro at a Mediterranean place. Everything else just isn't as tasty. Cute outdoor environment. Good service."}
{"text":"If you want Awesome, yummy Greek food... In a low key yet elegant ambience.... This is your place!  I love this place especially after a long, tiring day!  I just wish that they could answer the Phone in a more timely manner!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am up in the Chandler area visiting friends this is a go to. It's tucked away in a little strip mall and is a secret I want to keep to myself here in Tucson. Locally owned Mediterranean with a revolving menu. The have something to offer for everyone. Small but cozy every table inside has a view of the kitchen and friendly staff. They have small plates to big shareable platters to sample. The staff is knowledgable and can make a recommendation to suit your tastes. The happy hour offers great deals of you are checking it out for the first time.  If you are a first timer you have to try their hummus made in house and the dolmades. Portion size is great and everything tastes fresh. Make sure to ask about the rotating cheesecake flavors.   Faves: gyros, Greek salads, and red pepper hummus"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant more than five stars! The food was amazing! I got the chicken breast souvlaki platter and it was so delicious! The service was impeccable. Our server, Valerie, was so nice and understanding of my two year old son who can be a handful at restaurants. We didn't wait long for anything and were constantly being checked on but not so much where it was annoying. My kids really loved the markers for coloring to keep them busy. And I can't gush enough about the lovely patio. I am definitely going to be making this a regular spot for myself and my family."}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant through Chandler Living and went 3 times in one week.  Love the food and the staff is so friendly!  Portions are very large and easily shareable.   Everyone I've taken there has raved about it. Love the patio."}
{"text":"Really nice cute place, friendly staff, food is excellent!!"}
{"text":"A new year and a new restaurant favorite.  Monday's - 8$ burgers (three creative ones to choose from) Tuesday - 2-4 -10$  Wednesday-lamb 1$ 2$ 3$ Thursday - wine down Sunday - all day happy hour  2$ off glass wine 1/2 price bottles  Reduced beer and appetizers  Happy hour 2 to 6 daily   Greek burger fantastic  Chicken wrap awesome  Greek plates. All good.  Tasty.   Very nice service"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and although it was a tad bit difficult to find we're glad we made the extra effort to find it.  Cute quaint restaurant with very good and reasonable items on their happy hour menu.  We got the Falafel mee Tahini, greek nachos, hummus, and greek fries.  My favorite was the greek nachos.  This was more than enough to feed both my husband and I with left overs to take home.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it first opened. This is the best Greek/ Mediterranean in the area. You just can beat the fresh flavors and quality. Really a treat."}
{"text":"Hidden gem right by the gym we go to. Staff is friendly and attentive. Food= quite a variety of selection. Taste= super!   Husband got the chicken pita, it was fresh and so delicious. I got the gyro flat bread= this could have easily served two. They are not tight with the toppings and it was well worth it. The fries alone are enough reason to go here."}
{"text":"Great place I love the Greek wrap with Greek fries  Quick service  Nice staff and welcoming atmosphere"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for good food, make sure to stop by this wonderful Mediterranean restaurant. Easily the best I have been to. The staff and owners offered excellent service and you can tell they really care about their customers and the quality of the food. The Bruchetta, hummus plate and chicken sandwich were all excellent. Need to come back soon to try out the rest of the menu. If you like Pita Jungle, Pitta Souvli will be your new go to spot."}
{"text":"We walked in and awkwardly stood at the front door. The woman who seemed to be the owner or manager looked up at us, and then looked back down. It was not until a nice young man turned over and saw us that we were greeted. We sat down and waited for well over 5 mins before anyone even made eye contact with us. Even then, no one came to our table to get our drink order. I finally had to walk up to the register to get someone to come and get our order. Then she explained that our waitress just got a big table, and that is why no one helped us. Completely understand, but the owner lady could have came over and taken our drink order, or the young man, or the lady who finally came and helped us. Kudos to them though, they stayed positive and were very friendly and polite.  The food was good. We got the hummus trio, gyro platter, and grilled cheese. The fries are thicker, but surprisingly a little bit crisper. Do not get rice, it is literally mushy plain rice. Was not use to that compared to the other Greek places we eat at. Would I go again? Possibly, only if our first choice Greek restaurant was not open again."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Was able to make gluten friendly options.  Like other have said, it's a hidden gem and has a nice little patio for dining al fresco.  Nice menu and some fun takes on traditional dishes."}
{"text":"Been here many times and for some reason have spaced out and forgotten to write a review. PS is great. Have never been disappointed here. Food is always well-prepared and served hot by friendly staff. The souvlaki dishes are wonderful--lamb cooked to perfection and chicken done well also. Fresh Greek salad and moist and tasty potatoes served as accompaniment were also wonderful. Decent wine list too. And ya gotta try the lentil soup. It's waaaaay good. The entree skalds are outstanding. Will return again and again."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with a friend. Amazing food!!!!! And such fast service! Warnings- portions are huge!!!! We order numerous items and it was seriously all amazing! The Greek nachos were delicious and you have to try the sweet and spicy hummus!!!!"}
{"text":"We were regular patrons at Pita Souvli, but will not be going back after experiencing a declining quality in the food.  We ordered three appetizers this evening, plus gyro pitas.  The only decent part of the appetizers were the tomatoes.  Everything was cold.  The falafels were actually burnt and very dry. The dolmades must have been soaked in vinegar for a day, and were complete mush - inedible.  The fried cheese was dried out.  The pitas were just okay but the gyro meat was dry.  We have discovered a new Greek restaurant and will continue to go there even though the drive is farther.  What happened????"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the BF today to give this place another try.  It was a beautiful day so we sat on the Patio, which is quite charming.  We got there during their daily happy hour which is from 2-6.  I had a glass of wine...$2 off, and the BF had a Kiltlifter, also on HH special for $5 I think.  Tried the greek fries again.  They were good, but I still wish they had more of the sauce/dressing on them.  Lot's of feta though.  The BF order the Chicken Shawarma pita which he said was really good.  I had the Cyprus Salad which was amazing!  Mixed greens with the grilled Halloumi Cheese along with herbed couscous, grilled onions, olives, tomatoes and feta.  Soooo good!  The BF was still hungry so he ordered the Pouekia, phyllo dough stuffed with cheese, fried and drizzled with honey and dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar.  Amazing.  Really my only complaint was the water.  Tasted like dirt.  The other table seemed to like their water just fine, but I just couldn't stomach it.  Service was amazing though and all in all, we left full and happy and anxious to go back."}
{"text":"Really excellent Greek food, the best and most authentic around. They have a very extensive app menu ( saganaki...mmmmm) and a nice happy hour selection, that said they serve beer and wine too. Service is consistently excellent and the prices are reasonable. TRY THE VEGGIE PATTY! UNIQUE AND DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"If you want Greek food, this is the place to go!  Cute neighborhood spot that is not a chain! Great service, pleasant employees and the food--SO tasty. We started out with the Pikilia - a variety of appetizers including hummus, baba ganoush, dolmades, spanokopita and falafel croquettes. By chance we arrived in time to hit happy hour and get a few dollars off. We cleaned those up and went forward with entrees of Lamb Souvlaki Platter for the hubby and the Grilled Vegetable Platter for me. Both were served with a Greek salad containing a very nice combo of mixed greens, crisp red pepper and cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, olives and feta with a light dressing. Also served with lemon potatoes - a nice tangy flavor and just the right amount. Lamb was cooked to his liking (medium) and had 6 to 7 pieces on each of the two skewers. My roasted vegetables were done just right and very flavorful. Too bad we both cleaned our plate and didn't have room for the dessert in the corner refrigerated cabinet that looked so tempting!"}
{"text":"Terrible...i will never go back. Gyro was under cooked... too soggy...the pita was dissolving. Ordered greek fries which were bland amd throwm together.... I've had much better Mediterranean food in the chandler area... do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Great combination of great food, great specials and happy hours in a quaint setting with the best service we've ever had....the staff makes you feel like family!  Our favorite restaurant in Chandler."}
{"text":"Love Nick, he's very knowledgeable in his wines and always a joy to see.   Foods is fantastic, try the halumi,  it's amazing.   Lamb burger and pesto burger also fantastic,  never had a bad meal, love this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome family owned restaurant! We keep coming back for the fresh food and great service.Try the chicken soulvaki! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Mmmmm... Greek frys anyone?!? I didn't even know what I was missing out on! And the vibe in this place is fantastic, everyone is super friendly. I went in for a to go order and was asked 4 different times if I had been helped or if I could be helped. I was also complimented 3 times while I was there, which is always a plus! lol! The prices were just right. 5 bucks for a humongous to go box of greek frys sounds right up my alley! I need those greek nachos now. I have dreams about them. Too bad they are so far from my house. But I am willing to drive..."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to make a return trip to this gem last Wednesday 1/17.  They were pretty busy which was wonderful to see mid-week- love seeing the support of their many loyal and obviously repeat patrons waiting patiently for the best hummus in town, sipping great wines and catching up with neighbors. Small, family run, independent places like this seem to be few and far between and every time I'm lucky enough to visit the Phx area I am so happy to have a great meal here. The service is fantastic, and the owner is quick to acknowledge when the kitchen might get a little behind and do his best to make sure you leave with a smile.   Great food, great ambiance, and even if you don't live in this awesome neighborhood you feel like you do by the time you leave. Can't recommend highly enough."}
{"text":"The food and service were exceptional! The waiter helped with explaining the menu and selecting a food choice. The Avocado  hummus was very delightful."}
{"text":"Had lunch there our service was spot on the black tea was tasty and refreshing I had the pita club with gyro meat enough for two or three light eaters the humus was very good and I'm not a humus fan. I opted for Greek salad cold fresh and tasty lightly coated in a Greek vinaigrette over all very good meal Restaurant tucked away in a strip mall ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The best Greek food I've ever had. We went for lunch on a Sunday, great service, friendly staff. They were out of the chicken I ordered but the server offered me an alternative and worked with me to accommodate my diet.  Everything tasted super fresh and very flavorful. Although we didn't have dessert, the special for that day was jalapeño chocolate cheesecake, which I thought sounded very interesting and I will have to try when they have it again. I recommend this to anyone who wants fresh Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was amazing! Will definitely eat here again. Greek Salad was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"After a yelp search my family and I ended up here! What a wonderful meal!  We began with drinks, wine for myself and a beer for my father.  We ordered the dip trio, classic, black bean and babaganush!  Served with warm pita bread, gone in 5 minutes FLAT!  I ordered the Falafel dinner. They were a bit dry. The potatoes that they were served with were wonderful!  My father and son both had burgers, served warm and juicy. Cooked to perfection!  My daughter had a gyro pita. I advised her to eat a bit of the meat out of it so she could pick it up and the next thing I knew, she had eaten ALL the meat! Thankfully she was full, and my father ordered a side of gyro meat with his burger. Woo Hoo! Lunch for tomorrow!  My mother had a flatbread, while it had a few to many onions for my taste, it was delicious!  Walking in the door, my father noticed the homemade baklava! Since we were too full to eat another bite, we too it home. We also took home a slice of the coconut cheesecake!  Both were AMAZING!   I suggest you try this place out!"}
{"text":"I have really been craving Greek food and I was in the area so I thought I'd give this new place a try.  I decided on getting their variety platter which consisted of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Dolmades, Spanakopita and Falafel served with pita bread.(see pics)  Oh how disappointing!  *Strike 1~ The baba ganoush was over pureed into a thin slimy goo, it didn't taste very good either. All the baba ganoush I have ever eaten has been thick and had some texture left to it with a very distinct flavoring. This was the worst I've ever had.  *Strike 2~ The Hummus was gritty and bland. I was really looking forward to the strong garlicky lemon taste, none of that here though. Again another worst ever.  *Strike 3~ The Dolmades(grape leaves) smothered in a thick tomato and lemon slime, had the mushiest, yet sticky and pasty rice inside, it was awful. I grew up on these and actually make them quite often(grandmas secret recipe), so I think I know what I'm talking about.  I've had bad grape leaves but these take the cake.  *Your OUT!~ The Falafel, well you can see from the picture they look more like cookies, but nowhere near as good. They were more like fried wet sand , dry with no flavor at all. I wouldn't feed these to my dog.  The Spanakopita might have been the most edible part of this platter but by then it was too late, They had already been way past striking out in my book.  I tell the waitress and she sends over the manager, to whom I explained why I was unhappy with my meal. She apologizes but the has the nerve to ask me: \"WELL, ARE YOU GREEK?!!!\"  As a matter of fact YES I AM, I should be asking her that!  I know good Greek when I eat it and especially when I make it myself with recipes taught to me by own Grandmother, and sorry honey but that wasn't it!  I gave 2 stars only because she took it off my bill. OPA!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is sooo yummy. Best Greek I have had in years! The flavor, the taste, so impressed. Wish my stomach was bigger lol. I will be back to try other dishes. Today I had the pesto salmon. Wow!!! Beyond delicious"}
{"text":"$10 huge gyro's for two on Tuesday's can't be beat. EXCELLENT.  Only complaint is they kept the restaurant a little on the warm side."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Pitta Souvli, I was not that impressed with the food or service. I did decide to go back to try it again, and I was very pleased! I love their soup, hummus, and chicken. I think the first visit was a mishap or bad day. Upon further visits, the staff is very friendly, service is good and the food is outstanding!   Overall, I will continue to be eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh, clean, bright flavors.  Very accommodating to those with food allergies.  Don't forget to try the Rosemary-lemon potatoes!"}
{"text":"Love their food. Greek fries, salad, etc. everything is great, but they lost a star today! I went to pick up my order and they forgot hummus. So I got pits, with no hummus lol.   Not a huge deal, but I've been here about 4-5 times and there is literally at least a single mistake consistently with orders. They are about 5 for 5 for messing up an order. I love the people, food, the restaurant but it is the order to go that is a huge factor in a final impression. I'll still give them a shot, but just a warning to all. Check you're order before you go! Especially with a Togo order :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great menu, great happy hour! We'll definitely be back! Wish we discovered this restaurant sooner!"}
{"text":"I've dined here a few times and can say that the food and service is consistently great. Portions are very generous! There is a great appetizer sampler that I'd recommend; it let's everyone in your party try a variety of menu items. They even let me customize it (that is, more of this and less of that as you prefer)."}
{"text":"Went in during happy hour during the week and my wife and I were the only people there. Great service and the food was amazing. Had the fig hummus, falafel wrap and Greek fries. It was all fresh and not greasy. Will be back many more times in the future."}
{"text":"Close to my house, I have been her for lunch a bunch.  I like it, can't complain, better than the chain and they are cool people."}
{"text":"The service here was fantastic. With two small children, they made sure to get their food out and kept up on refills. Everyone was incredibly friendly and I will definitely be back.  The food was very good too. Their pesto is great and it hit the spot with all of my family."}
{"text":"Great pitas and salads. I live down the street from PS and love getting takeout from here. Prices are very reasonable for what you get and the food is awesome. One of the few places me and my wife agree on. A must try in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Saw some good reviews, so thought I'd try it.  Went for happy hour which I would advise if you're thinking of checking it out. 1/2 price appetizers (only ones from the list, not all) and 1/2 price beer and wine.   The service was great. Very attentive waiter who did a great job.  The food was ok, portions were fine, prices were reasonable. The gyros were,  as others noted, just a bit too dry. Greek salad was bland, I would not add it to your entree. Hummus was good, spanakopita was good, feta and olives ok. Falafel was a bit spicier than I'm accustomed but ok.  The big surprise was the temperature in this restaurant. It's August in AZ and they had floor fans out. I inquired if they had problems with the AC but they told me they operate only swamp coolers. Really? I'm sure they don't own the building, so not their fault but it does impact your dining experience.  The kids menu offered enough selection for the youngsters to get something if they don't like the Mediterranean food.  I'd go back - for happy hour - but it will not be a regular place for me. I have two places closer to me with food that's just a bit better. I would like to have tried the lamb souvlaki but was too full from sampling all the appetizers. Maybe I'll go deeper on the menu some other trip.  So, if you don't have a place closer to you with food you enjoy, there is nothing wrong with this place. You may like it enough to make it your regular Mediterranean place. In cooler months it might be nice to sit outside on their patio."}
{"text":"Excellent Lamb Souvlaki. Gyro plate was most delicious.  Great service. Happy Hour is a nice addition.  Definitely will return again and again   Another awesome awesome dinner.  The Greek nachos were just awesome.  The feta and olives were so good too.  Need time come visit this place.  Our server Louisa-Marie was most excellent"}
{"text":"I'll add my voice to the masses who can't extol the virtues of this place enough! Wonderful staff! Delicious, unique, wonderfully real Greek cuisine in a really lovely atmosphere. I can't wait to try the cheese they serve tableside en flambe! It looks incredible and I always stare longingly when someone else gets it. Their gyros are large and bursting with fresh, delicious flavor. I get mine with olives and feta. I just went in last night to get some take out and when I got there, the tea looked so refreshing (it was 100 outside), I ordered one to go. The owner was standing there and gave me one complimentary - just out of kindness! This is a great night out in a sea of 'meh' in the greater Chandler area. I look forward to it whenever I go."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, our waitress on the other hand was so ridiculous. She was taking pictures  with the other table after we had asked for a box and our check. She was also aware we were on a lunch break from work. She forgot everything and could care less about us. She was more interested in the guys at our neighboring table.   I think i'll stick to ordering food to-go from here"}
{"text":"So so so so good! The restaurant is tiny so try to get there when it opens. The fig hummus is amazing! The wait staff is super friendly and attentive and I highly recommend eating here. Two thumbs way way up!"}
{"text":"This place is our favorite place to eat, great happy hour, comfortable atmosphere, and amazing service! we love the burgers that are always cooked to perfection. You have to try their desserts, they are addicting so be careful!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just returned from Pitta Souvli after having not visited this spot in quite some time despite it literally being within walking distance of our home. Needless to say, after this visit, we will not be returning. We arrived around 5:30ish and the restaurant was only about half full. They were running with two wait staff who seemed to be pretty busy despite the patio being empty. We decided against an appetizer this time but had we, perhaps we would have had something to eat sooner rather than the much later when our food finally came. We kept it simple: I with a chicken schwarma platter (which was tasty) and she with a gyro flatbread. Apparently \"flatbread\" meant a wheat tortilla and not actual flatbread as you'd get if ordered elsewhere. That aside, the food came after a seemingly excessive 30+ minute wait. This is no exaggeration. It seems that the cooks were prioritizing to-go orders over food for the dining room and I'll never understand that. Whatever. When it did come, hers was COLD. I couldn't stop the waiter (whose name I will spare) to bring it to his attention since he seemed to be covering more than half the dining room area. He didn't ever stop to ask if everything was correct or if everything was okay. NOT ONCE. All through our dinner, my aggravation was clearly present on my face but, despite that, no one ever stopped to bother asking... not even the owner's wife who was seated across the aisle from us and who began helping out a bit once things picked up. Despite all this, I remained pleasant with the waiter seeing as perhaps some of the issues were beyond his control. I don't excuse him entirely though seeing as he never came back to check on us beyond filling our drinks once. We also had to ask for our check as did the other couple who was seated in front of us. The server was apparently so busy they walked their check up to the front register. I made sure to fill out the enclosed comment card since it's apparently important enough for them to include it with your check. After filling it out, I made sure to ask the owner's wife if they read and valued the opinions written on them. She smiled and said yes, so I stressed that it was important for her to read mine. I turned and walked out with not a word being uttered from either the wife or the owner (perhaps a male family member?) who had recently come into the restaurant and seemed very enthralled with attending to the three blondes seated back near the bar area. A disappointing end to what could have been a nice visit. Such a shame, too. I really like their food."}
{"text":"Lately I have been getting the Veggie Flatbread.  The red sauce is a great accompanyment to the vegetables and the feta cheese gives it a Greek flare.  Also has a great but not filling thin crust."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the girl who took our order for take out was super rude."}
{"text":"Very good food, good friendly service.   They do serve hard liquor now - and I had a very yummy \"spiced orange julius\" with pinacle whipped vodka.   The dip trio was good, nice soft pita, though we needed extra pita to go with all the dip.   The baba ganoush was the best - the tzaki was VERY minty as one other reviewer noted.    The greek salad that came with the dinners was one of the best salads I have every had - lightly dressed with a ton of red peppers and feta.   The potatoes were well seasoned, though seemed a little greasy.    We tried the gyro meat and the chicken shwarma - both of which were delicious.   Can't wait to go back and try the stuffed red peppers!  The wait staff was very friendly and the hostess (who may have been the owner or at least a manager) spoke to everyone and seemed very invested in the happiness of the customers."}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly servers who are patient and know the menu. Gyro meat is always moist and flavorful, homemade hummus is awesome. Only gave it 4/5 because they take orders to go and need to improve on accepting orders over the phone for pickup."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly even though I showed up 25 minutes before they were about to close on a Saturday. The hostess was very helpful and the ambience of the restaurant was very nice I would highly recommend going there for a great meal. The food was fresh and I did not have to wait long for my takeout very happy I stumbled upon this place next to my gym!"}
{"text":"We ate here in a hurry as our dog was being monitored at the Spay/Neuter clinic across the street.  We split a Gyro plate that included a very tasty salad, pita's etc. Our waitress was INCREDIBLY sweet and attentive. Just an all around pleasant experience when were were going through some stressful stuff with our dog.   We ended up coming out of necessity and LOVED our impromptu lunch here.  We live in Laveen, but if ever in the area again, we will be making a stop again. It was great!"}
{"text":"The gyro was alright and the service was slow despite the fact that I was the only customer there. French fries were burned and the gyro lacked in flavor..."}
{"text":"First time here. I got the Greek fries and a gyro.  Both dishes had a vinegary taste to them which wasn't necessarily unpleasant...just different.  I wasn't expecting it on my gyro especially.  Since I'm ignorant to authentic Greek cuisine, I'm thinking this might be the way a gyro is supposed to taste?  I don't know, but it sure was different. Anyway, the fries were friggin' awesome, even with the vinegary thing going on.  Feta cheese, oregano, some more cheese, and a dressing coats these big crispy steak fries.  So good.  And the order was quite filling by itself. As I said, the gyro had that thing going on, but past that, the meat was super tender and moist.  Their sauce (guess its tszi-uhm however you spell that) was plentiful but not overpowering at all, and it didn't make it sloppy.  The thing was chock full, too.  Huge.  $5.80 The service was nice, too.  And I'm NOT just saying that due to the girls working the front being absolute knock-outs.  They even suckered me into a piece of baklava, which ended up being the best I've ever had. So this appears to be an authentic place, and its right down the street!  The food was good enough to make me want to try everything on the menu at least once, and I believe I will embark on that journey.  Vinegariness or not."}
{"text":"I was in the area and hungry for lunch and saw this little pita shop was nearby so I decided to get something to go. The restaurant is in the Mountainside Fitness plaza but the entrance is on the other side of the main buildings, around the corner from the gas station. There is an adorable patio and the interior is comfortable and well appointed.  I browsed through the menu before deciding on the tuna pita sandwich ($9) and a side of spicy avocado hummus ($5). The sandwich comes with a side of salad or fries, I went with the salad.  The pita sandwich was an enormous portion of tuna. I felt like they put a whole can of it in my sandwich! While the main component was tuna, it also had lettuce, sauce, cheese, tomato, and chopped onion. I appreciated the enormous portion of fish but while eating it I felt like I was often eating plain tuna from a can stuffed in a pita rather than a balance of meat, vegetables, seasoning and sauce. The side salad was delicious and came with romaine lettuce, feta, olives, crispy sweet red bell peppers a lemony vinaigrette.  The spicy avocado hummus came in a small tub with a black olive and feta on top. I loved the hint of spicy kick and creamy avocado flavor meshed with the hummus.   Service was friendly and my order only took a few minutes to make.   Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"While the staff was very friendly and the patio is lovely I found the food inauthentic and overly greasy. We had a selection of appetizers and a kids meal for two of my children to share. There was more than enough food, the portions are large. This was missing the light, freshness of Mediterranean food. Everything was very heavy and unappetizing.   We also encountered a friendly cockroach on the patio which was extremely unappealing."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood go-to for good Mediterranean food. I always order the chicken souvlaki platter and it always leaves me feeling full and satisfied. Every now and then they are a little inconsistent with the sides, like the lemon potatoes and salad. Sometimes the potatoes can be a little bland, or the salad dressing will have no herbs in it. But these occasions are rare.... Overall a great place to eat, the fig hummus is one of my favorites!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem.  Many people might miss it, since it is kind of in the back of the Mountainside Fitness shopping center on Germann & Alma School.  Don't give up if you cannot find it on the first go around.  I have eater here several times, and it is excellent every time my family & I eat here when I am in town.  Last time I was there, I had the chicken shawarma plate.  It is always my go to when I am here and was delicious as always.  The service has always been excellent.  Last time we were in, an older lady was waiting on us.  She was super sweet and very attentive.    If you are craving Mediterranean food while in the Chandler area, this is definitely the best spot I have found. ."}
{"text":"This is by FAR, HANDS DOWN the best Greek restaurant in Chandler. The chef is from Cypress, that should tell you something. The ambiance is very romantic, dimly lit with pendant and string lighting at night. Bring your reading glasses if you are over 40 ;)  Get yourself a sitter and go out for a romantic night. This is the perfect neighborhood place for that. High top tables surround the perimeter and  a few regular height ones. They play wonderful Greek music too! There is a fairly large patio which I am going to rent out space in come fall.  Now for the food! OMG!! We have been here twice in 2 weeks because we are from Portland and are well, basically, Greek food whores.  We order the platter with all the standard Greek tapas like spanikopita and hummus and then split an entree which is perfect. The platter has  Baba Ghanoush , which is the best I have ever had in my life and the Dolmadas well, I felt like I was having sex in public. They are a little different, served hot, in a tomato base sauce that was very dark and Ah-Mazing! My man had the Chicken Souvlaki which he said was fantastic. It came with a side salad and lemon infused potatoes, which I had a bite of, and they were great.   I only have two criticisms and they were not enough to dock any stars just maybe suggestions for the owners.  We are also wine snobs. I know, you didn't see that coming right? Although they had one of my favorite Greek wines Boutari Naoussa (yes, those Greeks make some wonderful dry reds) the serving temp was too high. Even though it is a red, it needs to be a little chilled in the 50-60 degree range. AZ room temps in the summertime can be much hotter than that.  The other wish is that they serve a HUGE bowl tzatiki with the platter. They have it and it is fantastic but you have to order it separately.  This is a moderately priced, romantic place with fabulous food!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. I met some friends here for a luncheon, I'm glad I did. The service and food were great. We showed up at 11:30, sat outside on the patio. Elly our server introduced herself and was fantastic.  Food ordered was Falafel Platter, Gyro Platter, and a Greek Salad with Chicken. All the food was presented nicely and tasted great. I had the Falafel Platter. The falafel were cooked perfectly (personally the way I like them) and the salad that it came with, very fresh. Now that this place is back on my radar I will be back soon.  Atmosphere: nice, Service: excellent, Food: very good."}
{"text":"The Greek salad with gyros is amazingness! Something that tastes so good, is filling and healthy(compared to what I normally eat).  I very rarely eat salad when I'm out but this one is so good! They add a good amount of meat with your veggies and a few small slices of pita bread.  This restaurant is located in a hard to find spot but I kind of feel like it's a hidden gem. I picked up my salad on a Saturday night around 6-630 and they were full. (So I guess my hidden gem is not a secret.)   I've only been here a couple times. The staff is friendly, the service is quick and the cost is reasonable. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best Pitta I've had in a long time! This puts Pita Jungle to shame. I had the Gyro Pitta with my friend. They ran a 2/$10 Pitta special on Tuesday. The meat was fresh and was thicker cuts of gyro meat. The pita bread was super soft and the Greek Fries were fresh out of the fryer then drenched in a lemony vinaigrette, feta and sliced tomatoes.   The prices are reasonable and the service was quick. They were thankful for our business and asked us to come back soon. That we will!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little storefront plaza is this great restaurant! Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is VERY comfortable & classy. The service was very attentive and friendly. And the food - mmm-mmm! Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"All around a fantastic neighborhood restaurant with great Greek food. I always enjoy visiting. The lentil salad and baklava are excellent!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Nice outdoor patio area, fast food delivery. Great lunch or takeout spot!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My husband and I went out tonight and the food was all so fresh and delicious! It's definitely the most delicious Greek food we've ever had! They have a quaint little patio with white lights, surrounded by ficus trees- just lovely. We will be back here again!"}
{"text":"2 hours and $60+ later, I'm wondering how this place stays open let alone packed with patrons. The server was very sweet and the chicken on the Greek salad was nicely seasoned & cooked perfectly. That's where the positives end, unfortunately. The kitchen was painstakingly slow. We waited over a half an hour just for a bowl of lentil soup. The tomatoes were gritty and overripe. The salad had minimal lettuce and was mostly compromised of the gross tomatoes. My boyfriend was served the wrong salad. The Greek salad dressing was nearly absent and what was on the salad was not evenly distributed. The biggest yuck factor was waiting for the main entree to arrive and seeing a cockroach crawl across the dining room floor. I won't be back, but if they want to keep their doors open I suggest they hire an exterminator and get their kitchen staff to up their game, so they can turn over tickets in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious Greek food!  I the service is great.  The outdoor patio is the perfect place to sip wine."}
{"text":"Great Greek food. Local. Good wine selection. Meats are tasty. Sauce is good great place to eat in chandler"}
{"text":"Shhh... Don't tell anyone else, but this place has amazing Greek food! I've avoided writing a review simply because I didn't want my favorite hole-in-the-wall to get jammed up with other fans. I was nervous about the change of ownership a while back, but aside from minor tweaks, they've just added some friendly faces. I've had everything on their menu with the exception of a couple of spicy dishes. I'm not going into too many details because you'll have to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Al fresco dining at a tucked away Greek restaurant in a strip mall in Chandler? Why, yes! Yes, I will.  Food was delish, wine was superb, service was spot on, environment made me forget I was in the middle of an asphalt and concrete ocean that is Phx Metro.  Go here!  Or don't, so it can remain a secret. :)"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. A hidden gem in a random location beside an auto parts store! The service is always friendly, and the food fresh and tasty, and as a bonus, its also super healthy. Their prices are reasonable, especially during their happy hour! They almost always have a \"special\" hummus to offer and the green chili blend is to die for. My husband is obsessed with their \"Pesto Caprese\" burger. An incredible burger at a Mediterranean joint? I know, crazy! But just try it (or any of their burgers). You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"During my visit in Arizona we stopped here for lunch one day and it was excellent! They had many options to choose from including great appetizers, fantastic entrées, and tantalizing desserts. They also offer a full bar and wine options. It's a quaint establishment with a small inside dining room and an outdoor patio. I decided on ordering an appetizer as my entrée so I could try hummus, Baba ghanouj, pita bread, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, and spanakopita. I was so pleased with everything! They were on point with all of these options. Some of the other dishes that were ordered were the lamb kebabs, the grilled cheese and mushroom entrée, and a gyro entree. We all decided to share and absolutely decadent dessert which was amazingly delicious! If you're in the area and you want some good Greek Mediterranean food give this place a try."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the great food and options.  We were looking for something different in our area.  This is it !  Always trying something new on the menu and feeling welcomed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I got the falafel-the pita was very good but the actually falafel balls were very dry."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is always fresh and delicious! It is great to be able to get authentic Gyro meat off the skewer! My whole family enjoys the atmosphere sitting outside! Try it out before it gets too hot!"}
{"text":"Go here! You will love it! We came in Friday night because of an email I received. We have been in several other times as well. Every time has been amazing! The food is wonderful, the staff is super friendly, and the owners are making sure everyone is happy. The cheesecake was fantastic! I highly recommend this place! The patio is really nice in the cooler months."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and thoughtful food - gyro flatbread anyone?! Awesome happy hour - HALF priced bottles of wine. Intimate atmosphere, so you can actually hear each other speak. 4 stars because it closes by 8 or 9 most nights and if I'm going out, I want to stay out longer than that. :)"}
{"text":"We've been going to Pitta Souvli for years.  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming as they are family owned and run.  The staff always make you feel at home.  The food is always fresh and there's always plenty to share.  My husband loves the caprese salad and orders that every time. I love the pesto pasta. The flavor is so rich!  We will continue to make Pitta Souvli a family favorite.  If you haven't tried it, take some friends and sit out in their lovely patio.  Charming!"}
{"text":"Visited Chandler yesterday and found this desert gem. We've been staying in Casa Grande the past couple of months and find ourselves wanting for some good eats. This placed filled that need and more.  The falafel appetizer was excellent, very tasty and not over cooked and dry like many places tend to do. It was served with slices of fresh tomato on a bed of crisp romaine with a drizzle of tahini. Yum!  I had the lamb and my wife the beef souvlaki, both were excellent, the meat tender and cooked medium rare as ordered. The salad was fresh crisp and well dressed. The waitress was very nice and attentive. We were too full for desert so I can not report on that. If we are back in the area we will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here today. The food was great! We both had the grilled Greek wraps. I had the gyro and she had the grilled veggie one. They were huge. We could have split one but now I have leftovers. :) We also had the Greek fries-yummy The prices were reasonable, the portions were large and I will be back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I was searching for a good Halal place and was surprised to find one right in south Chandler! I am a vegetarian and love a good falafel, (And I am not a fan of having to order it in a sandwich) and this did not disappoint. The falafel plate came with roasted potatoes and a yummy greek salad. We also ordered feta cheese and hummus which were amazing and served with some of the thickest and most indulgent pita bread I have ever tasted! We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and we're glad we did. It's worth the drive from east Mesa to the degree that we make the trek a couple times a week. All the traditional Greek food is amazing - hummus is wonderful, even the pitas taste better. And then there's the home made desserts!  Wow!  Salads are our favorite and simply can't be topped. You owe it to yourselves to  eat here just once, but I can guarantee you'll want to return again and again and again."}
{"text":"Always love the Mediterranean Shrimp Pasta. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere. Come for a romantic dinner or causal dining. Many Greek options and daily specials. Trying the Hummingbird Cake for the first time. Fingers crossed that's it's good but sounds absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Holy Amazing, Batman!  This place is great.  We happened to be waiting for our dog to be done at the clinic across the street and since we were starving, we checked out local reviews and decided to try this place out.  This is a hidden gem.  The place is not overly big but it is comfortable.  We were there midday during the week so there were not as many customers.  We were sat right away and took a look at the menu.  Even though there were a lot of tips on the yelp page, we decided on the gyros platter and the chicken gyro shawarma (sp?) platter.  You get a lot of food with these.  Both came with pita, potatoes and a salad.  The salad and potatoes were delicious and light.  My girlfriend had the gyro platter with the beef and lamb and the meat had a good flavor to it.  I had the chicken and I am so glad that I did.  The flavor was amazing, especially when combined with the sauce that comes with it.  The tzatziki (sp?) sauce was creamier and sweeter than I am used to but was still delicious.  I am pretty sure it was made with Greek yogurt.  They brought us extra pita when we requested it and we definitely used it.  We left full and content.  It is a shame that we live so far away but if we are in the area we will absolutely come back.  If you are in the area and have not tried this place yet, you need to.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall experience with food/taste/quality was a 3. There are much better options for Greek cuisine in the valley/area. Service was poor in the beginning, the hostess greeted me and had me take a seat anywhere. After 20 minutes I was given a menu. I'm guessing they forgot about me. Three people apologized and after that the service was good. Overall 3 stars for service. All together not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"After coming here for many years & always enjoying it, it was a little disappointed tonight. The food was very good as usual but the service was very slow. We purposely went tonight because we got an email stating there was going to be a singer there on Wednesdays in May. Got there, no music. Asked where he was & was told the owner told him not to bother to come because it was too hot. It's  the end of May on Az what did he expect it to be. Don't advertise you going to have entertainment & then not have it. The outside needs mist &  lights. There was a table outside of 14 people it was so dark you couldn't even see them..let's go new owners get on the ball. What happened to the TV? The food is still good now put a little money in the place & if you advertise something have it?"}
{"text":"This is so close to home, but we tried this only recently (and I can't think of a reason why because I love greek food and kept going to my fave spots all the way in Tempe). It is kind of tucked away and not prominent, so we thought they might be empty, but we were pleasantly surprised to see many patrons.  We had dinner, but returned for happy hour and I think it's a great place for happy hour. There were groups of people who were definitely having a good time. The service was a bit... brusque. The waiters are constantly rushing around. I am not a fan of fake smiles and high pitched greetings, but this was a bit unsettling too."}
{"text":"Oh My Vinegar!!!!  Vinegar in everything!!!  Holy cow I've seriously never tasted so much Vinegar!  That's about all I have to say about that.  The Shwarma was really dry.  The Baklava wasn't bad.  The Gyro was cold.  The waiter was super nice but had horrible breath."}
{"text":"Hmmm Finally finally got over there for lunch..   Sirlion Skewers,  cooked perfect to order,  great seasoning. The red potatoes threw me off,  very tasty but has a sharp flavor maybe just over lemon.. ,  hard to describe,  but still killed em all..  nicely prepared salad,  very fresh..   appetizer,  grilled eggplant with halloumi cheese.. wow,  was this fabulous,  prolly best thing we had so far..   Saw the Lamb burger come out n omg,  thats my next item to try in a couple weeks..   will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Okay food .  The potatoes were drowned in lemon juice, my request for no tomatoes was ignored and the service was terrible.  We couldn't get refills and sat for a long time waiting for them to clear out dishes. Finally flagged a server down to get our check and she took the dishes.  Too many good Greek restaurants out there to put up with a bad one."}
{"text":"My work lunch crew used to love this place. Used to love this place. This place used to serve my favorite rice soup the avogolemono soup. It was heaven. Since the change in ownership, this restaurant has severely declined.   Last week, the 6 of us sat down for a fun Friday lunch. 20 minutes later we ordered our meals and when they came out we were all disappointed. Sadly, the food was all cold. My friend and I had to return the rice soups. It had a baby food like appearance and tasted even worse. My halloumi and eggplant had no flavor and was cold. The waitress came back and when asked how it was going, I responded with a \"Meeh, we have had better, what happened here?\" Doing a round robin of what we all thought was going on with our dishes...falafel was dry, greek salads might as well been named onion salads, bland, cold...it was a tasty lunch to say the least.   What a shame. There are few Greek/Med places near Intel...looks like Cyrpus on Queen Creek and Alma will remain our go to place. Let's hope they get their act together soon! I will no longer be a customer at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here last January or so and I thought my lamb plate was average while my boyfriend loved his greek burger.  We ended up going here again this past week and enjoyed our visit.  The waitress was a little slow on refilling soda, but all the employees were really nice!  I had a falafel pita while my boyfriend had his greek burger again.  We had the normal hummus as an appetizer.  It was all very tasty!!!  I felt the falafels were a little hard but still yummy.  The greek fries are very tasty as well, I would recommend those.  Next time we go, I am not quite sure what I will taste!"}
{"text":"Paul and Lisa have really created a gem with this place. Staff is extremely friendly and inviting. They have specials almost everyday. The food is nothing short of spectacular. You really cant go wrong with anything they offer."}
{"text":"I ate here for the second time yesterday with the toddler and a couple of friends. We had the dip combo platter (baba ghanoush, hummus and tzatziki with pita wedges) and an order of dolmades. I enjoyed everything but it was far from phenomenal. What earned them three stars instead of four was their tzatziki. It mostly just tasted like plain yogurt (not even Greek yogurt). Where was the garlic and cucumber? When the toddler and I make it we load it up with lots of crunchy cucumber, olive oil and we have garlic breath so bad that no one will get near us for days after. (Mostly because we eat the entire container, but that's how we roll.)   The toddler and I ate more than our fair share of the dolmades and they were good, but I definitely prefer the cold version. These were served hot in a tomato sauce. Good, but not my favorite. I filled myself up on the appetizers so when the gyro and souvlaki came I was too full to try any, but they both looked good.   I don't know how many good restaurants are out this way, but it's a nice one to try if you're craving some Mediterranean food. I saw a sign for a happy hour with half price drinks and apps. If I lived near here, I would definitely come back for that."}
{"text":"Just plain great! Had the lentil salad...it was humongous!!!! Be prepared of its awesome size. Filled with feta cheese, rice, romaine lettuce, lentils, onions, & tomatoes. Very good. Of course the New Zealand lamb chops!  Stay greeky my friend!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Pitta Souvli. Great food, really friendly staff and an all-around awesome experience.   This place is great for an evening out with the family. I really like the variety in hummus and the specials are always fantastic.   Great job Pitta Souvli!"}
{"text":"Amazing, healthy, vegetarian-friendly mediterranean food set over a cozy interior (with an adorable patio) and great service.  Must tries: 1) Lentil salad - I like to top with falafel 2) Hummus - homemade (and slightly spicy) roasted red pepper, basil pesto, or fig 3) Shrimp salad with homemade citrus vinaigrette 4) Greek steak-cut fries zomg (when you are feeling not *so* healthy) 5) Grilled greek wrap with grilled veggies (buttom mushrooms, onions, zucchini, bell pepper, etc)."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of eating here about once a month for a couple of years now. Although I've had a number of menu items, my favorite quick lunch is the grilled gyro wrap with a Greek salad as a side. Wonderful quality ingredients and generous portions. Service has mostly been very friendly and prompt. There's been one man who's served my lunch a few times who is consistently generally disinterested and not very engaging or attentive. I haven't seen him in my last several visits so perhaps he's moved on the brighten up some other establishment.  I wouldn't let the random chance encounter with the pouty fellow discourage a stop here. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Husband and I had dinner here a few years ago, and I really loved this place, but forgot about it. Tonight, while trying to decide on a place to eat, he reminded me of Pitta Souvli, and off we were.  The best thing about this place is the atmosphere. It's cozy and intimate, with nice high top tables and outdoor seating. The food is reasonably priced, and for right around $30 (two entrees, and sodas) we left full. I had the Chicken Souvlaki platter (with potatoes and a salad) - fantastic, and Husband loved his Greek Burger.   While we were there, we saw the ad for their happy hour - the prices are awesome (everything under $5) and the selections are great. Will definitely be going back to try out some of the apps.  Overall, really liked it, glad to have re-discovered it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The place: Another \"local\" shop hidden in a strip mall.  This place is small and cozy however in the summer it was a bit warm at lunch inside.  The decor is non offensive although since it's small if it was to get busy it could get pretty loud.  The food: I ordered nachos - I know - I'm in a Mediterranean restaurant, nachos?  Well, they had a different spin on them and I wanted to try something crunchy.  The flavors were absolutely wonderful in my nachos; the hummus, feta, and tomato were fresh and tasty.  The only knock I would give them is that the chips tasted a bit stale.  In fact, they should probably use pita chips instead of tortilla chips.  The bottom line: Good prices, great food ... just pick up some Stacey's Pita Chips from Costco and put 'em in the nachos.  Otherwise keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"So suddenly feeling guilty about meat I decided Mediterranean/Greek was the way to go....fire up Yelp, sort by most reviewed... Yahtzee...Pitta Souvli. I had researched online and decided the falafel platter was my goal. I got a very friendly greeting and was asked to sit anywhere, cool. I happened to be just moments inside happy hour but was able to order the hummus of the day and a kilt lifter draft at a discount!  The hummus was a nice spicy mix which was the star of the evening. I ordered the falafel platter. This could be a meal for two....I will say the falafel's were over cooked and a tad dry..but tzatziki to the rescue. Anyway, the portion was big, the veggies decent and the flavors good. I'd go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely disgusting. Greek fries were bland and under seasoned. The haloumi cheese was extremely dry and tasted old. Salads were oily and bland. The gyro (which they claim is off the skewer, yet is cut thicker than a ribeye) was greasy, and so undercooked that it was pink and cold in the center. I did not feel safe eating it. Everything was simply disgusting beyond belief.  As if the food wasn't bad enough, our waitress (who seemed to be either an owner or manager) was rude, unhelpful, and gave us a bad attitude when we complained about the food. Before I could finish explaining to her what was wrong with my \"gyro\" (if you want to call it that), she repeatedly cut me off with the nastiest attitude and an ugly look on her face and asked okay then what do you want? I was so turned off by that, that I returned my food and didn't bother to order anything else. When she brought the check, she told me with an attitude that she'd taken the gyro off the bill, AS IF SHE WAS DOING US A FAVOR! She's lucky I was in a rush, that's all I'm going to say.  I was shocked to see this place had 4 1/2 stars. Something was fishy. So I began to dig back into the reviews, and sure enough, there seemed to have been a change of ownership in about 2015-2016. It's clear, based on the stellar ratings prior to 2015, that the new owners \"Paul and Lisa\" have completely ruined this place. Paul, Lisa, do the residents of Chandler a favor and close down, before you poison someone.   Stay the hell away from this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! They have this lentil salad that is just out of this world. Every time I get it it's really fresh and crisp. I think they may make the dressing in house, though I'm not sure. It is really light and doesn't make you feel guilty. If you like Greek/Mediterranean food; give this joint a try."}
{"text":"Excellent souvlaki, great service, locally owned. I'm not Greek either; who cares? Grape leaves, falafel, baba ghanoush, are indigenous to many parts of the world, including Greece. Go to any Greek, Lebanese, or Persian restaurant in town and all these dishes will vary slightly.  Very good food and very good service in a quaint restaurant. It's worth a stop for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood restaurants. Right next to my gym-Mountainside Fitness! I haven't tried many menu options because my go to, the chicken kabob platter, is so delicious, I have no inclination to try something else. Very friendly staff. Willing to tweak my order to my liking. I eat here at least once a week. You should check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Pitta Souvli is exactly what a neighborhood Greek restaurant should be. Family owned, family run and the food is wonderful. I used to come here every Monday for happy hour until my job got in the way :( I still frequent it often and when I'm in the mood for a great gyro I know exactly where to go. Everyone I've introduced to Pita Souvli has become a regular as well. I tried what must have been a special hummus one day (avocado I think) and I really hope they consider adding it to the menu. Happy hour can't be beat as well with half price drinks! Definitely one of my favorite lunch/hh spots. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't know why I have never reviewed this place before! (I almost feel bad!) They have been around for a while and I swear, it seems like they are just getting better! I have to say, the service and ambiance is great but the food, hands down, is the reason I go. I'm not even a big Greek food eater but hummus and pita is one of my most favorite things EVER! This place has the BEST! I've gone for lunch, dinner, they have wine, they have an adorable patio setting. I meeeaaannn, what else can you ask for? I love the grilled shrimp entree, lamb, salads, appetizers, etc. I just need to go more! Om nom nom and healthy too! :)"}
{"text":"My go-to place is definitely Pita Souvli in Chandler. I love the low key atmosphere and perfectly chilled beer. The food is made fresh, so sometimes you have to wait a bit, but it is worth it. I have tried all the salads and they have the best salads in the valley, hands down. I also love the pastas and all the appetizers. I'm vegetarian and my husband is perfectly happy with all the tasty meats too. Gyro and Lamb burger are his favorites. This a fabulous place to meet friends and talk on the patio or inside. A truly fantastic neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I went their with 8 friends some of whom hadn't eaten here before.  Everyone enjoyed their meals which ranged from some sticking with appetizers to others having full dinner platters.  I had the lamb platter which came with 2 skewers of lamb, a Greek salad and roasted potatoes.  The lamb was done perfectly and was tender, the potatoes were delicious.  Other hits were the grape leaves, the lentil soup and the gyro pita sandwich.  Serving was a little slower than usual as we were told one of the cooks didn't show up.  Prices are moderate.  You won't be disappointed if you like Greek food."}
