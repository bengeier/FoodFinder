{"text":"I've been eating here now for over 4 years from highschool until now my sophomore year in college, and I have to say they are on their way out because at one point their food was to be reckoned with and now it's just bleh. Last time I was there I was really disappointed by the service. One lady working and I seemed to bother her to give her business."}
{"text":"Best burrito bar in the valley.  Quality ingredients, friendly staff, and loads of food.

Well worth the extra drive compared to other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Very good selection of burritos, tacos and more.  They have great quality ingredients, have never had a problem.  Prices are reasonable, and staff is very friendly.  Tables are kept clean and so is the rest of the place.  The only thing that's missing is they no longer serve beer."}
{"text":"Just  writing this review makes my mouth water .
I can almost taste the magical sweet flavor of the pork and the  
beef taquitos that  seem to be custom tailored to please my taste buds. 
Besides good food, the preparation of it at this culinary paradise is second to none. All the food is right where you can see and select what you desire, and never cold.  The employees are always
pleasant and ready to make Bajio a wonderful experience. 
Thanks Bajio!"}
{"text":"Had a salad here this week that I am craving again already!  Th egreen chili chicken salad is really tasty. It has a little sweetness and a mild chili flavor. As if that was not tasty enough, the fresh hot tortilla served with the salad was the perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"I remember when Bajo first opened this location. It quickly became one of my favorite places to eat! I loved how everything was made to order with different choices for your meat, beans, rice, etc, the ingredients were always fresh and delicious, and the staff including the owner were friendly and helpful. I always brought visiting friends here too and they would rave about it afterward. It was always busy too and sometimes the line went out the door but I didn't mind the wait because the food was going to be AWESOME! 

How I wish we could return to those Glory Days. I agree the change in ownership was the turning point. Someone must have thought \"WOW!  Here's a great opportunity! This place is doing everything right and is packed all the time!\" So they bought it and changed everything that made Bajio great. The prices increased while portion size & quality decreased. It's wasn't too bad at 1st but the trend steadily continued. Today I had the pineapple shrimp salad. It was awful. They forgot the crisp wafer things the salad is supposed to sit on & I had to go back & ask for them & crumble them over the top. The rice was overcooked & mushy, the beans had no flavor, the lettuce was limp and the whole thing was watery. Don't know where the water came from but it was puddling in the plate. When I say plate I mean tin to go containers they now serve everything in. The shrimp had no flavor & I think they forgot the mango salsa too. The best thing about the salad was the pre-packed pineapple pieces. As I ate my way over-priced, small, bland tasting meal of poor quality ingredients I knew I would not be back. I wanted to take it back up to the counter & ask for my money back but didn't want to embarrass the person I was with. BTW, he had the Classic Burrito which was once big enough for us to share but now is only large enough for 1 person.  He hardly ate any and pushed it away because it was just mediocre.  Next time I'll look for a burrito cart on the side of the road. I'll probably get a better meal and it will certainly cost less!"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews seemed about dead even, people either LOVED it or HATED it, but whatever we decided to give it a shot as we are new to the area.

Unfortunately we fell into the second group of reviewers. My boyfriend had the fish tacos, Spanish rice and pinto beans. He tasted his food and it was just at the threshold for being acceptable. I had the shrimp tacos with Spanish rice and black beans. My entire plate tasted the same, no distinguishing flavors amongst any of my items and it was all VERY sweet tasting. Worst tacos I have ever had.

A family walked in after us and immediately knew what they wanted, so they must be one of the \"love it\" reviewers. But as far as my boyfriend and I, the food was not appealing to our taste buds at all and we do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"So-so. This is a Cafe Rio or Costa Vida knockoff. The food is ok but is way over priced for the portion size."}
{"text":"This place has a Chipotle feel but has more of that New Mexico Mexican food atmosphere. There food is okay and reasonably priced. Salsa really makes the food for me, and there salsa is just okay. I normally order there chicken quesadilla or get an enchilada and would recommend both."}
{"text":"Quick & Delicious! You can buy authentic tortillas by the bag large and small. Awesome and different chips and queso which is a fave of mine!"}
{"text":"Tasty tortilla, fresh veggies, yummy meat, rice and beans. Great service and we come here all the time."}
{"text":"It was good food, not great, crazy expensive compared to Chipotle, will def try again"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing special. Wouldn't go there again mostly because the girl taking our order had a HUGE attitude and wasn't even listening when we were asking her questions. Pretty disappointing. Would have given a little higher rate if the service was better. Also paid $20 for two burritos and it totally wasnt worth the money."}
{"text":"I think this place has pretty good food for a pretty reasonable price.  The strip mall it's in is relatively easy to get in and out of, so I sometimes go here instead of the Chipotle across the street when I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"There really isn't much I liked about this place.  I had a chicken burrito, and was just unimpressed.  The tortilla was average, and everything was just kind of soggy.  The chicken was in sort of a broth, rather than what you'd see at places like Chipotle or Baja Fresh, where it's grilled and diced.  This was more like pulled chicken, though it was larger pieces.

Got a side of the queso sauce too, which looked good, and it was fine, though a little thin.  Try a place like Panchero's for awesome queso.  Had a side of chips and salsa, but again, below average.  

I probably won't come back here, there are too many better options.  Even the Coke wasn't great - the ice is crushed, so it melts quickly, watering down your drink.

Staff was friendly and accommodating, though.  And the place looks good, so it doesn't get just one star.  Service is slow, because they don't seem to have the \"assembly line\" thing down like at other places (hi, Chipotle)."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today while visiting my cousin Marc.  His wife Lori is a huge fan of this place.  She kept saying \"fresh\" over & over again.  She was right.  It's a big room in a huge outdoor/strip mall kind of place.  You order off a menu that is painted on the wall, then you step up to a Subway Sandwich type counter where they prepare your food in front of you.  You order shrimp tacos, they throw the shrimp on the open stove right there.  Then they take your plate down the counter of \"fresh\" ingredients and ask you want you want.  
What kind of rice do you want?
What kind of beans?
Which salsa?
Which reminds me: they have mango salsa!  Are you kidding me?  It was yummy. Did I mention they serve mexican beers?  They have margaritas too.  But they're pre-made and come out of a tap.  Which is the reason I'm not giving Bajio 5 stars
The place was seriously busy at lunch, but they have many tables."}
{"text":"There is nothing like checking in while waiting for your food, only to read a bunch of poor reviews.

This place used to be a great place to eat, now it looks like someone took it over, removed all but two of the tvs which had news on it and are selling over priced food.

The food was bland and mushy from being sitting out for the morning.

They charge $11 for 2 fish tacos, they use fried small fish nuggets kind of like the pieces that Long John Silvers puts on the side of the plate.  

The cabbage had that earthy taste from being old and the cilantro was on the border of being dried with no fragrance or flavor.

Oh and when my fish was done being fried to death the cook pushed his glove finget inside 2 of the pieces to see if it was cooked.

no wonder the place was empty."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved into the area and we felt like eating Mexican food. We came across Bajios and decided to try it out. It was definitely comparable to Chipotle while still being different and it was very good. I would actually even say that they have more to chose from than Chipotle. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Mucho food for un pequeno price. I had the fajitas, the daily special, for only $7.99.  That's cheaper than even Chili's and oh so much better. The chicken was flavorful, the toppings were fresh, and you had two choices for rice (sweet or Spanish) and beans (refried or black). 

It's cafeteria-style ordering, so you tell them what you want and watch them prepare it right in front of you. Customer service seemed very friendly -- I was greeted with a smiling \"Hola!\"

My biggest issue, or rather annoyance on my part, was this alert-the-restaurant banging of copper kettles that punctuated my whole dinner.  I can't figure out what it was all about.  I think if you got some punch-card from them, they hit a kettle and shouted out something. It was kind of stupid. I didn't like it. Especially when I was in the middle of a sentence that I had to repeat because of it.

But, heck, what am I saying. I'll go back. Copper-kettle banging or not, the food was good and a great price."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I'm not really a food savant.  If I like the food in a place; it's good.  If I don't like the food at a place, it's not good.  My senses are not keen enough to pick out the hint of Cayenne pepper used to season the enchilada or whatever.  Regardless onto the review:

Alright.  So this isn't a really big place.  There's outdoor and indoor seating, a couple of big TV's (or maybe just one, I actually don't remember now), and some cool paintings on the walls.  The paintings aren't anything Rembrandt, but for some reason I find them oddly entertaining.

I personally enjoy the food ordering process.  It's the Subway style layout, except with Mexican food.  You get a choice of three types of meat, two types of rice, three types of beans, two types of sauces, plus a bunch of extra stuff.  Personally I don't experiment too much, but I can honestly say the chicken, re-fried beans, Mexican rice, and red sauce is tasty.

The employees are friendly and put up with the zoned-out, zombie-like way I shuffle about when I'm thinking of what I want to eat, so thank you for that.  They give off a good, fun, I-don't-hate-you-for-being-here vibe and ring a bell when you leave a tip.

So all in all: good service, good food, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Chipotle-ish layout.  I tend to like the americanized Chipotle food better, but I've just had Bajio's salads so far.  

The only issue with the salads... they are SOAKED by the time you are finishing your meal, so it's not crunchy anymore.

Other than that, like the paintings on the walls, the mexican feel.  I hear the nachos are RIDICULOUS.  I will be trying more foods later on, but so far it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped by Bajio's for lunch today for the sake of trying something new.  I had the chicken stuffed quesadilla which just happened to be the daily special at $6.99.  A coworker had a sweet green chili quesadilla which sounded strange but tasted very good as well! The portions were plentiful so you will not leave hungry.  I will definitely returning to try out some more menu items.

And yes.......the random bell ringing/pot clanging was a little obnoxious..."}
{"text":"Great causal Mexican food. Better than Chipotle IMO. Decent price, good selection, lots of variety."}
{"text":"I come in all the time. I love the salad, taquitos, nachos and the burritios is great.The shrimp tacos were horrible, soggy gross mess, don't waste your money on them.  I like that I can choose what I get in my dishes. They are a bit more expensive compared to other mexican restaurants that are near by. My biggest issue is the staff. They act as if you are bothering them. Out of about 20 visits, only 2 did I feel welcome and get a smile. They act as robots just going down the line of ingrediants. The day shift girls are so much nicer than the night. I try so hard to engage them hoping for a different experience but no luck. They do seem empty compared to the other busy restaurants that are right there. Would love to walk in and have someone say....\"Hi, Welcome, How can I help you\". Tries to order a Churro for dessert, they don't make them anymore.. Sad, a mexican restaurant without Churros.....WHAT!!!! They need to have more than just one size of drink."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were awesome. The refried beans were bland and kinda gross. The rice was decent. I'll come back again but I won't order beans."}
{"text":"This is a family owned Chipotle like kind of place adorned with  Whimsical Disneyish  boarder line offensive Stereotype Mexican Caricature Paintings. Your food is served to you in aluminum cake pans. (that might be a sign to run away) and they ring a cow bell when you tip them. (maybe another sign of I got another sucker today and this one going to die when they try this food)  I've been here before and thought I remembered it being better and maybe I was just here on a off day on my most recent visit. My expectations weren't high I knew where I was I was just expecting quick and OK.

I am giving two stars based on my husband's meal of two enchiladas that he said wasn't the best but edible and cheap.

I liked the fresh greens in my salad and I really liked the fresh cabbage option for the salad but I didn't like my Chicken Green Chile Salad for many reasons. So I have to think do I just don't like it because of my taste or is this a meal that IS awful? My conclusion is that it was awful.

1) The Chicken tasted like CANDIED Chicken. It's a shame because the chicken seemed fresh and was cooked nice and seemed like it could have been good in other hands. (even a caveman can do better)  I didn't know you could make chicken that sweet. They took the time to marinate the chicken with honey and poured a ton of honey on top of it.

2) The what seemed like house made dressing was awful and I don't know what it was suppose to be. It could be used as a WD40 substitute. I took a small taste and pushed it away before it caused damage in my system.

3) The pasteurized guacamole like green stuff just doesn't taste good. It's manufactured mix of chemicals that Lowe's maybe uses in their paint.

4) The salsa tasted like those budget jarred salsa that always suck. Nothing fresh and not so good tasting. Very flat and soggy.

5) They gave me a fresh made flour tortilla that was RAW!

6) Where was the Green Chile? Nothing resembled green chile in my salad but I did have fried onions and I did have fresh greens in a tin! WOO HOO!

ADIOS Bajio!

{"text":"This place is disgusting. Food was too greasy, bland, and surprisingly not cheap at all. Next time I will just go to Chipotle for better quality and service. I was sick all day thanks to this establishment."}
{"text":"Very quiet here (few people) & multiple times we've been here the same staffers have been here with consistency in both food & svc.  I should rate it higher but I don't eat Mexican that often out.  We actually were taken care of by the owner who was very pleasant.  He even checked on us & the other patrons.  We were entertained by his telling of some of his humorous work situation real life stories.  Oh, the food?  It's not bad $7.95 for a smoked beef salad with 2 sides & $7.95 for a shredded glazed chicken burrito.  We cared enough to share some of our marketing ideas with him.  See, we make the world go round."}
{"text":"I want to create a time line showing how Bajio went from my favorite early release destination way back in high school to its current situation. I can only guess that the brief period that the restaurant closed down only to be reopened under new ownership was the tipping point into bad food territory. 

Thanks to Henry Ford, this place uses an assembly line to create the Americanized Mexican food that it churns out for its customers. I usually get a plain bean and cheese burrito because I'm not a big fan of most of their toppings. I've always liked that the food comes with free chips and salsa. 

I've tried other menu options like salads and chicken burritos, and everything is just so-so. I want this place to return to its former glory with the shouting for tips such, but I think that the current environment is here to stay."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of these types of Mexican restaurants. It's the line up and order what you want and they scoop all your ingredients onto your burrito right in front of you steez.

It's the Chipotle/Qdoba/Kokopelli/Cafe Rio style place.

What sets Bajio apart from these other spots? I think their restaurant is a bit nicer & they have some additional options that you might not find at the other guys.

3 types of beans: refried, black & spicy
2 types of rice: Mexican style & sweet
TONS of types of sauces

If you're a fan of this type of Mexican & you want lots of choices, give Bajio a try."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Bajios!\" - That's what the people behind the counter exclaim as you walk through their door.

Bring a larger-than-life appetite or be prepared to take your left over food with you when you leave!

This place is clean, the service is top notch and the food is fresh and rather tasty!

My weapon of choice?  The Chicken Chimichanga: Lime Chicken, mexican rice, black beans, green sauce.  Then they toss it into the fryer right in front of you.

While the chimichanga is attaining crispiness, your pan is prepared: I choose more mexican rice, black beans, fajitas (onion, bell peppers) and the green sauce.

Once the chimichanga is done, they place it on your pan and adorn it with more green sauce (whatever salsa you choose), sour cream and guacamole.

With the chimichanga and drink it comes out to under $11.

Another worthy mention is that the ice in the ice machine is crushed ice... the good kind.

When you tip them, the person at the register yells \"Propina!\"  and the rest of the crew answers \"Gracias!\"

We frequent Bajios enough to where we know the servers and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"I thought it was good. Nothing great nothing bad. I had a taco with half chicken half beef and side of rice and beans. It was all on par with every other place around. The service was great but I was the only one there. LOL  The place was clean and quiet."}
{"text":"Ok...  Fair statement here: I LOVE Bajio but my wife hates it.  The food is great, the price is right and the service - ohhh the service can not be beat!  I'll continue to sneak off and eat here when the wife isn't looking."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place cause I needed a quick bite and it was new to me.  Well needless to say I ate and left.  I don't even remember what I ate, but it was food for sure -- I think!? Okay gotta stop being mean.  Let's just say it wasn't anything \"new\".  Nothing I couldn't have ordered say from Rubio's or Chipotle.  Yo quero Taco Bells please :(  The place itself was decorated with some traditional Mexican portraits and paintings in an industrial-like setting.  Kinda odd, but whatever tickles your senses I guess. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bajio makes me sing \"Loco Gringos Like a Party.\" Okay, so Bajio isn't really where you go to party I was just compelled to use Rev. Horton Heat lyrics in this review. You could say it's like that old joke there's a party in your mouth and everyone's coming. Except it's the Bajio food that's making the party in your mouth... Um, where is this going?
 Bajio is *Krills! The brightly painted walls hold the enormous and very cool paintings (Prints?) on the walls, the weathered dangling lamps Bajio's decor makes you feel as though you should be in San Diego and not next to a Home Depot off of Flamingo. 
 When you get down to business and make your order the set up is that station style (like Subway) where you get to pick and chose the variety of beans, rice, meat, etc. Everything down to the sour cream is seasoned and that's what makes Bajio different from the other chains of Mexican food joints. It's not authentic but it's a place that you can prolly bring those who don't like Mexican food and they would eat it and you'd be happy to be there.  
 *Krills is street for Crack Rock."}
{"text":"This is a fast food Mexican chain similar to Chipotle or Cafe Rio. The pork burrito ($5.41) I tried had a sweet taste to it. Not as good as the pork burrito at Cafe Rio, but not bad. The size of it was comparable to those other places. It's a decent little fast food place, but if I had to choose among the three, my favorite would still be Cafe Rio.

2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Bajio by a co-worker who lives nearby and visits so often that most of the employees know her. She loves the Chicken Green Chile Salad which I tried once and was good. But I love the Pineapple Shrimp Salad which is what I usually get because of the delicious mix of flavors and textures. The salad has both rice and lettuce and comes with crispy flour tortillas. The Shrimp Tacos are also good. They saute the shrimp right when you order it so it takes a bit longer but is nice and fresh. I didn't like the Enchiladas which are not what I consider a true Enchilada. It's like ordering a Quesadilla at Chipotle.

From what I can tell, they bang the kettle when someone leaves a tip. This annoys me too, but like Tracy I keep going back because the food's good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great for dining but the \"Chipotle-Style\" line you go through to order your food while they prepare it in front of you is less than appealing.  But hey... at least you can see what they are doing while making your food? :)

My wife and I had a burro and some enchildas and they were both very good.  The homemade chips are a little greasy but other than that, they have a great salsa bar televisions with sporting events so that you can enjoy a good game while having your Mexican food."}
{"text":"meh...I came here a few months back and was disappointed, thought I'd give them another try today. Had an enchilada style burrito with beans and rice. Their food is bland. I wish I had more to say but honestly, this place won't last. There are other better options nearby."}
{"text":"Oh my! How have I NOT reviewed this place yet?! It is amazing. This is in the top 2 of my favorite restaurants in North Phx. (the other one is Bamboo Grill) If the man is there, he is the best. Always happy to see you, and ready to chat while he cooks! I have gone in here with my mom and sister, with just me and Hubs, and with my 2 little ones. Every time the food is fantastic. If it's just the girls working, the service pales in comparison to when the guy is there.. but the food makes up for that! Try the tortilla soup! Made right there in front of you and ohhhh... sooo good! Hubby and I always share the fajitas classica.. mmm... I think that is the best way to go. And they are more than willing to give you extra of whatever you ask for. And if you throw in a dollar for them, they ring the bell and yell \"AYYYY\" lol Also, good prices, especially if you split something, which is totally doable since their servings are huge!"}
{"text":"The food is good enough.  A couple things are a little more creative than Chipotle would offer.  The beans and rice are nothing to write home about and unfortunately, they give you a lot of that..  The fruit-based salsas are nice.  There is a the sweet green chili sauce they do that is nice, but probably high in sugar for an entree.  If you get a drink, you might easily drop $10.  You can get better food for that at a sit-down Mexican place.."}
{"text":"I wasn't really very impressed. Bajio isn't *bad* by any stretch, but it's certainly nothing to really rave about.

The prices were a little steep for what you get and everything (keep in mind, this is mexican food) was oddly sweet for some reason...and that struck me oddly. 

Burritos and such, served in a very Chipotle-esque fashion, but for a few bucks more than Chipotle. 

I don't believe I'll be returning. Not because it was a negative experience, just exceptionally \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Good, not great.  The quality of the food was subpar and the quantity didn't make up for any of what was lost. Workers weren't very friendly and it was pricier than chipotle, without being better."}
{"text":"Not bad... 


Not in love with the salsas.. they are kind of too sweet. Chicken was spicy and the burrito was good.  

Just another burrito place. Not bad, just nothing great. Nothing to me that really makes it stand out."}
{"text":"Bajio is my favorite place for a yummy, quick, cheap dinner. I've gone at least once a week since I found out about the place. Their beef is delicious, and I just tried their sweet pork and am now a huge fan of it too! The only not-so-fabulous thing about Bajio is their rice. It's okay, but definitely not the greatest. Everything else is phenomenal though, and you can't beat the price; an enchilada with two sides and a taco with all the fixings for $7 and some change."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I have never walked away from a restaurant still hungry.  This is not authentic Mexican food and was literally flavorless.  The meat was dry, the salsa tasted like tomato sauce, and the rice was way over cooked.  All in all, I will never go there again, it's crap"}
{"text":"My family used to love eating here, but it's gone way downhill. Our last to-go order just wasn't cooked right and was un-appetizing. Not a huge deal, we'll just call 'em and they'll make it right.. right? The number on the receipt was out of service. After my wife finally got ahold of someone, they said they would have a manager call us back. Never happened, guess we will have to do a chargeback now. After reading this place is family owned, it makes me sad to see a once beautiful place serving delicious food lose all passion."}
{"text":"On a lazy Sunday, needed to get a quick bite for lunch and wanted to try something different.  Figured we'd give this place a try as my wife loves hispanic food.  I ran over for take out.  First the place is actually huge inside which is surprising and they have a couple of flat panel TVs in the dining area.  I grabbed a couple of their burritos, one with pork and the other with chicken.  They make everything in front of you and have quite a few options to put in the burrito.  I had the \"spicy beans\" in my burrito and they were anything but spicy.  The salsa provided also was bland.  Overall the food was OK, but nothing that is going to make me want to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The downward spiral is complete...the wife was going to eat Bajio tonight while I was going to pick up L&L.  Our plans were foiled as Bajio is CLOSED (letter on the door indicating non-payment)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food, but I was the only one in my party that did. Nice decor and pretty decent menu selection, but I have had far better mexican food before. I'm from So Calif, so it is hard to find good mexican when you travel, nothing tastes like home. I wouldn't return and if I was a local I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this restaurant again. Maybe my expectations are too high or their standards are too low."}
{"text":"Who wants to stand around and read a menu on a wall and then stand around some more and wait for your subpar Mexican food to be cooked?  It wasn't even that busy when I went there, but I still stood there for over 5 minutes. I would never come here for lunch when it might be more crowded.  Who wants to spend their lunch hour standing around when they could have a more customer friendly system of ordering your food and then having it bring it to you?  They are going for that Subway-style watch them assemble your food vibe - but it just takes too long.

The mexican rice and black beans were the blandest I have ever tasted.  Not only did I pay the extra $1.79 for this worthless crap, but it was also included in my burrito where it totally killed any taste.  I would never go back to this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area, wanted to try something new, scoped it out on YELP. Thought it would be good because the reviews were good. Only one menu off to the side in the whole place. One girl was working, no greeting, went up and asked her about a menu item and could have cared less. She didn't ask if it was our first time or try to help in any way, was tossing things around, must have hated her job. Could barely hear her when asking the type of bean or rice we wanted. Absolutely would not come here again. The impression from just the employee not having any sort of customer service skills was enough for me to not want to come back. The food was decent, had a salad and nothing to write home about. You can just go to Chipotle and get the customer service and good food."}
{"text":"I don't know if I just went on an off night for the staff ...  Good thing I have a sense of humor.  I decided to keep my order simple, a fried been and cheese burrito.  For some reason they could not get it right and had to start over.  They were all running around behing the counter, everyone had to keep repeating their order as we moved down the line.  They also kept throwing red sauce on top of my burrito when I didn't ask for any.  I gave up and just had to laugh.  I won't be going back anytime soon.  Their trash was overflowing, we had a long wait in line (and it wasn't that busy) plus I didn't think their tortilla chips were good.  If the chips aren't good, I don't go back."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos anywhere! The atmosphere is great, the place is nice and big and kid friendly."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite of mine, but recently when I eat there I do not feel well afterward. The quality of the food is no longer where it once was.  I will not eat here again,"}
{"text":"Good food here!  My beef tacos were awesome a lot of flavor in the smoked beef.  The sweet rice was OK not really my favorite but i wanted to try something new.  

Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was a little pissy that I had to ditch my cousin and the volleyball game with UNLV for my mom and Home Depot to pick out paints for the house.    On the way to Home Depot we decided to get some dinner first.  Considering we always eat at buffets, casino restaurants, or at home we didn't know where to go and what restaurants were around Fort Apache and Flamingo.  

I spotted an orangey-yellow bright sign that said Bajio so I kindly suggested it to my family and there we were.  I didn't know what to expect.  I honestly thought it was a restaurant where people seat you and serve you.  It wasn't like that at all; it was a fast food joint.  I thought maybe it was just gonna be another Rubio's or Baja Fresh.  The interior was very modern with the light fixtures dangling down from the ceiling, plants all over the place, wall painted with warm colors, and tables and chairs lined up almost like a small version of a mall food court setting.  

When you reach the ordering station, the menu is actually painted on the wall.  Very interesting setting.  I was torn between the Mexican Pizza and Shrimp Tacos.  The Mexican Pizza had \"a layer of rice and beans, with your choice of chicken, beef, or pork sandwiched between two crisp flour tortillas, smothered with enchilada sauce, melted cheese, salsa and sour cream\".  As for the Shrimp Taco it had \"Two 6\" flour tortillas stuffed with shrimp sauteed in honey butter, topped with cheese and fresh mango salsa. Served with lime and your choice of rice and beans on the side.\"   Since it sounded so interesting, I decided to get them both.  I'm so glad I didn't just choose one.  They were both so yummy!  My mother chose the Nachos, \"Crisp tortilla chips topped with melted Monterey jack and cheddar cheese, choice of rice and beans, chicken, beef or pork, and topped with salsa and sour cream.\"  As for my step-dad, he decided to get the Veggie Burrito, \"Fresh-cooked 12\" flour tortilla, wrapped with your choice of rice and beans, sour cream, guacamole, sauteed chile corn and caramelized sweet onions. Topped with enchilada sauce, salsa and cheese. Served with your choice of rice and beans on the side.\"  They were both very good but what I chose was better.

I was very impressed with the menu and the decor.  Only thing I wasn't impressed with was the girl that served us.  She got annoyed with my step dad coz he's some what hard of hearing.  So, you gotta SPEAK UP when you talk with him otherwise you'll just go back and forth with a puzzled look and \"HUH?\" questions left and right.  She told the another person to help us in the middle of helping us coz she got fed up repeating herself.  I think she hates her job!  But then again, there was a long ass line behind us and she was one of those people who can't handle pressure.  The guy she gave us to was a darling.  He was awesome with a smile.  I definitely will go back for him juz coz he was super duper nice.

We left Bajio satisfied and agreed to go back again sometime soon.  I think I'll take my cousins here next week so I can take pictures with them.  Mmmm, can't wait."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm shrimp tacos.  I used to live in the Bajio in Mesa.  I feel like I was there once a week.  My favorite Mexican food.  The shrimp tacos have a honey sauce that is to die for and the tortillas are cooked on the griddle just long enough to keep them from getting soggy.  Really good stuff.  Plus the queso is wicked good.  This location is a bit pricier than the old Mesa one was but at least it is still open.  They also serve beer out here because it's not Mesa.  Much love for the No.Pho Bajio...just wish it wasn't so far."}
{"text":"Love this place. I usually get the pineapple shrimp salad for $9 and the potions so big I get 2 lunches out of it. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Located across from Lowe's.  Easy to be tempted by Ray's Pizza just a couple doors down though.  Their burritos are made in front of you there and served in a large basket.  Portions were generous but the prices were up there to match.  Parking isn't bad at all because of the Lowe's lot."}
{"text":"I really do hate Mexican food.  I'm too picky to enjoy the massive amounts of pepper flavors and onions that permeate this type of food.  However, there is one place on earth that I would choose to get Mexican food any day of the week.  Bajio!

I was actually introduced to this place while I was in Utah and was ecstatic to find it here in AZ.  There used to be one on Stapley that we went practically every time we went out to the EV.  Unfortunately, that location is no longer.  Anyway, Bajio prepares high quality and flavorful food that doesn't break the bank.  My favorite items are the ones with the shrimp.  Just trust me and get it, you can thank me later.  Their salads are also really great and a nice alternative to the heavier fare.

I really wish that Bajio would come downtown and make my dreams come true, but until then, I guess I'll have to make the trek up here to get it."}
