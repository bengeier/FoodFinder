{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it was a first time experience! Totally loved the place! Small cozy restaurant! Came in and just missed the rush, the owners were so nice and really showed they care about the place! They make EVERYTHING fresh there which is always a plus. The food was delicious. The burgers are great and so was the cheesesteak. I don't live close at all but I'll defiantly be making the drive back!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't order from here again my Burger was verry sloppy bread was stuck to the burger so I am guessing they reheated and didn't freshly cook. Fries was borderline like noodles either the fries was old or they had the fries sitting in oil for a long period of time. This is my first time writing a Yelp review so you can tell how uneasy I was about the food I ordered."}
{"text":"The food is ridiculously good. Big burgers. Great fries. Only four stars because the place is lacking in decor and the bathroom was horrendous. You can bring your own alcohol too! I had the bacon jalape√±o cheeseburger and cheesesteak fries. Big burger and huge basket of fries. Owner was cool and friendly."}
{"text":"Oder your \"food\" from this place if you like eat substandard gruel.  The fries were the saddest I've ever seen.  Think of a box full of shoelaces, then think how that would feel to try and eat. That's what this place calls fries.    The chicken came in a Styrofoam box which had melted around it. It was undercooked and oozing oil which had obviously not been changed in a while as I could also taste the fries and whatever other horse shit this place fries up in order to rip other people off.   So needless to say this \"food\" went straight to the garbage.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Just can't comment on the food, can not seem to find it open. So waited till a Saturday where the hours say closing at 1:00 am. Because of other comments mentioning the hours, I called first, \" Yes, we're open\"  well drive there, parallel park on Az. ave. (seems like the only option), walk to the place and greeted by a Closed sign @ 8:30. Food may be good, but really not worth the time to drive by and maybe they're open. Are these odd hours because lack of business, or just Ol' Johnny likes to work when it'll fits in to his busy schedual. Two stars instead of one because the food may be good, judging by the comments, just can't seem to try it."}
{"text":"I somehow wandered here while I was super baked one day. Owner was super laid back and his daughter, the other person working there, was super chill. The burger was really flavorful and worth going a few miles out of your way for. I also got the cheesesteak fries and all I can say for those is don't get them to go. They don't hold up too well. The vibe alone may be worth going out of your way for but the food really stands out."}
{"text":"My 14yr old son loves this place.  Sometimes we get a craving for greasy diner food and Johnny's is the place.  They have some of the best delivery anywhere and always mean to please."}
{"text":"My first time at late night Johnny's was a very pleasant experience,it was a delivery order for lunch I had the bacon and jalapeno burger chili cheese fries both were awesome!!! My burger was very juicy and very tasty!! I will order more from late night Johnny's.."}
{"text":"Great burgers and check steak. Good delivery . They were about to late on delivery and called to let us know and apologize.  I didn't even notice they were late."}
{"text":"Ordered food via grubhub over 2 hours ago. Owner called to say they were making a new pot of chili and it would only be an extra 15 minutes for delivery time, no problem but then an hour passes so I called and he tells me only another 20 mins. Maybe the food is good but this wait is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We had made a couple attempts to try Johnny's and finally were able to have a relaxing lunch today.   It was worth the return.      We discovered that during the school year, avoid the school lunch hour.   We tried the burger,  Philly and fries.  The burger was delicious!   The meat itself was very flavorful and cooked to perfection.   The fries were great fresh cut fries.  It was all simple but delicious.   The Philly was very cheesy and more of a knife and fork meal.    The neighborhood may look a little suspect,  but don't let that stop you.    The owner takes great pride in seeing that customers are pleased.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"As a Franchise Business Consultant for a major restaurant chain based here in AZ,it takes ALOT for me to be impressed when it comes to food(especially delivery). In this age of Burger Boutiques popping up like Circle K's and Walmart's, it is refreshing to see a Indy Mom and Pop doing it right! The Chicago Burger was by far better than any new fab pop up burger factory. My diet may not be happy with my new discovery but my taste buds and sanity welcome it. Great job Late Night Johnny's!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great hamburger, hand-cut fries and a friendly owner, this is the place.  It's not fancy but the food is awesome and the people are super.   Unfortunately we went there on a weekday before noon and ran into a mob of Chandler High School kids on their lunch break.  They have a great student menu and the kids fill the place. I sub at the high school sometimes and I knew that they had to be back in class by 12:11 so we decided to stay. The owner saw us (the only adults in the place) and assured us they would be gone soon.  Sure enough at 12:03, the kids started packing up and by 12:08, the place was completely empty and quiet. Our Cheese steak fries were so good, it could have been a meal in itself. Johnny came out and chatted with us then brought us a sample of his teriyaki steak.  It was then we knew we would be back. Big, tender seasoned burgers and I had an egg on mine! They have a beer and wine license but you have to bring your own. There's little to no parking but find a way to get there, eat, and meet Johnny. It'll make your day!"}
{"text":"Always super nice and helpful! Johnny himself will call you if there are any issues and he is always willing to help you out with whatever he can! I love the wings and burgers! You can tell they are in the business of customer service and not just good late night food stuffs. I especially love the variety of items on the delivery menu."}
{"text":"So I put an online order in through Yelp for delivery, but they ran out of chicken for my 8 piece bucket. There were only 5 pieces left, so the owner personally called me and apologized. Then he substitute it with a sandwich. Very nice guy. I think he probably thought I was a \"yelper\". However, I was just really high on my medication and didn't want to stay on the phone. So if you're seeing this, Johnny, good service man!"}
{"text":"Love to eat at Late Night Johnny's. Excellent burgers done with Johnny's secret steam method. I had the chili cheese burger and it was a monster, barely finished it.   Johnny is an interesting fellow. He used to be the road manager for Sublime. Some of the best dive food around."}
{"text":"Can't I start off with a giant OMG ......was looking for a BBQ joint that delivered I was craving some ribs in a bad way unfortunately they were out of the ribs as the owner (I believe )went over the menu with me he suggested a burger he said they were one of the best sellers. I am A burger snob my daughter suggested\" i order something else because I probably wouldn't enjoy it but the owner kept insisting I would love it so I said put all the fixings on it and will try it out. The owner said no you must try it just bread meat and cheese it's the best I thought that was crazy but he said he would put the fixings on the side for me well the cutest little delivery girl came to the door she had her stuff and arrived very quickly she said don't forget to try the burger plain . I did and have to say it was the best or in the top two but I'm leaning on the best burger I have ever eatenand once I had of their sin cut crispy fries I completely forgot about having to pay that extra dollar where was well worth it. This will be my new go to burger joint or late night delivery place as long as it doesn't get too busy but I have a feeling when people try this place it's going to be a hit"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Got delivery. Food was good, delivery was prompt, prices are reasonable. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Amazing food just wish delivery was a little quicker but its def worth the wait."}
{"text":"I stopped in here yesterday looking for Gigi's BBQ which had previously occupied this space and found out that Gigi's is gone and Johnny has taken over the space.  He's about as friendly a guy as you'd like to meet and takes his food seriously.  He said he cooks everything like he's cooking it for himself.  He showed me the huge package of meat he makes the fresh burgers from and a potato the size of a football.  I got a cheeseburger with fries and even though the burger was huge I ate the whole thing. The burgers are steamed on the grill to keep the moisture in and let the fat out.  This makes it a burger that isn't as greasy and heavy as usual. Everything was as good as my mother would make.  He gave me a sample of chili and if you like yours with a burn you'll love this.  I like mine a little milder but that's just what I learned to like in early life.    If you need late night food he's open late weekend nights.  And if you're a student at Chandler High there's a special menu for students.  Both the regular menu and the student menu are written on the wall to your right as you walk in.  If you're in doubt if he's there just drive by and look for the OPEN sign in the window.  If it's lit, he's there."}
{"text":"I must admit had we not had a groupon we probably would have not gone here and this would have been a HUGE mistake on our part.  Not only did Johnny himself prepare our food and greet us, but he took the time to explain to us the quality of the different items that were on his menu.  We have been looking for this type of \"locally owned\" family friendly place since moving here and I think we've found it.  Thanks Johnny.  Keep up the good work and amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers with a generously sized patty! The burger to bun ratio was perfect.  The bonus for my husband and I was meeting Johnny himself.  We originally planned on ordering our food to go but ended up eating at the restaurant.  We spent a couple of hours just hanging out and talking to Johnny.  Our only regret was not finding this spot earlier.  Johnny, thank you for the laughs and sharing your life stories with us!  We will be back before the 29th!  -Judith and Dominic"}
{"text":"Love ordering from this place.  Burgers and sandwiches are delicious - it's a rare thing to be able to order a burger and fries for delivery, but a better thing when the burgers are far better than other major chains or exotic stuffed/fat/5 guys places.  Late Night Jonny's also has a few specialty items - teriyaki rice bowl, chicken & Hawaiian style items to name few.  Food always arrives on time and hot - it's good to have a place like this in the hood'."}
{"text":"Do NOT GET DELIVERY. Food was disgusting. Carne Asada fries were slathered  with a weird gravy. The sour cream was missing. The guacamole was guacamole colored and that's about the only similarity to guacamole. The Salsa was a dark red almost black pur√©ed concoction that had a hint of tomato flavor. The hotdog was fine because, well it's difficult to mess up, But I will say it was cooked fine and had a good flavor. The mozzarella sticks didn't actually have mozzarella inside them, it was just kind of congealed next to it. They did deliver on time, which is basically the only redeeming quality. I would not recommend this place for delivery."}
{"text":"Have called many times with no answer. Is this place open? If so where are they exactly, walked up and down the street and saw no signs or lights anywhere about it."}
{"text":"My brother in law brought my husband and I here not too long ago. The food is incredibly delicious - specifically the burgers and the chili! Glad I was able to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch today and it was awesome!  I got the Chicago burger and my husband got the cheesesteak sandwich with fries and drinks.  The food was fantastic, I've never had a burger so tender.  My husband said the cheesesteak was great with super tender steak.  The atmosphere is super casual and very inviting and friendly.  The owner treated us like an old friend right from the start and chatted with us and the other customers creating one big conversation.  The prices are super reasonable for what you get, and it is FRESH.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I'm editing my review since I have now ordered from Johnny's three times in a week.  The burgers are excellent; flavorful and juicy.  I have had the Hawaiian style burger, the Fried egg cheeseburger, the plain fries and the cheesesteak fries.  Everything so far has been something I would recommend and eat again.   I love that they deliver but there is a caveat; because of the nature of the food they have to handle delivery a little differently than, say, a pizza place would.  They can't just wait until they have 4-5 orders saved up to deliver all at once.  Because of this the delivery time can be a little long, depending on time of day and how many other delivery orders are ahead of yours.  My food has always arrived hot and tasty.  This being said, if you order plain fries don't expect them to be as crisp as they would be if you ate in the restaurant.  I don't mind my fries a little on the softer side and the flavor has been great so I have no complaints about that but I know others have. I order delivery through Eat24 and when I ordered the other day I got a call from the owner Johnny.  He told me that the pulled pork fries that I had ordered weren't actually on the menu right now (he states he has told Eat24 about this several times) because his smoker is outside and well, we live in Arizona and the temp was 117.  'Nuff said!  He gave me some other options to substitute for the pulled pork fries and he let me know where my order was in the delivery que and apologized that it can take so long and he is the one that gave me the info about their delivery process.  That day he told me they had three delivery drivers on duty and were getting the food out as quickly as they could.  It really didn't take me that much longer to get my food than some pizza places around here. Overall, this is a great place and I look forward to trying their other menu items."}
{"text":"We have only ordered from Johnny's Grill once but are so happy to find a place that delivers a lot of options from sandwiches to broasted chicken dinners. Service was fast. The food was hot and tasty. Prices are reasonable. We have no complaints."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and fries for delivery. They were quick enough and the food was good. The fries tasted like the ones you get at the fair. I wanted my wings plain because I was sharing with someone who eats a different flavor than I and they followed directions only putting sauces on the side (you wouldn't believe how much trouble I've had trying to get other restaurants to do this) Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"It's not often you find a place that delivers burgers and fries. For my family, it's like finding the holy grail.   When we do delivery, our expectations are pretty low. Most places that can deliver, prolly shouldn't and those that don't we'd love to see start. This is one of those times where we were pleasantly surprised.  I had the jalapeno burger. It had good flavor and the jalapeno's were the real deal. All fresh with a good amount of heat. Hubs had the cheese burger which actually came as a patty melt. It  wasn't really what he was expecting but was still happy with it. My daughter had the chicken, which my husband also tried. He was happy. There are three levels with my husband pretty good, okay and bad. The chicken got a pretty good.  Also got some fries, which seemed to all be homemade. Some bacon jalapeno skins, which were on par with that I'd expect. And chili cheese fries. It was my least favorite of the dishes but still had good flavor. Plus they added jalapenos to it and I was happy with that.  On the whole, it was a good meal. Maybe I would have been a little harder on the place if I had gone in but it unfair to judge it that way when all the food is being made and sent elsewhere. So for delivery, it was just what we needed. Totally plan on ordering from here next time I don't want to drive for food and need a good burger."}
{"text":"This is not you elegant dining experience. However the food is the most important part of the equation. Therefore it gets the 5 stars. Chilli cheeseburger was great."}
{"text":"The Philly cheesesteak sandwich and the Philly cheesesteak fries were pretty good, but would probably be better dining in versus getting delivery. By the time I got my food well after the 45 minute quoted time the fries were all shifted to one side of the try looking like a pile of garbage and the sandwich was roughly about the same. All of the guts of the sandwich were only on one half of the bread and scattered around the platter. The paper they used inside of the styrofoam trays had everything stuck to it and were quite a pain to remove the food from without pulling up the paper. I would consider going back here if I found myself craving a Philly cheesesteak was nearby it so I could walk in instead of another horrible delivery service. But I'll probably just go to philly's famous next time."}
{"text":"This is second time i've eaten here. Both times were great. My first visit a had the cheese steak which actually packed full of meat and cheese and full of flavor. Today I had the bacon jalapeno cheese burger. Great flavor and they put fresh jalapenos in there. Makes a big difference. On both visits the owner Johnny came out and asked how I liked my food. Not only is the food good but the customer service is good too. I will definitely be back there's many more items on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"If i could rate Johnny's 10 * i would....... Omg ,i am a 1st timer but a new loyal customer.. Had the cheesburger to go. I took 1 bite (@Johnny's request, lol) and i was done before i made it home (i live less than a 1/2 mile away) He also let us sample the chili & teriyaki steak ...BOTH JUST AS AMAZING! The service was very friendly and personable. Made us fell like welcomed guest in his home. Family owned and operated...... Great place to go with the family."}
{"text":"I desperately want to give this place a try but apparently it's not meant to be. When I try to order online through Yelp apparently my apartment on Warner/McQueen is out of range, yet you put the flyer on my door. I try to call and I get the voicemail. I have a late night craving to try your food, but you've made it too difficult. My $ will be spent elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place is no longer in business.  It is now a Slice of Chicago which is opening to great reviews!"}
