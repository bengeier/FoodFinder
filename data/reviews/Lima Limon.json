{"text":"WOW!!! 

This restaurant is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! Don't get me wrong the other restaurant is still my favorite peruvian restaurant to go to with family but this place is a definite close second and much closer. 

I came here with my mom to try it out because we have heard such good things about it. Boy were those people right, this place has the makings to be a very sucessful restaurant. The inside of this restaurant reminds me of a 50s diner with its layout.

The food very very good. The only thing missing was a traditional chicken dish, but that was the least of my worries. 

The employees were even kind and helpful when it came to deciding what to choose from ( from what i saw tonight) they even came from time to time to check up on the customers.


The Best Peruvian Food in Las Vegas? Hell yea!
Will I come back? No doubt about it.

**Congratulations**"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the somewhat bland, strip mall decor. Great, authentic Peruvian food. Had the ceviche, chicken lomas, and boiled potatoes. All terrific. The ceviche was dynamite! Enthusiastic and attentive service. Plan to make it a habit."}
{"text":"Delicious my first time here. I order Lomo saltado impressed by the preservation and amazed from the taste! My husband order ceviche de pescado y camaron, I'm Mexican and had good ceviche before but this blew my mind probably best ceviche I've ever tasted. Friends order other plates that looked and tasted amazing. I will be back!!! In love with Peruvian cuisine. Nice place clean and good service."}
{"text":"The reason this restaurant is even getting two stars was because of the ceviche. The ambiance is a feeling of confusion. They can't decide to be a high end restaurant or a diner. The menu lacked a few of my personal favorites. However, standard Peruvian fare was readily available. 

We started with the ceviche which was undeniably good, but lacked the crunchy corn that I love with this dish. The Loma Saltado was good per by BFFS review. My dish was so poorly cooked on the other hand. My egg was over cooked. I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it came out well. It had decent flavor, but was quite chewy. 

As for the service it was seriously lacking. We never got refills on our drinks and I was given a steak knife well after I finished dinner. 

Over all we were not impressed. I dub this the \"fast food\" of Peruvian cuisine."}
{"text":"I am so happy i got to try this restaurant! I've never had Peruvian food before and im glad i got to experience it! Let me start by saying the atmosphere was so welcoming, with the colors, cool air and smiling attendants. Plus the giant screens for sports! :) very nice. My family started with the Jalea seafood appetizer, which was amazing! Every bite was so good and loved the lime in it! Also i got the #40 seafood with rice and sauce with hints of lime. All amazing. Our waiter was great! For our family of 11 being there, and it being our first time, he was so patient and helpful. We will be back and i recommend to all!! :)"}
{"text":"This place was great! I was in the Las Vegas area and someone recommended this place. I've been to Peru before and I loved the flavorful food there. I've eaten at Peruvian restaurants before and usually ended up disappointed by the food but this place was definitely an exception. The food was very delicious and presentation was authentic.

I ordered the Ceviche and the Lomo Saltado and they were both outstanding! The flavor and presentation of the ceviche was excellent and the Lomo Saltado was prepared perfectly. The meat was very flavorful. I was also happy with the service. The food was delivered quickley and the waiter was attentive.

The place could use a little more decoration but don't let that put you off. If you want authentic, delicious Peruvian food this place is great choice!"}
{"text":"Great food,  however. ...staff provides EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE. Twenty minutes to  get drinks, another 20 mins to get out food AND an additional 10 mins  for my kids to get their food...which by the way, we ordered it with the drinks!!!!....then to top it all off...when at the cashier to pay, the lady in charge began socializing with other people and proceeded to answer the phone...sooooo another 10 minutes to PAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Peruvian food. Don't be deceived by the location or modest decor--this is high-quality food with generous portions and beautifully crafted dishes. Peruvian myself, I was impressed by the amount of seafood and meat in all our dishes, plus everything is super fresh. As first-timers we had no idea of the ultra generous portions, so be ready for takeout!  Service was very cordial and professional. Highly recommended! We'll come back here each time we are in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors!!!! 

Ceviche mixto  was out of this world.
Citrus spiced marinated with garlic and lime.

Also got the jalea de mariscos. 

Arroz chaufa and that's it I'm stuffed lol ! 

Great job guys.

Ask for Ana she's a great server!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times, and I will keep on coming back. I had a chicken soup was good, arroz chaufa good too, and a lomo saltado ( my favorite dish there so far!)The staff is nice and I have no complaints. They do take a little longer when is busy, but that is expected as people eat at restaurants they like. I never waited too long for my food though. Overall, I like the food and the staff so I give it four stars. Also, I plan on bringing my peruvian family from out of town to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lomo saltado and seafood saltado were really great and if you ask for their spicy sauce it makes the dish taste even better. Our server/host Juan had great knowledge of all their dishes and was very hospitable. Their location might be hard to find for some since they are located in the commercial area that leads to Target. In short, they're behind the gas station in the corner of decatur and meadows. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"We came upon this place by chance while driving around looking for a place to eat. We were way out and away from the strip on Decatur when we saw the small yellow and lime green sign which read: Lima Límon. Not having had the pleasure of eating Peruvian food in Las Vegas or dining at a place that my family hasn't been at this was my opportunity to be first in our family to review a place. The restaurant is clean, with booths featuring intimate lighting. Flatscreen TV's show the latest soccer games but aren't intrusive to the experience. We ordered the standards: Papa a la Huancaina, Anticuchos, Ceviche de Pescado, Palta Rellena and Lomo Saltado. We washed it down with a classic Inka Cola and Chicha Morada. The service was very good, attentive without being intrusive. When we ordered, our waitress asked what order we'd like our food to come out indicating that some items are immediate while others would take a little time to prepare - I suggested that she being the orders out as they became ready. Fresh, well seasoned Ceviche was first. Tangy and spicy with sweet potato and giant yellow corn kernels (not hominy) accompanied it. Next, it was the vegan Palta Rellena, a corn, peas, and tomato stuffed avocado w/ a garlic aioli followed by sizzling iron plates of Anticuchos accompanied by grilled Yucca. We were very satisfied with the freshness, texture, presentation and taste of all of our dishes. We took the Lomo Saltado home and thoroughly enjoyed it later in our hotel room. My son, who was skeptical about eating here was most pleased and gives this place a 4/5 stars. I concur. I am an American born Peruvian who has had the pleasure of having a family who regularly makes and serves all the traditional and esoteric Peruvian dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious. Scrumptious. Outstanding. Just a really fantastic culinary experience. I'm in Vegas on vacation and a friend told me about this place so I decided to check it out. Wow. The food is so expertly prepared. Beautifully developed flavors that just took me back to Lima. A great find."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the Lomo Saltado! The Ceviche is great as well! Best Peruvian place in Las Vegas. The Peruvian place in Henderson does not compare to this."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Had some seafood with fries and rice cooked to perfection. There's usually soccer matches playing on the many screens in the room. Employees are very nice too. However the service is a little slow."}
{"text":"We discovered Lima Limon through yelp as a newly open peruvian restaurant.   We chose the usual dishes that people would normally get at other Peruvian places in the area.   We got ceviche mixto,  lomo saltado, chicken  chufa, and sopa de pollo. The lomo  saltado taste inconsistently depend on the time & day we went. Otherwise it a solid Peruvian restaurant."}
{"text":"La comida es muy rica .... Pero la organización es muy mala.

En varias ocaciones he ordenado por telce o siempre me dicen en 10 min y termino esperando 40 min adentro del restaurant.
Si eliges comer adentro tienes que llevar tiempo ya que también la espera es de 40 min o mas"}
{"text":"The food was ok nothing special... But the service was horrible!! The waitress forgot to give us menus first if all then I didn't get a drink refill not once!! Then the bill was 100 bucks for 7 people.  So not worth the money!!! I'm not a cheap person but I refuse to pay for bad service"}
{"text":"Finally, a good Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas! Food was good, fresh and it felt authentic. Our server was cordial and had great suggestions, just took a bit long to bring me my drink-however, once I did get it it was refreshing. Not pricey and a place to come back with the family."}
{"text":"Place is mehhh. But the food is just on point!! Loved all dishes! I wouldn't get tired of eating their menu everyday! They should move somewhere tho."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!! Best Peruvian food I have EVER had!!!!! The service was also very good and the price is very reasonable for the portions served. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for authentic Peruvian food. Buen provecho"}
{"text":"The food is authentically Peruvian!  Ceviche mixto is excellent and is so filling.  Pisco sour cravings satisfied... Watch out they're deliciously strong :) Felipe and Sophia were our waiters and they are a delight, friendly and great service.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time, Juan are waiter was the best always coming back to check on us. I ordered the lomo saltado that was delicious huge portions for a decent price. I would defently go back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  This was our first time trying Peruvian food, and I am a foodie!  We tried a chicken and beef dish. The spices and flavors....holy schnikies! Freakin' yummy! This place is fantastico!"}
{"text":"Everything we ate: ceviche pescado, Lomo saltado & the appetizer the one with yellow cheese was so delicious!  My hubby & I will come back to try other dishes. All the dishes had awesome flavor & spices. Service was excellent!  We came right on time before the rush."}
{"text":"This place is under staff. Poor service. They took someone else is order who just got there and they never took my order. I walked out after that"}
{"text":"Delice food of las vegas , the best peruvian food original!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kicking myself for not stopping by earlier! The food here is so good :) I've driven by a few times and thought, someday I'll try it. So glad I finally did :D Really friendly staff and amazing food. I had the Lomo Saltado, highly recommended :D"}
{"text":"Una maravilla como machu picchu la comida extraordinaria la atención exelente y el ambiente como si estuvieras en Perú y todo eso nos invita a volver siempre que estemos en vegas Nv."}
{"text":"Excellent food dishes. Our server was really polite and she was on top of her game. The server from another station even stopped to ask how was everything. We really enjoy this place. Our favorite dishes are cevice mixto, arroz chaufa de mariscos and the parihuela soup.... and the cusquena beer fits great with the ceviche."}
{"text":"One of the best Authentic Peruvian food I've ever had service is awesome very clean and well worth the money portions are enough for two people Per serving they have everything for everyone no matter what you tases everything from seafood steak beer wine juices exotic fruits and vegetables I will definitely be coming back love this restaurant"}
{"text":"Very friendly waiter. Simple bit clean. Food was flavorful and nicely presented. Nice Peruvian vibe."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of Las Vegas! Delicious food, big portions, great service from Juan. He is friendly and helpful. One of my favorite spots in Vegas. Thanks Juan."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time tonight. I arrived as they were closing (I didn't realize they were closing) but they allowed me put in an order to take out, which was extremely nice of them. I am so glad they did because the food was phenomenal. Really authentic Peruvian food. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"If you have always wanted to try truly authentic Peruvian food, this is the place to do it. 

Peruvian food is influenced by Japanese cuisine, so don't expect the food to lean really Spanish here. 

I ordered the pollo saltado. The dish was extremely flavorful with the soy sauce emanating through. Some might find the chicken to be a bit dry, but it reminded me of the stir fried chicken in Thai food. Even the rice was buttery and perfect. My favorite part was the French fries soaking in the sauce on the bottom of the plate.

The service is very friendly here. The waiter can offer you an iPad with images of all the food, if you're more visual. The owner is also the chef.

The prices might seems a little on the high side, but the portions are large.

The location is strange, but the best food rarely is in the best location. 

I highly recommend checking this place out, if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Not only that, but the prices are really reasonable. We had the seafood platter and chicken fried rice. For only $40 you get some of the freshest most tastiest seafood ever. If you haven't had Peruvian food before this is the place to try it. It's small mom and pop operation with great friendly service and bumping some great Peruvian music too. Just go and eat it's amazing food. The cheese sauce, red and green hot sauces, potatoes are simply amazing."}
{"text":"I had never tried Peruvian food before, so when I noticed this restaurant steps from the salon I frequent (props to Foxy Lady!), I filed it away to try someday. That day was today, and I only wish I had made this decision earlier!

My husband and I stopped in for lunch, and the large restaurant was nearly empty. Our friendly server brought us a bowl of salted corn kernels (like naked Corn Nuts) and when we told her we were new customers, she brought out a tablet to show us pictures of the various dishes. (Although the menu was fairly descriptive, the images helped to show the differences between the seafood preparations.)

For appetizers, we split papa a la Huanciana (boiled potatoes in yellow pepper cream sauce) and palta relleña (avocado stuffed with potatoes, mayonnaise, and chicken), two traditional cold dishes that seemed like something you'd eat at a picnic. They were both great on their own but even better with the spicy garlic-pepper sauce that our server provided.

For our entrees, I had the lomo saltado (stir-fried rib-eye strips with tomatoes, peppers, and onions, served with sides of french fries and white rice). This, too, is a traditional Peruvian dish, but it didn't stand out to me; I almost felt like I was in Hawaii with all the starchy sides! My husband fared much better with the tacu tacu con mariscos (mixed seafood with fish sauce served with a fried rice and bean patty). We're usually not big fans of octopus or squid, but the sauce was fantastic, and the side dish was a tasty addition.

They don't serve alcohol, so I had an Inca Kola, which was like a golden cream soda, and my husband had the Kola Inglesa, which tasted a lot like Big Red. We both preferred the Inca Kola, and while it was pretty sweet, that's something I would try again.

I read that Peruvian food has lots of Asian influences, and that was certainly the case here, from the soy sauce in the beef dish to the fish sauce in the seafood. And these Latin American flavors reminded me more of Cuban food than traditional Mexican. Portions were large but a bit pricey for lunch, so next time I think I'll stick with the appetizers (and maybe split an entree); there are plenty of options that I'd love to try.

The restaurant has a cute yellow and green logo that appears on their sign and their business cards. It's too bad the interior of the building looks like a '50s diner (red, white, and chrome); it would look so much better with the same theme inside. 

Although our server was friendly and helpful, service was a little slow. We had to ask for water several times, and it took a while to get our bill. But if you have time for a leisurely meal and want to try something out of the ordinary, Lima Limon is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Lima Limon,  where have you been all my life? The ceviche mixto is the perfect balance of citrus, seafood and spices. Peruvian ceviche is very different than Mexican ceviche,  it's still raw,  so come with a very open state of mind."}
{"text":"i am from New Jersey and i was dying for some peruvian food...this restaurant is a must. the food is delicious. the service was a thumbs up and the place was clean. i will be coming here again"}
{"text":"Delicious Peruvian food! The Lomo Saltado is super flavorful. Will definitely be coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Giselle Berta

The food was DELICIOUS!!! We ordered ceviche, jalea and churrasco a lo pobre. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to eat good peruvian food."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Ordered fish with side salad and some lacuma ice cream. Everything was fresh, flavorful and service was good. Wish this restaurant was in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"First time trying Peruvian food and omg was this good! We were recommended this place by our Peruvian friend who has tried other similar restaurants and she was definitely not wrong. My husband got the Lomo Salteado
And I got the Ceviche Verde. The portions are huge and the different flavors are delicious! The Inca Cola is really good as well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Got takeout for dinner here: went for the lomo saltado and the stuffed avocado. Called in my order at 8PM, was told to be there in ten minutes- arrived in 15, and still waited another 10. Not a big deal, gave me time to take in the décor.

I'm not sure why whoever opened this restaurant to sell Peruvian food and didn't bother to remodel he interior. Even just painting the red portions of the walls and trim to yellow or green, to match the logo on their business cards, would be a huge step up and be more cohesive and on theme.

Finally got my food and headed home, hoping the lack of Peruvian influence in the décor was not going to be repeated in the kitchen. But I was at least partially surprised by the quality of the food: the lomo saltado was a plentiful portion (thankfully, as the pricetag was $14) with peppers, onions, and steak strips over an overwhelming portion of fries, served alongside white rice. The rice actually, was very good. Despite not appearing to have any seasoning, it was flavorful and moist without being \"wet\". Loved using it to soak up the extra juices from the steak and onion sauté. However, I do agree with other reviews that say that the steak could have been more tender.
The stuffed avocado was perhaps the most underwhelming Peruvian dish I've ever paid $7 for. The avocado was not even ripe, and the mashed potato, chicken, and mayo mixture was bland and homogenous to the point where I could not find chicken in the dish. Not sure how or why this is so highly recommended in other reviews, maybe it was just an off day.

Side note: the creamy-looking red salsa sauce they have is surprisingly flavorful.. and has quite a bit of kick to it! Definitely get it but use it sparingly until you figure out if you can take the heat.

Edited to add; subtracting an additional star because I got sick to my stomach shortly after posting this (about 10 minutes after finishing my meal) and I continue to feel queasy."}
{"text":"The food was great. I went during lunch and it wasn't too busy only a few tables were taken, but we waited for 45 minutes for our food and all we got was one entre and two appetizers. I would have expected that long wait if it would have been packed. We liked the the food though but it could have been so much better service."}
{"text":"Best ceviche had since travelled in Peru years ago. Very authentic and great helpings - had the lomo saltado and anticuchios which were delicious. Service very warm - perhaps overly attentive! Decor - authentic I suppose :p but doesn't compromise eating experience."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of 12 people for dinner. It's a large venue & while there were a few other tables with 5-6 people plus a few people in booths our service was great. Server (forget his name) recommended several items to our table & let us pa-rouse the Samsung Tablet they had with all the photos of the menu items. Loved the \"corn nuts\" that were complimentary to the table. Our second round of them came out steaming hot & were even better than the 1st. One of our diners was born in Peru & he said this was the real deal authentic Peruvian food. There were many items on the menu that I would like to try so I'll have to go back to try more. Ordered up the Seafood Platter (not on the menu but on the picture menu) for $39.99 (enough for 2 people) as well as the Stuffed Avocado on the appetizer menu. It was all great. House green sauce is great but it's more than a mild spicy. Excellent on the fried calamari & yucca. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for YEARS and just recently went to Ceviches 505 in Miami and was looking for something similar to take me back on vacation. Let me start off by saying; this place is GOOD. I mean, REALLY GOOD. The food is amazing and there wasn't a single bite that I wouldn't recommend. Here's why I gave it 4 stars - the service is SLOW and slightly terrible. It's as if they hired family/friends to be their wait staff - people with literally no service experience- and they are not very hospitable... I'd like to feel welcomed (similar to when you go to most locals spots here - and not like adding another table to help is such an inconvenience.) With that being said, we will absolutely eat here again - just trying to figure out if we should order to go or possibly order ahead of time."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp Alfredo and seafood soup here.  It is very different and delicious.  I would come here again without hesitation.  Great service as well."}
{"text":"Food is super delicious but our waiter this time isn't very good at checking in if we are doing ok or if we need something. For example we have to get up and to front of restaurant to ask for anything extra we may need like napkins extra plate etc."}
{"text":"Ceviche was delicious... Sweet corn drink also, I definitely coming back, I know it's a new place but as extra person in front to the house helping waitress would improve the service,"}
{"text":"Great food. But shit service. The fact that the shitty ass waiter thought he deserved $33 as a tip was hilarious. I tip well all the time but this guy was horrible. Was in a bad mood and I had to get up and ask for a soda and he didn't even give you time to order. Would just walk away. The manager try to make us feel guilty when she took the tip away. I didn't give a shit cause he didn't deserve $33. Shitties service ever. I won't be coming back to this place and service is the reason. 1 guy ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what it is. Ceviche was not fresh and it had way too much onion and not enough fish, anticuchos smelled weird and it was extremely hard. Leche de Tigre was horrible."}
{"text":"Non-existent service.  I'm sure the food is amazing but they're clearly under staffed and don't seem to care much. Ah well. What can you do?"}
{"text":"Very mediocre Peruvian food.  The place has this really funny smell, which in my case, it prevents me from enjoying any meal.  
We ordered a \"Bistec a lo pobre\" and the meat was not good at all.  It was extra seasoned so it would taste better but it didn't.  The plantains were about to go bad which I found out by the taste of them.  Rice was good and french fries....
Peruvian food is so delicious that is upsetting we don't have a decent Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas.  Honeslty, there is NONE."}
{"text":"#1 family-owned Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas. Staff is always so welcoming and open to accommodating your meal to your liking. I bring my girlfriend here whenever we are craving peruvian cuisine. Definitely recommend the Ceviche Mixto and the lomo saltado. You have to try the Inca Cola with your meal.  The ultimate meal is the Seafood platter sufficient for two. I have tried every peruvian restaurant in LV and this is my favorite! The owner is very humble and respectful."}
{"text":"Love love love !!!!! Best food in Vegas a must try ! Usually a waiting of 10 min to be seated but def worth it the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying I have never had Peruvian food before, so unfortunately, I can't comment on the authenticity of the food. 

This restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend claiming it was the best Peruvian food in Vegas and so my boyfriend and I decided we would check it out. The location is a little unappealing - although very easy to get to, it's in quite a deserted strip mall, so there's not much activity happening there otherwise. Once inside, we were greeted by a friendly server in Spanish and immediately seated. We arrived at around 7:30 p.m. and there were about 2-3 other groups of people dining at that time. The interior resembled an old 50s diner with upgraded light fixtures. Also, interestingly, the entertainment comprised of Jackass on MTV, which we felt was a tad bit inappropriate for a family/dining establishment (about halfway through our meal, it was changed to \"I Love You Man\" on Comedy Central, an improvement but still questionable).

The menu was simple and consisted of appetizers, entrees (chicken, beef, and seafood), dessert and beverages. We had the maracuya (a passion fruit drink which we thought it tasted like guava/guayaba) and chicha morada (although a corn drink, we thought it tasted like a chai tea or horchata - really, the cinnamon was the overpowering flavor). These drinks were $2 a cup (no free refills) and otherwise they had regular fountain drinks available.

Our order initially consisted of the palta rellena, arroz chaufa, and pescado a lo macho. Again, never having had Peruvian food, we had no idea what to expect and merely went by recommendations provided from other reviews. The server came back to let us know that they were out of the palta rellena and recommended we try the tiradito de pescado as an appetizer instead. Although I was really looking forward to the palta rellena (avocado stuffed with cooked potatoes, mayonnaise, and cooked chicken), the fish strips bathed in yellow pepper lemon sauce were surprisingly delightful - something to note was that the fish and sauce are cold, I was expecting that they would be warm. The arroz chaufa was merely chicken fried rice, with a slightly different flavor than what you would expect at any traditional Asian restaurant. The menu description for pescado a lo macho was fried fish topped with Peruvian fish sauce and served with white rice - there were some additional seafood items included with the fish sauce and fried fish, such as calamari, octopus, oyster, and shrimp - that being said, the dish was probably the most delicious of the two entrees. To end, we had the crema volteada, which is essentially like a flan but made with milk and is therefore a lot thicker in substance. 

Overall, we thought the server was very friendly and attentive and the food was tasty, but I gave it a 4-star rating since the atmosphere was a little off. I would definitely come back and try something else (including that palta rellena) someday!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would! Incredible food, amazing service! Huge portions, fantastic flavors. Leche de Tigre - on the menu as a separate item, which I have not seen in any restaurants I've been to from San Francisco to LA to San Diego."}
{"text":"Had the Lomo Saltado A Lo Pobre (sliced beef served with fries, rice and topped with eggs!) and the Palta Rellena (avocado stuffed with chicken salad). The Lomo Saltado plate was large enough for two people and we were so stuffed that we had to take the stuffed avocado home, pardon the pun. ;)

So my recommendation is to split plates because portions are positively huge! Food is delicious though and you'll be happy with this Las Vegas outpost of Peruvian food. Also, they have a few decent wines to choose from, including a Sauvignon Blanc we enjoyed. Highly recommended for those who crave la comida Peruviana!"}
{"text":"Lima Limon has won my heart over...Don't ask the names of what I've ordered, because i cannot remember. But, i've had the dish with fish and shrimp in a yellow sauce, served with rice. The side salad is also great because they use this tangy, lime juice dressing on top. My husband has ordered the lomo saltado and says it's great. Calamari was also perfectly cooked. The waiters are always kind and attentive.

We will definitely be back...many times."}
{"text":"I thought the food was salty. It was too pricey for the area. Cheaper places on the strip for that price. Service was absolutely terrible; didn't put ice in the cups brought the ice out in a bucket for us to serve ourselves. Took 20 minutes to get seated another 15 to get our drinks forgot a plate at our table."}
{"text":"Felipe and Juan, both these men are amazing! Our first time at their establishment and this first visit is worth the trip from our home in Henderson. We decided to look for a Peruvian place in Vegas after our visit from Miami, FL. And we were very surprised to find a number of them at home. 
The reception that we received from Felipe and his guidance in what to eat are very effortless. He brought out an iPad showing us photos of the available dishes and this was a tremendous help. Very smart of them!  
We ordered the Seafood sampler and it dis not disappoint, in fact it hit the spot dead on! 
This establishment is very well recommended not just because of the food but because of their customer service and the music that they play while dining. 
5 stars in my book! Thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here first time was amazing which is why im back today however the waiter was very lackluster and seemingly forgot about us. Food is still delicious but the service is inconsistent."}
{"text":"Oh this place is TASTY! Granted it's in a deserted strip mall but that just means they have less overhead to spend on delicious ingredients! We ordered the papa a la huancaina, The ceviche de pescado, lomo saltado, tacu tacu y ceviche mixto. Everything is perfect! The meat is so tender, the taste is on point! Everyone should eat here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food total 10 for us! The Cevice was absolutely delicious, also ordered the churrasco with papas a la huancaina and loved it, it came with platanos maduros, excellent portions, and they receive you with tostado"}
{"text":"Always great Peruvian FOOD !!!! 
Love it. And everyone is very nice and friendly. I think they lost their liquor license because last time I had a pisco sour and it was taste. Didn't bother me now since I am pregnant but after the baby is here, I would like to go back and get one! 
YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and really enjoyed trying out Peruvian food for the first time. My sister was here once before with a friend who introduced the place to her, she really liked it so took me here to check it out. 

Not located in the best location, the plaza seemed very empty and old, but the restaurant itself was very nice, clean, and big. The place is big enough for large parties. We came in at a pretty slow time, only a few tables the entire time we were there. We were greeted and seated immediately, our waitress brought out water and a small plate of dried corn with salt, this was very different and pretty good. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet, she answered all our questions and made good recommendations. Great service! 

I tried the sweet corn drink with pineapple juice and passion fruit, this tasted like hibiscus tea with a pinch of cinnamon. My sister tried one of the two peruvian sodas that they carry, we asked our waitress what the soda tasted like before we ordered and she said guests said the soda either tasted like lemongrass or chewing gum :) my sister said it smelled and tasted like chewing gum, but she liked it.

We ordred grilled beef heart and a mixed seafood ceviche for appetizer. The beef heart was not as tender as I hoped it would be, but the seasoning was delicious, it also came with two big pieces of grilled potato that was perfectly grilled, not too hard and not too soft. The ceviche had sliced fish, mussel, shrimp and octopus, it also came with sweet potato and corn, it was very good but a little too sour for my taste. 

For the main entree we shared a beef stir fried with minions and tomatoes, it came with rice and fried. Our waitress recommended this plate stating it is their most popular dish. This was delicious, the meat was very tender, the fries were crispy, and the sauce was really, not too salty. The portion here is quite big, I would recommend sharing, the entrees are definitely gigantic. 

Overall really enjoyed this place, would definitely recommend and come back here."}
{"text":"This place is great. They are not that expensive, and they give you such large portions of food. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"La comida es excelente pero el servicio necesita muchos mejoras. Más organización y eficiencia."}
{"text":"This place sucks now, use to be great back in 2014 but they are missing a lot in there food and presentation now-a-days. Hopefully they make changes to be a great place to take the family out to eat again until then I would definitely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lima Limón is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. They serve authentic Peruvian dishes with excellent and personable service. I feel welcome every time I come here and I always have a delicious meal. Some of my favorite dishes are the ceviche mixto, lomo saltado, and jalea de mariscos."}
{"text":"Had the Lomo saltada. It was really good. The meat was juicy and the sauce for the meat is amazing. Mix it in with the rice and your golden. 

The hot sauce also is very delicious not sure what it is exactly but I used it for the meat, the onions, the tomatoes, and fries. Good on everything. 

Worth a try for sure. Just wish they had something else on TV besides telemundo news"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to the restaurant.  I still like the food but the service has gotten worse.  I took a friend here and he will never come back because of the slow wait staff.  There was only one person waiting all the tables.   This is crazy.  They may have lost all three of us as customers now which is sad as I do like the food but I can't spend 2 hours in a restaurant and have to rush to eat and leave because we had to get my wife to work."}
{"text":"I can remember I ordered the #4 and the #10.  Whichever was the potato salad stuffed avocado-type dish was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Service and speed are much much better now. Really happy about that. Food is still excellent! Can't get enough of the ceviche w green sauce !"}
{"text":"Great Peruvian food. I had the teradito, ceviche de pescado and their lomo saltado.  It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent portions and seasonings. I am half Peruvian and went with two Peruvian aunts to eat here during our trip to Vegas. We went two days in a row as the food was excellent. I ordered the jalea and the arroz chaufa de mariscos the first day for my family. The two orders were enough for 3 or 4 people. The next day I ordered the parihuela. It was thick and tasteful. All the ingredients were fresh and one could tell. The restaurant was very clean and large and the music in the background made for a perfect afternoon. The only downer was the mini mall it was located in was pretty empty. I hope the word gets around about this gem!"}
{"text":"Best Peruvian food I have had! The food is delicious. Portions are large. Customer service is on point. The gentleman who works the front always greets me with a warm smile and treats me like family. The location is a little easy to miss so be on the lookout so you don't miss out."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting Nevada from Vancouver, Canada. We decided to try out some local Peruvian and drove across the city to eat at this place. Sooooo glad we did, wow! We had the ceviche mixto, the avocado stuffed with potatoes and chicken and the lomo saltado. Amazing flavours, I haven't had such good ceviche since I was in South America. We couldn't stop talking about this place so after leaving the Grand Canyon we set our GPS to Lima Limon and had it one last time. Muchas gracias Lima Limon, su comida es muuuuuuuuy rica!!"}
{"text":"My parents came to town, and we took them to dinner at Lima Limon on St. Patrick's Day to celebrate our daughter's 8 month birthday. I'm always impressed by the food here, and on this visit, a server named Jaime changed my mind about the underwhelming level of service at his restaurant. He worked professionally, checking up on our table throughout our meal, and just made the experience that much more pleasant. Gracias, Jaime!

The chef does a great job with pastas. I always order tallarines verdes (creamy pesto) or tallarines a la Huancaina, accompanied by a large cutlet of chicken or beef that my husband enjoys for me (the perks of marrying a vegetarian). The arroz chaufa (fried rice) has great flavor, too. Lima Limon is one of my top choices for a weekday lunch because of the specials offered from 11am to 3pm. The menu changes each day, but a starter such as ceviche plus an entree like arroz con pollo served with a beverage for $8.50 is an unbelievable deal. You may find daily specials posted on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/#!/LimaLimonLasVegas?fref=ts

As much as I enjoy maracuya and chicha morada, I'd like to see Lima Limon aquire a liquor license and start serving Pisco sours. Also, a selection of desserts would be nice. During dinner with my parents, only alfajores were available."}
{"text":"The ceviche mixto is my favorite! All the sea food ingredients were so fresh and the taste was so good! The place is very clean and all the dishes were very appetizing! I'm so glad that this was the place we have chosen to celebrate my birthday!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I liked it and want to go back and try more, specifically the pesto pasta and steak. Shared the seafood platter with a friend which was more than enough so luckily I listened to the waiter when he said to decide on the pasta after the seafood because I wouldn't have enjoyed it being so full from the yummy seafood. My eyes can get the best of me and are bigger than my mouth :)

The ceviche was very Limey but very good. Calamari was delicious especially with the green dipping sauce. Paella yum. Muscles good probably my least favorite.  I will definitely be back to try more dishes. Not a big dessert offering so probably wouldn't have dessert here.  Tried the ice cream which was okay."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from the food here. My boyfriend and I ordered different things and we both got sick."}
{"text":"Muy bueno!!! 
Exelente servicio. Lugar amigable y lo mejor de todo que dan descuento!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I love it !!!
We order the sampler and the tiradito and it was amazing !!! Definitely  coming back !!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I can't wait to return to Lima Limon!

I had dragged my boyfriend here to try it when he would have initially preferred In-N-Out but, spoiler alert, he ended up loving it more than me! Our waiter was kind and attentive, after asking us if we have ever tried Peruvian food (we hadn't) he brought out an iPad with pictures of all the options. I thought this was not only super helpful but clever considering that many of their customers probably aren't sure about what they serve int he first place. My only complaint about the service would be that it took forever to get refills, and we only got them because we directly asked! This needs to be worked on by the staff. Sitting with empty drinks for 10 minutes halfway through our meal is really unacceptable. 

The food makes up for this blunder, however. We split the seafood platter and lomo saltado, and of course, the homemade corn nuts. The corn nuts were a delicious appetizer that wasn't as filling as bread normally is, which I appreciated. The seafood platter was fresh and overflowing with seafood goodness. For the price, it cannot be beaten! This was the dish that truly impressed my partner. We will certainly be back just for this. While I love seafood, this platter is a little too much for me personally, so the lomo saltado was a perfect second choice! It is simple, but I am into simple food. 

We liked what we tried so much, odds are when we return we will get the same things again! Except for the Peruvian beverage, I can't remember what it is called, but I wasn't a huge fan. I'll stick with diet coke!"}
{"text":"Never had Peruvian food. But Omgosh,  thank u lima Limon for a great first taste of it. The waiter was super nice and attentive with us. If you like lime and fish GET THE VERDE CEVICHE....this stuff was fiiiiiirreee. Think it was number 20. I'm definitely going back. This place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Get the lomo saltado and ceviche it is amazing! We get it every time :)"}
{"text":"I have had Peruvian food before and never really cared for it, but my friend really wanted to go here and try it out. I figured he would get full and I would be heading to a fast food restaurant soon after. Well I was really surprised with this place. The food was fantastic. I especially like the ceviche. I could eat that stuff all day everyday. I do recommend this restaurant and if you haven't liked Peruvian food in the past, I just say give this place a taste you will not be disappointed. 
Also the service was great. They went out of their way to take care of you. Very attentive to the customers.  . Ten stars for this place."}
{"text":"Our friends and us decided to have lunch at this place on a Sunday around 1pm. BAD IDEA!!! Unfortunately, we ended up waiting over ONE hour for our food. And even then, one of the couples meal was incomplete. 
By then, the ambiance in our party was kind of heavy, so not everyone enjoyed their food. 
Perhaps having more than one cook & 2 waiters would help. Food for though!!!"}
{"text":"This must be the best Peruvian Restaurant in Vegas.  I had a ceviche and lomo saltado...everything tasted so fresh. :) If you are in Vegas and want authentic Peruvian food this is the place to go to!"}
{"text":"Don't let the 1950's style decor fool you- you will not find hamburgers and malts here.  What you will find is authentic Peruvian food.  The ceviche de pescado appetizer and the anticuchos de corazon are big enough that together they make a good sized dinner."}
{"text":"Service is lacking as described by others. Food is delicious. Portion sizes are a bit large and the price reflects it. Keep it in mind and maybe share an app and entree. They bring out roasted corn with your drinks while you wait, while usually this comes with the ceviche entree in other Peruvian restaurants, but I liked this method, no complaints about it, just good to note."}
{"text":"I lived in Peru for 7 years, and I was really excited to try this restaurant.  A friend and I dined there this evening and I can honestly say, this is authentic Peruvian fare!  We shared the sampler platter of seafood which was recommended by the owner, who is Peruvian, and it was delicious.  Then we shared a dessert, I can't remember the name, but basically it was \"flan\".  Great experience!  The service was excellent and the food was exceptional.  I highly recommend it...."}
{"text":"One of the best Peruvian restaurant I've ever been!!! Customer service was excellent so it makes u wanna come back to this place over & over again. My favorite of all was the green dressing or dip for calamari, it's heavenly!!! Ordered a lomo saltado, very good!!!"}
{"text":"If you can stand the wait the food is outstanding!!  We were teased for at least 45 minutes by other patrons hot sizzling orders coming out!! This is my first time trying Peruvian food so the menu took me some time but I ordered the Lomo Saltado, steak fries and rice!  It was so simple but full of flavor!!  The prices are a tad high but the portions are huge and the food is it of the park for the area!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!!! I am a big big seafood fan and Peruvian food.  This place hit the spot.  I got an appetizer and one entre.   I got the ceviche mixto (mixed seafood) and we had the fish in yummy sauce.  Recommend this place and will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Peruvian food so I don't really have anything else to compare it to. The picture menu was really helpful. I really like that the fried calamari came in the big rings and not the tiny ones. We got the platter with all the beef, pork, chicken, sausages, etc. and I thought it was seasoned well. The chicken wasn't dry, thankfully! We also had the chicken fried rice which was exactly as the name entailed. My favorite was the fried plantains! Service was as expected - friendly but not attentive, i.e. water remained empty for awhile, waiter was hard to track down, etc. Other than that, I'd come back again just to try different dishes."}
{"text":"Went here twice. The first time was great. The food and service. This second time (Friday 8/6). The service was so horrible. The lady in front who seats you was the worst. Didn't bother to care about her job. I politely informed her the ladies room was out of toilet paper and paper towels. She just said \"ok\" and went on doing her stuff. People kept going into the men's bathroom to get toilet paper. She was the one who brought out our food. As soon as she set it down on the table she asked if we needed any more hot sauce since we ordered the ceviche. We said we will have to try it real quick and she walked away before we can give her an answer. She didn't bother to come back until it was time to give us our check. Didn't even bother to ask if we needed a refill on our drinks. Would rather other food to go than have to deal with her again."}
{"text":"Sadly I've had to lower my rating on this place due to my experience yesterday. 

I'm not sure what the waitress's name was but my girlfriend and I met my mom and her boyfriend around 5:45 for dinner so whoever was working at that time...

I've noticed that even though the food at this place is amazing, it's never really that full. In fact, every time I'm there there's maybe only two/three other parties seated. This time when we arrived there was only one other table and so the fact that it took 15 minutes for us to be asked what we'd like to drink kind of surprised me. And when it took 10 minutes for my glass of water to arrive it irked me even more that the waitress completely forgot what my GF had asked for. I feel like this is why you should write it down if you need to. Not to mention this woman had THEE worst attitude I have EVER seen in a waitress before. 

When my mom and her BF arrived she took their drink order and this woman was just so short with us as if we were inconveniencing her. When looking through the menu we had questions and she'd walk by our table to fast that we never had a chance to ask her anything at all. Finally she takes our order and while my GF is ordering I'm talking to my mom and suddenly this waitress just pulls the menu from under my mom's elbows and that was enough for me to be completely over this place. Say excuse me, have some manners. That's my MOTHER and more than that, that's a LOYAL, PAYING customer. Finally when we get our food and we're all taking our time eating the waitress comes and just takes my mom's plate and my mom looks at her and says, in a very confused tone, \"I'm not done...\" and the waitress says nothing and puts her plate back, then walks away. 

The food is amazing - don't get me wrong. I attached photos of what we all ate yesterday, but the service was so stupidly terrible that I doubt I'll come back to this place and if I do, I will walk right back out if this woman serves me again."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good peruvian restaurant since I moved to Vegas. Coming from LA does not help, they have way more peruvian restaurants there and more variety, because the peruvian community is larger than here and we are more critical and dainty about our own food.
I've tried them all, more than once, always leaving disappointed with the food, until I went to Lima Limón and for the first time in 15 years I finally had the peruvian food I was missing."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this was good!  I had the Mar Y Tiera,  which was delicious and enough for 2-3 people.  Wife had Tallarino Saltado, which was also awesome.  Service was good enoigh, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove all the way to this restaurant from Henderson because we heard good things about this place from our friends, and I must say it was worth the drive to this restaurant. The food is excellent. I think my favorite dish was the ceviche. We will be coming back to this restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian food in Southern Nevada! I would recommend adding more variety to the menus. Other than that, food and service are great."}
{"text":"The restaurant  have good food but the service of the serve is so bad . THEY NEED REAL SERVERS."}
{"text":"Food and presentation is delicious.  See pictures.  Servers and histess speak English and make you feel at home"}
{"text":"First time trying Peruvian food, definitely recommend this restaurant. We had a plate that had 4 different types of popular Peruvian food and they were all really good!"}
{"text":"If you want really good Peruvian food this is the place to go. However, if you're looking for good service I suggest you skip eating here unless you've got lots of patience and time to wait for your food (specially if it's a big party) In conclusion, great food but SLOOOOOOW service which is probably due to their small kitchen and lack of staff."}
{"text":"Very very good food.  I got the chicken alfredo and I love it!.  The seafood soup is also good.  I just wish I could have eaten here sooner!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. The food was excellent. It is a \"dive\" so you just have to adjust your expectations. The only real reason I had to take a star away is that the speed of the food is soooo slow. Like really slow. At least the night we went there. 

We tried the ceviche and a variety of the meats. Both were excellent and my friend (who just got back from Peru) had nothing but good things to say about the food."}
{"text":"This place isn't much to look at but the food make up for it. I've been several times and the service is always friendly. I always get the lomo  saltado and hubby always gets the fried shrimp and fish with sauce. You can ask for it to be spicy or medium spicy or mild. Alfajores is my favorite dessert and inca kola to drink. Overall every experience I've had has been great here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! Our server Juan was so patient awesome  and knowledgable of the dishes. He explained all dishes we asked about and even brought an IPad to show photos to really get the idea. Very authentic Peruvian food super flavorful and delicious! We ordered the -La Saltado and chaufa special rice"}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I was hooked on lomo saltado. When I moved to Vegas, I was on the hunt for a good authentic Peruvian restaurant. After about 3 or 4 places, I gave up. Until I found this place on yelp, which is conveniently located down the street from meadows mall. 

I've been here numerous times and order the same thing all the time. Lomo saltado!!! It's a thin pieces of beef cooked with onions, peppers, tomatoes and cilantro. They throw in French fries in the mix to soak up some of the juices. (I do wish that they would use the steak cut fries instead of normal fries, but thats just me). All served with a side of rice!! So so yummy. Tender cuts of meat cooked and seasoned perfectly. Only down side is that they don't serve the green sauce that is a staple in other Peruvian restaurants. They do offer a red hot sauce if you are looking for the extra kick. 

If you are in the area. I highly recommend this place. The waiters are super sweet and attentive. 

P.S. I freaking love onions so the fact there there are tons of onions in this dish is a plus!!! And the onions are still crunchy!!! Mmmm"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! This was easily the best Peruvian food I have had in ages. We started with an avocado appetizer stuffed with potatoes and veggies that was delicious. After that, I moved on to the fish in seafood sauce and was blown away by how perfectly the fish and seafood in the sauce was cooked. Nothing was rubbery and everything was spot on. Flavorful, light, and satisfying. I could not ask for a better meal. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"WHY IM CHANGING MY REVIEW:
This business is going to fail the way the operate with little staff. I'm not sure if they are family owned but their over head must be bad. 

I have to call in the morning because they gave us pork instead of the beef hearts we bought and paid for. Do they think we don't know what beef heart is supposed to look and taste like?? 
They had no seafood left because it was close to the end of the night. They should be prepared for their Sunday nights and basically ALL hours of operation.  
Also they had NO sauces. We spent over $100 for this food and we're extremely let down. We will be calling tomorrow for the food we ordered since they closed already tonight. 

This used to be my favorite place as it's the only Peruvian restaurant that's good in Vegas. But damn, they need to seriously manage this place better. Get more ingredients, find enough money to hire AT LEAST two more people so the restaurant can run half properly. The owner should never be the chef. Go watch some kitchen nightmares to get some tips by god...."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Lima Limon! My boyfriend and I come here quite often because of how great this place is. Both my mom and dad are from Peru, so I grew up eating only Peruvian food. When I moved away for college, it is then that I started to really miss eating Peruvian food everyday. Now I am always on the lookout for a good restaurant that is just as authentic as my mom's cooking. I may be biased by saying no one cooks better Peruvian food than my mom... but this place is pretty close!! My favorite things to order here are the papa a la huancaina, anticuchos, lomo saltado con tallarines a la huancaina, and the ceviche mixto! 

My only \"complaint\" would be that I get sad that they always run out of papa rellena by the time I get there ):

Also I would like to take a moment to give the customer service an A+ review! They are always so kind to me and my boyfriend and always going above and beyond to get our orders out to us as fast as possible and making sure we are enjoying their food while enjoying the night as well."}
{"text":"I really love Peruvian food and my ppl but this restaurant and it's owners are really bad . I'm never going back again . I ordered one Ceviche ( leche de tigre) to share as an apitizer and fried rice to my main course and they took more them 45 minutes and they brought all together ."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent, very fresh and well presented. Unfortunately, they do not have a liquor license but you are welcome to bring your own beer or wine just have a receipt to show proof of outside purchase. Which honestly isn't such a bad thing. They even provided beautiful cut limes and cold glasses. 

We had a wonderful appetizer platter of fried calamari, ceviche, a seafood rice dish (amazing) similar to paella, potatoes in yellow sauce, and a lime marinated mussel. Everything was delicious and our party of four was quite full after the appetizer. We opted to order one loma saltido (excuse my spelling) and shared it. It was a great meal  and I will definitely return. Business was very slow for them, Monday night, so it was very quiet inside. I hope they do well as this is a hidden gem in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been to other peruvian restarants but this one tops it off. I enjoy their Arroz chaufa mixto and can't complain about their portions....they are huge. And you can't eat their food with their delicious INca cola... peruvian soda pop."}
{"text":"Peruvian food in Las Vegas?? Whaaaaa... so good! Fresca in the Bay Area is really hard to top, but this place is a great replacement for SF transplants. The set up is a bit funky - this place used to be some sort of 50's style diner and they have kept the decor, but it looks like they are trying to fix up the back area to be more in line with the style they are going for. They use an iPad as their menu, which is a great way to see pics of their food and get a feel for the portion size. Our waitress was extremely helpful and patient, I highly suggest getting the calamari appetizer and their in-house mayo. I had asked her which of the specialty drinks she preferred (I can't think of the names now, but one was passion fruit flavored and the other one was more cinnamon) and she actually offered samples of the drinks. And there weren't tiny cups, she filled up 1/3 of a regular cup and let us taste it. Both had really distinct and strong flavors that paired well with our meal, so definitely order a specialty drink when you're here. I ended up with the lomo saltado as an entree - I wish the meat was a little bit more tender, but still, good flavors and portions. They also do have an aji de gallina which our waitress said they only have as a breakfast special, so I'll try to come back for that. I'll definitely be back to explore the menu a bit more and order those wonderful drinks."}
{"text":"We got seated instantly on at Sunday afternoon at 2 pm. The restaurant wasn't completely empty but not all that busy. Or waiter was one of the best I have seen. He spent a good 10 minutes recommending plates and explaining them to us. He even brought a tablet with pictures of the dishes ! We did wait a little longer than normal to get our food but the waiter did stop by to let us know it was on its way. Our food also came out at different times so that was also a bit awkward. But over all a good experience and good food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, el chaufa de mariscos Muy Bueno y la picadera buena seleccion para la entrada!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had food like this since I was in Peru in 2003. This is a no-frills restaurants, but the flavors are on point."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend and some hungry toddlers. Waited for over 10 min for the waiter I had to go and ask for service. Finally the food arrived it was great. However I had to ask for the tv channel which was set to mtv to be changed. I really didnt need the kids to hear b this and that and f that and this. Waiter was friendly front desk lady could use a smile and friendliness accessories."}
{"text":"Everything is great a lot of great flavors there green sauce is to die for and they're portions are good.menu is a little expensive but try this place at least once and u won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  Thank you fellow yelpers for helping me pick my dinner last night and for not disappointing in the reviews.  I would have never found this place had it not been for you.  It's hidden in a half empty shopping center off Decatur and Meadows.  Although yelp says 10, they actually were closing at 9 last night (he said they close whenever his aunt and uncle feel like it).  We got there about 845 and the waiter/host was super nice and told us to come in and sit down.  There were only people at a couple tables and I was weary, as I had never had Peruvian food before.  I asked the waiter what he recommended and I ended up with an Inka Cola (tasted like big red soda) and the Beef Saltado.  It was SO good!  The meat was very flavorful and the fries soaked up all of the yummy juices.  I hope this place stays around so I can eat here more often."}
{"text":"Food is great however the service can definitely use some improvement. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ambience decor still feels like a Chinese restaurant. We shall see how their traditional dishes fair.

I ordered the Pollo Saltado and I was interestingly surprised. The white rice parsley and vegetable stir-fry mixed with the chicken was the perfect meal for me. Order usually comes with french fries yet I declined this option. I did request their hot salsa, this was an icing for my tastes buds, not for the \"mild\" salsa eaters.

I am looking forward to trying a new dish here soon."}
{"text":"I visited so many restaurants over the world, but this one has the best service I ever received. They make you feel at home. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant is one of the best in Peruvian so far has a good many ANd flavor fully recommended the anticuchos juicy as delicious flavor and good service !!"}
{"text":"The portions are out of control (in a good way) and the quality of the food was excellent! 

Loved the avocado appetizer, a must try!"}
{"text":"So good! Tastes just like Peru! Wonderful friendly staff and amazing food! Loved it! And they have Inca Cola which my husband and I love!"}
{"text":"I have eaten Peruvian food before in Los Angeles and was amazed with it and I am glad that I've found a place as good as lima limon in Las Vegas at first I was skeptical but at first bite I was in love great food great service nice clean atmosphere will visit everytime I'm in Vegas !!! #tip try the lomos extra well done mixed"}
{"text":"A very nice Peruvian girl took me here, she certified it authentic, I certify it tasty. Good value, you will take home a box. Feels like grandma is making you dinner. Clean place. Go here, try it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has VERY authentic Peruvian cuisine in large portions at reasonable prices. Servers were attentive and engaging. I HIGHLY recommend Lima Limon!"}
{"text":"This place is always legit. I am on a mission to try everything on the menu. So far everything is incredible. 
The service is great. I hope they do very well and open a summerlin location or spring valley !!!!"}
{"text":"Really good Peruvian fare at reasonable prices! We could not believe the portion sizes here at lunchtime. We ordered a lomo saltado plate (beef stir fry), house salad, criollo soup, grilled chicken breast plate, and a mixed ceviche verde. The stir fry came on a massive plate with plantains, 2 eggs, Peruvian corn, and rice, the soup was served in a giant bowl, the chicken dish had 2 grilled breasts, and the ceviche was in a huge bowl as well. Everything was really tasty. I particularly enjoyed the ceviche in a green cilantro sauce because it was different from anything I had before- very citrusy, garlicky, and spicy. The soup had beef and angel hair and was very tasty. Service was friendly and personable. Would definitely come back but will share plates next time!"}
{"text":"Walked in and right out of this place. The waitress was rude. Didn't bother greeting us, not even a smile. You would expect better service for a place that has just increased their menu prices. It's a shame I was really looking forward to trying this place."}
{"text":"Very good food!!!! But poor service!!, not even a smyle from the server , no suggestions, nothing, she just drop the menu, and walk away , i dont get her name, but was the only girl doing as a server, also i wait for the check for like 20 min ,she never comeback to my table!! Bad bad bad, im not coming back NEVER!!!"}
{"text":"I had seen this place around my work for a while but had never stopped by until yesterday for a birthday party. I had never had Peruvian food before and everyone, including myself, thought that the food was great. There's this passion fruit drink that's amazing. The thing that lowers the rating is the service. I ordered an appetizer & after the wait received my food first. I was okay with it, and was going to ask to just remove the appetizer, but when I tell her I never received it, she goes to the back & comes right out with it, meaning it had been ready. I was still fine, but at the end of the meal I asked twice for a menu for us to order dessert and nothing. The waitress then comes and asks what we want & I have to tell her we still haven't gotten menus. At the end when it's time to pay the check, I remember I had ordered a side dish & never received it, but it was being charged, so I had to ask her to remove it. The food is amazing, just the service is a little lacking, even though the restaurant was almost empty. If they can fix that, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat. I haven't been able to find a decent Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas since moving from Los Angeles. This is by far the best I've had. I will definitely be returning to eat here more often. The Lomo Saltado is on point. I definitely recommend anyone wanting authentic Peruvian food to come here!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place for a while now, walked in and saw they have a \"C\" rating from the health department, turned around and walked out.  Did not want the bubble guts."}
{"text":"Very authentic..............I am glad you are in Las Vegas.  Good food, niece and clean environment!"}
{"text":"The ceviche was amazing! Fresh and delicious. The rice was also flavorful. The sampler plate is a good option to share."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is delicious.

I ordered the strips of rib eye with tomatoes & onions that came with beans & peppers. Very flavorful. My mom ordered the chicken with fried rice. It was greasy but I enjoyed it as well.

Fast service & big portions. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was the best place ever. When my aunt came back from the army, we went there and it was delicious. I loved every food from there. BEST PERUVIAN FOOD EVER!"}
{"text":"If this place had better service, it would have five stars in my book. 

The food was really good. I had the tiradito, and all I could think is that I wanted more.  We also tried the stuffed avocado, and it was really good. As we were enjoying our food, my eyes kept wandering to the near-by tables. Based on what I saw, I will be going back.

What I didn't like was the service. Our server took FOR-EVER to get us our drinks and food. Everything was in slow motion, and it wasn't busy. Also, the restaurant doesn't exactly have ambiance. It was clearly a diner, a tacky one at that, before the Peruvians took it over. 

That won't stop me from going back. However, I might order take out next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week - the food was fabulous!  I had the Pollo Saltado and he had the Tallarina Saltado - the portions are enormous.  We took 1/2 the food home for lunch the next day.  The service is kind of slow, but they only had one waiter working, and we weren't in a hurry, so we didn't mind.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time in Vegas my friend invited me to eat Peruvians food I was a little skeptical about the flavor since I'm bored Peruvian raise in Miami. Once we got there the warm reception at the door the quick assistance with the table it got me into then there is nothing fancy but exquisite  dishes I can say that my short time in that restaurant was unique if I return to Vegas I would down to go to to Lima limon again I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've never had Peruvian food and I have to say I've been missing out. The food was amazing!!!! It's full of flavor and it doesn't make you feel guilty after. Great price, great service and great food!!!! Definitely going back"}
{"text":"La comida esta rica pero todo lo q se pide ejemplo un arroz de mariscos llenan el plato de arroz con 5 marisco contaditos y para el precioso no debe de ser así deberían dar a conciencia para q la gente regrese. Pero por precios tan alto y las porciones de los platos poco poco pierden clientera. Una pequeña sugerencia."}
{"text":"There's a first for everything! First time coming here and first time eating Peruvian food. We are DEFINITELY impressed and coming back! Such amazing food!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find! I have passed by this place so many times, and I finally had the time to try it. I really enjoyed the Palta Rellena and the Lomo Saltado. The food was so flavorful. Portions are huge, so I have lunch for tomorrow.

The service is a bit slow, so this isn't a good place if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"The real deal!  This place is nothing super fancy but the food is absolutely incredible.  Ceviche is best seen to date.  Portions are large so sharing is perfect.  Recommend without hestiation."}
{"text":"We ate at Lima Limon on 3-12-2013.  It was a little hard to find as it was in a shopping center and didn't face Decatur as I thought it would.  I have no experience in eating Peruvian food but my girlfriend is from Peru and she said the quality of food was good.  What I ate was good (Lomo Saltado).  She had Mixed Ceviche  (with calamar, shrimp, oyster, onion, fish) which I tasted and it was good.  They had a salsa (Huacatay) which was nice and spicy and complimented the food very well.  The resturant was clean, looked new and the service was good.  They served Pervuian drinks which I would recommend and their were many dishes on the menu that looked and sounded very good.  I recommend this resturant if you like to try different foods.   We got there before  lunch and were served quickly and our order came out quickly.  I recommend giving this place a try,....you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went to Lima Limon on Sunday with my mother and best friend. Had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated and the place was a bit crowded for lunch. Wow! The food was excellent and the service was exceptional. I had never had Peruvian food before and our server asked if we would like to borrow their iPad so we could see what each menu item was. We figured, sure, why not? We immediately placed our orders because everything on the iPad looked delicious! They were very attentive to my mother who is elderly and a bit hard of hearing as well as accommodating to my best friend who does not speak Spanish. Be careful when ordering though, the portions are HUGE! You will not leave hungry. By all means be patient after you order. We waited a bit. But again, well worth it!"}
{"text":"My Peruvian professor recommended this place and it was absolutely delicious! He said it pretty authentic Peruvian food. I got the loma saltoda and it was excellent! Definitely recommend if you are a meat lover."}
{"text":"Que delicia. I love this place, Ive been to a couple peruvian spots here in Las Vegas, however this one tops the cake for me. The food is delicious, I have tried their ceviche mixto and it is amazing. I love the flavors of their food, their rice is delicious the parrillada was great but the BEST is the Jalea. It's fresh and it big. This is deff the place to go to."}
{"text":"Amazing Peruvian food in Las Vegas, very authentic dishes and reminds me of the food I had in Cuzco and Ollantaytumbo. 

Only downside is that they are very slow to take your order and it took almost 40 min for them to bring out 2 dishes.

I'd come back if they were any faster. The food is amazing but you'll have to be extremely patient and forgiving honestly. You may not be too happy if you're hungry and stuck waiting."}
{"text":"We have been here around 4years.the price of the plates are good,the staffs are friendly and the owner is very kind to us for each time when we came in, we like here a lot highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, everything is delicious but my favorite one is \"Lomo Saltado\" literally I could eat it every day!!!
Also you have to try the Lucuma Ice cream, love it !!!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD, unfortunately the service is a disaster. During lunch & dinner rush they only have two servers attending nearly 60 customers, no bussers to help clean tables. I had to wait more than 20min to be seated for a party of 3 when they were at least 7 table open but dirty. Forget about getting your drinks in a timely manner, and by drinks I mean a simple glass of water. Truly sad for an establishment with so rich & delicious menu have to suffer because of bad management. Based on other reviews it seems there's a pattern here.."}
{"text":"Food is very good and there's a lot of seating so you will be accommodated if you have a big group. I have the churrasco a lo pobre which is very tasty. They have authentic Peruvian drinks and spanish music playing in the background. Ive been here several times with large groups.
Cons: service is kinda slow and its slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Very good and friendly staff. The choros a chalaca and ceviche rock!"}
{"text":"I have two reason to visit Las vegas now. First: my best friend lives here, second: I need to eat at Lima Limón just because it's a great place with tasty food! I was craving ceviche for a looong time and when I read the reviews about this restaurant I decided to try it. I only wanted ceviche but their famous \"seafood platter\" has so many good compliments that my friend and I decided to order that. Instead of the normal ceviche we asked for \"chorrillano\" ceviche, pieces of fish and seafood are cut in smaller pieces but the taste  is still great! I was charged $2 extra but it was totally worth it!  This platter is huge! We didn't finish it all, it has everything you need! I can't complain about anything, I loved it all and I can't wait to come back and order different dishes."}
{"text":"Such a great find in Las Vegas! I lived in Peru for 2 years and return often for business.  The food here is just as good as it gets.  As is in Peru, the portions are huge and flavorful!  We had a Lomo Saltado, an Arroz con Mariscos, ceviche...and a few other typical platters. Everything was wonderful. The service was great. I can't wait to get back to Las Vegas, just to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food here is good. Portions are big . The decor is really nice. Restrooms are clean. You should try their rocoto sauce. I couldn't finish my plate, wayy too much."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Peruvian! I come here about once a week for the past two years. Get the ceviche micro and lomo Saltado"}
{"text":"I put a review 4 months ago and also talk to the owner of the place. Boy, what a 180* turn did she did on the items. The Jalea with plenty of calamary and fish. The lomo saltado need it more flame but still good. The Tiradito, wow! Way better than the first time. We also got a Causa for special because of Mothers Day. 

The service actually a lot faster. The best part are the prices, compared to the other \"Peruvian\" restaurants around Las Vegas, prices are adequate for the menu. If the restaurant keeps it like this it can do really good on the future."}
{"text":"this place is preatty good , but kind of expensive side, i would recomend not to come too hungry like me and order alot of food. overall the staff was helpfull and the place was very clean"}
{"text":"I have had Lima Limon bookmarked for several months.  I stopped for lunch/dinner and I am so glad I finally made the effort to remove this bookmark.

The restaurant was not at all busy at 12:45 with just one other table occupied.  I was greeted and seated quickly and I ordered a chicha morada for my drink.  I have come to like this drink a lot and look forward to Peruvian restaurants to enjoy more.  With the drink, my server brought a complimentary small bowl of cancha, the first time I've gotten this at any of the Peruvian places to which I've been.  They're salty and nicely crunchy and they go so well with the chicha morada.  

My server asked me if I was familiar with Peruvian food and she had a tablet with photos that you could scroll through and pick out dishes.  I told her I knew what I wanted just as she was pressing the lomo saltado image.  

In a short time, she brought the dish to me along with three sauces, green and red aji (both are spicy hot--test before you overdo something.  I preferred the green aji.  Neither one was too hot for me.  I tasted the white, mayo-based sauce and it was too mild.  

The lomo saltado was very good.  The beef was tender and the vegetables with the beef were not cooked too much.  The onion and pepper slices had crunch to them and the tomatoes were just warmed through.  The rice was flavorful--the fries were standard.  

When my server asked me about dessert, she said all they had were alfajores and flan.  I've had enough flan so I ordered an alfajor.  She informed me they only sell them in boxes of eight.  I ordered the box knowing I could have one or two--or maybe three--and I could take the rest home.  When she brought the plastic box, I asked if they were made in house as they were different from the larger ones I've had before.  She said they were indeed made there.  These soft cookies are filled with tasty dulce de leche and then liberally dusted with confectioners' sugar.  They were excellent!  It's lucky any came home with me but five of them did.

I am a fan of Lima Limon and I'll be back to try some of their other dishes.  The ceviches look very enticing!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. Service is OK. Amazing Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas. My favorite ceviche!"}
{"text":"Best Lomo Saltado and Ceviche you can get in town. It's the best Peruvian restaurant, they have an amazing chef. Server always remembers my order they're very friendly."}
{"text":"I literally drove 40 minutes to try their ceviche mixto!! Hands down!!!!!! Best ceviche I've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!! Fresh seafood!! So much flavor!!!!!! I absolutely loved it!!!! I also got 2 chicken soups for me and my boyfriend and the soup was to die for as well!!! I will definitely go backkkkkkk!!!"}
{"text":"Located right off the 95 and Decatur, when walking into Lima Limon you can definitely tell it used to be a 50s style diner with some of the decor left over.  There's not much to look at in the restaurant but the food made up for it.  The service was friendly, but not the most attentive (i.e. forgotten items asked for).  One cool thing that they do have is an iPad with pictures of all their menu items that is really helpful for ordering.
  
We Ordered: 
-Piqueo Lima Limon ($40) - My family ordered this because we wanted to have a little sampler of different types of Peruvian food.  It comes with choritos (mussels), huancaina (potatoes smothered in sauce), fried calamari, ceviche, and arroz con Mariscos (seafood rice).  This was definitely a good way to try a little bit of everything.  The stand outs of the dish were the ceviche, fried calamari, and the arroz con Mariscos.  
-Lomo Saltado ($12.50) - Similar to an Asian beef stir fry, the dish was pretty flavorful and the fries served with it were pretty good too.  Didn't wow me enough to want to order it again though.
-Arroz con Mariscos ($15) - My family didn't realize that this already came with the above dish (whoops), it was still good though full of mussels, squid, and shrimp! 

All of the dishes I had here were good/solid, but for some reason I just didn't find myself wowed by this place.  However, I definitely do see myself coming back here to try out different dishes on the menu whenever I am in the mood for Peruvian food."}
{"text":"DAM GOOD FOOD. Happy Peruvian !!! Super lomo is enough for two. Meat tender and seasoning dead on. My Go-to spot when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The ceviche options are all to die for. The service is great, clean nice place and loads of options.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I almost had a mini heart attack when we saw that the lomo saltado plate was $16!! However, they are generous with their portions so my hubby and I ended up sharing and ordered an extra side of rice which I believe was an extra $2.50. The staff was pretty friendly and if you've never had Peruvian food they kindly pull out their iPad and explain what their most popular dishes are and recommend stuff which is cool. The only sucky thing is they give you the tiniest thing of aji verde sauce. Usually at other Peruvian restaurants they'll give you a huge bottle but not here we had to keep asking over and over which was annoying."}
{"text":"Had my favorite lomo saltado, the fries could be better but the steak was tender.  I just love the hot salsa, it adds so much flavor with a kick.  Fantastic place."}
{"text":"When we first got here the place was empty, which made me a little apprehensive...maybe everyone else knew something I didn't.
We decided to go with it anyway and were happy we did.
I ordered the pollo saltado and having had it several times at several different restaurants, I will say that this was as good as any other I've had.
My girlfriend ordered the fettuccine with shrimp. While I thought this was a strange choice, I tried it and was surprised. It tasted like it had cinnamon in it, and even thought that may sound odd, it was a lovely addition to this dish.
I will certainly come back."}
{"text":"When I visit vegas Lima Limon is a must!!! Love the vibe!! super nice people delicious food and good prices"}
{"text":"So I went to check out this new place and although they do not have a lot of the plates I was expecting they have really really really good ceviche!!!! And there prices and fair!!"}
{"text":"!!Warning- Worst service in my whole life!!

(!!!Attencion-Peor servicio en mi vida!!!!
traducion de esta fonda que se hace pasar por resturante hasta abajo)

Decided to come with a large party of 13 on a family members suggestion. (worst mistake ever). It was a birthday celebration that turned into a dinner nightmare.

Lets start,  Amilcar the server was polite but lacked the most basic serving skills.
Restaurant (more like a shack) was busy but not enough to justify the cardinal mistakes he made all night.

From the start we had to arrange our own table as they were to busy to areange larger table for party (should have left then and there).
Also asked for highchairs and 30 minutes passed until i went looking for them and found 2 in a corner.

Party arrived around 7 pm, no server for about 1 hour...
No drinks while waiting (not even water)!

Around 9pm  food  arrives for half the table as it was pre prepared. (ceviche)
Half the table starts eating..... but

2 problems !!!!
No drinks still not even water !!! (placed order 40 min earlier)
No silverware to eat or napkins!

Finally server arrives with like half the places silverware from dishwasher, and they are still wet! (disgusting, looked rinsed not washed)

As half the party starts to eat, the remaining plates come out about 20 minutes apart each from one abother. 

We decide to start sharing food, as everyone is starving and turn our food into tapas style.

Finally we finish eating and realize the Birthday Girl has yet to get her food along with another person in the party!!!! ( 3 hours later)

And we are all done eating... WTF????
They apologize and said they had a mistake.

The whole night we never got water!!
No one did!

We were able to place one drink order that arrived at 9pm.


I immediatly placed another one. 
Did not arrive until 10pm...


I guess you can say the food was ok.
not bad, good flavor. But not worth it. Ever

We spend over $500 and I feel robbed...
any sushi Ayce is better, cheaper and 5x more delicious.

Only bring enemies and foes to eat here,
as you would never want a loved one to experience this dinning experience.

Thanks




(Review en español)

Este lugar no es restaurante, es una fonda!!
No tienen host, busser o bartender.
El mesero que tiened Amilcar, aunque amable es un pesimo mesero. 

La comida esta buena, pero el servicio fue el peor en toda mi vida. (no estoy exagerando)

Si usted quiere esperar por 3 horas sin recibir algo de tomar este es su lugar.

La cumpleañera nunca recibio su comida. despues de 3 horas y media. 

Se les olvido el plato de la cumpleñera y de otra persona aunque ya habian pasado mas de 3 horas!!!

Trajieron comida separada por mas de una hora. Aunque todos ordenamos al mismo tiempo.

Decidimos compartir ya que llevavamos horas esperando, comimos ceviche como si fuera tapas española ya que nadamas la mitad de gente tenia comida y nadie cubiertos.

Cosas que nunca llegaron!
Agua! Nadie por 3 horas nos dio agua.
Pisco sour- bueno este si llego pero tardo 2 horas. Nunca llegaron mas aunque pedimos mas immediatamente!!!
Servilletas- tuve que robar de otra mesa 
Cubiertos- bueno tambien llegaron pero mojados semi lavados y 10 minutos despues de la comida...... (en serio)

Por esas razones Amilcar es un pesimo mesero, no se donde se escondia ya que no estaba muy lleno. 

Pagamos mas de $500 y me siento estafado.

Hagase un favor y escoja un restaurante si quiere salir a comer, no esta choza, ya que lo va dejar con sabor amargo en la boca. No vale la pena la comida. 

Hay 1000s de lugares en Las Vegas con Mejor servicio y comida, cualquier buffet seria mejor. Y mucho menos, y sirven agua.

Y nunca vaya a este lugar con un grupo y mucho menos en occasion especiales!!!

Vaya nadamas cuando quiera sentirse menos preciado o con alguien que no le agrade.
Este es su lugar.

Gracias"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night. Good food but expect to wait a long time if ordering take out.  For a such a size establishment, they were understaffed."}
{"text":"The Peruvian food was delicious.  Overall the service was poor... It took over 10 minutes for our server to approach us for our drinks.  Our meals were brought to us 35 minutes after the order was taken.  Make matters worse, a 18.00% automatic tip was added to my tab for s party of six."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The only thing that would make this place better is bread rolls and that awesome green sauce, the complimentary nuts are amazing, and the food is fantastic ! The seafood is so fresh, the ceviche mixto is to die for, and the saltado de mariscos is amazing ! Everything here is on point, delicious !! Definitely my new go to for authentic Peruvian food."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian food in town.  I travel extensively and have been to Lima multiple times.  This is as close as you are going to get without having to get on a plane.  I am a regular and you should be too!"}
{"text":"Lima Limon sits in a desolate shopping center off of Decatur Blvd. It is next door to a Port of Subs. You will see the bright yellow/green sign and then enter into what is definitely 1950s diner vibe. Not sure what that is about - but maybe they are just waiting to revamp.

Service was exceptionally nice. I believe this place is definitely a mom-n-pop place as the waiter took great pride in talking to myself and my co-worker about the types of food, how it is made, etc. He even brought out an iPad so we could scroll through and see what the dishes looked like before we ordered.

I've never had Peruvian food before. The menu is straight and to the point. Most meals are simple: a meat, a carb, and a few veggies. In fact, some dishes come with both fries AND rice. It is somewhat reminiscent to me, of Hawaiian food, that comes with macaroni salad AND rice. However, Peruvian food obviously has an Asian-influence as I could distinctly taste soy sauce, and the \"pasta\" that came with my dish was very much like noodles you may find in an Asian dish.

I ordered the Tallarines Saltado with chicken. This is a BIG dish of food. Noodles were cooked perfectly, and chicken was good. Very few vegetables though - I thought I would get more tomatoes, but there were only two in my dish. Overall, the meal was good, but not great. Not sure if this is just because of the Peruvian dish itself - or the restaurant.

I would like to try Peruvian food elsewhere to see how it compares. For now, an A-OK will do."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas.  Great food, great mood."}
{"text":"I go to this place all the time. I always get the same thing and it's always the best! I always get Lomo saltado never lets me down. They give you huge portions so you will be full. 

However, this place is very slow at times. Their customer service needs to improve. That brings this place from a 4 star to a 3. 

All In all I like the place overall, just needs to work on their speed. You can say they are understaffed, but who knows. 

** update as of April 15, 2018. Customer service has improved! It was super busy today when I walked in and I was able to be taken care of in a timely fashion. Lomo Saltado still good!"}
{"text":"Very clean place but food not happy about  his food.  Lomo saltado was in the dry side and cebiche, fish does not look fresh and to much acidity."}
{"text":"Having traveled to Peru, I was itching to re-try that famous Peruvian dish - cuy, a guinea pig roasted in a wood-burning fireplace.  Nah, that's a blatant lie.  I'll try most anything, but not when they raise those adorable pets directly across from the ovens in cute little piggie cottages.  They don't serve cuy here, nor do they serve alpaca, which I did try in Peru (it's good, and no, it doesn't taste like chicken).  But some woolly llamas (or alpacas, can't tell 'em apart) do grace the entrance, albeit the imitation sort).

But what they do serve is good, and much of it is reminiscent of Alberto Fujimoro's one-time tenancy as Peru's president - soy sauce in many of the dishes.  Like the Tallarines Salteados con Pollo my hubby ordered - what seemed like a pound of spaghetti in a tasty and soy-driven sauce, with lots of sauteed onions and chicken strips.

We had called to find out if they served wine and beer, and the answer was affirmative.  Turns out they had exactly two wines, both from Peru - a rose and a red.  Rose is usually way too dry for me, but our waitress, Patricia, obligingly offered a taste.  It was my kind of wine, and more like a white zin, so I ordered a glass.  It was $7, and a good-sized pour.  

We had fried yuca and plátanos for starters, and the yuca was accompanied by a very spicy red sauce and slightly less spicy green sauce.  The plátanos were the ripened ones, but definitely less sweet than usual.  That was a good thing.

My choice was the fish in shrimp sauce.  The menu said fried, but I had already far exceeded my fried food quotient, starting with the fried Peruvian corn nuggets that were comped at the beginning, then refreshed when my wine was served.  They're addictive, and it's too bad that Cárdenas Market right across the street was already closed when we left the restaurant and tried to stock up on them.  Or maybe that's good ;)

Ordering my fish grilled was no problem; the two fillets were covered with a delicious - but a little too salty - sauce whose ingredients were a mystery, and that was adorned with an ample supply of shrimp.  A mound of white rice accompanied the fish, which was tilapia.  Tomorrow I'll enjoy the other half of the fish and shrimp and all of the rice, while hubby slurps up the other half-pound of his noodles and chicken.  Just to say I've cooked, I'll make a salad to add to my favorite meal:  leftovers.

With excellent and friendly service, Jesus C. singing on the middle-sized TV, a big glass of wine, a comfortable atmosphere, a very good meal, and the opportunity to practice my getting-rusty-quickly Spanish, I was a happy and fulfilled camper.  Oh, and for the gringos, Patricia speaks English just fine."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not meet my expectations. Their food is bland, their meet is always very hard, it doesn't taste like real Peruvian food it is too expensive for the low quality of their dishes. I wouldn't mind paying high dollars for Peruvian food, you guys need to up your game. The restaurant is very clean, the service very nice but unfortunately the food does not taste good at all. I've tried other dishes and the same thing happens,is does not taste Peruvian. I hope you can improve your quality and I will definitely give you guys another shot."}
{"text":"3 puntos favoritos de este lugar:
1.- Comida rica.
2.- Ambiente tranquilo y familiar. 
3.- El horario, cierran 9pm, he visitado otros restaurantes Latinos/Peruanos donde cierran 8pm. 
Recomiendo platillo #13 del menú, que es una combinación de 5 recetas."}
{"text":"This is my first time to Lima Limon and it did not disappoint. My wife had already arrived and ordered to appetizers: fried plantains and a fish like appetizer with a nice tangy lemon sauce. 

Now, I want Point out that this was my second time having Peruvian food today where as I have not had Peruvian food for over three years. That came to a little bit of a disadvantage for this restaurant in that I was comparing the both of them. However, I still had a great experience. 

I ordered a fried rice dish with chicken and steak.  It was good, but not great. It left me wanting a little bit more flavor. Especially, in contrast to the fried rice dish that I'd had at lunch.  That, and the fact that I was already rather satisfied from the tasty appetizers. My wife enjoyed a classic chicken dish that had red onions white rice and french fries with it and was pretty flavorful, so of course I nibbled on that. 

The one thing that will definitely have me coming back would be the service. Juan, our server, was very warm, inviting, and genuine. A true Peruvian, he showed great hospitality and made good recommendations for us to savor on our first visit. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Es un lugar donde la atención es de primera #Patricia la azafata,  hizo que nuestra experiencia fuese agradable y el sabor de los platillos exquisitos. Un gran lugar y con mi hermana lo recomendamos. Comida A1. Y sabor que te hace sentir como en casa."}
{"text":"Hooray!!!! This place is off the hook awesome good! The owner and staff are so polite everything I ate was cooked perfect and I could taste that everything was so fresh so next time your thinking red lobster stop here instead like I did! You won't be disappointed and not familiar with Peruvian food this is a great place to get familiar with it .......definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Driving Around Town Looking For Something Different Came Across This Peruvian Restaurant. Didn't want to try regular chain restaurants. I had the lomo saltado. It was delicious ! Lots of flavor and the salsa was AMAZING Tangy Perfect for my rice :) I would go back next time I'm in town(california ). The free corn was bomb!!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend this place. The bland, unappealing and cheap decor would have been excused had the food been good.
That was not the case. The quality of food served was on par with McDonalds except a much higher price tag."}
{"text":"Great Service! Home Made Food!
Highly recommend this place! Great friendly staff! Can't have enough of the food highly addictive!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Peruvian food! And excellent service! My husband is Peruvian and we have enjoyed lots of delicious home cooked meals from his parents and this is the first restaurant to even come close to their food. We had papa huancaina, ceviche pescado y lomi saltado, all were amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good lomo, top best I've had. Would prefer they mixed the French fries with the meat like other restaurants, the green sauce would be better if they put it in a ketchup type bottle to put on food easier. Little pricey but worth it. Overal very delicious , just took a while to get the food."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian food by far. From LA and willing to drive for only the food. The food was super tasteful and my whole family loved it"}
{"text":"Holy crap! The food is amazing the best we've ever had. Shrimp ceviche and Lomo Saltado were soooooo good. Juan was adorable and so helpful with it being our first time there. Best service, best food. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat at a Peruvian restaurant in forever,  and since I just moved to vegas in may I've heard of this place from my Peruvian coworker. I ordered the fish with shrimp sauce over it with cilantro rice. It was so delicious I swear. The flavor was nothing like I've ever tasted. They give a generous amount of food and I left satisfied. I'm definitely coming back to try more dishes. ;)"}
{"text":"Great food. 
Beware the huge portions!
Their dishes are really meant to be served as family style."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Peruvian food and I was not disappointed! Our appetizer they gave us was fried corn (it was okay). But what I was really impressed with was the seafood fried rice. I've never had fried rice like this before! It had mussels, shrimp, squid (I think?), and just a bunch of other concoction of seafood. So delicious I would order again!!! I highly recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Always cool to try new spots and foods you often don't see on every corner. Got the chicken soltado. Pescado w the fish/shrimp sauce. Both were tasty. Chicken seemed slightly over cooked. Look forward to coming back. Tomatoes in my soltado were good too."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is a little pricey for Peruvian food but compared to the other Peruvian places I've tried their presentation and food quality is a tad better so you're paying extra for that.  Portions are huge! Order a few plates and share. 
Recommend:
Ceviche peruano / mixto -lemony, creamy, and has mixed seafood with a perfect soft texture. Comes w boiled potatoes
Lomo saltatado -typical Chinese-Peruvian fusion dish. Similar to steak stir fry with French fries, bell pepper, onion, white rice and a sweet soy & garlic sauce. 
Tallarín verde con bistek-Al dente fettuccine with a creamy, salty spinach pesto sauce and steak cooked how you like. 
Chicha morada- a punch made of purple corn. A little on the sweet side but good. Order a pitcher for the table :) 

Some negative is that the service is so so and they need to fix the AC but other then that I might come back if I'm the area."}
{"text":"All I have to say is the food was amazing!!! 
I got the tacu plate and it was so good! 
The service was slow. But the food made up for it. 
Definitely will be going back just to get the food! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love Peruvian food and I am very familiar with it because I lived in Peru for a year. I am always looking for a good Peruvian restaurant in the area and I am glad I got to try this one out. 

I ordered the stuffed avocado, lomo saltado with tacu tacu and leche de tigre. The stuffed avocado was actually pretty good! It was big enough to share with the hubby. The avocado is stuffed with chicken, potatoes, carrots and peas. If you are not a fan of mayo do not order this.

The lomo saltado with tacu tacu was pretty good as well. The only thing is that I am used to eating lomo saltado where the meat is cooked medium rare. This one was well done and a bit tough. The flavors were there but I just wish it has been a bit more tender. The tacu tacu though was very good. 

The last dish, leche de tigre was ok but the seafood did not taste super fresh. Additionally, it was so lemony that it tasted quite tart. I liked that the dish had breaded fried shrimp and calamari. Overall it was good but I would not order it again."}
{"text":"I am from Peru and we live in Omaha Nebraska. We were visiting las Vegas. This place is really good and the prices are not bad at all. We got ceviche, Jalea and lucuma ice cream, the three plates were delicious. People who work there are very nice and fast. I will definetly will go back if I ever go   las Vegas again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Last time I went they raised the prices by a couple of dollars on everything. The time before that we came when they were still supposed to be opened but I guess it was slow so they closed early. I'm still giving them 4 stars because the food is really good. We love the fish ceviche, lomo Saltado, and the fried fish platter. The house juices they have are also great, we always get the pitcher."}
{"text":"1st and only Peruvian restaurant I've found so far in Vegas. What I remember most is how disappointed I was with the Lomo Saltado! Dry meat  Glad they had Chica and Inca Kola which are musts. Cannot remember the other dish I had but it wasn't really good either. Cute place but I don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Lo mejor de lo mejor ,todo cocinado con productos naturales y un sabor incomparable y un trato de 10 estrellas ,se los recomiendo a todos"}
{"text":"It was the first time for us trying Peruvian food. The menu was expansive, and we chose arroz con mariscos and lomo saltado based on good reviews from yelp. The food had a lot of Asian influence, and while it tasted decent, just a bit bland. We both didn't really understand the hype for this place. The arroz con mariscos tasted similar to jambalaya, and the lomo saltado was like beef fajitas, except there were fries too. 

The restaurant itself was simple in its decoration, it felt like a diner more than anything. I thought the price was a bit too expensive, at around $15 an entree."}
{"text":"Wow well the wait was worth it this place is good it's all fresh the lomo, was awesome and this chicken was greatttt it's a hit Was skeptical but I am a believer"}
{"text":"Wow, wonderful service and delicious food , conveniently located (for me). I will admit I am not exactly familiar with Peruvian cuisine, but our server was able to easily guide our choices, describing pretty much the entire menu in detail. I am a fan! The portions were generous and the ingredients were fresh.

The Lomo Saltado was off the hook. I'm craving it right now. I've actually made it myself at home since having visited Lima Limon, but I'll take theirs any day of the week."}
{"text":"When I was about 13, Lomo Saltado was a sick, sick obsession of mine. I used to eat it at least once a week and then I burned out on it, but lately I've been craving for it again. I've had this bookmarked the moment it went on Yelp. I love peruvian food...it's like the odd baby of South American flavors I like and Asian food (Chinese immigrant influence to the country). Hooray, rice!. 

We were given some crispy homemade cornuts (cancha) to snack on while we wait and some spicy aji to dip....it was pink, which I've never had before, I've always had the usual green. 

Lomo Saltado - pretty solid lomo! Yay! The beef was pretty tender which is the make or break point since really it's a pretty easy dish to make. Ask for a bit of lime to squeeze on and I used some of the aji on it which is how I've always eaten it. 

We wanted to get the lima limon chicken but they were out of the sauce so we asked what was popular and went with one of the recommended dishes.

Arroz con Mariscos -  The rice was seasoned well  and it was plentiful of seafood. The only thing I didn't like about it was the mussels had a strong flavor, but the seafood all were cooked right. I think I prefer just octopus and shrimp in my arroz than a whole mix, personal preference I guess. 
Portions here are pretty sizeable so for the $12ish each of these entrees cost, they were rather large. 

Instead of getting just coke, grab one of the specialty drinks if you can. We got some of the marucuya (passionfruit) and that was pretty refreshing.... You can buy by cup or pitcher and we should have gotten a pitcher. 

Service was pretty decent. I've seen the reviews about some servers not really being attentive, but our guy server checked  up on us a few times throughout eating to see if we needed anything. This is a positive change and thankful as the food is pretty good.

Just a note you can't see if from the stree when you're driving, but you'll see a Catherines Plus Sized store and Red Lobster. If you're here on a weekday before 3, also ask about lunch specials! 

Yes, I will be back for more lomo saltado!"}
{"text":"Brilliant food! It's my fifth time to go there and authentic Peruvian cuisine is what these guys represent! Portions are pretty big and you better be really hungry going on there! Friendly personnel and clean environment! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"First time at Lima Limon and what a great surprise! The food is absolutely delicious and our server \"Juan\" was delightful! We started our meal with the complimentary Cancha (toasted Pervuian Corn, sort of like Corn Nuts but better!). We ordered a dinner salad that was large enough for both of us to share. Our entrees were Churrasco with Tallarine Huancaina Sauce (New York Strip with slightly spicy, cheesy sauce), and a side of Crispy Fried Yucca. Everything was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I like the place good service, I've missed my favorite in CA.  But this restaurant will be my favorite in Vegas. I always order lomo saltado and loved it here.  My mom tried ceviche de pescado a very good plate she was happy and she would tell me if it wasn't."}
{"text":"I have been to this Peruvian restaurant many times. The service is always great and the food is amazing, there's nothing on the menu that you could try and not like. The food is Simply Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Mother's day it took 30 mins to for waiting not bad but we been waiting 1 hour and 30 for food not good and where still waiting. Terrible once I got my ceviche was so little. Before it was alot. Other food was alot decent food."}
{"text":"Amazing food. First time eating Peruvian food and I am a fan. The food was fresh and delicious. Service was a bit lacking and Univision was very loud on the TVs..but I got to work on my Spanish while waiting!
Don't let the run down shopping center turn you away."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTLY MUST ASK FOR A SIDE OF HOT SAUCE!
most unique creamy tasty spicy sauce ivs ever had!
I didn't want fries so we went with Tacu Tacu con Lomo Saltado (ribeye over mashed potatos/white beans)!! Amazing!!! Also ordered the Palta Rellena (avocado stuffed w chicken potato salad), cover it in creamy hot sauce."}
{"text":"If you like seafood or steak, and trying a South American twist to what you know, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"If I had a peruvian friend... this is what I imagine their mom's cooking to taste like!!! Everything is always so fresh! The Cerviche and Saltado (chicken & beef) are my favorite so far. I haven't had a chance to dine inside but whenever I to-go from here, the service is awesome!!! The older lady in the front is always smiling and speaking to me in spanish (even though she knows i don't understand since i'm asian), which makes me feel really welcomed :)!!"}
{"text":"Really good place, nice people, great food, very big portions. Service was good, and really good flavor on all dishes. Had fish ceviche and it was so fresh and tender I was impressed. Will come back next time we are out here"}
{"text":"Best Peruvian restaurant in Vegas! Don't let the outside fool you this place was amazing ! 3 sabores ceviche was outstanding and arroz con marisco was even better !! Our new go to restaurant for excellent home cooked Latin food .. everyone must come here !"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had to give a one star to this restaurant .
I decided to make an order over the phone for my food to be pick up on my way to work. i called one hour prior to make the order .after hour and 10 minutes i went to get the food .well it turn out they didn't have it ready . when the lady on the phone told me it will be ready at 12 .

I LEFT WITH NO FOOD - 

I can get food anywhere is Las Vegas, but they lost money and a customer .

Customer service is the number one factor in a business it can give you lots of success of it can be a business downfall ."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed not once, but twice in the span of a much month. This place could be good, but food inconsistency and bad staffing make this place the worst place I have visited in Las Vegas. 

The specifics?

* It takes at least 30 minutes to receive an appetizer. The kitchen is painfully slow
* No bussing staff means the dining room is constantly trashed with dirty dishes on most tables
* The steak was tough and chewy
* A fish and yuca plate only had 3 pieces of yuca. 
* They were out of their features sauces
* It took almost 3 hours to serve a dinner for three

I will not be returning to this restaurant. It a worth mentioning that the wait staff is quite friendly, but very limited in what they can do to serve you faster due to bad management."}
{"text":"Lima Limon was popping up when I was delving deep into Yelp looking for lunch options.  A factoid about myself that might very well scare some of you dearly is that I, on extremely indecisive days, can sometimes spend 10s of minutes just scouring the search results of Yelp looking for that new place to try, sometimes ending up 20 pages in without still being able to decide.  

I'd ended up on Lima Limon's yelp page a few times, but they sure don't make it easy to make a call in order.  I couldn't find ANY menu presence online, as they don't appear to have an official site, and none were uploaded to Yelp.  I ended up on their facebook where they sometimes post pictures of specials, but again I couldn't see anything definitive as far as a menu.  I decided to do something I've never done in my life, I basically cold called them and practically asked them to decide for me what to get.  The girl who answered was friendly, though she did seem a little dumbfounded at my request (naturally).   I believe she asked if I liked chicken, and I said yes, and then I asked if there was any cream or butter or milk in the preparation, and the next thing I know she mentioned something about seafood and I ended up with a rice with seafood (arroz con marisco) dish on order.  I asked if they had iced tea which is my norm and she brought up some specialty peruvian drinks.   Sure why not.   Off I went to collect both food and drink of which I had no idea what I was getting.   If this were a movie my heart would be pounding out of my chest while the protagonist was driving to the restaurant.  Since it was real life and I have no emotions I was fine.

When I arrived I perused a take out menu which I was nice enough to take some crappy pics of and upload here so you can have somewhat of an easier time ordering if you choose to do so.   I went straight for the descriptions of the drinks to figure out what I might be getting.  There were two options, one passion fruit based and the other sweet corn and pineapple based.  I love passion fruit so I assumed I was getting the pineapple and sweet corn drink (which they had just finished pouring).   I asked and they confirmed in a friendly manner.

I didnt even bother looking at the food before heading back to the office.  When I got back and finally opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by how it looked,smelled, and ultimately tasted.  It was a rice dish mixed with a lot of various pieces of seafood (shrimp, mussels, calamari) and veggies all mixed in a nice sauce that provided reddish/orange hue.  It had a bit of a kick which was nice, and the flavors were magnificent.  I devoured the whole thing quicker than it takes me to figure out what I'm going to eat daily.

The drink turned out better than I'd imagined, though it was very sweet which I'm usually not a fan of.   I probably wouldn't order it again though I wouldnt mind trying the passion fruit one at another time.

Overall, don't let the lack of web presence Lima Limon has prevent you from trying it, there's clearly some good flavors coming out of there.   For me it certainly deserves further investigation, and now I have a powerful takeout menu handy."}
{"text":"I returned to this place and tried their sampler! Definitely worth it and so good! Ill be back for sure to try more dishes"}
{"text":"My Husband and I are from El Salvador !!! 

But we really like the Peruvian Food... Some of our favorite dishes are Ceviche, Lomo Saltado, chicken Lima Limon and others..

A nice atmosphere, local comprehensive, nice and clean.. And excellent Service...

The Best Peruvian Food in Las Vegas ....

***** CONGRATULATIONS *****

!!!!!!!!  God Bless You !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another great find with the assistance of Yelp!

We were driving down Decatur and heading towards Cardenas when we saw a small sign for Lima Limon.  While sitting at the light I quickly Yelp'd Lima Limon.   It has some great reviews so we pulled in to the parking lot.  At first glance, this is not someplace you'd drive by and decide to eat.  The Target that was previously in this lot is closed and this strip mall is not the most inviting place.

Upon entering I wasn't sure that we made the right decision.  The place looked rather old and the booths are super uncomfortable.  I felt like the waitress turned on the lights just for us as we walked in.  However, she was very nice and attentive.  Until she got busy.  They could use another front of the house staff member.

We ordered Ceviche, Pollo Saltado and Lomo Saltado.
The Ceviche was awesome. Be prepared that the fish is in large chunks but so very tasty!!

Pollo Saltadao and Lomo Saltado were SOOOOO DELICIOUS.  Hubby cleaned his plate!!  Make sure to get their pinkish/red salsa.  It's got a kick to it so test it out first...  but it's absolutely amazing.

On the way out the door we bought a box of home made Alfajores.  Aflajores are my favorites Peruvian shortbread cookies with caramel so I couldn't wait to try them.   I got home and opened up the box...  the cookies are delicious.  The shortbread was a little lighter than what I'm used to for the cookie but I will definitely get these again.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything is fantastic. I was craving ceviche....im glad I was. My mom and I found this place. Best. Ceviche. In. Life.

So good. Service is nice and fast. Staff is personable and attentive. He brought us a tablet with menu items because he noticed Spanish was not one of our languages. How sweet is that?!

Will be coming back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a not fancy, but comfortable atmosphere! I've never had Peruvian food so I don't have much to compare it to but this place is SO good. They start you off with some homemade cornuts which are crunchy and salty yet soft and buttery mm!  We stick to the same things every time for dinner: The Ceviche Mixto-it has the familiar tangy and fresh flavor of your traditional ceviche with lots of seafood in it, but this is kicked up a few notches. It's spicier b/c of the chilies they use and more garlicky and it had a few surprises in there too-sweet potatoes and Inca Corn! The Loma Saltado-is a flavor packed stir fry ( not the Chinese kind) of onions, tender beef strips, yellow peppers and tomatoes in a salty sauce that makes you want to lick the plate clean. That's over top a bed of refried beans and it so good to mash them into that sauce. We also get a side of fried plantains that have a slight sweetness and act as a perfect palate cleanser. My husband and I share everything so it's very affordable and plenty of food. This place deserves more attention!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant opened less than 6 months ago (according to our waiter) so the place doesn't have a very visible banner on the outside of the building but managed to find it after circling the parking lot a bit.
Service was fast, our waiter was super friendly and gave suggestions for things to try. He brought us conchi (peruvian corn) to try when he found out my parents have never tried peruvian food.  
I had the fish ceviche which was super delicious, my mom had a seafood platter which she liked and my dad had the lomo saltado, the beef was tasty but the fries a bit on the bland side. I have to say the blue corn/pineapple drink is SUPER sweet and not for someone that's not used to super sweet stuff. Overall the food was great, serive was amazing and I will be coming back for more ceviche :)"}
{"text":"Great authentic Peruvian food and the service was amazing not to mention the great prices!"}
{"text":"Got an hour before back to training, so gotta hit up the nearby spots.  Luckily, Lima Limon, a place we got listed on our monthly \"ethnic cleansing\" list (culturally different places that has never been tried before) was just miles away.

The dilemma...the gang at work will not be pleased to learn that two of us couldn't resist the temptation to take a test drive, without them.  Shhhhh...Hopefully, they won't find out.  I keep telling them to jump up on Yelp, this is why lol.  

I read a previous review about how a Yelper put in a phone order and left unhappy with an empty stomach, swearing she would never return.  This game we play is an emotional one indeed.  Although, like movie reviews, I think we can't let others comments derail us without having tried it for ourselves.  Remember, chefs & staff are people too, and bound to make mistakes.  I wonder if this Yelper ever allowed the staff an opportunity to remedy free situation.  But that's neither here nor there.

Anyhow, we were pressed for time and had to eat with the quickness and by this time had 45 minutes left.  I opted for the mainstay dish, lomo saltado, another for a trainee and a fried shrimp calamari plate.  I was concerned with how long it would take, 40 remaining...and counting.  Nothin to do but sit, wait and analyze the decor that reminded me of an old school diner/karaoke/dance/buy-me-drinkee bar...for those of you that don't know, Google it!

The homie decided to bounce after ordering to get gas in the interim.  Surprisingly, by the time he returned, out came the dishes!  37 minutes to spare...but bad for two full size entrees and a hefty appetizer.  I usually wait for all parties before I start eating, in respect, but this was an exception and dived in while my patnah was in decontamination from the petro mission.

7 minutes later, the lomo was no-mo!  Although it was very similar to chop steak, it was tender and flavorful with a unique sweet soy sauce line taste with a hint of tang.  With 30 minutes to spare, I was more than satisfied with the outing.  Got full, got back to work and ninja mission accomplished.  I will mos def be back with the rest of the unit, fighting the urge to tell them what we tried today since we gotta keep it on the hush.

They get a 3 star rating for now and will reevaluate soon when I return with the squad.  Service was good and friendly but food did not wow me.  Perhaps the ceviche can change my mind..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here for the lomo saltado and the ceviche. It's truly the best favors combination I love their green salas. Best customer service. You pay for good quality,roughly 16$ for a dish. It's across the street from Cardenas i can't wait to come again"}
{"text":"Wow increíble el servicio el mesero muy amable, el sabor de la comida delicioso, el pollo a la parrilla exquisito, gracias."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good!  The huancaina sauce is the BEST I've ever had.  Lunchtime is usually pretty chill but we went to dinner service the other night and the wait staff seemed genuinely perplexed that a White family would want to eat there.  Our server did not speak a lick of english, had to fetch someone to translate, and didn't act very happy to wait on us.  We've eaten Peruvian food many, many times, have Peruvian friends and love the cuisine.  It was the first time I'd ever felt remotely unwelcome at a Peruvian restaurant.  

The ceviche is just okay, however.  The mixto has TOO MUCH calamari, and it's sliced very thinly - to the point where I kept wondering what all the noodles were doing in my ceviche.  Oh yeah, it's squid.  I also have a suspicion the fish is tilapia - grossssss.  Wished I had ordered just the camarones.  

I'm totally going to eat my leftovers but the service left a bad taste in my mouth and I think I'm going to continue to only visit them for lunch."}
{"text":"As a Peruvian ex-pat, I constantly find myself under tremendous pressure when trying to satisfy my sivichi craving. I'm a regular at \"Las Americas\", \"Don Beto\" and \"Mi Peru\" - all of which are respectable establishments in their own merit. However, when news came through that a small, family-run restaurant was being born; I was forced to visit.

Upon first arrival I noticed a minor lacking of decoration, which is understandable as they have only recently opened. Their seating arrangement is comfortable, taking advantage of the large space provided, without seeming too empty. If I had not known this was a Peruvian restaurant, I would've thunk this was a 60's style diner! Not a bad thing, just unexpected.

A kind and familiar face welcomed us and led us to our thrones. Quickly, she brought our drinks and a small bowl of Peruvian Fried Corn, a tradition. The Menu seemed rather unintuitive, featuring a handful of classic dishes, but missing some too. More than anything, the restaurant's young age is seen in various ways. I firmly believe that through hard work and perseverance, their experiences will come with time.

I'm not one to order several dishes, but I had been craving a good ol' Peruvian meal for awhile, so my comrade and I decided on 5 dishes. A breeze of onion signalled the arrival of the \"Choritos a la Chalaca\" - which were good enough. The choritos didn't feel overly fresh, but the onion relish topping was fantastic - helping cover up any mishaps caused by the choritos. Completely understandable seeing as we're in the middle of the desert, a beautiful one at that. 

Before we could finish enjoying our choritos, a heaping plate of \"Chicharron de Calamar\" made its way to our table and hearts. We were won over by the light yet crispy coating which made these feel like small pillows from heaven. Flavorful yet not over the top. A house specialty!

As mentioned earlier, my main motivation came at the hands of the sivichi; I was slightly surprised after having been underwhelmed at other similar restaurants. The fish was cut well and the seasonings were just right. This took me back to the innocent days as a kid, sitting on Peruvian shores enjoying this same dish. Nostalgic.

To top it all off, I decided to splurge and give the \"Anticuchos\" a shot. Boy was I happy I did! Their flavor profile was spot-on, although they could've been cut a tad thinner, just personal preference.

All in all, I'm very pleased with the whole experience. Friendly staff, flavorful dishes and reasonable prices. There is great potential in this establishment and I hope to be there years from now when this is a booming part of the Las Vegas economy."}
{"text":"Far off the best Peruvian restaurant I have been to in the US.  I come from Southern California where there is at least one Peruvian restaurant in every city.   The Leche the Tigre is amazing and the Lomo Saltado is to die for!!
I cant wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellente!!! Ceviche mixto, seafood fried rice, and sizzling meat place!!! So happy and full."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This is THE BEST restaurant in Vegas! First off, I have been dying for a good Peruvian restaurant and it has been slim pickings up until now. When my daughter and I walked in, the place is clean and modern. Instantly, you feel a very authentic Peruvian vibe. They were playing Peruvian music and the tv was set to Univision. It actually brought me back to younger years when I lived in South Florida, with such a strong Latin culture, where this music would be fully appreciated! Significantly unlike any other restaurant you will visit in Vegas. 

When we ordered the food - papa la huancaina, ceviche de pescado & lomo saltado, dear God I thought we died and went to heaven. Being Peruvian myself and having grown up with traditional home cooked Peruvian food, my standards are REALLY high. Not only did the food taste like my parents made it, but when I asked the server if they used GMOs or organics, he said that they used organic. Clearly, that is not verified at this time. However, the food was so savory and heavenly, I wouldn't doubt if it was organic. 

I don't remember ever going to a restaurant where the food tasted this completely amazing... ever! And I've been to some pretty amazing restaurants in my day. If I could give Lima Limon 10 stars, I would. Definitely a MUST. Go check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"The best Peruvian food in town the piqué Lima Limon was amazing never have had tried anything that I don't like highly recommended"}
{"text":"Both the food and service here were very good. They have both a printed and a tablet menu with pics of all the dishes. Portions were large, so bring a good appetite.
Our server delivered a small bowl of canchita to munch om. The fried yucca and fish appetizer was a bit dry but we asked for some hot sauces which our friendly server quickly delivered and that helped the dish a lot.  The Lomo Saltado was great with tender strips of steak cooked just right.  The chicken and noodles was also delicious and had a wonderful sauce with a different flavor than I had ever tasted. Dessert was outstanding - a creamy cake that I did not get the name of, but was similar to flan, only better. And Lucuma Ice Cream (our server was kind enough to explain what a lucuma is, even googling a picture for us! And, no, it is not a llama-like animal!)
All in all, this was a very satisfying meal for about $20 a person with soft-drinks, an appetizer and two desserts.
Best of all, it's walking distance from where I live! Sometimes, life is good!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! Everything was huge and we had so much fun. Can't wait to get hungry so that I can finish my leftovers and come back again! 

The location makes it a bit of a diamond in the rough but worth making the trek out for."}
{"text":"My 11 yr old nice and I have made a mission out of trying a new \"different\" restaurant once or twice a month. Different cuisines and chose something off the menu that probably normal Americans wouldn't try. So we chose Lima Limon. And per usual we had to try beef hearts! I was skeptical, but it was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! The server was very patient with us and explained everything the best he could. He even made me homemade lemonade! I can't remember the name of the fish/shrimp dish, but it was SO good! And we had the flan for dessert. OMG. Best I've ever had, and I'm not usually a fan of the stuff.. I had one bite and wanted the whole thing! Definitely will be back. It was a great experience and amazing food."}
