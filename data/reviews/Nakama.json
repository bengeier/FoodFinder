{"text":"This was truly a major disappointment.  The restaurant is way over-priced and the food is just \"average\".  There are so many of these types of restaurants around that I would not waste my time with this place.  I had a steak and shrimp dish that was average.  Shrimp was OK but the steak was tough and over cooked.  I ask for medium rare and got medium which was well done by the time everything else was cooked.  Service was marginal yet the restaurant was not full.  Very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Poor service. Waited too long for our food. Sent it back because it was poorly prepared - was worse second time.  Forgotten meals. Talked to the manager and he said \"sorry\" and scurried away. I worked many positions at a local restaurant and am more forgiving than most - this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for a special occasion. I was so excited because I had been wanting to try this place for a while. The waiter was very nice and the chef at the hibachi was really funny and my niece loved his sense of humor (she is 3).  I ordered a drink called city peach which is peach vodka, pineapple juice and orange juice- very very sticky ingredients. The bar waitress who brought the drink, spilled it all over my leg and the floor. I was very cold, very wet, very very sticky and very very uncomfortable the entire meal. My shoes kept sticking to the floor which no one bothered to wipe up. No manager ever came over to apologize or comp my drink which really upset me. I paid full price for 1/2 a drink essentially which I stressed my dissatisfaction over and still no manager came over!  The shrimp was good and so was the steamed rice, but the veggies were very bland tasting, I ordered steak, cooked medium, it was well done which made it hard to chew and dry...thank goodness for \"pink sauce\" to cover it up!!  I was very upset over the drink and meal - for all 6 of us it cost over $200 - NOT worth the money. I do not mind spending money for a meal but only when it is a GOOD meal worth the money - AND, I had to rush to my mother's house which is nearby for a rest room since I got sick off something.  This place is not worth your time or money!"}
{"text":"Lunch: Filet mignon and shrimp was delish! Ginger salad dressing and shrimp sauce was awesome!"}
{"text":"After my previous experience at Nakama the General Manager stepped up an showed outstanding customer service!  Im happy to say i will continue to eat at Nakama thanks to the upper management,  & for my love of the food, but im still upset i cant have my food exactly the way i want it."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. I think it used to be more of a scene a few years ago, but I still think the food is good. It's the same hibachi show you'll get at any of the local places. I'm vegetarian, and some of the chefs really know how to be nice to a vegetarian (cook your food first, before there's meat on the grill), but not all of them. You'll get better service if you go when they're not busy."}
{"text":"Our party of 7 went in for hibachi on a Friday night. We made reservations and only had to wait a couple of minutes for the table to be ready. Three of us were vegetarians and the waitress was nice enough to let us know that the soup had a meat based broth. Our chef was great and even prepared our vegetarian food before putting the meat on the grill. Overall great and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"I went there with people from work and it was a lot of fun.  We sat at one of the Hibachi's and ate some really good food.    The sushi was also really good and I normally am not a sushi person.  I would recommend for a fun evening."}
{"text":"I have been to Nakama for many happy hours in my earlier professional days.  Recently, I arrived for sushi with my friend Katie around 7:30 PM on a Thursday (great downtime to get a seat at the bar following their popular happy hour).  This was an impromptu outing after assisting Katie with some logistics for this year's Silk Screen Gala & Film Festival.  We started with beverages and placed an order of edamame.  They definitely place a good amount of sea salt on those green soy goodies, which I LOVE.  Thursday is ladies night, which allows 1/2 off of a selection of mixed drinks, beers and/or house wines.  Together, we surveyed the area, making up fun and comical stories about our fellow bar patrons.  #Goodtimes  Next, we placed our order for sushi (the main entr√©e), cleansing our palates each with  a salad.  I had the Nakama salad with their yummy ginger dressing.  Katie had a spectacular cucumber salad, mixed with soy sauce, sesame seeds and red pepper bites.  Finally, the sushi arrived in its artistic and flawless state.  Fresh and colorful, we each chose 2 types (totaling 4): Asparagus Tempura, Spicy Tuna Roll, Baked Alaskan (our favorite), and a Hawaiian roll. Nakama has a moderate to high price point which makes sense, due to their prime location in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood and terrific ambiance.  I will definitely be going back.  Oh, and knowing that we ate so healthy (minus the salt and soy sauce) made for a non-bloated ride home.  #30somethingproblems  Review can be found on my website as well:  http://wp.me/p43vGR-YX"}
{"text":"One of the more popular/trendy places to be, always busy (youll need a reservation for the habachi tables, and be prepared to wait to get a spot at the sushi bar). However, im not a sushi person, so I cant comment on that. The food here is certainly good, but I wouldnt go so far as to say spectacular (definitely had better hibachi steak, & fried rice was disappointing). Props for the atmosphere, service, and relatively moderate pricing (for these kind of places)"}
{"text":"GREAT  food  and really high prices  so it is good but i dont think it is worth it  i felt like all you are paying for is their obviously high rent due to the \"trendy\" location  i'll go back but not often"}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere and great service.  Cocktails were tasty.  Sushi rolls were very tasty and fresh. Really enjoyed the food. We enjoyed the experience and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We just got home and had T H E best Nakama dinner yet. We've been going to Nakama for years and have never had the amazing experience that we did tonight.   The shining star was our chef, Tom. Right from the start - great eye contact and great communication with our table - my husband and me, and a couple with a 7 yr old - a very engaging young lady. Tom didn't miss a beat and truly made her experience (and ours) special. He made sure to ask if anyone was allergic to anything, .... handed her the tools and challenged her to do cook, he made the rice into a heart, the veggies into a 'U' and the 3 pieces of chicken in the fist column stacked to make an 'I'. The 'I' 'Love''U' was a first for us and Tom seemed so pleased. And so were we. He showed he was having a good time and it was contagious. The food was amazing -  - Bob's Delight and I had the shrimp/scallops/tuna. My husband agreed that our meals were the best yet at Nakama-in both flavor and the correct temperature.    We'll be back in two weeks and will ask for Tom. Hope he's working then too!"}
{"text":"The manager, Sun, was awful. She had no customer service or hospitality skills at all. She served me the wrong sushi roll and told me I was wrong (um, hello the customer is always right) and she was giving our amazing waitress, Ashley, a hard time and arguing with her about the WRONG sushi roll. Ashley and Ryan, the servers, had amazing personalities and showed my table amazing hospitality. Besides the good sushi rolls (when I finally got the one I ordered) I would not recommend coming here at all. We also waited an hour for our table when we had a reservation."}
{"text":"Had sushi and sashimi for lunch this week. Very generous portions and fresh. Have recently been to Tamari and Yamato and this was the best, with Tamari a close second.  Only issue was seating. We wanted a table for a meeting, but had to sit at the sushi bar because tables are limited."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went to Nakama for dinner after spending the afternoon at Skybar nearby.  We all had on bathing suits WITH cover ups.  In particular, one of my friends and I were wearing almost identical outfits (sheer dresses over out bathing suits) except that she even had shorts on under her dress.  She is black and I am white.  The manager on duty approached her and asked her to leave because she was not \"obeying the dress code\" but he didn't say anything to me, in an arguably more revealing outfit.  When she asked him for clarification, he asked did she want to speak to the owner and she said yes, to which he replied, \"well he's not here.\"  I can completely understand upholding a dress code, but I cannot comprehend selective dress codes.  If her outfit was unacceptable, then so was mine and we should have both been asked to leave but he ONLY said something to her!  He then proceeded to call the police and told them that my friend was \"causing a scene\" (she wasn't.)  I will never set foot in this racist establishment again!"}
{"text":"Never a bad experience here. Chef Tom is an amazing entertainer and cook!  He was especially attentive to my 3 and 4 year olds that loved him."}
{"text":"now i sympathize with a lot of the reviews for nakama, but in 3 separate experiences i've never had anything close to a 1 star time.  our most recent trip led us to the sushi bar where the service was lightning-fast and karma-friendly.  (our waitress forgot to charge a salmon roll and ended up comping it in the end)    it may be overpriced, but isn't all sushI?  the red dragon roll was worth every cent as was the hanalei.  i've never ventured to the hibachi side of the road, and i just have a feeling that you'll be better off sticking to the sushi.    cheer up pretentious sushites and remember that you're in pittsburgh, not osaka!  PS. nobody's mentioned that Nakama's cougar population is flourishing."}
{"text":"After an afternoon Pirates game, 3 of us sat up at the sushi bar and ordered fairly common sushi and sashimi. It was fresh and tasty. We also ordered a bowl of chicken fried rice that my husband claimed was the best he had ever had ( I think they cooked it with a LOT of butter). We watched the sushi chefs prepare way more interesting looking dishes while we waited for our food and enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waitress, Lauren, was a giant bag. That is my only complaint.  Not sure if we were just really luck to get the 3 seats as we walked in or what??  There was a constant line up in the waiting area so maybe we were lucky."}
{"text":"So...  I usually only eat in the Sushi bar/bar area because I am not into the whole hibachi thing.  This place is usually very busy for Happy Hour, so if you just want to eat and not worry about a crowd, try a different place or come at a different time.  Otherwise, it can be amusing to people watch here.    Personally, I come for the Sushi.  Ever since my friend introduced me to the Hanalei roll, I can't resist it.  Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, some other stuff, then tempura batter fried.  Tastes so much better than it sounds, worth the $14 price tag (if done right) as it is double the standard sized roll.  The other rolls are all decent and the sashimi servings are huge.  If you are on a first date, beware - the pieces of sushi are so gigantic that you'll either 1) look like a pig stuffing it all into your mouth or 2) risk having the entire piece fall apart all over you as you try to daintily take normal bite sizes out of the sushi-piece.  You decide whether you will go for option 1 or 2!  Oh, and just say NO to the tempura appetizer.  It's not tempura, that would actually be Japanese style.  No, what you will get if you order the tempura is American-style beer-battered shrimp and 3 pieces of vegetables, all for 11 bucks.  Blech.  Service is always a bit shoddy in the bar area, but to be fair, that place gets crazy busy.  So...  Food, 4; Service 2-3 depending on the night and business; atmosphere, 3.  But hey, if you just want that busy happy hour scene, this is a place to go to!  P.S.  Parking can be a pain.  It's Carson in the Southside, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"Was here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. Luckily it was just the two of us so we were able to sit at the sushi bar right away and you get the whole menu at the sushi bar which was a good thing since hubby wanted steak hibachi.  The onion soup came with our meal and was nice and spicy. We had the Hamachi, toro, sake, tamago, all nice and tasty and the nice sweet tamago. The caterpillar roll was very good and we also had the spicy yellow tail roll which was ok.  Service was fast, really fast considering how busy they were.  Prices are comparable to all other Japanese steakhouses, the steak hibachi was $28.00, the rolls were 10.99, 6.99, 5.99  They have valet parking ($7) which was nice since we are from out of town and had no idea where to park.  Talking with people there, they are always very busy and have 600 reservations on Saturdays, so if hitting it on a weekend or if you want to sit at the hibachi tables I would make a reservation.  We both said we would come back. Only complaint I have is the sushi bar is near the door and I was cold. If you're at the hibachi tables I'm sure you'd be nice and warm ;)  One question: What is with the cards on the ceiling?"}
{"text":"An amazing Valentine's Day with June and her staff! So over the top good that we had to write up a  review.  Wife has recently discovered she's gluten intolerant, so going out has been a real pain. But both the waitress and bartender bent over backwards to find out if X or Y piece of sushi had gluten in it.   The sushi we did end up getting was amazing, and they accidentally brought out extra rolls for us, and then offered to take them off our bill as we didn't order them.   Eventually, June came over and chatted with my wife for awhile; my wife got a little soy sauce on her white sweater, so June ran over, got some club soda and a napkin and was actually blotting out the stain on her sweater.   Seriously, amazing service, amazing food."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced mediocre hibachi. The rice wasn't cooked well enough, and the hibachi chicken was tough. Everyone I went with got food poisoning after as well.   Everything needed to be seasoned more, too."}
{"text":"I remember this place being awesome....not the case anymore. The restaurant felt dirty, the food mediocre and the prices way too high. Also, the employees all looked a mess with dirty pants, mis matched uniforms etc.  I am very surprised the owner/manager let this place fall so hard."}
{"text":"I've been to Nakama three times...each time worse than the last...shame on me for continuing to go...but there is an absolute dearth of places to go in Pittsburgh.    I had a reservation on Opentable; they cancelled the reservation but didn't fail to accept my money.  The server was beyond untrained.  They forgot at least three of the items we ordered.  We brought our own wine and they charged us a $30 corkage fee when the last time I was there they charged us $15.  I asked to speak to the manager who got angry that the last person hadn't charged us $30...that is THE HIGHEST CORKAGE FEE IN PITTSBURGH...and at a tired, mediocre restaurant.    I don't right negative reviews...I realize places have, like people, bad days...but it's clear this restaurant is on a precipitous slide from the peaks of mediocrity to much worse.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful sushi joint, which hosts the best appetizer ever (the tuna and avocado).   If you're looking for a one of a kind sushi experience definitely visit."}
{"text":"This is my first time here.  Service marginal.  Bar tender not very friendly.  Shrimp were like eating rubber. Way over cooked.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nakama: Overall, I give three stars due to okay food and varying levels of service.  Service: I came here for my friend's birthday. We had a pretty large party and made reservations ahead of time. When we got there, we ended up still waiting for another thirty minutes or so, which was fine with us. What got us a little annoyed was how the hostess was not kind to us or anyone else that was there at the time. When we were getting seated, they were unsure where to seat us and we had to walk around the restaurant once before settling.  Our waitress was one of the sweetest people ever. Her name was Stephanie and I want to say how much I appreciated having her as our waitress. The whole restaurant is loud and super crowded, and she remained calm and helpful throughout the entire night. I would often see her running from place to place.  The manager was also very sweet. My girlfriend made an ice cream cake for our friend and he was the one who brought it out for us, helped us cut it, and even washed the cake pan afterwards. He is obviously very proactive in customer satisfaction. In addition, the restaurant didn't charge us extra for all of this, which many restaurants do.  Food: Food was only okay for me. I got the chicken diabolo and my girlfriend got the steak. The chicken was not fresh, extremely dry, and chewy. The steak was not the greatest either, it seemed to have the same problems of being a little dry and chewy, not as bad as my chicken was though. I was definitely very full after all of this though, it was a lot of food. If I ever come back, most likely, I will get the shrimp, since that was pretty good.  This was my first Hibachi restaurant experience. While I understand the excitement of the show, etc., I don't think it's worth it for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. The whole thing is fun to watch, and thought that would be their gimmick, but the food turned out to be amazing.  I've never liked any seafood but their shrimp appetizer is so good! The only place I'd ever eat seafood (besides my occasional bouts with sushi).  I got Chicken & Steak hibachi dinner all three times I've been there. I got filets the third time for the steak and it was worth the extra three dollars.  It is kind of sad that the performance of the hibachi chefs varies a lot from person to person, as the second time I went was by far the nicest to watch, but all three were very good.  This is my birthday restaurant now. ;)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in to have dinner, and requested to be sat at the sushi bar. The host pointed to where we could seat ourselves but then quickly shouted that she needed to take our Starbucks because she couldn't allow any outside drinks. We looked around puzzled because there was a dirty table beside us with an empty Starbucks cup. She refused to let us drink our coffees so we unfortunately left. Terrible customer service. She should have offered to pour our coffees into one of their own cups."}
{"text":"I've tried to like Nakama, I really have. There is a serious shortage of good sushi in the Southside.....as in there are only two places to go for it. With the renovation and new ownership of the old Sushi Two into Tokyo Bistro, Nakama has dropped to last place (or 2nd), for Sushi in south side.   Nakama has style. The interior is gorgeous. This is where it all ends and goes south though. The food is very uninspired, the waits for a table are unbelievable (and unwarranted), presentation has gone downhill over the years - and the worst part: the crowd.  For some reason, Nakama has turned into a singles scene. Please explain to me how a sushi & hibachi restaurant is now a meat-market? (fish market? hehe) Any given night of the week, you will find scantily clad fake women (could be a good thing), and old rich perverts trying to pick them up......cougars, suburbanites, screaming children....it's nuts. At peak dinner hours, you literally have to fight your way through everything. You'd think you stepped into Town Tavern by accident or something!  The other issue, and the reason why I am marking it bad for groups, is the lack of larger tables dedicated solely to sushi eaters. If you have a large group of people, you may as well pass. You can either camp out and wait for a bunch of seats to open up at the sushi bar, or sit at a hibachi grill - which is terrible for the cook if everyone in your party wants sushi.  Here are some final pros to balance this out a little bit and explain why I gave it two stars:  - Great drinks...best bloody mary I've had. - Awesome for late night food once it clears out - Good lunch specials - The aforementioned interior space  But if you really want good sushi, go to Umi in Shadyside or Pennsylvania Fish Company on Penn Ave in the strip. Nakama is not the place."}
{"text":"I love this place, i wouldn't call this real sushi, but its still really good!"}
{"text":"The food is good. I've  never had the sushi but Ive heard  it's very good. I only gave 3 stars bc the service is AWFUL   The manager is a pompous asshole,  Is annoyed at life And  doesn't care if you have a complaint. Acts like your disrupting his life if you have a concern.  I've eaten here and had a few good experiences but I've also has really awful experiences as well and haven't been back"}
{"text":"I ate at Nakama for the first time last night, sat at the sushi bar with two friends, ordered a ton of food, and an expensive bottle of sake (which was over priced and soso in quality). Despite the money we dropped, the service was horrible, simply put; unprofessional, rude, and snotty.  Now, this place has nothing to be uppity about: THEY DO NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT SUSHI IS. It was Americanized to the extreme, the menu was embarrassing, as with the wine and sake list. The sashimi was so poorly cut you could barley chew on it, the maki was not tightly rolled. And the fish... oh the fish, no flavor.  The hipster crowd should of tipped me off, this is place for people who do not know anything about dining, and probably only eat sushi because they think it's the cool thing to do. The crowd was nothing but meat heads and trashy looking girls, the music selections we're bottom of the barrel, and the blaring sports tv's would ruin anyones dinner who cares."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Nakama constantly, but the past few times I went the service was horrendous. The most recent time was the worst I have ever seen. A friend & I decided to sit at the bar & not only was the bartender rude, she acted as if we didn't exist! It took her 15 minutes to even look at us to take our order, then when it was finally ready we watched as she chatted with her friends rather than take it over to us. Nakama isn't THAT great, so when the service is bad.. Theres no point in going, I'll be going to Lil Tokyo next time I get a sushi/hibachi craving!"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you are gluten free. Our server was pretty clueless and they couldn't prepare gf sushi. My food was cooked in the back, came out cold and I had half of what everyone else had. Had a reaction to my food. Def got glutened.  Also had to ask several times for water. My friend got the complete wrong sushi order.   Not a great time at all."}
{"text":"I witnessed my friend who was intoxicated at the bar was taken advantage of by the bartender ( male working Sunday 8/14/16 around 5pm) someone needs to check the cameras and action needs to be taken. The gentleman paid $100 for his tab and he was clearly really drunk and when they gave him his change he only gave him $6 dollars back and when he confronted the bartender about it he had the rest of his change sitting on top of the register. This was extremely awarkward to watch someone being taken advantage of and to see the bartenders face when he caught him was something unreal. Really messed up when you go to a nice restaurant like Nakama and have an employee do something like that. Really makes you think twice of going there in the future ( or makes you realize that you need to count your money because there are people out there like that )"}
{"text":"Love this place! Soup is delicious ...sake bomb...awesome.... Hibachis always great...go for lunch ...much cheaper less packed"}
{"text":"Friday May 15 my friend had reservations for 9:00PM for a surprise birthday dinner at Nakama. Because of Nakama's strict seating policy when it comes to reservations, she spoke directly to a manager, and requested that the guests be allowed to sit before the guest of honor arrived so that it would in fact be a \"surprise\". The manager agreed and assured her that there would be no problem granting that request.   The guests arrived at 8:30 PM and informed the host that we were all present for our 9 PM reservation. The host told us we would be called when it was available.   We were still waiting in the bar to be seated at 10PM. An hour after the guest of honor arrived, (so much for the surprise). When we were finally seated everyone ordered appetizers and drinks right away. It took 20 minutes to receive our drinks. And believe me, I'm not exaggerating for effect here; I was timing it on my watch. My appetizers arrived at about 10:30.    We placed our dinner orders shortly before the apps showed up, which would be around 10:25. The chef did not arrive to start cooking until 10:50.   I addressed this with the server who gave me excuses about the shortage of chefs and how they were backed up, but I noticed people who arrived after us, who were also seated before us (with comparable party numbers) were almost finished with their meals before our chef arrived.  The waiter clearly didn't understand that I wasn't interested in excuses and passed me onto a manager. The manager apologized and went to grab a chef for us. However when the meal was finally cooked and served it was 11:30. All after we were supposed to be seated at 9.   On of the couple's who was with us, never received an appetizer after waiting for 1.5 hours. The appetizer was Ahi Tuna, which requires NO cooking. The manager offered a free dinner, but by that time our friends were so disgusted that they left.   I have to say that we were one of the last tables to leave the seating area, which was after midnight. We spent way too much money on drinks while we were waiting to be seated and eat our dinner. No one at the table was compensated for the aggravation. One of the girls at the table is a newscaster for channel 4, and I would love to see her comment on the negative experience we had.   I strongly urge people who are interested in a hibachi style dining experience to seek other venues. If it is sushi you are interested in, try the Downtown Fish Market, Umi, or Yakoso."}
{"text":"May be a decent place to eat hibachi...BUT NOT sushi or sashimi!!!!  I have tried Nakama's 3 times to be fair.  Nakama can not live up to it's name as a \"Sushi Bar\".  Don't waste your time, money or taste buds...."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. The Signature long rolls were delicious and the Nigiri cut was thick and satisfying.  The service was prompt and accurate, despite some complicated orders.   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Review for Bar/Scene Only:  My mom says my crackface cousin (she doesn't call him that) raves about this place.  My random childhood friend's boss told me I should come here to meet interesting people.    I went for drinky times.  I brought a City Paper with me, as I was alone and needed some entertainment.  I sat at the bar for about 20 minutes, watching everyone around me get served.  Two large, bald headed gentlemen sidled up and were taken care of immediately by the bartender.  Still nothing in front of me.    Eventually I was asked \"Are you OK?\" at which point I requested a drink list.  Now, I don't really go in for too much mixed alcohol or sweet stuff, so I ended up just ordering a Pearl (cold-unfiltered) sake.  I'm not sure what people see in this place.  I mean, the bar scene is almost all large and/or old(er) people who usually happen to be bald if they possess a scrotum.  I mean, that's fine, that's cool.  Just not what I consider a \"happening scene\".    Also, my bartender made me taste the sake before giving it to me.  I thinke maybe he thought I didn't know what I was ordering.  To be fair, I was the only one in the whole bar drinking sake, so maybe they don't sell that much of it.  The food may be tasty, but I was warned that it would \"give me the poops\".  Can't verify that though.    Has anyone else noted the playing cards stuck to the ceiling?  That's pretty cool.  I also like the exposed pipes.  It's really not so bad from a design standpoint.  Just a Pittsburgh kind of place, I guess..."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! We drive to Pitt every 4-6 weeks and my husband and I stop by whenever we can. I always get sushi, my favorite is the Nakama roll. My husband usually gets a full meal which he always enjoys. Drinks are always amazing as well. It's a little pricey for the area (I guess compared to DC is average), but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I love the food and love the feel. The only thing that left me a bit cold was the bartending staff. I have been there three times on business trips and each time they seemed to be indifferent at best, except when my bill came and I got a huge smile and a \"Have a wonderful night.\" which was about as sincere as a campaign promise."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night for Sushi.  We had 3 different roles and tgey were amazing.  Ordered 2 more nagiri pieces that were great. The fish was fresh and flavour was good. Will definitely go back for sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been to Pittsburg for business several times and I always make sure one night for dinner I stop in.  I have never ate on the hibachi side, but I LOVE there sushi.  The crowd is always lively and upbeat.  You will crave this place every time you set foot in Pittsburg."}
{"text":"Used to be a staple on Carson but has really disappointed over the last few years. Still a pretty good meal but the service and flair are completely gone. The hibachi used to be so entertaining but now it's basically just watching someone awkwardly cook for you. Sushi is tasty but no options that really stand out. Table service is usually not great and the bartenders seem to use their phones more than mixing tins. Still a place I will go every now and again but there are many better options for this type of fare around the city."}
{"text":"Went to this \"sushi\" restaurant last night and had hands down the worst sushi of my life.  Shrimp tempura was beer batter, not tempura.  Seaweed salad was hard - how does that even happen?  Sushi was mushy with overcooked rice and too much of it.  Also the habachi fried rice tasted like burnt soy sauce with a sprinkling of dirt.  The atmosphere left me feeling as if I forgot my too short skirt, spray tan and box of condoms.  The waitress was very sweet and had our entire meal comped.  We tipped her generously and ran for the door."}
{"text":"Great location in Southside and good if you want to fulfill a Hibachi craving. However, not the greatest Hibachi, nor the most authentic either. It's also really loud in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Much like Geisha House in LA, Nakama is all about the \"pizazz.\" I remember when this place used to be a RITE AID, and now it has a massive coy fish on the front of it. I'm not going to diss Nakama, because I actually really like Nakama. I've gone here on many different occasions: for family and friend gatherings, work-related lunches, or just for drinks. This was where I first learned how to properly use chopsticks. It definitely gets a lot of hype, and sometimes you can't even get a seat, but that's because the hibachi is so damn good. They have this creamy sauce that is out of this world, I know several people who order extra just to take home. The whole experience is nice, really. The sushi is better than average and the hibachi is great, too, but I usually go with anything \"surf n' surf\" (all seafood). The scallops are some of the best around, but a bit on the small side, if I remember correctly. Very good with the cream sauce I mentioned. Don't know what it is, but there's a reason why they keep it a secret. The service is a number one priority, at least from my experiences.  Don't go for the hibachi if you're not in the mood to sit with other people, unless you have a large group. I took my folks once, and I don't think they were totally into it, but it's nice for younger people or a party."}
{"text":"Avoid the hibachi and save yourself from the rest of the night on the toliet!   Had the hibachi sesame chicken, my husband had the hibachi steak. First course onion soup was super salty, tasted like it was hot water with beef ramen seasoning. Salad was decent enough. Veggies served first then meat. Bland- nothing special. Certainly not worth $50. They also serve this nasty \"shrimp sauce\" which is basically thousand island dressing. I was worried about the food safety on the hibachi \"chef's\" cart. Kinda grimey-lookin.  Worst part was that later that night, both of us got sick from eating there. I'm talking sick like from the movie Bridesmaids.  It was bad. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch today. Food was quick n fresh as usual. And the service from the blonde bartender was on point. She was very sweet"}
{"text":"The food is great if you are there for food and if it was still 2005.  The sushi is sub-par and on more than one occasion I've left their feeling a bit ill from it.   As another reviewer wrote, \"Nakama has turned into a singles scene. \"  I don't understand this phenomenon either as if you are there for more than 5 minutes you cannot go anywhere else without smelling like the inside of that place. You also have to wash your clothes twice to get it out, it's almost worse than cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Good fresh sushi. Get the appetizers if you can. We had the seared NY strip, which was delicious and $9.99 for quite a large portion of steak. The crab fritters were pretty good and crab-y if you are in the mood for something fried and not soaking in oil. We didn't do the hibachi, but the sushi was good. The toro jalapeno roll was pretty creative. The food is NOT overpriced for the whole package. Yes it is a bit \"uppity\" if you mean no one is really wearing their XXL Steelers shirt and the servers and patrons actually care what they look like. It is not a place to get a $5 roll."}
{"text":"So I'm in town working and went and sat at the bar to get a quick dinner before a show.  They had a dry Riesling on the menu and I confirmed with the waitress that it wasn't sweet.  So I get it that this is a strip of tattoo parlors, vape stores and college bars, but there are also quite a few great restaurants hidden around the area.  So, I was a littel surprised when my wine was beyond syrupy.  Then I ordered a specialty roll.  Honestly, I ordered a cooked tempura sushi with avocado.  It came drowned in about three different sauces.  It wasn't compelling. On the positive side, service was fast and friendly. The place was crowded and people seemed to be having a great night. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Wife and I went on NYE. I got the blue crab and red dragon rolls. They were decent, but something was missing.  This is especially true with the blue crab roll. My wife got the shrimp hibachi and said it was equal to Little Tokyo and Benihanna.   The service was okay, but they did put an extra chair on our table which made it a little cramped.   It gets a 3 and not a 3.5 because the bathroom had an attendant.  Not only that, but he had pictures of scantily clad overweight women sitting above the urinal. Dafuq?"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced.  Like, a lot.  Ginger dressing is horrid.  Usually the ginger salad is one of my favorite things at sushi joints, I look forward to it.  I ate two bites and pushed the bowl away.  The hibachi was overpriced and not that great.  The fried rice had no egg in it and just didn't seem like the typical.  Wasn't filled with flavor and they put two huge pieces of fat on my plate with the steak.   Ugh???  Is that normal?  Also, the miso soup was like super miso.  Spicy and odd.  But, and this is a big but, because without this there would be one star:  the bartender/server.  I don't know his name but he has a tattoo over his collarbone.  He is amazing, nice, attentive and made the trip to Nakama okay.  He needs to run this joint.  Otherwise, I hate to say it because I like new restaurants in our area, skip this place.  Go to ichiban instead."}
{"text":"If they had 4.5 stars, I would rate them higher than 4. This place is rad! It gets really busy, so I highly recommend reservations or sitting at the bar. Don't pay attention to the 3 star review because this place deserves more than that! Service is great and one of the great things about sitting at the bar is you can watch them make your roll right there in front of you. We ordered 3 different rolls and each one was fresh, unique, and on point. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the low reviews but this is one of my favorite Habachi places in Pittsburgh.  If everyone is mad about the wait for a seat, then reserve a table!!  The food is absolutely amazing, and the waiters are very nice as well.  This is a great place to grab dinner but don't forget lunch!  The food is quite pricey, a dinner plate at the grill can cost you a quick $25, and that's not including drinks and sushi.  Tab for two people including drinks is usually about $100, well worth it if you ask me.  Right after dinner you can find a great place to grab drinks in the South Side.  If you're complaining about the price, just don't go everyday!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Nakama for the first time for a first date - many firsts that night. Starting with the bad: We made dinner reservation for 7:15 and were a few minutes late. We were told that we lost our spot and had the choices to either wait a half hour to 45 minutes, sit at the sushi bar, or just order food at a table without the hibachi experience. We opted to get a drink at the bar  and wait it out. This was a Wednesday evening and the place was packed. No seats available at first so we checked out the drink menu and finally we got a couple of chairs.   The drinks were decent - I'm a lightweight so they were good for me. It worked out that we waited for the hibachi because we were able to be squeezed in within ten minutes.    I got Hibachi Seasame Chicken and my date got Nakama Tuna Steak. He also ordered sushi but our waiter had forgotten to bring it- It was really no problem because the portion sizes are pretty big and we probably couldn't have ate the sushi anyways.   I have no complaints about my chicken - It definitely exceeded my expectations based on the other reviews I have seen for it. My date goes there on the regular and so his Tuna Steak obviously has his coming back for more. The Onion Soup was by far one of the better Japanese soups I have had. It has a kick to it that I haven't tasted anywhere else.   Our hibachi chef was wonderful. He was entertaining, easy to talk to and was really good at his job. He even let us all try a little fried rice.   I always have had reservations about Nakama because I thought it was an overexposed restaurant that jacked its prices up because of its trendy reputation. I really enjoyed my time there. It was clean and had a lot of energy. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Tried to have lunch here but ended up leaving after waiting 15 minutes for a beer. No wonder the place was 1/2 empty. Talked with manager and she offered me a free beer but I could not have it after being being upset by the waitress. Was really looking forward to a nice meal but now they are off my list"}
{"text":"The foods can vary a lot in quality, unfortunately.   I had gone a couple weeks ago and gotten the Haiku roll due to the high praise, to see that the crabstick inside of it had a smokey/bitter taste to it that was very unpleasant. Additionally, the tempura shrimp resembled more of a boiled shrimp. It definitely was fried, but lacked any tempura batter or anything, making it to be kind of a waste of space inside the roll, which I really hate to say.  Additionally, the spicy chicken was extremely mushy and the outer coating would thus fall off the chicken.   However, the lobster roll is definitely the best. I would highly recommend it, despite the enormous price tag on it.   Overall, this restaurant uses a lot of rice in their sushi, which I do not mind! It allows the rolls to be of a greater size."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this damn nakama again. I made reservation on open table. When we arrived none of the hosts greeted us they were just standing and talking on the podium. I finally told them I had reservations and they escorted us to a table with a group. We didn't want to sit with a group we just wanted a table for two. So we ask if we could switch the seats they were offering us and they did. When the waiter arrived it was apparent he had an attitude. He asked us what we wanted to drink and was there anything else we wanted. We weren't given any menus I asked for a menu and he only brought us one menu and there was two of eating. After noticing his rude and annoying attitude wasn't going away, we decided to just get up and leave without even ordering. This nakama has the worst service."}
{"text":"A gimick place.  Nice place for tourists.  Ate at the bar and was ignored throughout my meal.  Probably didn't spend enough money on the slip to be treated like a person.  No need to say anymore!"}
{"text":"Not worth it.  We showed up at 6:15pm on Sunday night for dinner thinking we'd have more than enough time to make an 8pm movie. We didn't get out of there until 7:45. The service was SO slow. There was one bartender/server for the entire sushi side. She had zero urgency and seemed to cater to a few men at the bar while the diners and other bar patrons sat waiting.   It took twenty minutes for her to bring us water and take a drink order. She then proceeded to refill everyone's drink, take orders, and get new drinks for her favorite bar patrons before making my boyfriend's drink. It took over thirty minutes from when we walked in to get one drink.   The food was good, but not worth the price. This is a restaurant in a strip mall in the suburbs. To spend over $100 for horrible service and mediocre food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Boy, has this place changed over the years! The price has always been steep, but it used to be that you would get great, fresh food, service and entertainment in return. Not anymore.   The wait staff is generally sour and unprofessional. We came in on a Monday afternoon and they clearly struggled to find hibachi seating arrangements during this slow period.   Luckily, on this Monday, we were able to get the one chef with a modicum of talent and personality. When Nakama first opened, all of the chefs were friendly and full of tricks. That's what we come for. The whole point of hibachi restaurants is to be entertained, not just sit around a sweaty table. Most of Nakama's chefs nowadays will just sit there in silence as they grill your steak.   The food is still good for the most part, although the sushi isn't very fresh, and they have a tendency to bring appetizers during or after your main course.   A lot has changed over the years. Between the loud music on weekends, reward cards, and specials, it's clear Nakama is trying to do too much instead of just concentrating on good hibachi. The bar makes a killing on weekends, though, so I doubt they'll change.   As an aside, they have a broken \"gong\" that they ring on your birthday, except that they deaden the noise, so it sounds like a fork hitting a table. Come on guys!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had....and I come from the East Coast.  Unreal toro, have some of it's available."}
{"text":"When you ass black ladies that they're not welcome because they have on a bathing suit and they are covered with dresses and or shorts and tops but the girls next to them can be with their boobs hanging out showing the Coots where is that the right thing to doask one group to leave who were swimming covered in their bathing dresses and shorts while people sitting in the restaurant got the slip down almost falling out shorts so short you can see their Hoochie what is going on here"}
{"text":"Cold average. Sushi was just OK, rubbery and a bit soggy. Also had 2 apps and miso soup. Korean BBQ lettuce wrap was overcooked and chewy, served with a cut iceberg lettuce cheek that was barely the size of my small hand. The chicken nakatori was 2 pieces of over cooked, dry thigh meat on a stick for $8.99??? Nope. Rarely complain about price. This place just doesn't give you the quality that the price demands. Soup was great. This was my 3rd and last disappointing taste."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars, I absolutely would. Had a reservation for 10 last Friday. Hung out at the bar area while waiting for all members of our dinner party to arrive. My friend was attempting to order a drink from bartender Susan (dark, curly hair) and was met with a rude \"you're gonna have to wait\" response from her. (Keep in mind that the bar was not overly busy at this point in time) My friend was talking among the group about the extremely poor service he had just received. Susan overheard and began to scream at my friend in front of the whole bar. I would say it was the most unprofessional thing I had ever witnessed by a customer service employee, but the manager Sun took the cake on that. Susan called Sun over and complained about my friend. Without hesitation, Sun removed my friend's drink from his hand and asked him to leave. At no point did Sun attempt to hear my friend's point of view. Needless to say, we took our business elsewhere. I approached Sun and calmly asked why my friend was kicked out. Her response was \"he started yelling first\" which could not have been further from the truth. I told her we would be cancelling our reservation for the evening, to which she responded \"bye\". This was my first and last Nakama experience. I will NEVER step foot in that place again. I'll eat gas station sushi before I give them my money. If you're thinking about dining here, do yourself a favor and cancel while you still can. Or at the very least, make sure Sun and Susan aren't working."}
{"text":"I love sushi - and even though Nakama is always extremely busy and crowded, they have a great sushi menu.  I had the avocado and Philadelphia roll when I was last here, but one young chef was very sweet and gave my friend and me an entire roll for free.  You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This is another one of those typical Hibachi style Japanese places.   The food was okay.   The rice was cooked until it was crunchy; one of my pet peeves.  The place as also VERY LOUD.  You couldn't hear anyone else talk unless they were right next to you.  I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Bland food no showmanship no conversation my noodles were still cold. . . Probably the worst hibachi I have ever experienced. . .I definitely do not recommend it"}
{"text":"The food is reasonable but the place is great for an evening for some good dressing up with some good drinks. The ambience is great but it can get a little too hot near the grills..."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed this place. Had a horrible experience. Host was unorganized. Soda was flat in our mixed drinks, they brought out more soda to fix it, we had to demand new drinks. Soup was really spicy.  Our sushi came out on someone else's plate, they picked at it around their order and sent it back, the sushi chef just re-plated it and gave it to us (gross).  Food was average at best, cook was good though, portions were big.  Server came back once during dinner.  Messed the whole tables checks up and we waited 30 some minutes just to leave after we boxed our food, so we left cash and walked out, paying for our overcharges. Manager no where to be found.  I would avoid this place after this experience.  We used to frequent this place years ago!  What a shame it went so down hill!"}
{"text":"This review is for the sushi bar. I found the fish to be somewhat rubbery and the rice soggy. The rolls were not wrapped tightly causing me to separate the fish to eat as an inspired sashimi.   I found the atmosphere as most Pittsburgh sushi restaurants to be somewhat tacky. To lure the crowds in they have the loud hibachi tables setup for the novelty inspired Pittsburghers. I sat at the sushi bar where the oil infused exhaust from the hibachi tables crept over leaving for a somewhat ghastly atmosphere.  The waitress reminded me of someone from Applebee's, ultra chipper, bubbly and unable to answer basic questions about the fish. The prices were much higher than other sushi restaurants in the area and based on several recommendations I can only conclude that Nakama is over rated when it comes to sushi. I refuse to lower myself to sit at or eat from a hibachi table so maybe by these standards this Wexford establishment is superior to others."}
{"text":"This is a popular spot in Pittsburgh's South Side. Over the past few years the quality of the food has declined. It is still good and fun so give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend who's local and she introduced me to this amazingly delicious place. I ordered the tropical roll and she had a tempura Philly cheese roll. We share crab fritters and had a glass of wine with it. Everything was so delicious! I loved every minute of my experience there. The waiter was super attentive and friendly. The food was quick and fresh. I will most definitely return again in the near future."}
{"text":"I have not eaten in a Nakama restaurant, but the stuff that they pawn off as lo mein at PPG Paints Arena was terrible. I chose chicken lo mein. The noodles were completely dry and devoid of any sauce or other ingredients. A handful of cubed generic chicken (which looked like an afterthought) was thrown on top. Very disappointed, paid $12.00 for dry noodles and a small serving of chicken.   I'm aware that the food is not prepared there and cannot be compared to the quality of their restaurant food, but if I were responsible for this presentation I would be embarrassed. Very poor quality.  This being said, I would not hesitate dining at a Nakama restaurant. I have heard good things from many people, but if you're going to PPG Paints Arena avoid the Nakama lo mein."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for sushi -  I've been putting it off  as I'm not a fan of sitting at the sushi bar  That said, the chefs didn't even make eye contact, so I was perfectly happy. Yeah, yeah, antisocial...  :)  They're docked a star from my perspective because there is no option to the bar/sushi bar area if you don't want hibachi and if someone is with you who doesn't like sushi, they are stuck eating off of the appetizer menu.  I always start with basic items when ordering sushi at a new restaurant - had salmon, tuna, shrimp and eel nigiri and a cucumber maki.  The fish was fresh, with decent texture, the cucumber was crispy, and overall Nakama might have taken over the number 2 sushi restaurant spot in my heart."}
{"text":"Went with a group and sat at the sushi bar. Service was not so good. One person's meal was served after the other three of us had several orders of sushi. We ordered two orders of sashimi and only one was on the platter. Quality of sushi ok. One was stringy. Valet returned car keys because they were going to leave early."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends to try the new Nakama. I had never been to the original one, but had heard the hype.  My expectations were high.  I want to give them credit for being new, but they should have had their act together for 8pm at night.  The entire visit was a mess. The service was unstable and poor. The ingredients in my sushi were stale or over ripe.  The salad had WAY too much dressing- but I suppose that's my fault.  It's possible I will try there again in a few months, but for the prices, the food and service should be impeccable."}
{"text":"Renee,  I do not even know where to begin on thanking you and your team!  Everything was absolutely amazing! The menu's were festive and I thank you for doing them!  We had no trouble with valet and they were some of the nicest guys! They were so accommodating with our cars and needs! They even offered to run people's leftovers to their cars!  How many places would do that and how many places would let you leave your cars there? Probably, NONE! The servers went above and beyond and were some of the nicest servers I ever had! The one that is going back to school and we had on his last night was great! Most people probably would have just wanted to end their shift and be done. Not him!  He was everywhere, kept me in the know, took care of the bill for me and really was WONDERFUL!  I am sad for you he is leaving because he had to be one of the best you had!   They kept the drinks filled and were really on top of things!  The chefs were great, talkative, and did awesome tricks! The food was absolutely amazing from the appetizers to the entrees! I LOVED it all and received many compliments! The manager on duty (sorry I didn't get his name) went above and beyond as well!  He let us leave all the leftovers on a back table and brought us markers to write our names on the boxes.  Not many places would be so extremely accommodating and I have witnessed this first hand!  I cannot believe how much you all did for us! Most importantly, thank you especially for all you did to make this night perfect and my job that much easier and better!  You all are the best and you work with some amazing people!  Thank you again from the bottom of my heart!  Have a very Merry Christmas and a safe and Happy New Year!  Amanda"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Nakama tonight. I am lactose intolerant and told the waitress, the amount of attention I got and the effort the staff went though to make my meal lactose free was amazing! The staff was so friendly, food was amazing and our waitress Jess was great! We also got to meet the owners an they are the nicest people. My friends and I come here once a month and always have a great experience! I recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys a friendly atmosphere and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I don't get the attraction to this place. Maybe it's just because it's in the South Side and offers easy group dining.  My husband and I had a gift card and ate there saturday and we decided to sit at a small table in the bar area. Our spicy chicken appetizer was good  but nothing spectacular. Our meals were ok. Fried rice seemed bulk and not freshly made.  Their shrimp sauce was also not great.  Our drinks were really good and the service was really good. There are many other hibachi places I would choose over Nakama."}
{"text":"at Nakama Express in Greentree.  Horrible Service, it was wrong, and no one will correct the issue.  Don't even waste your time with the worthlessness that is this whole restaurant.  Part or the Corner Market & Ale in Greentree, I am so disappointed!"}
{"text":"What an absolute dump. Staff sat chatting at a table drinking Starbucks while we waited for fifteen minutes for service. Three other staff passed us and never acknowledged our presence. As two of four patrons in the entire restaurant, I would have at least expected some recognition. The bathrooms and floors were absolute filthy. When we left, they finally acknowledged us and asked if they could help us. Too little, too late. Will never return."}
{"text":"Decent sushi spot in Pittsburgh.  There are better around but it's definitely worth a shot if you're craving sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Hibachi is overpriced and under quality as compared to Saga. My family all agree, Saga wins in atmosphere (Nakama is crowded with smaller tables placed to close together) , fried rice (Nakama charges almost $4 extra if you want fried rice which also loses to Saga in taste),  and Saga also wins in quality and price.  Service is a push as well as the chef ( I think the chef's show is always luck of the draw). Nakama wins in ginger sauce."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay.  Nothing special, but a little better than Little Tokyo.  Bartender was rude.  Made my French Kiss martini incorrectly (I watched as he poured an imitation chambord liquor).  Hiachi was okay.  Soup was way too salty.  Salad was good.  The chix and steak were pretty good.  Service was horrible.  Had to pass all used dishes to the waitress across the grill.  Will not hurry back."}
{"text":"ICK--avoid this place.  I took one bite of the sushi and stopped eating it.  It tasted funny and waaaaaay fishy.  Our chef wasn't Asian but some white guy who didn't knock my socks off.  All he did was toss some high sodium sauce on some veggies and meat, stir them around, and serve them on our plates.  My stomach hurt less than 1 hour after I ate there...'nuff said."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and I do think the Hibachi is tasty, however, the service seems to get worse every time I'm here.  Server seemed very rushed, barely staying at the table for 1 minute to take orders.  Today, I had my 9 year old son with us.  He ordered a steak kids meal, which the menu states is steak, vegetables, rice, and ice cream for dessert.  He got no veggies (which I didn't even mention since he won't eat them anyway) but he ate all of his meal and was excited for ice cream.  The server never mentioned or brought it, so I asked, \"he's supposed to get ice cream with his meal right?\"  He says, \"oh, let me check if we have any.\"  About 10 minutes later he comes back with our check and says, \"sorry we're out of ice cream.\" My son says, \"do you have any other dessert?\" Server says, \"No, but the Milkshake factory is a few doors down.\"  Really?!?!?  Your solution to being out of something is referring me to another establishment down the street?  Is Nakama buying him a milkshake? Otherwise, I don't know, but that just seems ridiculous to me.  He acted as if I was trying to get some freebie or something.  It says it comes with the meal.  At least offer the kid a pineapple or take a drink off the check or something.  No, I did not take it up with the manager because at this point I just wanted to get out of there."}
{"text":"Nakama is like the equivalent of reality TV on VH1 to the local Asian cuisine restaurants actually available in Pittsburgh.  It's seems like the thing to be, but there's much more fulfilling places that are way lighter in the pocket book that you can easily skip it after one try.  They own a great spot in Southside though so the prominent location creates dominant control of people's eyes and ears.    Got to Yokoso."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a Nakama fan!  Whenever I'm trying to think of a place to go for dinner for a special occasion or a night out, Nakama often comes to mind! We usually get the hibachi dinner and it's always delicious and fun to watch!  We usually get some sushi too!  I live in LA now, so I've definitely had some good sushi out here, but I think the sushi at Nakama is just as good.   My biggest complaint about this place is that it's way overpriced.  They charge you for all of these little extra things too, like fried rice, which I feel is pretty unnecessary.  The sushi is also overpriced in my opinion.  Overall though, I've always had a great time at Nakama and I love the food!  I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We are definitely fans of this place.  Best Japanese steakhouse in Pittsburgh, which may not be saying all that much, but they actually do a good job.  Food quality is good, and the chefs are typically pretty entertaining.  I find the waitstaff to be a bit on the slow side, and I have no comment about the sushi (not my thing).  Plus, we saw Jordan Staal, Tyler Kennedy & Max Talbot there one night!  So if its good enough for the Stanley Cup champions, its good enough for me!"}
{"text":"I'm a celiac and the cook carelessly made my food with wheat and I was informed after I ate half my meal... NEVER come here with an allergy, the cooks apparently \"don't read the tickets\" according to the manager.  P.S. Bathroom looked like an atom bomb when off."}
{"text":"The wait was way to long just to be seated, the service is mediocre and the prices are too high for sushi. Decided to go somewhere where I could actually be seated."}
{"text":"Good sushi Diablo noodles were enough for three to share with the veggie egg rolls and ginger salads Service was very good at the bar"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Susan is the worst bartender in the world but she ruined my night. If this is typical for Nakama's service I will never be back. I wish I could give 0 stars. I have never posted a review before but feel so strongly about her terrible service that I just had to."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always.  While very expensive, the food was delicious, the hibachi entertaining, and the ambiance appealing.  The sushi is some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Thus Japanese restaurant used to have hour long waits. We went in on a Sunday afternoon expecting to have a wait but there was none. That was good! Then I understood why. The food was good but not great! It was decent but not delicious. The chef was nice but forgettable. The waiter was memorable though! Very upbeat and friendly personality. Also it was very dark in the dining room. Not a plus."}
{"text":"Couldn't help but feel as though i was watching an episode of jersey shore as the bartender brought out sushi to her friends first, even though they ordered well after us. It was also brought out to only one part of our 3 person party at a time. We couldn't even eat together. It also took over ten minutes and two bartenders to make one glass of water....on a slow sunday afternoon, mind you Not a good sign.  Luckily the sushi is of good/great quality."}
{"text":"The three stars (really 3.5) is for the steak and chicken I ordered at the hibachi as I thought it was tender and seasoned well.  However, I didn't care for the fried rice I added on at all and there was a lot of waiting around.  It took an extremely long time to get any meat/protein.  Since it was cooked last you basically had to eat rice and vegetables if you wanted hot food or sit there and let your food get cold while you waited for the rest of it.  Initially I tried waiting for everything but it kind of got to the point of being ridiculous having food on the plate and just letting it sit there untouched for so long getting cold."}
{"text":"Well, I was very disappointed by our first meal here.   The sushi was delicious.   The service was ok.  Our server was nice but he kept trying to clear the table when we were still eating from plates.  I set my Chop sticks down to get a drink and he took my salad.   The chef was the worst part.   He cooked well but didn't have much flair.  I got rice in my eye and a piece of steak hit me when he was trying to toss it to my husband's plate.   The steak hit the table 3 times then hit me.   He didn't have all of the tables' meals on his cart and had to go back for part of an order after the whole meal was cooked and the person said don't I get scallops?   For what we paid we could have gone else where and had the same if not better hibachi.  I don't think any of us will be back."}
{"text":"Nikki was our waitress.  She worked so hard all night, not only for us, but for everyone in our section. Did a wonderful job for us considering we needed a new drink every five minutes!  She consistently asks if everyone is happy, which makes the dinner so much easier to enjoy.  Our chef was wonderful and cooked everything to perfection, along with asking the specifics when it came to little things we enjoyed about the meal.  Our valet service was also very personable and they made sure to open the door both times for my girl.  Really appreciate that.    I'll be coming here for years more."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Nakama & it was truly a disappointment.  We waited 20 minutes for our sushi to be served and then received someone else's order. We waited for the order to be corrected. I ordered eel & sea urchin sushi. The eel was served cold and the sea urchin was old and slimy. We sat at a table near the bar & had a view of what appeared to be someone's closet. We saw coats on the floor and a tennis shoe protruding out into the restaurant. In addition, there was an industrial bucket sitting on the bar chair with lemons and limes and no cover. My first experience there was amazing. This experience of a dirty restaurant with poor quality sushi has left me with a bad taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of hibachi-style cooking, and my old place on the South Side was right down the street from Nakama, so I was excited to try it when I still lived there.  Once was enough, I'll never go back there again.  The food was pretty terrible through and through.  The meat didn't taste very fresh, the soup and salad were both forgettable, and the fried rice was AWFUL.  I can't understand why this place is so popular, my best guess is that some people consider it a \"classy\", \"cultured\" destination to get drunk at.  There are plenty of those types of places on the South Side already, and I'd venture a guess that even the bars serve better food."}
{"text":"fun restaurant, EXTREMELY rude people working there.  I would suggest confirming your reservation multiple times, at least 3.    ---BEGIN RANT---  I went here with a group of 10 people, we made the reservation a week in advance, and when we showed up on a Saturday night the place was PACKED, the wait for a table would be 2 hours, and our reservation was nowhere to be found.  Lost reservation was bad, but to top it off the hosts and hostess had MAJOR attitude insisting that we were lying about making a reservation, arguing with us for no reason, and generally making us feel very unwelcome.  Personally I don't enjoy being treated like crap when all I want to do is bring your restaurant lots of business.   Just because your restaraunt is decorated in a trendy way and serves sushi doesn't mean you aren't in Pittsburgh, so lose the NYC attitude Nakama!  ---END RANT---"}
{"text":"If I had to describe Nakama in three words it would be \"Overpriced, Loud, Boring\". For a hibachi steak house, this place really doesn't seem to care about the whole, hibachi part. It basically is just watching someone cook food in front of you, there's no show, no flare, just a dude in a chefs hat frying your rice and leaving once you have your food. On top of that, for the price, the food is not even close to good enough to justify it, nor do you get enough of it. In all honesty if someone told me this place is only in business because of its location, I would believe them because the quality alone is not even close to enough to carry this place. I would not recommend going to this place, but I would recommend you check out Ichiban if you need your hibachi fix."}
{"text":"Once we got seated the chef came out after an hour wait. They charge extra for fried rice, and they didn't give you an option of noodles. You had to choose between shrimp or mushrooms. Usually those are both given to you free of charge. Other than that the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"The management is terrible!!!!! I ordered a seafood combination ( lobster scallops shrimp ) they give me tuna scallops and shrimp forget to bag my salad and soup!!!! On top of that the seafood combination cost 4-8$ more I called to address this the Chinese lady offered me a four dollar refund after they forgot my stuff an over charged me sad business practice I'm never going there again poor management"}
{"text":"So it was payday and I decided to treat myself to some overpriced cocktails and sushi.  My wallet was bleeding a little bit after this night but it was worth it because you can observe cougars (literally in animal prints) hunt their prey. Dinner and a show!    OOO and not to mention there was a magician! YES, a magician at Nakama.  Hilarious. As far as magicians go, I guess he was good! It still kills me that Nakama and Max & Ermas have the same entertainment.   Service was a bit spotty. The place was packed but we still stay at the bar for 20 minutes sans cocktails.   Pro: Busy, Lively, good cocktail list, fresh sushi, good place to start the night  Cons: Slow service, pricey, strange amount of bachelorette parties (they has sashes and crowns)   Every once in awhile this place can be fun!"}
{"text":"I was at Nakama yesterday and ordered the scallops hibatchi.  The rice and vegetables were fine but the scallops had a taste like an ammonia cleaning product.  Someone else in our party verified this.  I let the server know of the problem and was asked \"would you like to speak with someone?\"  I thought I was speaking with \"someone\" about it.  The waiter did nothing else and management did not come over.  I later googled \"scallops taste like ammonia\" and found that this is what scallops taste like when they are going bad because they produce an organic compound called an amine.  So, apparently Nakama served me old scallops, I complained about it, and then they didn't care."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for hibachi and sushi with friendy staff and quick service.  The Chicken Diablo dinner was delicious"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and shrimp combination dinner.  The shrimp was good, the chicken was bland and chewy.  The service was good but the entertainment was pretty much nonexistent.  The real down side of this place was the price. The prices were way too high for such mediocre food.  There are more reasonable alternatives around that blow this place away.  I have been to so many of these Japanese steak house style places that I can tell when one is just average at best....and that was Nakama."}
{"text":"Found this place after the wait was too long at Fathead's down the street. It was crowded so we were offered a seat at the sushi bar and handed menu's but then found room at the regular bar and those menu's were higher priced! Ridiculous.  It was crowded and loud, why the dance music at sushi place?   The food was OK, the shrimp was a solid B, the strip steak was B+ but everything else was just average. The Japanese soup which is usually chicken based was mushroom based, yuck.  The small salad was trenched in too much dressing. The rice was decent, the sauce on the meals was just average. The check arrives with a higher price than the menu's. Turns out fried rice was $3.29 more than white, it would have been nice if the server told us ahead of time! Dinner and a Sapporo beer was $30 for one. Not a good value."}
{"text":"One of the coolest meals I have ever had. Watching a hibachi chef cook my food in front of me was a real treat. This place gets super crowded, so come early (or really late) and try making a reservation (although they will still probably make you wait). We had to wait a long time before they took our order and a lot more time after that before they started cooking our stuff before us, but once that starts, it all really becomes worth it. I am vegetarian so had miso soup, stir-fried mushrooms, vegetables and tofu with sticky rice (and sake!!).. it was all delicious... watching your food get made in front of you makes it soo much tastier. Portions are enormous, so don't overorder. Great place to catch up with friends and have a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I went to Nakama on Saturday for my birthday. I had a party of 9 and told the hostess my friend was in traffic and would be late. She insisted they could not seat us until everyone in my party arrived which to me seemed to inconvenience them more because we were occupying the lobby and seemed to be in the way. Once seated, it took long to get everything. A long wait to order drinks, then receive our drinks, then long to take our order. My reservation was for 8 and by 8:45 we hadn't even put our food order in. I ordered a margarita and 30min later I still hadn't received it so my friend complained to the manager who was walking around. He was very apologetic and explained our waitress was actually a hostess and he bought me the margarita. That definitely saved the night and I am thankful for his generosity. The food is good, your basic hibachi food. I didn't order sushi but my friends seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place has such a cool atmosphere and the food is great too. I love their sushi, it is incredibly tasty. I will definitely be making another trip here. It's also nice to sit outside and enjoy your meal when the weather is nice. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided to get dinner here with a group of friends here. We needed a reservation for all of us so we just sat at the bar and ate there. It was very packed during the dinner but the bar was empty.  Everyone ordered their own meal. I ordered shrimp fried rice and a sushi roll. It was plenty of food for me. I believe my roll had shrimp tempora, Avocado, cream cheese, and jalape√±o as well. There was good presentation and plenty of food for me.  The drinks were good and the bar crew was fun ! It was reasonably priced for what we got and being in the middle of the city. We were probably here for about 2 hours I think. We had a great time here that evening."}
{"text":"I've been to Nakama three times in the last four years, and I have to say I've had some mixed experiences from visit to visit. Nothing outright horrendous, but I've never had a perfect meal here, either.  During my first visit a family member and I sat by the window and enjoyed a quiet meal on a Saturday afternoon. My only complaint then was that there were no indications about just how big each order of sushi on the menu was; as a result we ended up putting in a second round of orders to fill up our stomachs, because round one was pretty light. (This problem still exists - they don't specify how many rolls you get next to every item or even in the section header. My orders have definitely ranged in size over the years and it's really hard for me to judge how big their rolls are without images or numbering. Special rolls in particular are rarely the same size as regular rolls since they have special ingredients.)  At dinner during my second visit I couldn't hear anyone in my dinner group over the grills, voices and music. The food was ok but the main thing I remember about the evening is leaving with a headache from the noise.   And my third and most recent visit, while mostly good, still wasn't quite spot on. On the plus side, presumably since it was a Monday evening it was relatively quiet and there was no loud or obnoxious music being blasted throughout the place. The chef making our dinner was very nice, he let his technique wow us and do most of the talking for him, and he occasionally engaged in polite conversation with us. I loved watching and listening to this gentleman and he was a huge improvement over the flirtatious comedic wannabe I dealt with at the last hibachi place I went to, which will remain nameless. The drink I ordered was delicious and based on the samplings I had from my family's meals, the hibachi orders were perfect - the meat was tender and juicy and everything was seasoned for flavoring and cooked just the way everyone wanted them. But like I said, the meal wasn't spot on. My sushi, the Hawaiian roll, was ok, although I wish there had been more tempura evenly distributed throughout it. Our waitress actually messed up part of my order - I got a plate of salmon roll instead of the salmon cake, but I had waited long enough for my food while watching my family's hibachi being made that I didn't feel like complaining about it and sending it back. (On that note, if you come as a group, know that hibachi and normal orders never arrive anywhere near the same time. Order appetizers if you don't want to sit at the table drooling as your friends or family's dinner cooks in front of you.)  I've definitely never had an outright bad experience at Nakama and the food has always been tasty enough, particularly the hibachi - but honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here and it'll probably be another year or two before I stop by again. And while Nakama hasn't completely and utterly disappointed me, it just haven't \"wowed\" me yet, either."}
{"text":"Nakama might be a little pricy, but it's well worth the cost. I recommend incorporating the seared Ahi tuna into your selection. It melts in your mouth! The atmosphere is lively, but still conducive to conversation.  The Hanalei Roll, a tempura flash fried sushi roll, is my very favorite sushi roll.   The cocktails are tasty and extremely strong. The Slush Puppie Martini is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I like the Hibachi experience, and I don't eat seafood. That being said, it is a little overpriced for the quality of the food. I have gone a few times. I like that they give veteran's a meal for free on veteran's day."}
{"text":"Just ok. It's the same hibachi you can get anywhere else except more expensive. My chicken was over cooked, and the shrimp was chewy. The fried rice is delicious, and so are the martinis."}
{"text":"Aside from the Southside ambiance and the bar, there is nothing more here to see than an overtly OVER-priced,  UNDER-quality Japanese fair.  Sushi \"chef\"s were laughable (being taught as they made my dishes... really? for a 30$ dish???), service was slow, having to remind the waitress over and over for even a glass of water... and the quality of the dishes mediocre.  Unless you are offering to spend at least double the amount worthy of the actual value of food and service, I would highly discourage anyone from visiting this establishment.  If you are looking for a classy, Japanese restaurant with a bar, I would go to UMI - SOBA on Ellesworth St. in Shadyside."}
{"text":"That Baked Alaskan roll though....what it does to my mouth, mmmmm  Nakama is smack dab in the middle of the action known as Carson Street. It's a good spot for dinner before going out or to celebrate something special, unless you're looking for someplace quiet.  The drinks here are delish and while the habichi is ok, the sushi is AMAZING. If habachi isn't your thing, you can opt for a table or sit at the bar. The servers and bartenders are very friendly adding to the overall experience.   Valet parking is offered on the weekends.  Finding a spot to park along the street during the week on the evenings is fairly easy.   Dine solo or with friends and Nakama has all the makings for a good time."}
{"text":"Jalepeno margarita was tasty but weaker than the faclcon's defense in the last quarter of the super bowl. Rolls were tasty but lacking in the filling and were limp...err soggy? I can't say anything about the hibachi as I sat closer to the bar area. This is a pass for sure."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but prices were outrageous. Customer service is not good. First, they do not have a spicy salmon roll and if I wanted spicy salmon I had to get the sauce on the side for an extra 75 cents, did I mention we spent over 175$? come on! I felt I was nickle-dimed to death.  Then came the vegetables, none of the kids meals come with vegetables or noodles and their kids dinners are the same price (or more) than the other hibachi places in the area.   I had to pay extra 4 dollars for vegetables.  Come on we are in the burbs we feed our kids vegetables.  They need to work on their pricing and market research for their new location. Waiters need some help too they did not know the menu and could not provide much help making selections.  May try again in a few months but that was a lot of money for a not very good experience."}
{"text":"Good sushi and sashimi. Miso soup was just ok. The Uni was delicious. The row with quail eggs was lacking some flavor. It's medium all the way around not great not bad. I loved the Carson St atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite Hibachi restaurant. Workers are wonderful. Luke is THE BEST!!! Amazing chef and Fantastic with kids!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is inconsistent. I've had bad sushi here several times. Habachi is very good, but on the pricier side"}
{"text":"This used to be Miyako. I was devastated when I heard Nakama bought them out but learned that they have the same employees on staff. To be honest, I dislike the Nakama in the south side but love this location. This Nakama in Wexford is the only Hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh I will go to. Their fried rice, shrimp sauce, everything is so delicious. It's better than the hibachi restaurant I visited in Kobe, Japan. I normally only get hibachi there."}
{"text":"I am currently at my table and just couldn't wait to rave about my experience here!!! We came during happy hour and had excellent deals on drinks and apps! We got an array of sushi as well, my favorite being the Crunchy Philly.. and that's coming from someone who isn't much of a sushi eater!   Everyone was also very happy with their martinis and they have a wide range of selections to satisfy any craving! Our server, Marissa was so sweet and very attentive to us! Our drinks never went dry and she was more than excellent.   We all enjoyed our experience here immensely! Thanks Marissa!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Very unique rolls and large portion size.  It can get really crowded on the weekend, so call ahead."}
{"text":"I set up a reservation through open table for a Sunday evening. I specified that it was my sons birthday when I reserved. Arrived at Nakama and made sure the hostess knew it was my sons birthday. She asked if I wanted the pineapple or ice cream. I told her the ice cream. After eating a very mediocre dinner (saga is much better and a more reasonable price) we received our check. No ice cream and no recognition of my son's birthday. The chef even asked us if we had any birthdays and we told him yes! My husband chases after the waitress explaining that it was my sons birthday (4th time they were told). She arrives with the gong and no ice cream. Seriously don't even make an effort to celebrate a birthday if we have to beg for it. I will NEVER come back. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. Soap dispenser ripped off the wall, paper products all over the floor, mildew around faucet and a bathroom attendant standing outside greeting you as you walk in a bathroom that is far worse than a convenience store. This place has had it's run and is done. Absolutely disgusting! And I have never given a review on here before. I can't help but to feel compelled to do so!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Great Wine selection, had the 1997 Cake Bread Cabernet.  I would highly recommend this place if you want great food and great vibe."}
{"text":"Better than Bennihanna and Shogun. A little more expensive but less filler and more protein. The Filet & Shrimp combo was perfect. Our server Rae was prompt and very mindful. 4 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Honestly nothing special compared to other hibachi places. The most recent time I went I had to ask for a box twice, sat and waited for awhile when everyone else in my party left, still didn't receive the box after the waiter visited the table next to me two more times to suck up while delivering the checks, so finally got up and left. I probably won't be back - just not worth how average it is."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite sushi & sashimi bar in Pittsburgh but it seems the quality & service are travelling down hill, or at least they were last night.  We went here for my birthday and were greeted by the hostess with a blank stare.  She didn't say anything...  Nothing...  So I said, 'Hi, we'd like a teppanyaki table', to which she responded with another blank stare.  Then I said 'Hibachi...' and she woke up and said, 'That'll be at least 15-20 minutes or so...' and then went back to her blank stare.  Nothing like, 'Would you like to grab seats at the bar? Start your meal off with a drink? How about a sushi roll while you wait...' nothing...  So I said, 'Ok, we'll wait...' and seated ourselves at the sushi bar.  It took at least 5 minutes for the actual waitress to appear and it seemed like it was a chore for her to get us a couple glasses of water.  She didn't offer any help picking out rolls or sushi so we were on our own.  We settled on a 'Steeler Roll' for $14.  Looking around at the closest hibachi table to us, I could see 6 people seated and 2 empty seats.  I figured they were waiting for someone- turned out they weren't.  I also assumed that maybe they had ordered already- they hadn't.  Had they ordered drinks already maybe- Nope...  It was obvious that the hostess just wanted to be ignorant and make us wait for another table.  Ok, fine.  She doesn't get tipped anyway.  So our roll arrives and we start in on it.  It tastes pretty good but the eel that we so love is being lost in the quantity of rice surrounding it.  It even had trouble staying together.  Then the hostess comes over and says 'Are you ready...?' to which I look at her, then at the roll, and say, 'We'll need a few minutes...'  On to the teppanyaki table...  The restaurant was super loud because I think there was an 'End of the Season Pittsburgh Steeler party' in the back room and they were making all kinds of commotion so I can't fault the waiter on how hard it was for all of us to hear him.  Oh, by the way- our table was only half full when they started service.  There was my wife & I and another couple.  Maybe they were trying to get us in & out quickly, I don't know...  Our waiter started to take our orders and I heard him offer the couple next to us, 'Would you like to upgrade your white rice for fried for an additional charge?' and they both said no.  Looking in the menu, I see that a side of fried rice without any purchase is $3.29 so when it came time for us to order, he offered the same thing and I asked him how much the 'upcharge' was.  $3.29 was his response.  Why wouldn't he just ask if we'd like an additional side of fried rice for $3.29 instead of making it sound like you were getting a better deal by declining the white rice in favor of fried for $3.29???  Stuff like this really bothers me so I told him, 'I would like fried rice but I also want the steamed rice I'm already paying for...' to which he says, 'Fine with me man, I don't care how much rice I bring out...'  Nice customer service...  Anyway, we ended up with the only American teppanyaki chef in the entire place, and he was just getting over bronchitis or something because he barely spoke and when he did, it was in a very low tone.  Don't get me wrong- he was a very nice guy...  My wife had ordered the Bob's Triple Combo (Strip steak, Chicken & Shrimp) and I ordered the Chef's Choice (Strip steak & Chicken).  They were both delicious and aside from the service issues, we had a very nice meal.    We both agreed though- next time we're going out for sushi- we're going to Sake at South Side Works.  The chefs are much friendlier, the fish is fresher and the prices are much more reasonable (Half price on Sunday's & Monday's)"}
{"text":"I've had a lot is sushi in my life. Being thai and Laotian, I've eaten a lot of raw \"protein\" dishes. Sushi was Not fishy at all here. Pretty impressed with that. Fishy ness is not necessarily a bad thing (in asian cuisine that is) but when u can't even smell it here...it says something."}
{"text":"Nakama in Southside is great. Nakama Express in Greentree is not good. The staff there is disrespectful and lazy. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I love Nakama- have been going there every now and then for years. Sushi is great, hibachi is good as well. However, last night I decided to order a healthier version of my meal. I asked they could cook it without butter and with double vegetables, no rice.  (a simple request that most Hibachi restaurants are OK with). A few minutes after I ordered, the manager came out to ask me if I was allergic to butter- I said no just watching what I eat. He told me that if they busier, they would not be able to make my requested meal but if they were busy, they would not be able to make it. He wanted to make sure I knew in case I wanted to order again. While he was very nice about it, I found it troublesome that a restaurant that cooks everything fresh will not customize a meal while busy. Not a huge deal overall, but still would not come here if you are trying to be health-cautious."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was not super impressed by this place at all. I have been wanting to try Nakama since I moved to Pittsburgh in 2011, but I never got around to going. My overall impression is that this place is spectacularly average, and extremely overpriced. Dishes range from $30-$40 on average, unless you order the Kobe Steak dish, which is a whopping $70. Wow. I went on a Sunday night, so it was not crowded or loud as I'm sure it is on weekends, being in such a prime location on the south side. We were seated right away and our server was polite, friendly and fast. No problems there.   We got a sushi appetizer that was delicious and fresh, but it was pretty expensive for the quantity. I have had good sushi for cheaper, and this became the theme of the night: \"it's good, but why is it so expensive?\" I did not find, as other reviewers have said, that this was the best sushi in the city. It was very good. It was high quality, but it was not the best, and it was expensive.   I ordered the tuna steak hibachi, and my boyfriend ordered a spicy steak hibachi dish. Hibachi orders at this place include the typical salad and miso soup, as well as an appetizer of either mushrooms or shrimp. I will say that the miso soup was the best I have ever had a joint like this. It was flavorful and had more mushrooms than usual. The salad was typical. The shrimp appetizer consists of 3 small pieces of shrimp. While I greatly appreciated the extra snack, this addition does not really justify the price difference between this and other hibachi places.   Our chef was perfectly capable, but not fun or talkative at all. Maybe it's not considered classy or upscale, but I like to have fun when I go to a place like this, and I appreciate chefs who make jokes, get creative, and talk to us while they're cooking. Our chef made good food, but he barely talked at all, and didn't really do anything exciting. He did the onion tower, but that's about it.   The food was good, but nothing spectacular. My favorite thing was my boyfriend's spicy dish, because it came with these really delicious thick noodles. The spicy sauce is a creamy orange sauce that still has a lot of kick. It was delicious, actually. I wish I ordered that. The tuna steak was fine, but nothing to write home about.   Overall, my experience was perfectly fine at this place, but when I pay this much for a meal I expect more than just an acceptable experience. There are plenty of places in and around the city where you can get similar meals for much cheaper. I probably won't go here again."}
{"text":"Working on the Southside, I have been visiting Nakama 1-3 times per year since it opened. This place has definitely gone downhill. I probably would have given 4 stars when it first opened but not now. Food and service was not great at all. Probably won't go back unless I have to for some work-related function."}
{"text":"Owners have very bad attitudes and customer service skills. Waitress was lazy and didnt look like she wanted to be there. Our food was overcooked . I wouldn't recommend eating here when they're better Asian cuisine and other restaurants on East Carson."}
{"text":"Guess what - uni is in season!!!  And Nakama is one of the few places we were able to find it.  We came at a weird time (too late for lunch and too early for dinner) but we were just coming really for the uni so we sat at the sushi bar.  Sushi is fresh and amazing!!  I have been craving sushi for the past few weeks and Nakama served up exactly what I wanted.  Our server was great - food delicious - wine was refreshing.  Everything was perfect - so left very happy and will be back"}
{"text":"My friend suggested me to come here for sushi and I was not impressed at all. They're sushi was very mediocre and it did not taste anything special just like a regular sushi roll that you can get from a grocery shop"}
{"text":"We came in, sat at the bar and proceeded to have a delightful time filled with delicious sushi rolls and nigiri. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"We were there for lunch today and it was ok.  We probably won't go there again though.  The food was average.  The cleanliness was below average.  We ate at the hibachi table and even though there were 8 seats at the table, the hostess sat my hubby and I right up next to the only other couple at the table.  I assumed she was planning on filling up the whole table but once that didn't happen, I felt rude to move.  No big deal really.  They brought out water, soup, and salad and I heard the guy at our table say there was a hair sticking out of his water glass.  The cooktop had plenty of small pieces of food from the people before us but I figured the chef would clean it better before he cooked.  Well, he did wipe the very center but the old food remained.  I really tried to not watch after that.  The food was average.  We didn't have chopsticks at our table which was disappointing.  I'm sure they had them somewhere and I didn't ask so that's my own fault.  I just expect them to be on the table at Japanese restaurants.  Lunch prices were good.  Ill probably stick to my favorites though...Pho Van in the Strip and Mekong in Dormont."}
{"text":"Cherry blossom sushi roll. Need I say anymore?! Well besides the edamame with Siracha and miso soup.. I just can't get enough sushi from the place. I have no complaints about the hibachi but I find myself at nakama strictly for my cherry blossom roll. Mmm. Sushi. Oh and sake bombs. God bless the sake bombs..."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times when in town for work.  The place is a bit of meat market at times, but very entertaining.  It reminds me a lot of Ra Sushi.  I have only had the sushi and rolls, but the portions are enormous.  The quality is decent as well.  Drinks are okay, but I would skip any of the specialty cocktails.  Go with the sake bombs (sapporo and saki).  Late night is fun, as this is a place to be seen."}
{"text":"Quality of edible product: not good Quality of service: not good Environment: very loud in front room, dead fish in bowl behind sushi bar  I would never eat here again unless they were taken over by new ownership.  And then they would get one chance."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious. I was nervous because it only had three stars but man was I in for a surprise. Great food, clean atmosphere, and very nice bartender! So happy my wife and I gave it a chance!"}
{"text":"Seated our large group within minutes even though we didn't have a reservation, food was hot and delicious, they actually had vegan choices for their specialty rolls! Hibachi chef was a gentleman and did a good performance and was a great cook. Service was fast and polite. The magic tricks in the lobby while we waited was a plus :) Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Best hibachi in Pittsburgh! The quality of the lobster and steak were melt in your mouth. Plus cooked to perfection! Very accommodating with gluten allergy."}
{"text":"OK so June 17,2016 I went on a date with my girlfriend.  She chose this restaurant she never been there before.  So we get there and we have my vehicle valet parking.  We eat then we get the check not only did the server try to over charge for my meal heal sat in my face and told me that I asked for my meal to be separately rang up.  Why would I do that an it would cost more?  But any who then we go out to get my vehicle and it takes about ten minutes for him to come back with it. Now today I get a parking ticket in the mail talking about a parking violation!  But how I ask?  I don't know but guess who won't be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"I am going to give this place a bump in its reviews because I feel as though it's deserving. We came here on a Sunday night and we're greeted promptly. We sat near the Carson street side windows (great for people watching).   Our server was very friendly and had suggestions for us when we asked. He was quick and didn't miss a thing on our order. I noticed the busser was working extremely hard as well! Every-time we finished a dish they were walking by to grab it which was nice.   Sushi was good. They could improve on the quality and portions but overall pretty good. Make your own opinions but I would take the bad reviews with a grain of salt. I find most people usually only review when upset... food for thought. I had a good experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Never coming back :( I've given this place so many chances. I remember years ago when the sushi and service was great, now the only good thing about it here is there hot food. If you go here, they have very tasty lunch entrees, that's it, and be ready for iffy service. I went last week and sat at the bar in clear view of the bartender who was too busy playing on his phone to greet me. I got a sashimi platter and boston roll. I ate two pieces of sashimi, the second bite I had to spit into a napkin, I couldn't bring myself to swallow it. The boston roll was okay, but not very cool. Even the sashimi was above room temp and very fishy and just bad. I'm a service industry employee myself, you have to be pretty shitty for me to give a bad review....it was that bad, sorry bout it :("}
{"text":"As far as the sushi goes, I'll have to pass from here on out. I can never understand why this place is so packed as it is when I pass it sometimes. Oh, I know why. Because people are clueless. Yes, that's it. (And it has a good location.)"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls in a chic atmosphere! Very fresh ingredients and creative combinations. Reasonably priced drinks, too. Definitely a good local pick."}
{"text":"I went there with my son because he really wanted to go.  He loves sushi and is always excited about flying food, so what better place to go, right?  And it's always packed, which means it must be good, right?   Overall I'd say wrong.  The sushi was about the same quality that I get at Giant Eagle.  You know the kind... \"I'm really jonesin for some sushi, but I guess I'll take the old salmon stuck on top of crunchy cold rice because I'm too lazy to put my ass in the car and drive to Sushi Kim or some other real sushi bar.\"  The hibachi: Quality level on par with Benihana.  Enough said.  It reminds me of what a chef friend of mine said about the Spaghetti warehouse one day: \"Fancy Ragu\".  The hibachi was fancy canned chop suey.  Oh, and the price.  One adult and one 14 year old lunch (2 small plates of sushi and 2 hibachi lunches) $80.00.  Someone hand me the Astroglide.  Quick.  I've been sampling these kinds of establishments on both coasts for the past 15 years, from Vancouver BC to San Diego, from Miami to Boston.  For what they charge, the quality should be much better and the staff should TRY to smile once in a while.  Sorry, honey, but tight skirt and 17 layers of makeup can't hide a mean heart.  Here ends the rant prescribed by this reviewer for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about coming here after reading all of the awful reviews, but have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the food once I got there. I had the standard sesame chicken hibachi dinner and everything I ate was excellent - the ginger salad dressing was really tasty, onion soup was just OK, and all of my hibachi food - shrimp appetizer, chicken, veggies and fried rice was really very good. Everything was very flavorful without being overly salty.   Our server was attentive and friendly, even when we had an issue with a watery mojito that one of my friends ordered, she rectified the situation immediately and gave her another drink without hesitation.   While the food and service was good here I just cant get over how stupidly expensive this place is. I wouldn't even think about getting sushi here at their prices - 15.00 for a dragon roll? Come on! Even the hibachi dinners are over priced. I won't be making frequent trips here just simply due to price. 33.00 for ONE person for ONE dinner and a beer? Just a little too steep for me."}
{"text":"Read previous reviews and people seems like love or hate this place. But we still decide to give it a try just because of it is located in the heart of southside and it would against logic that it serves the worst sushi. It was a Sunday night and we were able to grab a seat very quickly. We ordered seaweed salad, tuna poke, Unami sashimi, rainbow roll and Hawaii style roll. I have to say I am glad we gave this place a chance. The seaweed salad could be better but it certainly didn't taste bad tho. Just compare to everything else it was just average. But of course Everything else tasted great! The reason I am giving it a four star not five are service and sanitary.   Service, the waitress refilled my water once and then just didn't think I might need another refill. Drank the last drop of my water, not happy with this. Sanitary, saw a huge fly on the window(thank god not on our table or even food). I'm guessing it might just got in since the door was open and we sat at the high table area which is kind close to the door.  So over all, some miner change will put this place to a five star sushi place."}
{"text":"My second time to Nakama left a lasting impression enough for me not to ever come back. I ordered the shrimp and chicken during the lunch hour and it wasn't good. I couldn't even finish, or get all of the side dishes. I was gonna take it home for the dogs but they wouldn't have eaten it either. I had a friend pay for me but I felt so bad she wasted her money on that shitty meal. Also, take a look at the cleanliness. Or lack there of. A lot of work needs to be done or just shut it down altogether!!"}
{"text":"Nakama tries to be very trendy, but I have experienced much better sushi for a better price.  Still, the sushi is better than many people claim.  I had very good service here.  And there is some great people watching.  But we have much better choices for Japanese food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"everybody knows this place and it's an upscale destination for a night out.  whether hibachi, sushi, or bar crowd, you're bound to find what you came for.  is it the best sushi in the world?  nah, good but overrated.  but.... that's not really the sale here.  the sale is the atmosphere and in that sense, it usually delivers."}
{"text":"So I was recently in town as part of that annual convention involving tails and ears (If you're from Pittsburgh I'm sure you know what I'm talking about!)  Anyways, my friends and I decided to give this place a go on the last night as a final hurrah. Folks who had been dealing for the convention were running late getting their trucks packed up so we didn't even get to the restaurant until after 9:30 PM.  We called and asked if they would still do the hibachi grill for our party and they were very welcoming of us and said sure, absolutely! So despite getting there so late we all got treated to a fabulous meal and a fun show, we're all thankful not just to Nakama but to the whole city of Pittsburgh for welcoming us to their city every year!  On to the food, I tried their Diablo Seafood hibachi which was shrimp and scallops cooked up with udon noodles in a spicy sauce. It was very unique from the other hibachi meals due to the noodles and spicy sauce so my order had to be cooked last but it was more than worth it. Everything was delicious, the spicy sauce actually makes you sweat a little bit but certainly is not over powering. My girlfriend had some hibachi steak and, well, any time you got a beautiful cut of meat cooked up right in front of you like that you just know it's going to melt in your mouth.  Everything was great, we're already talking about coming back to Nakama next year, hopefully at a much earlier time in the day though. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Manager refused to take a coupon, said that there is nowhere to accept it through the register. Pretty sad to be honest. Will not return."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite hibachi place. I have never had a bad experience here and I've been eating here for years. I'm always confident I'll have great food and great service.  I have been to several hibachi restaurants, Nakama has he BEST food by far, as well as the best service."}
{"text":"I like Nakama, but you need to be ready for more of a bar / party type experience.  The hibachi is good.  The food is good.  It really comes down to the chefs.  They have a couple chefs that put on a crazy good show.  If you get one of them, you are in luck.  They each seem to have their quirks.  It isn't the typical show of a little bit of flame and a shrimp tail in the hat.  The sushi bar and regular bar are where Nakama really shines.  Nakama has a great bar scene and good sushi.  The sushi isn't the best in the city, but it is well done.  The fish to rice ratio is great and they have a diverse selection of pretty sushi rolls for people who want to go beyond your standard single fish product and rice.  I'd strongly recommend Nakama if you want some good sushi and drinks in a upscale busy bar environment.  If you are looking for an 'authentic' sushi / hibachi experience, this is not the place.  Nakama fits the Southside scene.  You hit Nakama before a club or party bar."}
{"text":"Food here has finally gotten to the level of the service. Fish used in the Sushi is of low quality and is no longer worthy of eating. Service at the bar in the daytime is very lacking.   The bartenders act like they are doing you a favor by waiting on you. Oh almost forgot to mention... The still have Oktoberfest beer on tap in mid December. The beer is from August. Throw it away and put a Xmas beer there. Or wait till may to do that...  Another case of the owners just milking the gravy of what they built. Can't blame them I guess. Place was really good 8 years ago when it had to be.  Update... 1/1/16  Had to meet a client there today. Black curly haired bartender acted like she was doing us a favor by giving us a menu.   SHE WAS RUDE AND IGNORANT!!! For zero reason. Just plain mean. If she is not an owner or related to them then she must have pictures of the owner in a compromising position. Otherwise who would want her in a service industry position.   She gave me a menu that looked like it was out in the rain for 3 days. Was really ignorant about it too. I just suggested we go somewhere much more worthy of our money so we left. But not before I apologized to her for being a bother by simply sitting down at the bar she was working.   Although I work on the south side and love sushi, I will never go back into this place. Zero management I guess. Sad..."}
{"text":"Anyone with a brain will instantly recognize that this place is not about the food AT ALL. It's about its function on the South Side; the Dream House for all the Ken and Barbie types. You will find Pittsburgh guido / yinzer OAFS eagerly paying through the hose for over-priced meat in hopes of wooing one of the many ex-sorority, Louis Vuitton bag hag bar WENCHES. For the poor OAFS who slobber over these WENCHES with their wallets, this watering hole is their surest spot to buy tuna. As for the WENCHES; it is the perfect place to parade the whitest teeth, highest heels, and blondest roots. This restaurant is the pole-dancing embodiment of what your average black and gold bleedin' yinzer believes to be upscale. Case in point, a hand-soap-offering attendant in the men's restroom; truly ridiculous........... just smacks of a naive pretentiousness that only the provincial mind-set of a South Side bar-barian would find 'classy'. I guess I'm not one for 'classy' restaurants anyway; they are always way too tacky."}
{"text":"While the food was OKAY - I would say I prefer the taste and overall experience of Saga better..   The waiter forgot to cook one of the kids meal - so the 9yo had to sit and wait for her food while the rest of the table ate  The kids menu should truly be a kids menu - you can't give a 6yo and 9yo the same portion as the adults!    The meals were over priced and certainly more salty than any other hibatchi place I've been to.  With all that being said I will likely not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a pretty slow Saturday night for dinner and it doesn't have the same feel as the south side location.  The older bartender with long brown hair never cracked a smile or acknowledged us- she had a general harsh persona about her and made us feel unwelcome. Another diner that was sitting at a table behind us asked her for a refill on his water and she rudely told him that he would have to wait for his server to get him water. Finally, a friendly, younger blonde bartender took our drink and dinner orders.  She was very nice and attentive and was happy to have a tab since the other staff members were complaining, rather loudly, about how slow it's been for them- and I guess that equates to lack of tips. I don't need to hear that while I'm out out trying to enjoy my evening out with my husband.  The food was good but the general atmosphere of the bar area was just uninviting. The prices are a bit overinflated for their sushi compared to other places in the area.  I think Ichiban has a much better atmosphere and better service."}
{"text":"I could live off of their spicy steak diablo.....truly something that sets them above and beyond all other hibachi restaurants!!!! The decor is great and the food is amazing. Like I said, better than all other hibachi. It's hard to mess hibachi up in my opinion, but Nakama is so good it makes every other place I've tried seem mediocre. The steak is always cooked to perfect as per how you request, the service is always fast, friendly, and entertaining, even when they're packed busy. The sushi is soooo fresh and again, some of the best that I've had. They honor their reservations well also, and we've never had a problem with having to wait or a scheduling error. They really do what they do very very well."}
{"text":"Total bad experience..Rude waitress + average food. Sharing food is a strict no. Walked out of there as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I have read all the negative reviews but I can't offer one. I really enjoyed our last visit. We made a reservation on open table for a Sunday afternoon. We were the first ones through the door. We have only been to the South Side Location.  The restaurant was clean and ready for the day. The staff was friendly and accommodating to our special occasion. It was a Birthday celebration.   I really enjoyed the Hibachi and Loved the sushi. I always order chicken or salmon Hibachi and I try to always get a Philadelphia Inside out roll.  Everything was fresh and prepared to our liking. Hibachi is always great, because you can see what is being made right in front of you.  I am looking forward to finding the food truck!     We received a free appetizer that day, go on the website and give them a little information and they will send you a email for a free appetizer.  Highly recommend for Hibachi Lovers like myself."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience at Nakama. I walked in with a group of 30 - 35 people and asked to be sat at the sushi bar. I was disappointed with the hostess when she told me  the sushi bar does not have that many seats. I suspected she was lying to me because at least two of the members of my group were black. So i asked if they could accommodate two, me and my piece. They happily said yes and informed us it was all self seating. I was genuinely surprised by the lack of Asian servers. Most of the servers were white. When the server came of i snidely requested a glass of their most expensive champagne, only to throw a hissy fit when I found out the brand was not one I enjoyed. I honestly had no idea of the names this was all in an attempt to seem pretentious and impress my piece I was with. After I got done humiliating the server I asked her for \"just a water, with extra lemons on the side\". I also asked for some obscure sweetener I knew they did not have. I rolled my eyes and said sweet n low will do. The sushi menu was archaic. There were no pictures of anything. It didn't help that the sushi bar has all the raw  fish and everything they use in their rolls in a glass case right in front of you at the bar. I was very upset when i couldn't find totinos pizza rolls on the menu, so I went with a crunchy Philly roll. I had no idea what to expect because as I said, there were no pictures. The sushi chef handed me my food directly as to intimidate me. I took it without flinching. The ho i was with seemed very pleased with her order. I on the other hand immediately told the server that wasn't what I ordered. I asked her what was in it and she began to list the ingredients, including uncooked salmon. I then began listing a number of diseases and sickness' you can obtain from eating raw sea food. I demanded she take it back and just get me a side of fries. Go figure, they didn't have french fries. So I ordered a well done filet and asked for ketchup, which they also didn't have. I explained to her that the Heinz ketchup factory was right across the bridge I was completely baffles as to how they did not have ketchup. Nevertheless, my steak was quite good and my partner enjoyed her meal so much that I scored so hard later that night, after 4 hours of heavy drinking followed by 10 minutes of me insisting to my piece I was fine to drive home. Overall Nakama was a great experience and I tipped my server $40,000."}
{"text":"The events that took place yesterday afternoon at Nakama leave me ultimatley confused and extremely saddened. I no longer live in Pittsburgh, but it is still the place I consider home. What do you do when you come home to visit? You visit loved ones, celebrate birthdays, weddings, graduations, and you eat all of your favorite spots! I joked with friends, \"I CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO NAKAMA\"! Well never shall I step foot in that place again. I have celebrated birthdays, friends birthdays, celebrations, heck my family even took my GRANDMA there for her 91st birthday this past December! I've have birthday celebrations there with over 50 people! Long story short over the course of goodness 5+ years I have been a patron of Nakama. For Pittsburgh, this once was a place that was sort of a staple for the community. You take your friends from out of town there...It was simply thee place to meet a friend for a quick drink and appetizer, or for me a sports girl, even dine at the window and watch a game or two...NOT ANYMORE! Frankly once management changed and the playing cards came off the ceiling the service and FOOD was never the same! I'm not making this up, but I have seriously gotten sick several times, yet my simple behind would still go back because \"its Nakama\", \"it's my FAV\"! Even yesterday before we left SkyBar a friend reminded me, \"Girl last time you went there before you moved to NYC, you got sick!\" I was like OMG, you're right! Yet me and 7 other friends happily marched down to Nakama because we wanted to do an impromptu following of tradition a CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY, quickly at the bar. We sat down ordered food and drinks, everything was fine... A manager comes over and says to my friend whose birthday it was... (of course he ruined her bday) you need to cover up we have a strict dress code. Now mind you my friend next to me had the same sheer sleeveless version over her bikini...My friend who the manager chose to point out, her cover up was long sleeve, floor length.. and she had on shorts. Why he chose to single out one girl and not the other puzzling if you catch my drift. Mind you..... our other friend had another cover up on who in my opinion was more scandalous than both of those put together! Anywho, we say okay, cool, she holds her cover closed and he walks away. By this time all drink and dinner orders had been placed and we saw another friend who thought we were still at SkyBar walk past the Nakama window, so my friend who had just been yelled at runs out to get her. Our friend who was just arriving has on a bikini top but BEFORE WALKING INTO NAKAMA SHE PUTS ON A SHIRT! My birthday friend comes in and sits down and the manager storms back over and begins yelling. He said something like I told you, you cant wear that in here and you will be asked to leave... Some people's food had actually begin to come out, so they are like huh?! We are eating?! He gets louder and louder... we were like look... she has buttons it's buttoned... Mind you we are at the bar...Seated! No one can really even tell what the heck you have on! We weren't in the dining room we were at the bar! And to top it off, it wasn't even busy! Other patrons were watching and making comments, after the discussion with the manager escalated because he was NOT being reasonable -he then told us to get out!? WHAT?!HUH?! I guess the customer isn't always right... They just lost hundreds of dollars over a bathing suit cover up (see picture) Other patrons were disgusted actually telling us sorry, that was rude and disgusting. I woke up this morning to a long post from a women saying how what she witnessed how it was degrading and uncalled for. Here's the best part my friend sat there to finish her water and the manager called the police! The Pittsburgh Police !They spoke2 the manager inside and then came out to speak to us and frankly, the cops thought it was a joke also. They said they aren't they dress code police they are the real police. This manager took time out of the cops day when they could have actually been needed elsewhere to whine about some swimsuit coverups! What a joke. I miss the old Nakama not this stuck up, stuffy one, with lying managers and clearly some personal problem with race... He clearly singled out my black friend and said nothing to my white friend and for what?!Why?! We were just coming there to do what we always do year after year celebrate a birthday! I had a flight back to NYC that night but I was willing to risk missing my flight just to eat a little bit of Nakama. Due to a flight change I ended up not even having time to eat because I missed my dinner opportunity due to an incompetent managers stupidity. Dear Nakama, my old friend who is fake and clearly has changed, you won't get another cent from me and all of my family and friends! Just how a random strangers post was able to make it to me on Facebook only hours later, she won't be returning nor will her friends! PGH is small so we will all continue to talk!"}
{"text":"Pricey and overrated. Food isn't bad but not anything special..I've had better at Benihana. Sushi is pretty good. The people who cook in front of you are always pretty friendly though which definitely improves the overall experience."}
{"text":"When they first opened the food was great. We would go at least once a month. In the last year or two the quality has gone down. The portions have gone down and the $$ has gone up. Also the consistency in the food has dropped.  Used to be our favorite place, now it doesn't come up when we talk about going to eat."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to go to Nakama yesterday for some hibachi lunch. I have been here many times before, but this is the first I will write about it. We were seated immediately at one of the tables. There was a group of 5 already seated at the table we were seated at with their drinks already in hand and ready to order. We felt a bit rushed because they were ready to order and we just sat down. My girlfriend ordered the Spicy California Roll as an app. She said it was \"ok\".... Nothing special. ... But in their defense she also said it's a pretty plain roll. I got the Bobs Triple Combination with steak, shrimp, and chicken, while she got the Hibachi Shrimp. After she was eating the roll, the server came over and said \"so, is the roll repulsive?!\". To which my girlfriend responded \"yeah, it's disgusting\". It was just completely awkward. He didn't know if she was serious.. I did, and gave him the ok nod. It was just weird. I had some captain and cokes, she had a few Rieslings... The cook was great, the food was tasty as always. I do think he put a but too much salt in it, but it was still great. Our tab after tip was $121.00   All in all, an ok experience. If it wasn't for the awkward comment from the waiter, it would have been a 4 star.. I do love me Hibachi and it's the closest place to me, so I am sure I will be back. I do prefer Sapporo out on 60 because it is a family run business and you are always treated greatly..."}
{"text":"I think my bartender was having a bad day.  I have been to Nakama a few times.   I usually meet to discuss business.   This was my least favorite experience at Nakama.    The food was pretty good.     I just cannot get over the service.  The bartender was short and gave the impression we were putting her out when she took our order.   I agree with some other reviews where the place is not the same when I originally moved here.    I will get my hibachi / sushi fix elsewhere.   There are plenty of options on Carson.  What a shame :-("}
{"text":"We flew into Pittsburgh for two days for a penguins playoff game...I don't know why this place has three stars...we were in Pittsburgh for two nights and ended up here for dinner after bar hopping all day.  We got some appetizers and I had teriyaki chicken skewers and chicken with rice.  Drinks were extra strong, but not too much to the point of not being drinkable, just generously poured.   We had a great time here and would absolutely return on our next trip."}
{"text":"We ordered three different sushis and found them all lackluster. I think the main problem was the rice--rubbery and not enough vinegar. The service was nothing to rave about, although the rolls did come out fast.  For the price, I would rather go elsewhere to get better sushi."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and have found it enjoyable every time.  I must say I have only had the sushi, so I can't comment on the hibachi.  I am surprised on all the negative and mixed reviews on here.  I have eaten a lot of sushi, in a lot of restaurants, in a lot of cities and Nakama's is legit.    The prices are very fair especially for the portions and how fresh it is...the nigiri slices and sashimi pieces are generous and so are all the rolls....nigiri (2 pieces) or sashimi (3 pieces) of white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail, eel for 5.99, salmon 4.99.....inside out rolls (8 pieces) 5.99-6.99...maki rolls (6 pieces) for 3.99-4.99....rainbow roll and specialty rolls around 11.99....this is hardly pricey considering how much you get, how fresh it is and where you're eating it at....I don't see how people had bad times here...did I just get lucky and show up on their good nights everytime?  The sushi is well presented and the service has always been good.  The location is perfect in the heart of the south side.  It's a sexy, busy atmosphere and can get loud, but it's not a big deal, sit by the window for great people watching up and down Carson St.  If you sit at the bar, you'll find it comfy and easy to eat even though it is a small place....this isn't the biggest restaurant but it's set up nicely no matter where you sit....The drinks are good too!  It's a great spot to take a date or with friends....It's the place to be feel and has a good, energetic vibe.  It's a fun, good-looking, classy crowd and I have to give it 5 stars.  Everytime I go to Nakama it's been a great sushi and dining experience all around...."}
{"text":"I love sushi. Nakama is far from my favorite, but the service was very good and the sushi is good. I'd go back if we're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Overpriced Low-Grade Sushi  The sushi at this place sucks and is extremely overpriced.  I have tried at least 10 different rolls on their menu through out the times that I have been there.  The sushi is poorly rolled and falls apart. The fish and ingredients that they use are not fresh. The service is OK.  The hibachi is also overpriced as well. The chefs are similar to what you will get any hibachi place.  Also, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to deal with a bunch of yinzer wanna be NYC trendies listening to techno bumping into you while you are trying to eat your food.   The only reason this place stays in business is due to the trendy bar scene and the lack of sushi places in the Pittsburgh area.  However, I think if a restaurant/bar similar to nobu, sushi samba, or RA sushi opened up in Pittsburgh it would blow this place out of the water."}
{"text":"My husband and I just want to give this place a try, food is ok but over priced. The chicken lunch dish have no test, the dragon roll was ok. Anyway, the food are not worth the price we paid."}
{"text":"Quick, pick another place to eat! We had a terrible first and last experience here today...   Popped in for a quick lunch before we went shopping and from the moment we walked in the red flags went up but sense it was the only place to eat in the strip mall we were at we gave it a try...  Enter restaurant and there was a Hostess seated behind a podium who looked briefly up from her phone to ask us if we wanted table or grill seating, we said table and she said \"just seat yourself in the bar\" and promptly went back to whatever was important on her phone... Silly me, I always thought that \"your job\" took precedence over your phone...  Enter bar area and sat at what appeared to be a bussed and set table... Wrong again, kind of... the table was set but you could see where the last drinks and plates were from the previous customers or many previous customers...  Waitress arrives promptly with part of the menu, didn't point out the full menu was under the napkin. Asked us if we wanted drinks and with only 20 seconds at the table we asked for a few minutes... she smiled at us and took off... about 10 minutes goes by and I had to snag her as she was flying by to, well your guess is as good as mine since there was nothing behind us... The place was NOT busy, at all... at lunch... red flags again...  My wife asked a couple of clarifying questions on her choices and the waitress really had no idea how to answer them, but they were hard questions like \"how large is the portion size?\" and \"what's the difference between the appetizer and main dish with the same name?\", those sure would have stumped me if I worked there...  Wife's salad shows up, part of the \"difference\" was the main dish came with a salad and fried rice... I ordered a California Crab Roll and didn't expect it until the wife's main course showed up... Wrong again, her cooked meal showed up 5 minutes early to the party and I assumed maybe mine was taking longer due to the complexity of assembling a Japanese style roll, in a Japanese restaurant... Wrong again, the roll was pre-made and I don't think it was actually done at the restaurant, more like from a vendor, or vending machine... But it was served graciously as the waitress literally tossed it on the table as she walked by not missing a step. Had to run her down again to get a small wasabi dish for mixing the soy and radish...  Okay, so we've thoroughly established the service is way below any reasonable expectations, actually, the service was below any expectations, even the half asleep guy at the convenience store around 3am provides better service... so on to the food, this will be short and to the point... Bland, tasteless, over priced if it were free, and as I write this I'm currently counting my blessings I'm not writing this on the toilet... Only ate two of the 8 pieces and didn't want to push my luck.  I really hate writing negative reviews but felt the need as a \"public service announcement\". There are many great places in the area this place just wasn't one of them."}
{"text":"Love the food, and had great service, but the interior needs an update. Also, my beer was warm."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place at all. I thought the food was O.K. and the service was horrible. We sat all the way in the corner behind the bar..it was so loud, service took forever, she didn't bring lemons with my water after I specifically asked for them, which I can't stand..why do they do that? What is so hard about bringing me a lemon with my water? They only offer white rice with their sushi which to me, kills the entire experience. The tofu in the miso soup was hard..we didn't even eat it. I thought this place was awful. Awful! On a side note, the salmon was $6 for 2 pieces of sushi. Really? Did the person running this restaurant think that there was a salmon shortage, that it was a rare species? Who do they think they are charging that much? Is it salmon laced with koala? BC THEN you could possibly charge $6 for it and that would make sense."}
{"text":"I know how many people seem to rave about Nakama... I really do not understand it.  As a young professional, I am offended at the lack of cheese and desperation in this place on any given weekend.  Is anyone themselves anymore?  Are people that desperate to keep up fake appearances and be someone that they are not?  That is the vibe that I get in this place.  Sorry to those who love it, but I know for certain I am not the only one who feels this way.  Sushi here is mediocre at best... I have had way better elsewhere (and I cannot believe I am going to say this- even Cleveland had many way better sushi options that Pittsburgh!- I love this city but we are lacking in options!).  If you sit at the bar or sushi bar, you will leave smelling like a Hibachi as well (wish there was something that they could do about this- if people want to stink, they would sit at the Hibachi tables I am sure).  Service is meh... I have had one great server the many times I have been there (I was forced to have work dinners there based on customer demands way too often, and one of my friends loves this place for a quick dinner so I have been here a lot).  I recommend a martini here... they at least are good.  Other drinks have seemed pretty weak.    I wish I could say better things being a resident of the Southside who prefers to stay local on weekends, but I cannot."}
{"text":"So a group of us decided to go to Nakama for dinner and my birthday. I don't know about them but my experience was not that impressive. I'm probably going to go ahead and split this up into sections.  Hostess: Before we arrived we had called to see if they had availability for 6 guests. Luckily for us they did. When we arrived we ultimately ended up sitting at the bar and I went back to let the hostess know that we didn't need the table anymore. Most hostesses I know would be more than happy to move onto the next guests waiting for a table but this hostess made sure we were ok and double checked if we really wanted to give up our table. I appreciated the gesture.  Cocktail Server: Since we decided to eat in the bar we grabbed a high top table along the window. Unfortunately this table only fit 2 guests at a time while one guests stood. We decided to make due whilst we waited for 6 seats to open up at the bar. The cocktail server made her way over to the table and we ordered soups and salads and a few plates of sushi. Service wasn't too bad with her and I can honestly say she did a great job considering how busy she was.  Bartender (Asian Guy) Before we ordered food from our server we tried to get the attention of the bartender. His attitude was pretty shitty for the most part. He honestly acted like he didn't really give a shit. And for me I take notice of everything  Since happy hour had not ended we wanted to take advantage of the $5 martinis. I ordered a Mango Tango which tasted more like fruit punch and vodka. I was a less than impressed plus he charged me the full price of 9 or 10 bucks. Learn your happy hour deals dude!   After the \"martini\" we decided to order a bottle of champagne from d check this I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in the entire establishment to order champagne.and honly had 1 champagne flute for a group of 6. One champagne flute and 5 water glasses. Are you for real? This is the epitome of ghetto. Working in the industry if you need 6 flutes you better pull 6 flutes out of your ass.   Bartender (Mark) made nakama worth going back to for his company and that's it"}
{"text":"My mom has a visual disability and was dining at Nakama. She was having a difficult time seeing in the restaurant, and then the chef lit the grill on fire in front of her, which startled her into spilling soup all over herself and the floor. It's pretty standard customer service to provide assistance in cleaning up spills, but nobody from Nakama offered to help with cleanup. When they're charging $69.99 for a strip steak, there's no excuse for the incredibly poor customer service that my mom experienced."}
{"text":"My favorite hibachi place in Pittsburgh!  Nakama combines a great experience and atmosphere with delicious food and drinks.  I have never had a bad experience here.  The salad and mushroom soup they start you off with is better than any similar types I've had at other hibachi restaurants.  I love the ginger salad dressing and the great taste of the soup.  It is a great start to a great meal.  My go to meal here is the Hibachi Chateaubrind.  It is filet seared in a garlic butter.  I order mine medium rare and it is always cooked perfectly.  Each bite literally melts in your mouth and the flavor is out of this world.  The shrimp are also a delicious side to the meal.  I also find the rice at Nakama to just taste a little better than other spots.  Always look forward to my next trip back!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is great and so is the food. I usually go with the Yakitori (teriyaki chicken skewered) for a good lunch. Hibachi and sushi are great too."}
{"text":"The sushi and hibachi are really good! I've been here a couple times and it's a nice place to have good food and some drinks"}
{"text":"They would get 5 stars because the food was good but the service was super slow. It was a Friday night and we had 3 different servers?? Two of them took our orders twice.. We had reservations at 8:00 and are just leaving now at 11:00. That's how slow. But the hibachi guy was awesome and the staff was friendly, just unorganized and incredibly snail-paced getting food out and filling water.   We went here for a friend's birthday. It was a surprise, but their policy is no seating until the entire party is there so we awkwardly had to surprise my friend sitting in separate groups at the bar lol"}
{"text":"I love to eat here during the day, but never on crowded nights or weekends when you don't get any service. The stars are for the sushi chefs of course and their attention to their customers. The waiters still suck."}
{"text":"My experience today at nakama today was amazing !! The bartender Jordan..  She was so attentive to the WHOLE bar while making everyone feel comfortable.    Such a wonderful place!?"}
{"text":"I was there with a party of 20 ppl (or so)and I can say,This is definitely the best sushi I've ever had!i really loved their apettizers too!prices are a bit higher than the rest of the hibachi places in the Pittsburgh but the quality of the meat and shrimp is upstanding so you get what you paid for!all of us were really pleased with all the selection we got!my favorite rolls were bake Alaskan(bit spicy),crunchy philly and lobster tempura!i would say that if you're cheap AF or broke DO NOT go there or if you're just gonna complaint about the high prices!as for me I don't mind paying a lil more for my food if it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Nakama is one of those places that pleases the masses. Go during happy hour, and you won't be able to hear the person next to you. The cocktail list is big and enticing, but the drinks aren't anything to write home about. Sushi is relatively good, albeit moderately overpriced. This is the type of place you go for the atmosphere, not the amazing food."}
{"text":"Industrial produced sushi with processed flavor, Nakama is great for people who do not like sushi as they heap mayonnaise and everything else on their fish to disguise its subpar quality. It's popular with drunk people who can't taste their food anyways."}
{"text":"Not highly suggested. Solid restaurant, cool atmosphere, and above average food. The lighting is insanely dark (at later hours); which makes reading hard and eye contact impossible. I have one absolute complaint: the splitting meal charge. If you and a friend split a meal, they charge $10. I think that it is all together an unnecessary charge; and even if the charge is somewhat of a requirement, ten dollars is too much. There ain't nothing wrong with some ladies wanting to split a hibachi meal.  BUT EDDY IS THE REAL OG. He works hibachi and he's an angel. That's all."}
{"text":"If you're into the whole hibachi thing and the whole doing copious amounts of sake bombs thing, Nakama can definitely be fun. But I feel like I'm kind of burned out on hibachi since you're basically paying out the ass for \"the experience.\" I have been to a couple birthday parties here and had a good time, though.  As far as the sushi bar goes, this is one of the better sushi places in Pittsburgh. The fish is pretty fresh. But I feel like it's way overpriced if you just want to come here for sushi rather than hibachi. Nakama is in no way trying to be authentic--they have a large list of special rolls and most of them contain cream cheese or crabstick (two things I dislike, which limits my options here). My favorite thing I've had here is the salmon sashimi with avocado, cucumber, wasabi tobiko, and ponzu sauce, which I tried on a recent lunch visit.  Unfortunately, once night falls the atmosphere straight-up sucks. This is the hot spot for guidos to pregame before they head to Diesel or wherever else those people hang out. The drinks are what you would expect--boring, but fruity and easy to drink. Like I said, you can have an amazing time here if you bring your whole crew and are looking to get tipsy. But if you're not in the mood for a trashy night out, stay far away!"}
{"text":"Nakama is an anomaly. In the heart of Pittsburgh's South Side you will find one of the best sushi restaurants in the US. The place is big, noisy, and a pick up scene at the bar in the evenings, but the fresh sushi and rolls are simply out of this world.   After several visits I was still baffled by how a Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh could produce the best damn sushi and rolls I'd ever had. I spoke to the Sushi Chef and he explained everything is flown in fresh daily. Then we had colleagues from San Francisco come to town and they were blown away by Nakama's. Finally we had Japanese customers in town for a week so we awkwardly asked them out to eat \"sushi in Pittsburgh!\". After the meal they said it was the best they had experienced in the US.   I can't wait to get back there soon later this year. Sometimes the ideal visit is a Sunday afternoon sitting at the bar to catch a game and enjoy the great food with a Sapporo. Either way, make this a pit stop when you are in town - you'll be blown away."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the South side location, and were delighted to have Nakama in Wexford. We went with another couple, and sat at a table for 4 (not hibachi). First,  very surprised with the prices, but we ordered dinners. The food was cold; timing of the food brought to the table was poor, but Our waitress was very good. My meal was returned to the kitchen, and the other 3 people were finished before my meal was re-delivered, and it was cold. For the pricing and quality of food does not justify the cost for the meal. I hope things will change for the better, we would enjoy returning. Thank You"}
{"text":"Few issues I've had here, typically get take out.  No plastic utensil,  got soup??? To bad.  Also they'll say 15 min and I'll get there in 15 to wait another 20 min.  Dissapointed"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great sushi! I wanted to take my friend from out of town down south side and be on the classier side of things. We strolled around and decided on nakama. We love sushi and wanted a good cocktail! How could we go wrong here? We sat at the sushi bar and were waited on quickly. Our waitress was great and attentive but not annoying. She was considerate and asked us if we wanted separate checks which I always forget to ask upfront. My friend got the nakama Cosmo which she thought had too much sour mix. I had the French kiss, it was great. Sweet and sour but not overly sweet. We then split three sushi rolls and seaweed salad. Love seaweed salad. Sweet and vinegary with a good crunch. We got the basic salmon roll, Hawaiian roll and haiku roll. They were so delicious and very fresh. Came quickly too on a very busy Saturday night. Great place to get hibachi with a group of friends or intimate for a date! Not the cheapest option for good sushi is south side but the atmosphere makes it very worthwhile!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken hibachi and the mango tango roll. The roll was really delicious. Fresh and flavorful. The hibachi, though was pretty bad. The chicken was diced super tiny and extremely overcooked which gave it a chewy texture and there was an odd chemical taste to everything. It does come with salad and soup so I was still full despite not eating much of the hibachi."}
{"text":"Went here Monday afternoon.  Not busy at all, but the server was too busy talking to her friend.   Had their sushi (Maki Nigiri), the three fishes were five stars (Tuna, salmon, yellowtail).  The spicy tuna roll was ok.  Too bad they dont have other sushi sets.  They have 2pcs per order, but sets would be nice.  Had a side order ebi (shrimp), asked the server if it was raw shrimp or cooked.  She said raw, but she was wrong.  High hope cause it was $6.99.  But no, it's not worth it.  Might try again for their Hibachi menu.  Ok with rolls... but if I really want sushi in pieces, I will go elsewhere.   Always wanted to go to Nakama but dont want to go to south side, this first experience with Nakama north was somewhat a disappointment."}
{"text":"Hibachi is mediocre but the sushi is outstanding! All of their rolls are delicious, unique, and fresh. My favorite is the Nakama Maki. Hibachi is nothing special and there was a long wait for just mediocre food."}
{"text":"Excellent Hibachi! Food Was Amazing! Fresh Fresh Fresh! Portion size was Big! Will Deff put this one on the top of my List! Very Delicious and satisfy at the right Price!"}
{"text":"Nakama has become one of our date spots. We always sit at the bar. Great beer selection and bar tenders will give recommendations. We order 3-4 rolls and leave absolutely stuffed. Favorites include the red dragon, dragon, and rainbow roll. It isn't mind blowing sushi by any means, but for a delicious almost junk food sushi experience I can recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food but you are paying for the atmosphere. Can't order sushi for take out past 5pm or somewhere around that time. Gets easily crowded and so loud you can't hear your friends talking. I go to the sushi place in the waterfront. Better prices and less crowded and free parking."}
{"text":"I find the sushi rolls to be quite good contrary to several reviewers here, though I usually put most of my efforts toward hibachi.  My favorite hibachi meal is the kobe beef.  It's pricey, but the taste is a significant experience for me because I love steak.  Note, I am getting rolls and not nigiri or sashimi (go to Umi for that!).    I have been disappointed often times with the \"performance\" of the chef.  From an entertainment perspective, I've seen better, but the most important aspect is the food and I've always had it well prepared.    The drinks are well mixed in my experience.  I even ordered the one with the glowing ice cube once, which was great, if only for the ice cube and ensuing ridicule.  They offer a limited wine selection, but there are 1 or 2 decent options by the glass.  The place is definitely packed all the time, which either makes for good people watching or is sure to annoy you -- it depends what kind of person you are.  I happen to enjoy the crowd.  The bathroom attendant is a bit much though.  Yeah, it's pricey, but you get a lot of food.  Most times everyone I'm with ends up taking some for the road."}
{"text":"I'm really at a loss for what to say. Nakama has long been one of my favorite restaurants. This has been a favorite destination for birthdays and other special occasions. I went here for lunch on my wedding day! So when I moved recently, it's been a quest to get back there again. And then today happened...      I went today, expecting a pleasant and entertaining experience. Unfortunately, I didn't get what I was expecting. I went there, expecting the full knife-tossing, food-flaming experience. Instead, I got a cook who cooked out food with his head down, barely daring to even speak with us. Half of the table's food was finished cooking before he even started the other half, leaving my friends to make the decision to eat before us or wait till their food was cold. I kept waiting for him to set our meal aflame. It's my absolute favorite thing about hibachi restaurants. But it never happened. He finished cooking in silence, cleaned the cooktop, and left.      Now, I don't want to be entirely negative. The food WAS as delicious as I expected. Out waitress was very friendly and attentive. When one friend ordered the Nakama Panda (drink) and they were out of panda mugs, she provided us with a Lucky Cat mug instead.      This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth, but I sincerely hope and expect it to be better next time I go back. And I will. One less-than-expected trip will not spoil this fantastic restaurant for me!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the twenty something see be seen crowd, this is where they mingle. My group considers this place a birthday celebratory location. Special occasion= a fire show...indeed! They have sushi and the quintessential hibachi grill chefs performing wild antics as they prepare your dinner. These guys know what they're doing and they are some of the best around. Shrimp slinging into my mouth...GOAL!  The specialty cocktails are ginormous with all the fixings, pineapple, cherries, and Hawaiian umbrellas galore. Nakama Panda anyone?  I get drunk just looking at them, yes they are too sweet and I feel like I have been transported to the magical world of the smurfs as I sip the comical bright blue drink!   Picture a night out with your friends, eight to ten of you surrounding a steel table with a wooden ledge to perch at as you are served a Nakama salad with ginger dressing and greens. The dressings are always so tart. Next a small bowl of Nakama onion soup with mushrooms. I like the Hibachi shrimp fried rice with the sauces to dip my \"shkrimps.\"  The food is common for this type of place so nothing exceptional. Entrees start at around $20. At least one person in the party has to get hibachi or no fireworks! As the meal is cooking blasts of fire warm your face as you munch and drink up the starters. At some point food will be thrown at your face!   Finally the Pi√®ce de r√©sistance, happy birthday singers with your Birthday sunday complete with sprinklers and fan fare. (Note that you have to purchase this in advance or you just get a boring scoop of ice cream) enter giant gong...\"GONG!!\"  You're done! Out to the southside street you go to get LOUD and continue the party!"}
{"text":"I wanted some good sushi on a Friday night, and didn't get it. Hibachi was good. And the ceramic cup was exciting"}
{"text":"I am a little sad to have had this experience with Nakama in the last times I've been here because it used to be my favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh. My last time here was yesterday,  the worst experience ever. I went there with a friend and we sat down in the high tables area, and the table was super dirty and STICKY! #Ew we informed the waitress about the situation and she cleaned it. The quality of the food that night was bad also, we had the steak hibachi and it arrived cold and tasted like it was there since yesterday. The food quality was really bad in the last times I've been here and I wanted to give Nakama one last shot. After this time, NEVER TO COME BACK AGAIN.  The service was never that great and now the food quality has gotten just as bad + coming to a dirty table = really disappointed"}
{"text":"I can't actually comment on the food.  The place looked nice relative to a lot of neighboring establishments and was recommended by our lunch-time server @ Nola (very good Creole) and our concierge.  My low rating comes from the fact that I called twice to make a reservation and no one answered.  After taking a cab from downtown we learned there was a private party and we wouldn't be able to take in the Jersey Shore fist pumping scene (thanks Callan W for the visual).  Simply disappointed in the lack of basic customer service.  We ended up down the street at the Pittsburgh Steak Company.  Not sushi but the gorgonzola filet melts in your mouth!!"}
{"text":"It's interesting that one of the most crowded restaurants in the South Side (possibly, all of Pittsburgh?) has such bad ratings on Yelp. I think Yelpers have it right in the case. Nakama totally did not live up to the hype for me. I had the hibachi and it was just mediocre. The chef / entertainer wasn't even that good - no cool tricks and he didn't even try throwing food in my mouth. The place was so loud that there is no way you can have a decent conversation if you come with a group of people. And, I swear they celebrated 10 birthdays during the hour we were dining there. They have this irritating gong that they bring out. You can't hear the guy next to you, but you will hear every birthday dinner that night.   A bunch of my co-workers like Nakama's sushi bar, so when I get a chance to try it, I'll update my review. Until then, I'm not quickly planning my next Nakama outing."}
{"text":"Went here with my son and decided to sit bar side! My son ordered shrimp hibachi I ordered chicken fried rice. My son got his food and finished and and I still had not gotten my rice! When I mentioned it to the waiter she said it'll be right out! 5min passed and she walks back by and says your rice will be right out! When I finally got my rice it was Nasty burnt sticky unflavored! Not one time did the waitress apologize for any mix up!!!! Never again and I visit this place every time I come to Pittsburgh drone Orlando Florida!!!"}
{"text":"My sister & I went to the sushi bar on a Sunday afternoon and I was quite pleased. The chefs at the bar were very friendly and chatty (though I'm sure that had something to do with how empty the place was), and we got a ton of sushi for under $40. My sister got the spider rolls and I ended up stealing a few because they were so tasty. I live in Chicago, and the prices were pretty comparable to cheaper sushi there, so it was a great deal. My sister keeps saying we have to go back over the holidays, and I definitely agree!  EDIT: So we went back on Saturday and this time shared the maki platter, some Spider rolls, and the Hanalei rolls.  The hanalei rolls were by far the best sushi I have ever had. I am still having dreams about them.  That's all."}
{"text":"Always busy. Good sushi...a little on the pricey end but its always a popular place to go."}
{"text":"The hibachis were already closed, but that is fine since I save my teppanyaki experiences for Benihana.  We sat at the drink bar and looked through the menu to find items that we might want.  It doesn't take me long to find what I want in an Asian restaurant:  Gyoza Spider roll Spicy tuna roll Spicy chicken pieces Hibachi fried rice Marinated beef tips  Everything arrived in increments, which was great since it was so much food.  Our drinks were always full and the service was spectacular.  Where did Nakama go wrong?  All of the food tasted like a shadow of what it could have been. The flavors were not vibrant, which really was sad since I could tell that the ingredients were fresh.  My sushi didn't smell and it didn't have a fishy taste; it just had very little taste altogether.    Nothing was spicy -- piquant -- that was supposed to be spicy.  The spicy chicken pieces are more sweet than anything else and the beef and rice was just as flavorless.  I wish that there was more flavor to everything that I ate; especially considering the price tag."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing experience. Terrible service, mediocre food and unhospitable management. Will not return and would not recommend"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the people watching from a table by the window. The drinks are watered down and over priced. The sushi is lack luster. And the hibachi will more than likely ruin your night because you'll spend all night with epic diarrhea."}
{"text":"This was my second experience there. That being said it was sub par in the service end of the establishment. Food... AMAZING..!!! \"Show\"... Eh... Hostess was completely and utterly rude to us and her co-workers.   The habachi segment left us wanting more of a show... Tables around us were laughing and having fun and our guy did nothing more than cook and cut vegetables..... Our server was decent. Young kid and full of energy and pretty attentive!   Great place to come but they need to retrain or get rid of the dead weight in the hostess stand and hype up the particular chef we had."}
{"text":"Even though we had reservations this was probably the worst service I ever had. The food was good and the chef did a very nice job but they are overpriced and up-charge for things like fried rice. The waiter constantly forgot items and messed up the to go order. Saga and Ichiban are a much better and cheaper options."}
{"text":"I really wish this place was great, but unfortunately, the decor does not make up for the mediocre sushi and the abhorrent clientele.  That place during happy hour reminds me of a Bosch painting, except for populated by yuppies instead of the naked damned.  The waitstaff is decent, but the hibachi chefs are kind of weak.  If you go on the weekend, you can have an awkward conversation about how loud you pee with the bathroom attendant.  I guess there's not a lot of small talk to be had.  I have had fun in this place, but I can have fun pretty much anywhere.  Oh, and if it is crowded, good luck hearing a word that anybody says."}
{"text":"Great for a birthday celebration. Great server and excellent cook! Had so much fun  and food was amazing. Had the veggie option and everything was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"You would think by the crowds in this place it was the only sushi place in the whole city of Pittsburgh. I went in with good expectations of this place considering it is always crowded.....boy was I wrong!!!  First off the service at this place is horrible. This is mostly a 22-28 yr old staffed place. The hostess basically laughed at me when I said we did not have a reservation, offered us to have a drink at the bar, and then said \"but you cannot stand around in this area here around the door it is getting too crowded so either the bar or maybe wait outside\" ...seriously you don't tell a customer that.   We just wanted sushi anyways, so we sat at the sushi bar and ordered some rolls and sashimi. Now maybe I am spoiled from living on the west coast for so long now that I am used to Asians (usually Japanese..go figure) working and making my sushi. There were 3 white guys about 25 yrs old making my rolls for me, not to say they cannot do it as well as anyone else, but the rolls were seriously not that great.  Hell I did not even see an Asian person working at the tables either, they were mostly Mexican guys.   Sorry, I know most of the reviews are raving about how good this place is, but to me it seems pretty pricey for what you get and the food is not all that. I can only speak for the sushi...maybe the dinners at the tables are better. To sum it up this is mostly an over priced sushi bar that is a good place to hang out and have drinks with friends and maybe hit on some groups of women out for dinner."}
{"text":"Okay, let me preface all of this by saying they'd get 5 stars if they weren't BLASTING 90's hip hop over the speakers. I get it, it's the south side. But on the same hand, it's a restaurant. Slow your roll. (See what i did there?)  I've had nakama bookmarked on Yelp for close to four years. I've always wanted to go, but never really made the time. Got asked on a date here, and couldn't turn it down. I love sushi.  So, this cant speak to the hibachi tables, but maybe someday it can.   Arrived at 8pm on Saturday for our reservation, and immediately were seated at a (wobbly) table by the window. We knew we were there for sushi, and we couldn't wait to get to ordering. They have paper sushi menus you can fill out with a little golf pencil and turn in like homework to make your sushi appear. We just kept checking boxes. Haha! So many amazing choices. Thanks to everyone who recommended the Hanalei Roll, it was amazing!   So the order went a little something like this; Spider Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (much to the disappointment of my date did not contain penguin. KIDDING), Spicy Crab Salad Roll, and the Crunchy Philly Roll. When Leah, our server, brought them out we (and our little wobbly table) were a little overwhelmed. But we made it disappear quite quickly.   Neither one of us really liked the Penguins Roll. Seemed like it was just..missing something. The spider roll is forever my go to when trying new sushi. It was great. The Hanalei Roll, as previously stated was incredible. Who knew you could flash fry sushi?! The crunchy Philly Roll was about the same. Really good and disappeared quickly. My amazing date really enjoyed the spicy crab salad roll. Leah recommended it, and it was an excellent choice.   Everything was really great. No complaints on service, Leah made sure we had everything we needed quickly, and kept our water glasses full. Let's turn that music down a little bit, remember, this is Nakama, not Jimmy D's.   I will definitely be back. Hopefully WE will definitely be back.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Best sushi north of Nakama in South Side. Notice a trend? Seriously great beer selection, very fresh sushi. Very good ginger dressing and miso soup was on point. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This visit was like the final straw of an ex boyfriend that I hadn't gotten over....except now I am!  Nakama just isn't the same restaurant I remember. Maybe it's been a few years since I've been to Nakama, but instead of being a sushi/hibachi hot spot it feels more like a bar in south side that just happens to have sushi.  The staff seemed disinterested and chided us for making a reservation. Apparently we only needed one if we were ordering hibachi (we weren't).  The sushi fit our craving, but it was just mediocre. The seaweed salad was unusually sweet and the sushi was at least room temperature. I usually enjoy sushi that is a little on the colder side.  All in all, I'm glad we went to check it out since my romanticized last visit, but am ready to move on!"}
{"text":"I think that this was closer to a 3 start restaurant but given the amount my father spent I can't give it 3 stars.  I booked this place for 6 adults and 2 kids because I thought the kids would really enjoy the experience.  We were in town celebrating my 40th birthday.  It is extremely loud which I expected, but didnt help the experience.  While our chef was nice enough, he didnt provide the \"show\" that you are also paying for and I feel the kids didnt get the full experience.  The food was good...however 2 of us ordered our filet medium and it was way overcooked.    Overall, it was a decent meal but I dont think we would return."}
{"text":"Came here for the first and most definitely the last time the other day. Decided to come here after many coworkers had recommended the establishment, and was left highly disappointed. My friend and I sat down at the bar, and it took the bartender about ten minutes to come over. I ordered a beer and my friend wanted to taste it before ordering one herself. After dropping off my drink, the bartender walked away and didn't come back for another ten minutes to take my friends drink order. After dropping that one off, walked away for another twenty minutes before taking our food orders. When I ordered, I asked to modify my sushi order a little and her exact response was \"whatever, you're eating it, not me\", and when I ordered a dish, it was \"oh that's my absolute favorite but we don't make it anymore\". If it's on the menu, shouldn't it be available? I asked for the sushi first and said I would decide on a main course after that came out. The sushi came out, and the order was completely wrong. After it had been sitting there and I tried to flag her down, she came over (again, about 20 minutes later) and just threw it in the trash right in front of us. Rolled her eyes and told me that I should have \"explained what I wanted\". Having now spent an hour here, we had just wanted to pay for our beers and leave, no longer wanting food. When I spoke with the manager, all she said was \"this is the first complaint I've ever gotten about her\", and walked away. Wish I could give zero stars just based off of the terrible service."}
{"text":"I had a reservation at 7:00 pm. I wasn't seated until around 7:40. It also seemed as if they were short on cooks because our table sat for a significant amount of time before the cook showed up. Subsequently, we didn't eat until 8:45. I prefer Ichiban."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi spot in the city downtown. We ended up ordering way to much food then got huge puppy bellies. But the food was so good! I loved the sushi, miso soup and fried shrimp. Our chef was really cool too. Plus our waiter was super helpful with our huge group."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Save yourself from being \"nickeled and dimed\" and go to Ichiban where you get more food at better prices. An up charge for fried rice??! Really??  It's a hibachi!  No noodles or it's another charge. Our chef was slow and i had to remind him of items I ordered and did not get. Ichiban has a better atmosphere, better food, and better prices."}
{"text":"We visited for lunch the other day and we were quite satisfied. Our server was super friendly and prompt. My husband and I are what I like to call fake-sushi fans, so we got a California Roll and a Spicy California Roll cuz we were feeling craaaazy that day. We also ordered the coconut shrimp. Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time, although the shrimp came out a couple minutes AFTER our sushi, and I would have preferred it before.  The sushi was well prepared and very tasty. The rolls stuck together just right and had good flavors. The sauce on the spicy rolls had just the right amount of heat. I know, there's not much to a California roll, but what can I say? We're sushi wimps. The coconut shrimp was nearly on par with Red Lobster's coconut shrimp (which are the best coconut shrimp out there) but a teensy bit dry. This was remedied by the yummy, spicy sauce on the side (strangely reminiscent of the sweet chili sauce McDonald's had out during the Olympics...)  All in all the service was great and we enjoyed our food, so we'll be back. The lunch hibachi prices are very reasonable so we hope to try that next time."}
{"text":"Crazy good dinner Yum yum sauce on everything!! Filet mignon love"}
{"text":"The food here is soooooooo GROSS NOW!!! Don't eat here... The chef SUCKX"}
{"text":"The very first place i ever got to try sushi at, and i ordered a few different rolls too. I liked all the ones i tried. The shrimp tempura was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Went here with my BFF for her birthday. Cocktails were great, just a little heavy on the sour mix.  I got the house Cosmo and my friend had the French Kiss cocktail.  The French Kiss was tastier than mine.  I loved the atmosphere: dim lighting, a swanky bar and hibachi tables in the back.  Self seating around the bar so we didn't have to wait at all at 9pm on a Saturday night. Rolls are big and are a decent price and the fish is super fresh. Two of the rolls tasted exactly the same which was a little disappointing: the Hawaii roll and the Haiku roll. If you want more variety don't order them together. Overall, Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Over rated.  In most cases you get what you pay for except here, you pay more for average at best sushi.  The waitress had a terrible attitude and a face to match.  Yokoso is shitting on this place.  Not to mention have fun trying to find a decent parking spot on the southside."}
{"text":"The fascination with Nakama has always left me confused. I'm not a huge hibachi fan, so my gripes truly rest with the sushi. As far as sushi goes, Nakama simply doesn't deserve the praise that it gets. Granted, when they first opened, the food was decent, but even back then it was never a truly great sushi place.  Now, if you like your sushi over-saturated in sauces, then you might enjoy it, but all too often, the rolls are soggy, poorly rolled, and the fish quality isn't as good as you'd expect if you were judging the restaurant from the outside. Blame it on the pace with which the chefs have to prepare it...blame it on them hiring inexperienced sushi chefs. Whatever it is, it's just not up to par with some of the other sushi places in Pittsburgh. In fact, the sushi at the Tokyo Buffet on McKnight is just as good...AND THAT'S A BUFFET!  Regardless, it's always packed, and I'm a huge fan of seeing businesses succeed in town, but Nakama is truly a place that's gained too much from its trendy status. Unfortunately, I'm all about the food, so after you enjoy a good martini and enjoy the little hibachi show, what you're left with is the reality that the food is second priority to those other two parts.  The hibachi is fine, but it's nothing special...of course, when is hibachi ever truly a special experience, taste-wise? It's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth. The best hibachi I've ever had at Nakama was the ahi tuna...the cut of fish was actually fresher than sashimi that I've ordered there, and keeping it seared, but rare in the middle kept it from drying out. Or maybe that was just the butter...either way, it's by far the one thing that I've walked away with good feelings about.  The sashimi cuts that I've had have rarely satisfied. Fresh fish shouldn't taste so fishy, and for what you pay, they should be serving up better cuts. The sushi menu is interesting enough that you'll be able to find what you're looking for, but it's truly a hit-or-miss experience when the sushi hits your taste buds.  Overall, Nakama is the hot spot where you meet your friends before hitting the clubs and make random friends over some happy hour drinks, but if you're looking for a quality meal, I'd enjoy the drinks and move on to any number of better restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Nakama is my go-to for special occasions! Hibachi is great with all kinds of land and sea options to choose from.  Sushi is also just spectacular with so many different choices! However, being that nakama is in the Southside - where all the bars and club scenes are, it may seem like more of a bar type environment rather than a sushi and hibachi restaurant.  Reasoning why it doesn't get a full 5 stars is due to how expensive it can be! Dinner for 2,  a person can easily spend 60-70$ during dinner time.  That's why I like to hit the lunch time special where it's half the price - but also half the food but you still get your hibachi fix!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I've only ever tried the sushi. I have no clue about the hibatchi bar.  I was delighted to see that I'm not the only one who finds this place to be completely overrated and overpriced. The sushi was your average run of the mill raw fish. Nothing special about the freshness or the imaginitivity of the rolls. That is, except for the price. I couldn't believe that a meal for such average sushi cost as much as it did.   If you're looking for some decent raw fish to feed your sushi craving, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill instead. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you want Benihana's in Pittsburgh, I guess this is the place to go. Other than the fact that they have some marketing and advertising genius who's greased the palms of every \"guide to the city\" and \"best restaurants\" free pamphlet that they hand out at hotel concierge desks, I don't know what all the hype's about.   They have a big sushi bar area, and quite a few grills in the back. We sat at a table with some PITT football players and I ordered the filet, while TY got surf and turf. It was all kind of eh, but I have to say that customer service was very good and all the staff were really nice. The filet was tender, but I think just the flavor of everything was mediocre, especially at their prices. We had a coupon for $15 in one of the aforementioned guide books, so pick one of those up before you spend your money here."}
{"text":"I've been such a fan of Nakama but lately things have gone down hill. I make a trip to this location once a month/every other month, and have for years. I've noticed some changes for at least the past year. Portion sizes decreasing, prices increasing, and service hitting rock bottom--quality of food is about the only constant.  The food and location are awesome. Food tastes fresh and well made. Being located on East Carson is awesome, easy to get to with valet parking and street parking available.  Now where it drops off; prices of food have steadily inclined whereas portions are decreasing. Once you'd expect to leave with left overs, now you're lucky with 8 pieces of shrimp in your dinner. Also, the cost of something as minor as having fried rice over steamed rice is nearly $4. But it is worth it considering the past two outings the steamed rice wasn't delivered to the table until after the meal was prepared.   Lastly, the service really needs an overhaul. As someone who has experience in the service industry I know how it is and sometimes you're having an off/bad day but MAN IS IT BAD. From the hostess to our waiter (with exception of the chef--they're typically wonderful!) it feels like everyone is in a rush and no one cares to help you even when placing a food order.   Two of my most recent trips resulting in forgetting to fill out drink/bar order. I can understand waiting on the bartender but water shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. Both of these outings were on Monday nights when the restaurant is at its slowest.   One waitress over charged us on fried rice, no big deal, but then argued that the three of us in our party ordered it while only one did. It took too long to resolve we almost wished we didn't speak up.  Last night our service was even worse, again waiting for the server to arrive, 10 minutes for water, forgetting one water and ignoring the table until our dinner was being cooked. Then it was each time we'd ask for something he would run away. No water refill, no soy sauce, going to the bar to get a container. I can understand on a Friday night but a slow Monday?   I hope this place improves because I really do enjoy it but for the price I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"took my family out going off the name. the restaurant in south side has a great reputation. it turns out this place had made no improvement since its previous life as a poor excuse for hibachi. waited a good twenty minutes for the server to take our drink order. after about another twenty minutes and hearing loud complaints from two other tables the server returned and placed a take out box on the grill. it melted immediately. drinks had not come along with her so we decided to walk out. went down the road to ichiban and head awesome service and food as usual."}
{"text":"Decent Hibachi food. Solid 3 stars.  My boyfriend and I came to Katama for a Hibachi dinner on a Wednesday night. We have high expectations when it comes to Hibachi because our taste buds have been acquired to meet the Hibachi standards of Nakato in Atlanta, however I will TRY my best to give an unbiased opinion.  To start off, Nakama was fairly empty for a Hibachi restaurant. We were seated immediately after arriving and ordered drinks. I orders the Slush Puppie which I thought would be a frozen mixed drink but instead it was not frozen at all and tasted like a melted Blue Raspberry Slushie from Quick Trip. For entrees, I ordered the Teryaki  chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Shrimp and Chicken. We noticed that the prices were on the more expensive side ranging from $18-40 with an additional charge of $3.75 for fries rice.  Our Hibachi chef came out moments later looking a bit unenthused and seemed to be new to the Hibachi grill. I sat patiently waiting for the big fire opening at the beginning of every Hibachi experience but this time it didn't happen. Our chef started right on the appetizers! I ordered the Shrimp appetizer which was pretty standard, and my boyfriend opted for the mushroom appetizer which was yummy. Next up came the vegetables lacking in flavor.. I ended up having to sprinkle my veggies with soy sauce for taste. The fried rice tasted a little off to me as well, as if it were cooked with margarine instead of the traditional Hibachi seasoned butter. Our entrees were decent but well portioned with enough to take home for left overs.   Overall, their Hibachi recipes lack in flavor and seasoning. The prices are comparable to Benihana's however the portion sizes provide enough for left overs."}
{"text":"The cranberry location doesn't really live up to the swankier south side locale. It's very tight at the teppanyaki tables in the back, I feel like they tried to stuff as many tables and chairs as possible into a small space, so you are definitely bumping elbows with your neighbors if all the chairs are filled and it's tough to navigate. Service was quick and friendly. Our chef was highly entertaining and my 87 year-old grandmother described the shrimp as \"the best she had ever eaten\".  The sushi rolls were good, fresh and flavorful. The scallops and shrimp Diablo were barely spicy. I could have used a whole lot more heat. But the scallops were cooked well, not gummy at all, which is a huge accomplishment!  All in all I would probably return to make grandma happy, but not unless she was with us"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday at 8PM and the restaurant and Hibachi wasn't very crowded.  Monday also gives you $7 off the steak/chicken/shrimp dinner; which is a good deal.  I decided to try the restaurant again and my opinion stayed the same.  Onion soup is watery and not very good.  The salad dressing is not as good as other similar places.  The show is nothing special.    If you go to their website you can get a free appetizer coupon but you can't use with the daily special.  No valet on Mondays but many meters are on Carson St."}
{"text":"Love this place - good food decent price! Great times!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. Always fresh and quickly served.   Seating for sushi is open which can be a bit awkward when it is busy. I've never had to wait long though, if at all. Be prepared to wait for the valet though, may as well try to park on your own."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night to celebrate my boyfriends new job. We didn't want to drive downtown,so I figured nakama in Wexford would be a nice place for a celebration. The service and staff we're very friendly. My boyfriend got sushi and he said it was fantastic. But the hibachi dinner, not so much. The salad was drenched in dressing and everything that came off the grill was extremely salty. It made it really hard/impossible to eat. The cook and waitress were so nice, I didn't want to say anything. I was a little upset because we spent so much money on dinner, I wish the quality would have been better. Overall I think this place is way too expensive for the quality and amount of food you get. You would be better off getting a groupon for another hibachi place. Next time I think we will make the drive downtown to go out for a celebration dinner."}
{"text":"I really like Nakama and I've been here several times. I am surprised the ratings aren't better actually. I think it's a good place to get good sushi and hibachi. I've never had any of the other food so I can't speak for anything else. I've never had a bad experience but have also never been blown away by anything crazy.  Seating is available at the sushi counter, bar, hibachi table and dining room. It gets very busy and crowded on weekends so I recommend a reservation if you have a larger group.  It can get loud as well especially in the evening on weekends so I wouldn't come here during that time if you want a quiet and intimate environment.  Overall a good choice in my opinion and I will be back at some point."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been visited this establishment during the day, and on a Saturday night.  I am not expect on Japanese food, but I like what I had.  I am out of Atlanta, so the prices are great.  Nice place to start a Saturday night out, and nice for a business meal."}
{"text":"I've been to Nakama a few times for sushi (always delicious), but I finally got to try the hibachi .   The deal is pretty good -- you pick the protein (or veggies) and you get that, fried rice, salad, and a mini appetizer of (2) shrimp.  In addition to the hibachi scallops, I ordered the Nakama ceviche appetizer. When it arrived I was a bit thrown because, while it was a very pretty plate, it wasn't what I would call ceviche. Instead, it was a few large pieces of tuna sashimi on a bed of raw white onion, carrots, and I believe jicama. There wasn't much citrus flavor at all and the raw white onion was a bit too much. The tuna was delicious, but I would definitely change the name of the item.  The hibachi scallops were cooked perfectly, and the fried rice accompaniment was a little too good (I watched lots of butter go into it). Very yummy.  As far as the hibachi performance went, there wasn't much, though it was 12pm on a Saturday, so I get it. Our chef was very nice and kept up some good conversation with us. I also greatly enjoyed the fireball he started off with (see picture)."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place and love my sushi, so finally indulged myself.  It's a Friday evening about 6pm and the place is hopping with people and their energy (and noise level).  However, since I'm going solo tonight I have no problem finding a place at the sushi bar.  I'm tended to promptly and pleasantly by my server who helps me determine which tuna I would prefer for my sushi selection and lets me know it is very fresh tonight.  I end up with eel, salmon, and tuna plus a salad with ginger dressing and a glass of plum wine.    My server checks on me, the sushi chef at the sushi bar serves me my sushi and it is a nice portion and tastes very fresh and just the right serving temperature.  I'm a happy camper as I do love my sushi.  The price is in line with any sushi restaurant.  I spent about $32.00 plus tip for 6 pieces of sushi, a salad, and a glass of wine.  They do have the hibachi tables and usual fare and fanfare that goes with it.  Plusses:  No TV in the sushi bar and no salt and pepper shakers alongside the soy sauces.  :-)  Been seeing that a lot lately so was glad it wasn't the case here.  The only down side is the volume level of noise which I would attribute to poor acoustics, perhaps?  Not a problem for me dining alone but if I was with someone and wanted to carry on a conversation, I think there would have been a lot of \"Huh?  What'd you say?;s\".    I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"While this is still primarily a Japanese hibachi, it is clearly better than the numerous chains that have been popping up everywhere. The major difference being the quality of the ingredients and cooks. My steak and seafood is always cooked perfectly to temperature, which can be spotty at some of the competitors. Also, I would rate the sushi here among the best in Pittsburgh. Also you can get some menu items you just don't find elsewhere. I particularly like the Diablo preparation with a spicy sauce and soba noodles.   The one knock would be the showmanship can be pretty hit or miss here depending who you get and there is really no innovation. A pretty standard show."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!The food was perfect.The cook was funny,friendly,told us funny stories while his cooking! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good sushi! The price wasn't cheap, but the quality was worth it. The issue is space. There are people who come solely for the bar, but there isn't enough space. I had some blonde chick shaking her hair in my saki! It was so bad that the waitress had to ask her and her friends to either sit or move away from the table. It was ridiculous. I rate on both product and atmosphere. The food was superb, the drinks delicious but Nakama needs to fix their atmosphere. The  sports bar/ bar environment does not suit this place well. It's sexy  and classy, they need to keep the drama away. Food saved this place."}
{"text":"The 3 stars is strictly for the Laura the bartender and the daytime atmosphere, not the food.  I've been to Nakama a handful of times, though only once was it specifically for food. The rest of the time it was for a few drinks or some sake because it was a nice day out and I like sitting near their windows. I've never ordered a specialty drink, only beer and sake. Tip: if you go and like sake, get the Crazy Milk and check out the bottle for a few lulz.  We've ordered food twice, I believe, one time being referenced above when it was a full meal and the order was just some sushi for tapas-style appetizers. Neither time has the food impressed me. In fact, it's probably the worst sushi I have ever had. My boyfriend ordered a spicy tuna roll and the tuna looked like baby food, as if someone had chewed it up and spit it back out - no lie. It was disgusting, but he powered through most of it as he was starving. They also managed to mess up fried rice, completely annihilating the veggies for some reason. The sushi rolls I've ordered have ranged from \"eh\" to \"gross.\"  I can't give this place less than 3 stars, though, because every time I've gone I've had a really great time. I guess I would break down my review like this: Food - 1 star, Atmosphere - 4 stars, Service - 4 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today to celebrate our anniversary, we were there in the afternoon because of our work schedules. We had an amazing time!! Even though it was still \"lunch time \" they fired up the hibachi table for just the two of us! Luke was our chef, and he was awesome!! We had a blast, and we'll definitely be back!! Also, the prices for the lunch menu were discounted, win win in my book!!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite Japanese place ever.  I love sushi, but my boyfriend isn't a huge fan, so I got the Boston roll and he got the steak tips. AMAZING.  We no longer live in the area, but we always visit it when we're in town."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious. A bit pricey, but it tasted awesome. We got several rolls and shared them. Overall, we enjoyed it and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my friend. We sat at the Hibachi table and had the best time. We come here regularly but today was exceptionally awesome because of our chef's upbeat personality and witty jokes the whole time. Our chef, Luke, was entertaining as well as cooked everything perfectly. Would request his table again in the future. Also ordered a Philly roll, which are always delicious here. The veggie egg roll we got was actually pretty disgusting. It was so oily and tasted bitter. I told the waitress and she gladly removed from my bill. Other than that, lunch was great."}
{"text":"I've had pretty good sushi in the NY / NJ area and this would definitely be a place we'd go on the regular, so for the people of Pittsburgh PA, you guys deff have good sushi in town. Not only was the sushi good, but a great selection of beers, and a cool sports bar feel. Really hip, not something I expected in Pitt, very NYC like.   My one comment would be on a Sunday during Football Season, nobody want's to see pirate baseball on tv, especially regular season baseball."}
{"text":"Love hibachi but not this place! Way more expensive then it's competitors for less food and poor service. The manager wasn't even aware of the open table coupon we earned from spending so many points at various places; made us out $20 dollars. Also took the server 20+ minutes to refill drinks. Sad!!"}
{"text":"5 people. No booze. $200. Was the food remarkable? No. Was it acceptable? Yes. Was it difficult to see in the low-light ambiance? Yes. Are there alternatives? Certainly. Do I think this place is a bit over rated? Sorta, kinda, yes."}
{"text":"Sushi was average. I ate at the bar & the service was poor..very rushed; non attentive..had 2 ask for utensils 3x to 3 different staff, had to ask for soy dish..and no meal follow-up."}
{"text":"Good hibachi for Pitt.  Good tasty food, large portions and trendy environment.  I would recommended for group dinners, business travel dinners and Happy Hour.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Huge sushi rolls which were a little hard to pick up with chopsticks without them falling apart. Interesting combos of contemporary ingredients. We had the spider roll which came with huge pieces of crispy fried soft shell crab. Hamachi and jalapeno roll was good too. I can't remember the other two rolls we had but all the fish tasted fresh.   We didn't order hibachi but it (the hibachi) looked kind of weak compared to other places I've been, not much of a show, no interaction between chef and guests, etc. Mostly just the chef tapping the spatula, no flipping, tossing, no onion volcano! Glad we just stuck with the sushi."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Pittsburgh. Only problem is that it is usually very crowded and the noise is not well isolated, so sometimes it is hard to talk over dinner. Also, tables for sushi are too small and too close to each other. But food is outstanding, especially specialty rolls and fried rice at hibachi tables"}
{"text":"The Sushi is really good! The Hibachi is also very flavorful, staff is friendly. The only downside of this restaurant is that it is super packed on weekends (just like all of the other popular restaurants). The spicy chicken egg rolls are really soooo good! Also, my family members that hate sushi actually really liked all of the tempura rolls."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting the restaurant down on the Southside and I have to say that the food was fantastic as usual, but this visit this time around the service by our waitress(Haley) was mediocre. My friend ordered a wine(Pinot Noir) but she came back with a Pinot Grigio, which is a common mistake and not too much of a big deal. But when she was asked to take back the drink she got snippy with us. She also had out chef confused with what she has written down and our food was going to the wrong plate. The occasion was my friends birthday and when another one of her friends came by she didn't want to take his drink order. She completely messed up our payments and got snippy with us when we were confused. Our overall experience with Haley was terrible. The only reason why I tipped her 20% was because I am also a server and know the struggle. The food was delicious and yum yum sauce is great, which is why I still recommend this place and love coming here when in town."}
{"text":"Note: for sushi bar. Did not go for Hibachi (because I've had enough of Benihana and it seemed really pricey). Wait was also nonexistent for sushi at the bar.   Another disclaimer: I'm used to California sushi restaurants & chains (Japanese friends would have MUCH higher standards) and I haven't had good sushi since I've moved out to DC.  Friend & I shared: Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (when in Pittsburgh...), Spicy Squid Salad, Salmon Ceviche (cannot find on online menu), and Philadelphia roll (because somehow my friend has NEVER had it?)  Everything was really good! I especially liked the spicy squid salad and the salmon ceviche- the latter had pretty thick pieces of salmon but was so nicely presented that I didn't really mind at all (the same cannot be said for everyone.)   Overall: good, solid Japanese restaurant. Would go again."}
{"text":"Very busy at lunch.  Almost like they weren't ready for a Friday lunch.  Slow service, mediocre food.  I think I will skip this place the next time I am in town..."}
{"text":"Good sushi, perhaps a little pricey, but always good.  Hibachi is excellent as well - great chefs, entertaining."}
{"text":"Trendy and overpriced as it may be, I'm a Nakama fan. Best hibachi in the city, and the atmosphere has more of a modern-feel than competitors like Ichiban or SAGA. We had a large group (about 20 people) there for my birthday dinner this year, and the service was great. The chefs put on a great show and everyone had a good time. We also had my sisters bachelorette party at the one in the South Side and it was a success. Recommend for a fun occasion."}
{"text":"A Saturday night out in Pittsburgh should start at Nakama for no reason other than entertainment (and good cocktails).  The place was packed, but we found a space by the bar in the corner.  We didn't get a chance to eat the food, but I can say the place looks kind of fun.  Not really date worthy as it was pretty loud, but the hibachi style dining is definitely a conversation starter.  I ordered a strawberry citrus-tini, a serious $10 cocktail.  In Philly, I wouldn't think twice about this price, but for the burgh, it seemed a bit steep.  It was quite tasty though and I couldn't really stop myself from licking the flavored sugar on the rim.    Nakama is like the serengeti...it is hunt or be hunted.  Ladies brought their A game, or should I say DD game as most everyone in the place had their breasts on display.  We joked about a possible nipple slip...quite frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised.  The gents are just as preened as the ladies and I couldn't help but see that the Jersey Shore had made it all the way across PA.  Fist pumping anyone?  We only stayed for the one cocktail, but we were there long enough for some decent people watching.  I would suggest going for the beginning of your evening on Carson St.  I know I certainly learned a lot about the singles scene in my short time there."}
{"text":"There are not many sushi options in the area.  I do not eat raw fish, and I'm not looking for anything fancy - so I go for the Baked Alaskan Roll. It's good. I do return for this roll and the hibachi dinners every once and awhile. The overall experience at Nakama is just lackluster. Nakama is extremely overpriced at $7-8 for a domestic craft beer, $9-13 for a glass of domestic wine. They are extremely slow. The servers are disinterested. My visit last week was the only time I had a friendly, non-snooty waiter. Every other visit I've been treated to snooty service. They have a great rewards program and I will return twice a year with my complimentary meal (up to $20) coupon :) I appreciate this aspect of their business model."}
{"text":"I don't give many two star reviews, but this place deserves it. Lesson learned after dining here: trust Yelp reviews. Say it with me now, trust...Yelp...reviews....  Where to start? Let's start with the positives: Service was good, ambiance is great if you're looking for a fun (read: loud, energetic atmosphere), and the Miso soup.  Negatives: I paid $25 per person for overcooked, chewy steak and tasteless shrimp. I decided to fill up on Sapporo, salad, rice and veggies and find the first homeless person to give my leftovers to.  If you're looking for Hibachi in Pittsburgh there are other places that you should check out first. I can't comment on the sushi as we didn't order any."}
{"text":"My friend loves Nakama so when she came to visit me, we decided to get dinner here. We ordered sushi and appetizer to share. The sushi was decent but overall, not very memorable. If you want authentic sushi, I highly recommend Chaya in Squirrel Hill!"}
{"text":"I really do love Nakama. The food is delicious & something about watching it made & set out on your plate is a good feeling.. Everything is so fresh. I live when the cons do their little tricks. I do feel like they have made the portions smaller & I wish they gave you the extra mushrooms & the end."}
{"text":"I personally never had the hibachi, I like to sit up at the bar. Its usually pretty hard to find a seat but if you are patient and come with only 1 other person, its usually doable.   The rolls are actually very fresh, and very delicious. I eat a lot of sushi and I would definetly say this is fresh fish. I would also add that the rolls are very creative... i have never had a roll that I am not satisfied with.  There is also a great atmosphere as usually it is loud, lots of people, TV's everywhere for watching the game. They also have pretty good service!   I definetly love coming to this place, if only it didn't take so long to find a seat!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for four people on a Saturday night at 8:00. We did not get seated until 9:00. In the bathroom I heard the hostess complaining about how backed up they were and that she wanted to tell the complaining guests \"I don't know you, I don't care\". This attitude aside, the rest of our service was really good. It was slow-going on getting drinks, but I could tell our server was really rushed. Hats off to the people at our \"grill\" who were going to the bar to buy drinks. It gets hectic at hibachi places, and they did a pretty good job for being as busy as they were. Our hibachi chef was awesome and adorable. He was really a lot of fun, and you could tell he knew what he was doing.  The drinks were reasonably priced, as was the menu. I think it was about $45.00 for me by myself with a hibachi meal and two Kettle One cocktails. The shrimp was good, and the steak was really tender. The fried rice was definitely not the best hibachi-fried rice I have ever had, but it hit the spot. I really liked their miso soup, it didn't have tofu, which made me happy!  I would love to go back and try the sushi, although I will probably avoid coming here during a peak hour, whether or not I have reservations. Definitely better than Benihana, although I have had better hibachi."}
{"text":"I have been to Nakama, many many times.  I usually just get sushi or maki.  You cant complain about this aspect of Nakama.  They always have good, fresh, tasty rolls.   It isn't the cheapest, but how cheap to you want sushi grade fish? They are good size portions too, so its not like your paying all for the presentation.  They move a lot of fish here, so it's unlikely you will get subpar seafood. The Dragon roll is awesome and I usually get the Caterpillar as well.  both nice sized rolls.  They do have hibachi in the back  but I've never tried that."}
{"text":"They've gotten better. It's still location, location, location. I can't blame them for charging the prices they do- people are paying it and leaving happy."}
{"text":"Trendy ambiance, fresh sushi, but the worst hibachi I've ever had.  First with my sushi review: I have been here multiple times for sushi and liked the bar set up and thought the sushi tasted fresh and the service was quick. Good for happy hours (especially Thursday specials) or dates. However I don't like how if you only want to order sushi you have to sit at the bar. It makes it impossible to go there as a group or you end up waiting forever if there aren't enough seats in the bar area.. when the entire back room could be open.   The reason for my 2-star review is the hibachi, something that is pretty standardized among restaurants, but Nakama didn't have any of it right the time I went. The miso soup tasted like the packet cup of soup you buy in college. I ordered the shrimp and it turned out tough and rubbery. I also tried some of my friend's steak, which was also well done and dry. The hibachi chef didn't even ask how she wanted it to be cooked. Also, even though it's similarly priced to other hibachi restaurants, you have to up charge for fried rice and don't even have the option of noodles.  Bottomline: go to Nakama in small groups for sushi but stay away from the Hibachi"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through Uber eats.  My food arrived a mess, which is most likely not the restaurant's fault so I let that slide and will take that up with Uber.  However, I ordered hibachi meals, 3 of them.  I also ordered sushi as well.  I received no sauce with my order.  No soy sauce, shrimp sauce or steak sauce.  I called the restaurant, because this is their mistake and spoke with a manager named Sum or Sam, I couldn't make out her name due to the noise in the background.  I explained the issue and she told me to come and pick it up.  No apology or otherwise for the mistake.  I explained that I ordered delivery because I didn't have a means to pick it up at this time, and she said oh well.  At that point she said, well I'm not going to keep discussing the same thing and hung up on me.  I called back in and am currently waiting for an owner to contact me.  A simple I'm sorry goes a long way, further more don't offer delivery through a third party if you can't provide the items that are supposed to come with an order.  I won't be going to this establishment or ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I worked at a top notch sushi restaurant and was educated very well with the real definition of sushi over summer. and having come back to pittsburgh and eating at nakama, i was sadly disappointed. no one knows what they're serving and it's just a trendy place that pretends to serve sushi for people to say they \"eat sushi\". the drinks and bar section is fun and the tvs are great for games. but i would not go back there for any food any time soon."}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar, which has a great atmosphere.  The sushi rolls were tasty, and there was a fairly large selection. Overall, Nakama was good.  It's definitely one of the better sushi places in Pittsburgh, but it also definitely lacks the charm of a restaurant that I would call one of my favorites.  Nakama gets very crowded Thursday - Saturday nights, so get there early if you don't want to wait an hour or more for a seat."}
{"text":"Let me start with what works at Nakama: The servers. They're super nice and efficient.  What doesn't work is the food, the prices, the crowds, the incredibly busy, loud bar without the possibility of being seated in the quieter room (reserved only for Habachi eaters) -- even when you're paying $15.00/person FOR LUNCH!  And, the restaurant demands that you dress in nice casual wear. No t-shirts, yet the food was terrible!  We shared the Spider Roll and the Chicken and Shrimp Habachi plate, as well as a seaweed salad. The salad was okay. The Spider Roll came in a sticky, overly-sweet sauce which ruined the flavor. The crab was rubbery and seemed old. The chicken Habachi was waaaaaaay overcooked (dry to the point of being hard to swallow),  the shrimp smelled old , and it was NOT DEVEINED (read: it still had the poop tunnel in it!). ICK! This is supposed to be Pittsburgh's finest sushi restaurant? Old fish meets overcooked chicken, meets truly bad sushi, meets loud bar with no option to sit elsewhere (even when you're not drinking), meets overpriced lunch menu!  My advice: Go elsewhere! If you want something to eat, check out ANY other restaurant in the South Side. Even if it's bad, it won't be as expensive as Nakama. But, there are better places to be had in Pittsburgh. Not being from the area, I can't speak for sushi bars, but,  I especially like The Gypsy Cafe and Primanti's in the South Side. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I like hibachi but I forgot how expensive the fancy stuff were. With that in mind and my budget, I decided to get an assortment of sushi rolls and a signature cocktail. The sushi and coconut shrimp were great, but the cocktail was just a tease. It honestly tasted like juice. Maybe the light up ice cube was placed to detract you from the lack of alcohol."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of hibachi in general, but I see why Nakama is a favorite for most. Authentic tasting asian hibachi cuisine and atmosphere make this place a sure bet. Conveniently located on the corner of Carson and 18th, Nakama is a popular destination for those looking for sushi and the famous hibachi-grilled meals.   I opted out of the hibachi specials, but my date ordered the sesame chicken and was quite pleased. Don't be alarmed by the higher than usual prices, the portions can feed 2-3 easily. The sushi was prepared well, although it came out after our meals were already served.   In the past, I've had less than desirable experiences, but this go around, I had no complaint. Great food and good service."}
{"text":"Sorry but l don't think I will return. The waiter could not make hot tea. Slow service and food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Went on valentines day with a group of friends. Our reservation was for 7:30 and our table was ready on time. Our server, I think his name was Steve, was very attentive. Our chef was Luke and he was great. Very engaging and entertaining. The food was great and we had a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"If you are going to attempt to dine here on the weekend, make a reservation. I recommend Luke as your chef. He is very entertaining and his food is the best. I have never had a bad experience here with food or service. My girls, who are 9 and 8, are big fans of Nakama."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend and had a great meal. We sat at the sushi bar and the bartender (I can't remember her name but she was pregnant) was absolutely fantastic. She was super quick and we had wanted mules but she didn't have anymore cups. As soon as one turned up she brought us mules .... on the house! So kind! We enjoyed a lobster role and some tuna sashimi which was to die for. So fresh and delicious. I had such a great night, my boyfriend wanted to come back the following night so it was a winner in my bo"}
{"text":"Sat at one of the tables by the window.... I had the cucumber salad, shrimp egg rolls and ahi tuna... All were very delicious! Nice portion of the cucumber salad and the egg rolls were so crispy and the sauce was so yummy!  I'm new to ahi tuna and it was just what I was expecting, I left very happy :) my boyfriend had the shrimp hibachi he cleared the whole plate and not to mention it's really nice you can order hibachi at one of the tables in the front. Our server was nice and she really made sure we had a great time! Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"I went here with my friends to celebrate joint birthdays and we all decided in checking out this place, because who doesn't love hibachi? Right?!  Anyway we had made reservations for about 15 people and were seated at a hibachi table. Everybody made their drink orders and were given our drinks in a reasonable amount of time.   Hubby and I went for the hibachi, while the majority of our party opted for sushi. Anyway, one of the things that I expect from a hibachi joint is a cheesy, interactive chef and this guy was none of those things. He just basically cooked his dishes and did one onion volcano and that's about it. No crowd interaction or goofy jokes..... this is something I always expect.  Also there were no acknowledgement of anyone's birthday despite telling the waitress.  People that ordered got their fried rice, but I ended up ordering steamed rice, which never arrived when my scallops and steak and veggies had arrived. I was starving at this point so I just proceeded eating and noticed that the waitress did not come back to the table, even to refill drinks. I actually had to flag her down to inquire about my rice. My husband has finished his beer and actually wanted another one but was nowhere to be found. The service was pretty disappointing overall. Another thing that I found disappointing was the small portion size for hibachi. Usually I am used to walking out with left overs for two days from one order of hibachi. The sides were just a small portion of rice, vegetables, and soup and salad, but no lo mein or other hibachi standards.  Not even a small scoop of ice cream at the end.  So needless to say I was kinda bummed out about this too.   In terms of the food I will have to say that my scallops were perfectly cooked, and my steak was pretty awesome, but overall I found the customer service here pretty lacking.  At one point my husband was walking to the bathroom and was nearly run over by a member of the wait staff and didn't even receive an \"excuse me\".  The lack of service kind of overshadows everything else.   I also think that their decor was pretty cool and really liked their vibe, but overall my experience was just meh."}
{"text":"First time at Nakama and we were really happy with our meals. Hibachi is very good. I had the stir fry vegetables & veggie egg rolls. Egg roll filling wasn't anything to brag about, but they were perfectly crispy on the outside. All of the cocktails we tried were yummy. Valet parking if you need it, but this location on E Carson is relatively easy to find street or paid lot parking. I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was great but as for hibachi preparation it was a low grade. Several errors and a bit plain. Food seasoned well and not over cooked. Location good, and atmosphere good.  Would return but not for the show."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for something new, we dined at Nakama on a recent Saturday afternoon.  The entrance background is covered in shiny glass tiles.  We were greeted right away and offered a hibachi table or a table in the bar area.  The bar is small and intimate with a few flat screen TV's.  The hibachi area is typical for this type of place and we decided to go with the chef show.  Our server was prompt with our menus and then with our beverages.  I was concerned that we would have to wait for our table to fill.  But our server said that our chef would be out right after our first course.  So, there was only the two of us at our table.  I ordered the shrimp flambe' appetizer, salad and the hibachi shrimp.  The bf ordered the same appetizer, mushroom soup and hibachi chicken.  The soup and salad came out first.  I was impressed by the size of the salad and loved their ginger dressing.  BJ's soup was equally as delicious.    The show was pretty typical of this type of restaurant.  We really enjoyed it and our chef was friendly and very interesting to talk to.  The shrimp were good size and pretty cooked.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and we loved the vegetable friend rice.  Service was a bit off, but the restaurant only recently opened.  We loved our meals and will visit, again!"}
{"text":"Sushi came on a regular plate and there was water pooled in the bottom. Sushi was average in freshness and preparation. Crab roll had little flavor and the wrap tasted terrible. Hibachi food (brought to our sushi table) was cold and flavor was bland. My son ordered noodles and they were burned in flavor and tepid at best.  The staff seemed overwhelmed and it was difficult to get things ordered.   Food came out at weird intervals and ordering green tea was a 45 minute wait?????   Nakama use to be better.....probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Hmm...rarely do I return and reduce my rating....never actually. But, this time, I have no choice. The sushi was still good (again, for the area and what we have available to us) and we tried some of our friend's hibachi and the steak was really good - hence the reason I'll still give three stars. This time, I ordered my beloved strawberry citrus-tini martini. While the drink itself was the same, the rim didn't have the same amazing blue sugar. And....there was some sort of hair or something of some sort in my drink...that I discovered AFTER drinking some of the drink. I'm still grossed out by it. Can I, will I return? I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"Stopped at lunch on a dreary Pittsburgh Saturday. They were not crowded and we sat in the bar area. Nice , cool vibe with modern decor. Got the sushi sampler. The fish was nice and fresh. Me and the hubby both got hibachi as well. He got the strip and me the tuna. I enjoyed mine immensely. The hubby though it was just all right. The bar tender was our server as well. She was phenomenal! I wish I could go 3.5 stars but I can't so 3 it is. The hubby thought it was average. I thought it was a little above."}
{"text":"This is a god-awful excuse for a restaurant.  The actual serving of food is last on its list of priorities, which run something like this: 1) Having heavily-made-up waitresses treat diners rudely. 2) Functioning as a place for bald-headed men to drink. 3) Using \"valet parking\" to totally tie up the intersection of 17th and Carson. 4) Being a mediocre-to-poor Americanized \"Japanese\" restaurant.  I had sushi the only time I came here (probably about three years ago).  It was really bad.  Cold, rubbery rice that not only didn't have any rice vinegar in it, but wasn't properly cooked.  Rolls looked like they had been created in a fit of pique by a drunken marmot or other mammal lacking opposable thumbs.  And the fish, while not being actively spoiled, was not notable for its freshness either.  If you want hibachi, try Yokoso.  If you want excellent, authentic sushi, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill.  If you want pretty decent, cheap sushi, try Oishii Bento in Oakland.  But for the love of god, don't come here for any reason."}
{"text":"I love Hibachi and Nakama is by far one of the highest quality Hibachis I have ever experienced. I usually get the Hibachi steak. It is cooked to perfection and the shrimp appetizer and yum yum sauce is to die for! They're mixed drinks are fantastic especially the Parasol Girl. Our Chef was very fun and entertaining. They really brought you into the show. Be sure to sign up for their dining card so you can get a meal for free!"}
{"text":"I went here for my boyfriend's birthday and did hibachi... and it was good! There was a LOT of food, which is probably why it's so expensive. Hibachi ranges from $20-$70 per person! Plus, they charge you for extras, like $3 extra for fried rice instead of white rice. Kind of ridiculous. The 3 of us shared a bottle of sake because it was $30/bottle so it was the cheapest option. Also, I told 4 people it was his birthday and they were supposed to bring dessert and ring a gong... but that never happened."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I  went there for dinner & were delighted  by the menu selection the ambiance at first but once our meal came, it was absolutely mind blowing. The sushi was so fresh, so delectible, so DELISH and I think this will be my new \"go-to\" spot in Pittsburgh for amazing sushi. There are so many more rolls that I would like to try. I cannot wait to return to Pittsburgh to go to Nakama again! :)"}
{"text":"This review is only for the sushi bar!  The first time I was here, the sushi tasted AMAZING! The Baked Alaska Roll was topped with salmon that had a smoky taste, which gave the roll an extra kick. I've came back twice to get the same roll, but it no longer had the smoky taste...perhaps it was by accident that the first time tasted so perfect!  I've also had the Boston Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguin Roll, and probably a couple more.. don't remember. They consistently have a good balance of ingredients and sauce.   Presentation was great. Last time, I had my rolls spread out on the plate in the shape of a giant flower hehe  Service was always fine, never have to wait too long for the dishes. I always come here if I'm in the area.. even if I've already had dinner, just to get a sushi roll to-go!"}
{"text":"Ugh this place is so overrated! It's cool that they cook in front of you and everything but the quality of the food is not great!!! I've been here twice for friends birthday dinners and I don't know why they like it here so much. The service is awful and everything is so overpriced!!! If I never go here again I would be fine with it but I bet one of my girlfriends will drag me here again"}
{"text":"We hit up nakama in the southside for my birthday.  Went on a friday night, the crowd wasnt too bad.  Nakama is a place ive been by a bunch of times and always wanted to give it a try.    For the money, what it was, and coming from Westmoreland county it was really not worth it for me.  The habachi was decent but no different than the places in monroeville or greensburg.  We also had sushi was was decent but nothing fantastic."}
{"text":"I used to love nakama and would go all the time. Unfortunately, I will not be going back. The main reason for this is mostly due to the fact that they charge you $4 more for fried rice and don't even include noodles. Meanwhile their prices for most of the hibachi meals are already higher compared to saga or ichiban. Secondly our chef was super average. He didn't do anything cool and didn't even acknowledge that their was a little girl's birthday at our table. But I cannot stress enough how ridiculous it is that they charge you for fried rice. No other hibachi restaurant ever does that, and if they do they at least provide you with noodles. So I ordered the filet mignon and that came with dry terrible white rice and a small portion of vegetables and that came to $28.50.  If you go 5 miles down the road you can go to ichiban and they will give you a combo meal of filet and shrimp with fried rice and noodles for 27.95. Unreal rip off."}
{"text":"No! Just no on the hibachi. The sushi was ok but overshadowed by the horrible experience in the back at the hibachi area that we couldn't really enjoy it. Overpriced, badly cooked...yep, bad hibachi shrimp. Way overdone and chewy. The chicken as well. The \"soup\" was made from a buillion cube.the salad was a nasty glob of something on some shitty lettuce. And our server was nice and attentive but too busy because they were understaffed. Finally, our hibachi \"chef\" said not a word nor did he smile. I think maybe he's there against his will. All this for $250! No thanks. Steer clear. They should be out of business soon and something decent in that nice location."}
{"text":"Light dinner just Shrimp and fried rice, but it was Great! The service was good and the Chief was excellent."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with my experience here the other night.  We were there for a birthday dinner and made reservations a week in advance.  When we arrived, we were told it would still be another 15 minutes as they were a little backed up.  We were okay with that, but we didn't end up getting seated until 45 minutes after our reservation.  The hostess then tried to tell us the reason was because our whole part wasn't there, which we all were at the time I checked us is.  So that was a little off-putting that she lied to us.  Our party ordered several glasses of sangria and it was very watered down and not good at all.  We told our waitress who then told us that their sangria does get watered down towards the end of the night.  We all had one drink from the sangria and asked for a different drink.  She got us different drinks, but would not remove the charges for the sangria, even though none of us drank it.    Overall, I was not very satisfied with the service.  I will probably only go there now for the sushi as a takeout item."}
{"text":"The hanalei roll is my favorite sushi roll anywhere ever. Sushi is always fresh. Hibachi  is average. I don't get why people like the atmosphere. I like going here only when it's not very busy."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nakama for years now. I have never thought the hibachi was anything special, especially since you're paying that much for it.   Now onto the sushi, while it isn't fantastic, it is on the better side for Pittsburgh. Definitely not my favorite, but it's consistent and good. Whenever I have a craving and don't want to get all dressed up for the night, Nakama is my go to.   Service is alright here, rarely is it quick, so make sure you have some time to spend. It is definitely pricey, for 4 rolls and 2 beers it was close to $80."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were so happy when this opened nearby because after the change in the taste and serving size of sushi and sashimi at jimmy wan's, there were only a few choices left.  So far our experience here has been great!  The hibachi here is one of the best tasting I've ever had. The chefs are entertaining and service has been consistently good even at the bar area.  You can order sushi at the hibachi section as well.  The bar area is open seating and has quick service.  They have a lot of beer on draft about 20 and good ones too.  I have yet to try their cocktails.    Happy hour is half off appetizers and a dollar off draft beers.  I think also a dollar off some of their martinis?  The last time we dined here, the sushi chef, steve, did a great job on presentation and even came up to our table.  We were also able to use the $10off $50 dinner coupon from the clipper magazine.  They have a good amount of space at the bar area but can get a little crowded at the hibachi area.  Overall, happy with this restaurant and would recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Nakama has the swanky thing down, but otherwise? The food is just par. I've never been impressed with any of the rolls, soups, or appetizers.  Furthermore, I don't like places that DOUSE their sushi in sauces. It's like they're purposely hiding the actual taste of the fish. This place is ok, but nothing really special."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Nakama, and our experience was less than ideal. I first made the mistake of believing I could have a calm and quiet meal here on a Saturday night. The restaurant was very loud and hectic. We were seated at a hibachi table with six (clearly intoxicated) people after being denied a non-hibachi table.  The process to get our food took very long, so be prepared to dedicate a good portion of your time just sitting and waiting if it's a weekend night. I ordered the Veggie Roll as a starter. As one of the only appealing vegetarian sushi options on the menu, I decided to give it a try. Overall, it tasted pretty much like any vegetable roll I've had in the past. Nothing too special but decent. For my entree, I ordered the Vegetable Delight with tofu. The tofu was not crispy like I would expect, but still very tasty. The vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The yum yum sauce stole the show, truthfully. My boyfriend started with the Spicy Typhoon roll which was a disappointment. It was mostly rice and deep-fried batter. For his entree, he ordered the Hibachi Shrimp which is on par with any other hibachi shrimp meal. The portion sizes are big enough to take home and make another meal out of it - always a plus. We opted out of dessert after we were told the only option was freezer burnt chocolate ice cream (A for honesty, I guess)  Overall, the prices were average when it came to the quality of the food, however, the entire experience will probably deter me from returning anytime soon.  FYI, you get a free appetizer if you sign up for their mailing list, but they will not accept it unless the coupon is physically printed out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good bar/wine selection.  Sushi was great. Very yuppie and young professionals crowd.  My only complaint comes from the service.  We were seated at a hibachi table and then told unless the majority of us were getting hibachi we would have to sit at the sushi bar. I wouldn't have had a problem with this but the place was not that crowded and my party of 4 ended up spending a lot of money on sushi and drinks so its difficult for me to understand how they wouldn't accommodate us at a table.  Additionally, they forgot my appetizer and made no effort to apologize at the end of the night.  Great atmosphere, food and location. Improve your service."}
{"text":"Yummy! Clean, lots of options, good beer selection,  nice music playing, great atmosphere, prices were a little high for sushi (about $2 more a roll than usual). Overall nice date night."}
{"text":"It's good. The rolls are better than the sashimi although one time we had some really nice(and surprising) maguro. We always get the hamachi jalape√±o roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when I say the rolls are better than the sashimi. It's still enjoyable. Good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis. Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.  You can go here and watch the pens game AND eat a roll.  Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.  4.5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone"}
{"text":"From the service to the food everything is great. One of my favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"Well... this place has lost it's luster for me. Everything that used to taste high quality and fresh tastes just okay now. The sushi isn't that great anymore. The habachi just isn't the same.  What happened? Did I change? Did this place change? I think it's a little of both. Maybe I can compare it to a relationship. Yes, that's it. Things were awesome at first. We were in love and everything was just perfect. The sushi was fantastic and fresh. The habachi was so delicious I wanted to lick my plate.  Then over time things started to deteriorate. The sushi didn't taste like my beloved Penn Ave Fish, my new amore. The habachi was missing something. Did the soup recipe change? Not as much flavor. Did the portions get smaller. Where did my sprouts go?! Things started to head south...  The last straw was the whole atmosphere or Club Nakama we'll call it. The music is pulsating techno. The crowd is judge-y. The service is lacking. And the food, it's nothing special. Sad, because what once was, is no more:(  It's time to break-up. We had a good run. We may run into each other once in a while and be friendly, but for now, it's time we take a break. Might be for good this time. You never know...."}
{"text":"Stopped here after having a disappointing happy hour somewhere else.    Surprised happy hour went later than typical.  Food and drinks was good, and fair prices.    Chill atmosphere, and bar staff had good timing."}
{"text":"This is your typical hibachi place.  The Spider roll was a lot of imitation crab meat, but it was very nicely rolled and presented well. It was a slightly crunchy soft shell crab.  We shared a triple combo and the chef was confused? / annoyed? that we were sharing...but we were glad we did in the end...between the two of us, we STILL had food left over.  Started us each out with a bowl of miso soup, and it had fried onions and mushrooms in it, which was different, and appreciated.  The salad was good with a yummy sauce and mixed greens, carrots and tomatoes. On the better side of the salads I've had like this.  Our combo had steak, shrimp, and chicken...and it was just... a TON of rice and a tonnn of veggies. It was delicious, but as usual it was on the saltier side. That is hibachi for you, though. Pretty good.  Our server didn't really put on a show. Not sure if he knew English that well. He did all the demos, but didn't interact with us too much as I've been used to in the past."}
{"text":"All I had here was sushi which I found to be okay. Between the two of us, we got the Boston Roll and the Rainbow Roll. Rainbow roll was really good, except one of the pieces of fish tasted a bit slimy to me, so that was a little unsettling. Rest of the roll was great, however. The Boston roll though was very underwhelming. It was supposed to have cream cheese in it, but for the life of us, we could not taste the cream cheese! How are you going to advertise cream cheese as one of your key ingredients when there's basically no cream cheese except for maybe in one measly piece? Quite disappointing.  Service was good. Our waitress was nice, quick, and efficient. Just how servers should be. A little on pricier side though, so watch for that.  Bottom line: sushi-wise, this place is okay. I won't be craving it, but if someone were to invite me out to dinner there, I wouldn't put up a fuss. It's not a place I would go out of my way to eat at."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice.  Made reservations right from the app and we went straight to our table.  We had a new waitress, but she wasn't bad.  We ordered and our sushi was out in probably 10 min!  Very fast for the amount we ordered.  The presentation and taste were both excellent.  All around a good sushi/hibachi"}
{"text":"Stopped by here today for food during OpenStreetsPGH! Prices are a little expensive but also sushi is usually expensive in general, especially at restaurants like these.  I got the dragon roll and my friend got the Hawaiian style roll. They were good but not anything spectacular. I think my check came out to around $16 for my one roll alone.   Service was really nice and attentive since they weren't super busy. However, the table we sat at had a spilled soy sauce puddle and a soaked menu. And the little side dishes for sauces were dirty and not cleaned well. It's disappointing because this seems like a \"fancier\" establishment that would focus on keeping their tables/dishes clean."}
{"text":"A group of four of us went to dinner before a show in the south side. We alerted our server to our time window and she said no problem. Our servers attentiveness was minimal and we didn't require a lot. Our meals were okay but nothing special. When the bills came our prices were different than on the menu and when we asked our server about it she told us that we each had a $3.50 up charge for ordering fried rice rather than the white rice the meals came with. Our server never mentioned the up charge and she asked us which type of rice we would prefer! She was very rude about it in the end and never apologized or anything. We will spend our money elsewhere when we go to the next show."}
{"text":"I go here a few times a month, mostly because I think the bar scene is probably one of the most fun in Pittsburgh.   It gets pretty crowded especially on the weekends, but the staff does a good job especially after you go there a few times and they know who you  are.  It's the only place I know of in Pittsburgh that on any given day (even a monday or tuesday) there will be a good crowd at the bar with a higher girl to guy ratio than the usual dudefest at most bars.  The hibachi is better than most.  It's definitely better than benihana, but probably not as good as Shogun in Monroeville.  The only thing I don't like about the hibachi (or any hibachi) is that after the meal you smell like a diner short order cook because of the oil from the grill.  The other menu items are pretty average at best.  The marinated beef tips and chicken lettuce wraps are okay appetizers.  The edaname is pretty hard to mess up and the miso soup is about average.  The sushi is awful.  I mean I guess the rolls are edible, but you can hide the quality by adding a lot of junk to cover up the flavor.  The sashimi (whish is really all that I order) I found to be really poor quality and the way it was sliced was not at all how sashimi should be sliced.  I really don't understand how this place wins best overall restaurant and best sushi  in Pittsburgh.  It really makes no sense.  Most of the people I know agree that the hibachi is good, but overall the restaurant isn't that good and the sushi not good at all.  However, I have a  friend who is one of the chefs assures me that the quality of ingredient is good.  Overall, I suggest if you eat here the hibachi is pretty good and fun if  you are having a sit down dinner.  If you are eating at the bar try to stick to the edamame or maybe one of the appetizers mentioned.  I strongly suggest staying away from the sushi, but if you  must stick to the most basic of rolls (california roll, etc.).  In fact, if you are not sitting down for hibachi go eat at Dish on the same street and head to Nakama only for the bar."}
{"text":"I went to the hibachi with a few friends here on a weeknight, and I didn't try the sushi so I can't speak to it.  It was pretty packed and indeed, it was very loud and very dark.  You seriously might want to bring a flashlight to read the menu (I'm not joking).  There were only 4 of us at the hibachi table, so the  fun factor was pretty dulled down, but it didn't help that you couldn't really hear what the guy was trying to say anyway.  The server had a hard time hearing me as well, but my order of chicken was correct.  So as for the food: Salad - was well saturated with ginger dressing -I mean they must have tossed it with a good amount of dressing before bringing it out.  The dressing was good, but definitely not that good.  Soup - salted and fine, nothing notable. Shrimp flambe - chewy, tasteless, didn't even have the butter flavor. Rice - steamed and fine Chicken and veggies - dry dry dry chicken, veggies were good, and the flavors on the veggies were very good.   Sauces - okay The ladies room: Pretty clean, and also staffed.  Bottom line for me - I wouldn't come back here on my own volition - there are other places in Pgh I would try first."}
{"text":"Way Way Way over-rated.  This is not a place to have an enjoyable dinner.  However, if your'e the type of a person who loves shaving your face with alcohol, then this is a place for you.  This place is noisy and dark.  I could hardly read the menu but luckily I reviewed the menu online before I went.  The food price is outrageous but if your goal was to impress a date, then that's fine.  Then again, why would you want to bring a date here since you will have a hard time talking to him/her since this place is so noisy.  The Hibachi chef that we ended up with looked like a Mexican that could hardly speak English.  His skill sucks and couldn't even do the onion volcano correctly.  This is the very basic thing and looking at him trying to make one is pathetic."}
{"text":"Nakama has OK sushi.   Nakama is noisy, the waiters take forever to serve you, and it's way overpriced. If you want authentic sushi go to CHAYA THE BEST SUSHI IN THE BURGH!"}
{"text":"$60 for takeout and I've had better food from the #1 ChinaHouse. Portion sizes were stingy and a joke for the price - It's like there was a nationwide shortage of shrimp. $4 for mushroom flambe that consisted of 8 sliced up pieces(total rip off). Tastes were bland and non-existent - onion soup tasted like Swanson beef broth straight out of the can. Things were left out of the order no soy sauce for the California roll, no chopsticks, and total lack of service. I would expect more from a so-called 5 star Japanese Steakhouse. I work hard for my money and will never waste it again on this hype. Save your time and money and just go to Ichiban."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is review is for the SUSHI BAR ONLY   Went here last Saturday and stopped in for a quick bite at the sushi bar, mainly to try it out because I've heard so many good things about Nakama.   To be honest, my experience was exactly like the two star Yelp rating means: Meh. I've experienced better.  Two of the 4 rolls I ordered were loosely made which as a sushi lover I found to be kinda unacceptable. One had an end piece that frankly would have gotten the sushi chef a failing grade by anyone's standards - it was falling apart and had nothing but rice and paper on it despite this being a fairly pricey signature roll. One of my sushi pieces was similarly falling apart - the rice hadn't been packed enough and the salmon was just slapped on there.   I would even have sent those back if I could have found a waitress or been able to hear myself think. They were just too crowded to give the proper amount of love to each dish, and as you know, a dish prepared without love is bound to be lacking.  The noise and my seat in relation to the crowded door area just made me want to get out of there. I was bumped several times by people weaving their way past each other, at one point someone bumped my elbow as I was raising a cup of hot sake. Hmm ... a splash of hot sake? ... let's say it's not my favorite sensation in the crotch area.  Anyway, the staff was friendly when you were able to flag someone down and I am sure everyone was doing their best, but think this place is highly overrated - making it over crowded - making the whole experience that much less enjoyable for everyone.  Hope your experience is better than mine - the place should have been better from what I've been told by Nakama fans. Good luck!!"}
{"text":"It's just ok. Not something I'll come back to or recommend. The sushi was plain and simple, not tasty but not bad. Some sushi places are simply dangerous, but this place seems safe but boring.   Overall, if you have a choice, take a pass."}
{"text":"I really thought that Nakama was a great place.   We went there for Valentines day. They had great specials and they also provided a complimentary rose with your reservation. It really seemed like they cared about the little details.   The restaurant was very clean and decorated nicely. It has a large bar and sushi in the front. I really liked the open design and tall ceilings because it gave the feeling of having a lot of space.   The wait staff was very friendly and very prompt with service and bringing drinks.   I wouldn't say that it was any more busy/noicey then any other hibachi type restaurant. These always draw crowds and tend to be noisy. The pricing is also on par with any other restaurant of this type.   If I had a complaint was it did take a little long for our cook to come out.  They did serve soup and salad quickly.   I would go again and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Went out with a group of friends, had a great time.....food was good, a little too salty for my taste but no real complaints. I will say, after having hibachi many times....the meat was NOT overlooked!!!! Had the Butcher's choice, strip and chicken were proper temps, tender and juicy....Miso soup was tasty, salad over dressed....my appetizer was the lettuce wraps, way too salty. Would go back but definately not a 1st choice in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"I love me some sushi, and the dragon roll (sans cream cheese) was great, but im pretty sure it wasnt supposed to be in a soy wrap as our other roll was (salmon & spicy tuna, something). We also ordered sashimi which was great but sushi guy with the green eyes, why do you look at me like I'm stupid when I say \"my miso soup is cold.\"  It was super busy, so sitting at the sushi bar with the door constantly swinging open and the freezing air flowing in and out was pretty annoying, and the hip hop on someones ipod was kinda random, but overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. The food isn't good and it's super pretentious. Plus there's that whole racist and sexist dress code policy (see other recent reviews). I haven't been in years, but I will certainly NEVER go again."}
