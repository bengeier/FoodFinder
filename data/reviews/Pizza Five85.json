{"text":"My sister took us here after raving about how good this place is. It doesn't look like much, but i was really surprised!!! The pizza is amazing and i love that they just build it in front of you. Five stars"}
{"text":"Went in to try it out. There was one person working. She was making an order for the costumer in front of me. Two pizzas. Meanwhile, another person walks in. I've now been waiting for about ten minutes. No hello, welcome, how are you? She asks me very firmly what can I get started for you? Half way through me finishing up my sentence which is...the pasta please. She moves on to the next guy in line behind me. She clearly is overwhelmed due to being under staffed for lunch hour!! He says a comment like maybe you should get more help. She then asks me what meat I want after starting on the guy behind me order which is a pizza. I tell her chicken. She looks up and says I'm out of chicken. At this point I've invested 15 to 20 minutes standing in line only my order hasn't even started. At this point clearly frustrated I ask her well how long is it going to take to get chicken? She responds three hours! I didn't respond who's your where's your manager? She then response I am the manager! At this point I scuff because I was clearly upset and she doesn't even offer anything else? considering the fact that this location is located inside a busy plaza which tends to draw a lot of traffic in the lunch hour you would think that one they would be more staffed, two more prepared and three remember about customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I love the pizza here, and the toppings selection is ike no other! Keep up the good work! :D -Roadhog380"}
{"text":"First and foremost they suck and I believe them to be bait and switch artist!!!   I was going to go to Chipotle next-door for dinner but the line was long (because it is good). The hawker on the side walk convinced me this was a Italian equivalent to Chipotle and they were running a special for $5.85 that was normally $7.75. DONE I'm in!   First your sign is confusing as hell there were 5 people standing there trying to figure it out. It had more words than a Twitter post and this review. But it should have had 8; \"pizza one size any sauce any topping $7.75\".  I built my pizza and headed to the cashier were the girl from our side was now on register.   \"$10.53 please\", she said.   \"You just told me it was $5.85. How expensive is the drink?\"  \"Do you have the coupon\", she asked?  \"You didn't tell me I needed the coupon\"   \"Well you do\", she said.   At this point the manager slowly faded into the background. Eventually hiding in the back room.  So I'll never be back again!!!!  P.S. If I was Chipotle I would sue these idiots for trade infringement and libel!!!"}
{"text":"This place has only been open a week or so, and I really hope it's here for the long haul. Fresh ingredients and lots of them. Make your own pizza, pasta, or salad (think Chipotle or Subway). They were very nice and the pizza was very tasty. I will definitely be back here often."}
{"text":"The pizza is Peter Piper quality. If you like good pizza learn from my mistake. Skip this place.  The sauce is nasty. They put too much on and it kills any potential for a decent bite.  The veggies are average and the meats are OK--glad they have chicken as an option.  No matter what you put on it, the sauce overpowers the pizza as a whole.  Much better pizza over at Jimmy and Joes for lunch. Dinner? Grab Grimaldis."}
{"text":"Pizza is good price is reasonable clean place friendly staff only bad thing about is they have 1 person running the whole place from making to cooking and register to run the food out the customers. So the food takes a little too long"}
{"text":"The staff was nice n friendly. Pizza was good. Need a few more cheese options but they had pasta as well. I will come back for a good pizza with a friendly staff. Location does not have much foot traffic. Overall it was a good pizza with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very good customer service, tasty food cannot go wrong with pizza five85! You can make your own pizza, pasta, and salad for quite and affordable price I love it"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I always feel well taken care of when I come in. The employees are all so nice. Customer service is #1 over here. I see some people on here are talking negatively about the pizza comparing it to grimaldi's and whatnot. This pizza and grimaldi's are two completely different types of pizza. If you expect to get grimaldi's quality for 7.99 then you clearly don't understand the market this place is made for. Hands down, pizza five85 is the best pizza compared to anything in that price bracket. In my opinion."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for a late lunch. We were super excited because we love the competitor, Fired Pie a few miles away, also in Chandler. We were greeted right away which was nice. The space is very modern and cool looking. On the walls were TVs that showed Yelp, Facebook and Twitter feeds. Hint: Go right immediately in the door. It is open to guessing so if you go straight you are actually at the register, not the ordering area. It is tough to tell where to start when you walk in. We ordered a salad and pizza. We were asked if it was for here or to go. I said here. The salad then came from a cooler below the items you pick from -  in a to go container. If the salad is in a premade to go container, why does it matter where we ate it??  This should have been my first clue. We asked for regular sauce on our pizza and they kept insisting we put olive oil on it so it wouldn't burn. I said no to which the gal said, you can't taste the olive oil, it's just there. If you don't put it on it will burn. This should have been my second clue. I said no, I didn't want it.  I picked the toppings to my salad and we did the same for the pizza. The salad was ok but the chicken on the salad was extremely tough to chew. The pizza was ok but a little doughy in the middle. As we sat eating I watched a man clean the stainless steel with a chemical in a metal container and a rag. All above where the pizza gets cut . After another crowd of people came through I watched a second gentleman clean the stainless steel on the front of the oven doing the same. As we were leaving there was a man standing in the doorway to the back of the kitchen tucking his shirt into his pants. Food was meh at best. A couple employees were super nice and helpful while some appeared to be on their first day on the job, not so helpful and knew very little about anything. I asked what the Five85 stood for since the prices are $7.95 ( if I remember correctly). She said she didn't really know but it was probably just a name they made up. She didn't seem to know much about the company she worked for and had a very difficult time ringing us up. Can't say I would recommend this place or go back. Sadly, we were so excited too. Bummer."}
{"text":"I don't get the theory here. You go in and tell them what you want on your pizza. And how is this different from any other pizzaria?  They all have you build your own. That is what a pizza place is all about.  Pizza was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Just had the Alfredo pasta. It was great. The only thing I would change is adding more sauce before it's made because they have no way of heating any additional sauce up for you after it's made. The service is awesome. Everyone is friendly and energetic. The food overall was good and you can choose all of your toppings. Great drink options for the kiddos. The bathrooms stayed cleaned despite the big rush for the FREE FOOD! I definitely will be coming here for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Fresh and many choices! Cooked and made to your liking. Overall it's pretty good. Still doesn't compare to Spinato's or Oregano's. Would come again if the wife was out of town, quick and easy"}
{"text":"I've tried the pizza and pasta.  The price is right for a quick meal whee I can get exactly what I want. It's especially good for families where everyone wants something different."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. It's awesome, flat rate for the pizza made in front of you and the price is perfect. The pizza is amazing and fresh. And the portions are perfect for everyone to get their own. Found my new favorite place for lunch."}
{"text":"I love this new pizza place!  I love the concept of having  smorgasbord of delectable items to craft the perfect PERSONAL pizza at a fair price.    Oh sure,  the personal size pizzas are large enough to share if you like that sort of thing... But also the perfect size to provide you with the right amount of left overs for the next day. And while there are actually a few great pizza joints around,  having to order a family size pizza to share usually means someone has to compromise on at least one of their favorite toppings... And from my prospective,  it's usually me... MOM.   The crust is so thin and crispy,  and having the choice of butter,  garlic butter or olive oil is perfect,  in addition to the sauce of your choice.    I should back up a moment and clarify that this is not just a pizza place.  You can craft your own pasta or salad in this same fashion as well which I will definitely try in the future.   The topping options are endless... They even have shrimp and salmon!  And it doesn't matter how many toppings you choose,  the price is set.  I believe we paid $7.75 per pizza.  Not a bad value,  especially if you make two meals out of this.   The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars was because they were a little  slow.  There seemed to be only 2 people working.  That being said,  it was Halloween evening and the guys who were working were very nice and extremely customer friendly!  They were just working their tails off.   I am certain this place will be a new staple for us.  I look forward to all the fun gourmet combinations I can create!"}
{"text":"Packed up the kids and headed down to try a new pizzeria. Called in the afternoon they said they would be open until 10 PM. Pulled up at 7 PM and they said sorry we are closed."}
{"text":"This place is like subway or chipotle.  Pick pasta, salad, or pizza and then all your sauces, cheese meat, and vegetables.  Lots of choices, wish they had a few more toppings.  Cooked while you wait-- fast!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was our favorite pizza place until the last couple of times where my 3 year old had a hankering for pizza (right now) after long days at work and school and talking about it all the way home, they were either out of main ingredients or closed by 6pm. Guess they're not going to make it, they're not even on Facebook trying to be known in such a busy neighborhood. Super disappointing.  Theirs wood burning oven made the best thin crust pizza that reminded me of my old fave in New Mexico."}
{"text":"To quote Kevin Malone from The Office: \"It tastes like a hot circle of garbage\"  P.S. Pizza is my favorite food and I will eat anything from a $20 gourmet pizza to a $5 Little Caesars but this pizza, I would never eat again. So disappointed. But hey, they people that work there are super nice. Awesome customer service, the food is just gross."}
{"text":"I have now been here 3 times since they opened. We were drawn to Pizza Five85 based on their offers of free and discounted pizza as they train staff and get the word out to the community. Overall, our feelings about this place are positive. The concept is great! There are lots of options of pizza toppings to choose from that can also be applied to pasta or salad if you choose.  We are able to feed three of us (two adults and one toddler) with one pizza, so that makes it less than $10 for a family meal, which is a great price. We ordered the pasta once for our daughter and it is a large portion that led to leftovers for her. On one of the free pizza days, our pizza was burned on the bottom, but that has not been the case for us since. This place is family-friendly with great potential. Sometimes it seems a little crazy there for staff but I think everyone is on a learning curve in the beginning.   My only recommendations would be to add more veggie options like broccoli and artichoke hearts. It would also be helpful to identify where the line starts since you have two entrances. Keep up the good customer service Pizza Five85 and we'll keep coming back and recommending you to others."}
{"text":"Glad I came here... Only because I know it's not that good enough to come back. The notion of a \"chipotle-of-pizza-AND-pasta\" was exciting but unfortunately, expectations weren't met.   The pasta was probably only okay because we were REALLY hungry. It was quite bland and the bits of Cajun chicken they have are dry. I will say the pizza isn't half bad. I liked the BBQ sauce, it was nice a tangy. The pizza was crispy, not soggy. But there are just much better create-your-pizza places out there.   Another word of advice when coming here: do not go here if you are in a hurry. My bf and I had a show to attend and were looking for something quick. Seeing that there was no line when we entered, we thought this would be fast but it seemed like the employee was working in snail mode. The pizza takes about 10+ minutes to cook as well.   The 2 stars I gave were for the smiles and kindness of the employees. I appreciated it."}
{"text":"Went there with my partner, was going to go to the Chipotle next door but this place had just opened up.  The pizza, pasta, and salad are all the same price - and assumable the same size - so we got two pizzas and a salad thinking we'd share the salad and have more than enough pizza to bring home as leftovers.  The pizza ordering experience is similar to ones we'd had in Vegas, basically choose your crust type, sauce, cheese, meat, veggie / other topping.  It's the same process for the salad and pasta, same sauce / veggie / other toppings as the pizza.  The pizza itself is quite good. The crust has a unique and delicious flavor that, in and of itself, would be worth coming here.  The toppings and cheese are fresh and delicious.  The salad, on the other hand, at the same cost as a pizza, is ridiculous.  It's a small side salad at best, even adding a number of toppings.  Although, again, the veggies are fresh and delicious, it's 10 bites at best.  Considering this isn't a side, but something someone would order as their entree, paying $8 for this just isn't justified remotely and almost ruins the whole experience.  The ambiance is quaint, nicely designed, until you realize an entire wall is dedicated to showing their awesome social media postings with flashing LED strips.  So basically think 4 or 5 TVs, each devoted to one social media outlet, with rolling positive reviews raving about the pizza.  When you step back and look at everything, this part of the restaurant is clearly out of place.  I don't need to be force-fed a restaurant's positive reviews while attempting to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Oh my!  Went here today with my husband and we ABSOLUTELY loved it.   We got a pizza and a salad. If you haven't tried it and don't know the concept here it is: you choose a pizza, salad, or pasta and load it up with any toppings you want for one price. And when I say any toppings I mean any toppings. We got meatball, pepperoni, bacon, ham, onions, jalapeños and olives on our pizza. They had a ton of fresh toppings for the salad... asparagus, roasted red peppers, cilantro, chicken, romaine, mushrooms, apples. I could seriously go on and on. The dressing we got on the salad was a balsamic vinaigrette which was so yummy. Dare I say one of the most delicious o have had in some time?   I was worried the pizza would take too long to make but they use a thin crust that they pop into a wood burning type oven and in three minutes, BAM! Your pizza is ready.   Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The price was very reasonable, especially considering that there is no limit to what you can pile on. $7.75 for a pizza, salad, or pasta.   We are thinking about making this our weekly pizza place. Its cheaper than our usual pizza joint and healthier. GIVE THIS PLACE A SHOT!"}
{"text":"This is a fun pizza place for AZ, and comparable to its neighboring Chipotle and Smash Burger. While the ingredients and pizza itself, like Chipotle or Smash, are nothing to shake a stick at, the food is good quality for the price- especially if you are adventurous.   Not my favorite pizza or dinner place, but a novel inexpensive experience if your friends are getting a burrito and you're in a different mood."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in on my lunch break to try out the new Italian equivalent of Chipotle. I was excited about being able to order a salad the why I want....well for starters the lettuce is exactly what I would consider fresh. The man took a pre prepared to go container of lettuce out of the cooler and proceeded to build my salad. I ordered shrimp, chicken with ceasar dressing.....he gave me Italian dressing.  When I got back to work I was incredibly disappointed to discover that the lettuce was soggy (like it had been washed and stored while wet). The shrimp was FROZEN and I found a piece of PLASTIC!!! A $10 charge and I was left with a wet, runny, poor excuse for a salad. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely closed, with \"Available\" signs in the windows. Too bad, because I thought it had promise."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the build your own pasta today but wasn't very impressed. You can choose from two types of pasta and two sauces. You then choose your meat, cheese and veggies. They then warm it up for you on a skillet and voila you have your pasta. The problem was it was bland and not very memorable.   The only bright point was the person working behind the counter. He was friendly and fast even though he was scrambling to take orders since two employees called in sick."}
{"text":"Cool concept. Its like a \"Subway\" or \"Chipotle\" for pizza or salads. The pizzas are only one size, fairly small. The salads could use more toppings. But all was good especially for the price"}
{"text":"My original intent was to go to Smashburger, but the lure of a build-your-own pizza place was irresistible.  It's very nice pizza, and for an extra buck or so, you can get large shrimp on it. Having done so once, I don't think I'd do the shrimp again -- but they do have the ingredients to do an Austrian ham-and-corn pizza, and I recall they can come close to reproducing the apple-walnut pizza that was so good at Piezano's back in the day.  Staff is adorable, ambience is your basic industrial chic."}
{"text":"I was trying to get to the pho restaurant nearby when I spotted this hidden brick oven. The place is spacious but it seems under marketed. I have passed by this place every day and not seen it till now.   Once inside I wad greeted well. The options are very straight forward but some how still confusing. I ordered a pizza. The guy slopped a lot of strange things around. He did not give me a full scoop of sauce. But they are gracious with the cheeses. As for the salmon on a pizza I was surprised by both that the server had never tried it and that it worked well with a lot of other dishes, say for the salad or pasta. Nevertheless they serve no alcohol but do have some select drinks like coconut water. He bedazzled me with how much basil he put on it. I think the amount wad a solid steel. My pizza has a nice crust with fine black marks that stain your fingers. You cannot eat this pizza with a plastic knife or fork so don't plan on it. Otherwise with the food great and the price not bad I sat down in plastic chairs. No booths in the whole place? The To-go section is great. Plates for serving but the napkins could use some help."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant!  Just like Chipotle, except for pizza.  Instead of feeling limited to the type of pizza you can order, Pizza Five85 gives you the freedom of creating your pizza from scratch.  From the type of dough, marinara or pesto sauce or both!  It's an awesome place for lunch, doesn't take much time to make your pizza and they're personal size pizzas, with an affordable price.  Check this spot out if you're looking for a some pizza but don't have the time!!"}
{"text":"The Jeff Spicoli lookalike behind the counter informed us that pizza five 85 is set up a lot like chipotle for Italian food. The idea is brilliant and they let you choose between a pizza, pasta or salad. You then get to pick all of the ingredients chipotle style. The ingredients range from meatballs, chicken, sausage, and a whole selection of vegetables. This all sounds awesome until you take a bite.   This is by far the worst pizza and pasta I have ever tasted in my life, including the stuff I make at home and I'm a crappy cook. The marinara used for the pizza and pasta is laughable. It has this disgusting sweet taste to it that tastes like something you would expect from a Peter Piper Pizza or Chuck E Cheese. The pizza dough is pretty much a tortilla, that's how thin it is. When baked, it tastes like a nacho chip with pizza toppings on it.  We ordered the bow tie pasta and it was soggy and overcooked. How do you mess up pasta at an Italian place??? I can't believe how bad this place is. If the word Pizza is in the name of your eating establishment, your pizza better be good. I will never return to this place. Such a shame! It has such a brilliant concept. Too bad the execution is so awful."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this restaurant.The staff was friendly and the food was quick. However, the ingredients were not anything you couldn't throw together yourself and make at home for the same cost ( and personally this pizza lacked all flavor.) I most likely will not dine here again."}
{"text":"They couldn't be bothered to stay open past 8 pm on a Thursday night. Guess I won't bother to be a customer and instead enjoy the packed Chipotle next door."}
