{"text":"Use to be my favorite lil spot..until they hired this little vulgar asshole that loves hockey. Now the wings are over cooked and he shouts profanity and wipes his greasy looking hair while he cooks. I love it when the chic cooks..she is awsome and has a excellent attitude."}
{"text":"First time coming here the food was absolutely delicious best wings I've had and they have like 7 different flavors the blue cheese and ranch dressing were delicious they were home made the blue cheese had big chunks of blue cheese which I've never had before in dressing it was so delicious fresh cut french fries were amazing the BLT sandwich was like no other just one half of a sandwich had more bacon in it than most people and put in a full sandwich very delicious and satisfying       .  the place was clean love the fact that they have windows in there where you look out so you don't feel like you are in a cave I met the owner she was very nice you could tell this wasn't her first rodeo with this type of amazing food and her out going personality this place will go far it's amazing little neighborhood Bar and Gril fresh homemade delicious food  this is hands down the best bar food I've ever had everything made fresh daily it was very comfortable and very cool I was very relaxed when I left lol I didn't even have a drink just went for their amazing food this will now be one of my regular stops"}
{"text":"I use to come here often. The food is great but every time I come here I have to wait 10-20 minutes for service. I see the servers behind the bar talking to each other and I'm ignored. I have stopped coming here because of how bad the service is. I once waited 45 minutes for me food."}
{"text":"Was there a week ago service was unbelievably terrible and the food was cold ...they need to replace the management at this establishment..or it will lose a lot of business...they need someone that knows how to run a business...!!! And don't be Mexican or other minority because you will feel the the racist owner and manager help support this type of behavior..!!! How sad it's 2017 don't you know the Mexican dollar goes a long nowadays ( not pesos) ...stupidity and ignorance...shame on you whom ever owns that dump !!!"}
{"text":"Love the new place! Good drinks, Great Food, can't wait to try everything! Nice Atmosphere and the Staff are very down to earth, they make you feel very welcome unlike its predecessor."}
{"text":"First time here was about a week ago for the soft opening, the staff was all smiles, food was amazing, drinks kept coming. 2 pool tables, nice lounge area inside. The patio area has a cool setup. Excellent service!! Been coming back ever since."}
{"text":"Jukebox with great music and the food served is until 2am and tastes great! Bartender friendly and serves the best drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here cause the reviews of the meals. The service was very slow. The drink order took forever to get to our table. Our order of tater tots were served with only 6 tots on the plate. The club sandwich was good and worth the price paid for it. Then it took a really long time for the check to arrive. I'd be willing to give the place a second try for the bar atmosphere instead of trying for the food only. But I wont fo back for just a meal."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! Hope did a wonderful remolding! Love the drinks, food, staff, and overall atmosphere!! The Glass House is the place to go!! I give The Glass House !!"}
{"text":"I was reading all the wonderful reviews on The Glass House and was pretty excited to check it out. My happiness and excitement about my evening out disappeared suddenly once I saw the menu. The menu consisted of \"Girl Stuff\" and \"Guy Stuff.\" Under the \"Girl\" side was salads, a chicken sandwich, and grilled talapia. While the \"Guy\" menu had a build-your-own-burger, pulled pork sandwich, sliders, and tacos. Who knew that food could be so gender specific? Perhaps \"The Glass House\" is equipped with BIC pens for \"her\" because my dainty hands just cannot grip a regular pen or a burger apparently. Never coming to this establishment ever again and I will sure as hell be spreading the word."}
{"text":"this is a horrible place, the manager/owner Hope is the worst employer. The mistreatment of her employees say it all in how this place is ran and the future of this establishment. Do not want to spend money my money or time at an establishment where the owners do not treat their employees well. 

#horriblerating"}
{"text":"The 2 dollar beef slider was divine. The wings were delicious and at a great price. 

On the contrary, the mug  used to serve my beer was heavy and odd to drink from. The customer service was lackluster. Took my friend and I approximately 30 minutes for somebody to approach us and take our order. The beef sliders came out relatively quickly but our wings took another half hour. 

Overall, good food but horrible service. Won't be back. Place is mediocre and nothing special about it. There is better establishments to have a beer and wings. If you are on a budget this place will have to suffice, it is exceptionally cheap."}
{"text":"Nice new hip bar on the middle west side! Amazing food fresh and not bar like at all."}
{"text":"Good burgers and the service was very friendly.  My first impression was that it was sort of a dive bar.  But the food and drinks were good and the music was loud."}
{"text":"Love this place was looking for a place to watch the game with my kiddos friendly clean good portion of food good prices friendly serves.
Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I love this place .my complements to the chef .the staff is so friendly. Dont miss out by not stopping in you need to experience this place .the glass house is 1 in my book."}
{"text":"Maybe an off night, but seating is slim to none when its packed. Prices were decent, but service was very slow. Beer that was \"on special\" was miss quoted and the table next to us had a major problem with their bill, although I think it was due to people in their party leaving and sticking the others with the tab an the other not being able to pay it.

If you don't like hearing about all the life problems at the table next to you this is not your place. I now know the life struggles of 8 strangers which put a damper on things for us. 

Traditional fried bar food, nothing special."}
{"text":"Chose a seat and ordered my usual, a Cosmo. It was one of the strongest I think I have ever had. lol  Hubby ordered a Moscow Mule.  Small but tasty.  The price reflects the small size so no complaints here. We ordered the fried zucchini. On a whim, our waitress told us that the zucchini was hand cut and hand breaded. This made us happy. However, it was actually frozen, beer battered zucchini which is the norm in this bar atmosphere.  :P I ordered the triple decker BLT.  Yummy,  but the toast really tore my mouth up.  Wish I would have ordered the wrap instead. The tomatoes were ripe and juicy. Hubby left half his burger on his plate. It wasn't that something was wrong with it... it was an okay burger. The patty was pre made which made it somewhat tough. We have never been fans of the pre made patty. This place was an okay place. Good prices on drinks and food. However with all the restaurant/bar choices I still have in this city not sure that I will return."}
{"text":"This wonderful little neighborhood bar is like having a piece of central (the cool part) phoenix on the westside!! Great Service, Great Food, Great Prices and specials.... The owner really cares for the patrons, and it shows in every detail..."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Walked in around 8pm on a Friday and didn't get helped for about 20 min. Wobbling table. Not enough staff. Old tickets on table still as well. I don't know why this place has 5 stars at all. Had to leave after horrid experience."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and can't wait to go back a third time. We live within walking distance so that was a plus, and had seen good reviews online for food so we decided to give it a try. The drinks are GREAT & very reasonably priced (I highly recommend getting a Grape Crush & a Nuts Berries). We've ordered 4 different types of wings so far (they have around 10 or so types to choose from) and all have been GREAT. I also ordered a build your own burger and was incredibly pleased with the results. The burger I got here was comparable to somewhere like Red Robin's gourmet burgers. Incredibly fresh ingredients and a perfectly cooked burger (I prefer mine medium rare). Service times are sometimes a little slower, but nothing that would ever stop me from coming here. This is a wonderful find and I would recommend anyone looking for great food and drinks to come here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It is just the kind of \"bar\" I love. It's cozy but not small. Lots of windows so it never feels confined. They have a BIG and nice covered seating area outside that you can eat, drink and have cigarettes under.

Hope, the owner and a bartender too has been there every time I have come in. Having a bartender you actually 'want' to talk too doesn't sound like a big deal..but it is.

The service is always friendly, quick and my order accurate. There is something to be said for being able to walk into a place, find a seat, order a drink and get what you want. Like I said a moment ago, it doesn't 'sound' like a big deal..till you actually want to go and have a drink and not regret you left you house..

OH, and the food you ask? It is the BOMB/AWESOMEST/insert your favorite superlative here. By the time you find your seat you're going to be thinking more about what smells so damn good than the drink you came in wanting.

Kat, the head cook is AMAZING. Not only is she great at what she does but enjoys what she does as well which comes through in the quality, portions, presentation and most importantly the taste of the food she creates."}
{"text":"It took about 45 minutes to get a dozen wings. I drank about three beers in the meantime, and asked several times where my food was and was told 'it's next' 'it's in the fryer'. FINALLY got the food and the wings weren't even that great. Overall, the service was slow on a slow night and I'm disappointed. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Quality food, exceptional service.  Met a friend for a quick bite.  I had been warned in advance to not judge when I arrived to trust her they had good food.   It is a neighborhood bar with a lot regulars, but welcoming.  Variety of seating and 2 pool tables and clean.   They do a large food service.  Outside seating with misters. Mostly the smoker area.  

Beverage service was quick, they make fresh food, not frozen stuff.   Jack chicken sandwich was awesome and fresh.    Loved the homemade potato chips.    We had the desert cookie with ice cream, it was fresh, warm and delish.  It was large enough to share with entire table.   Server Dorleen was friendly, attentive and did an awesome job attending to all guests.   While not near me, I am confidant I will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my saturday here. loved the music trival that you guys have.. beer prices are reasonable prices.. good place to go and hang out and play pool.. staff was friendly"}
{"text":"First time didn't disappoint the wingz were delicious! Small lil bar with lots of big windows"}
{"text":"Really can't find anything I don't like about this place. The seating for games is good, you can actually reserve booths that hold 6-8 people for football games! Also - good prices on food, the wings... Flavors are excellent, don't care for the way they're kinda soggy after frying, they really should offer a fried then grilled option like some places - that'd make them perfect. The pulled pork sandwiches are amazing, really love their BBQ sauce, also the sliders are good. All in all, welcome spot to the neighborhood! Very happy to come across this spot!!"}
{"text":"I went in to order some wings the bartender MJ immediately started being condescending and rude to. The guy next to me turned to me without me saying a word to him and said she's rude to everybody. I ordered some wings she said it would take 14 minutes 33 minutes later I got them and they were overcooked crispy Critters. I asked her her name and she ignored me. So I asked her again and she said MJ honey sarcastically. I said did you answer me the first time and I just didn't hear you. Then she said to me in front of other customers why are you  yelling at me? All I did is  ask her a question. If I had called her honey it would have been sexist. 

 I told her that I haven't not tipped anyone in over 3 years and that I was not going to tip her. I asked her if she wanted to know why and, she said I know, sarcastically. Then  she said I'm going to start treating everybody else in the bar differently right now. Not me, just everybody else. Another sarcastic comment.

I gave her the chance to apologize but she chose not to. Is she just apologized for her rude Behavior would have tipped her but she didn't care. So I don't care if I go back there."}
{"text":"Clientele is really chill, staff are outstanding! Food might be hit or miss,but lots more hits than misses! Great wings and onion rings, bar has EVERYTHING! Jameson, Bushmills, Jack, Makers, Cointreau, Jim, SoCo- gotta stop writing, gonna go!"}
{"text":"Here for paint night. The thick fries are outstanding! Unfortunately, our onion rings were overdone. The BLT sandwich and the BLT wrap were very good. 

It's a bar about a step up from a dive.

The people are very nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped on for the 1st time a couple of months ago and have been going back at least once a week but usually twice a week. Friendly staff,  great local bar,  great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice little dive,chill crowd.Never disappointed with the food I've tried it all.Wings,wraps , tacos and burgers the beer and drinks are well priced .staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I've had the chips, tacos, sliders, and wings and they've all been wonderful. Summer makes a good Bloody Mary and the breakfast is good, too .
However, the serving staff seems to forget about you once you get your food. Trying to get your bill is tiresome, and so I've ended up sitting for 15 minutes waiting, and waiting. This has happened every single time I've come here which is close to 15 times."}
{"text":"My buddy and I came here for drinks and we were both under the impression that it was just a bar but they also serve food.  He and I sat at a table for 15 minutes chatting until we finally decided that the server wasn't going to help us so we walked to the bar to order our drinks.  The entire layout of the bar was awkward.  It's divided by pool tables and TVS and the bar is off in the corner so you're either encroaching on the patrons sitting at a table or the patrons sitting at the bar, it was uncomfortable.  Even though the place wasn't busy at all we still had to wait on the bartender because he was shooting the shit with the server.  I think a friendly acknowledgement from an employee after being there for 20 minutes would have went a long way.  We finally got our drinks and walked back to our table leaving a trail of spilled tequila shots and beer because the bartender filled them to the brim.  We finished our drinks and the server never came by to see if we wanted more so we left.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food made by a dedicated chef
Drinks taste great and bartenders are amazing [especially Beautimous-Bridgette]
Atmosphere is great and the local crowd is real cool"}
{"text":"Stopped in at this place on a whim and it...wasn't quite what we expected. Maybe we misread all of the descriptions and reviews, but I was expecting more of a classy wine bar type of place. This is a straight up dive bar, albeit a good one. We walked in and saw a group playing pool, an old-style jukebox, and a few pinball machines. However, everyone looked to be having fun and no one was getting rowdy so it was all good.
And the food was WAY better than I expected from the location. We ordered the beer battered mushrooms and I ate my fair share, which is saying something because I don't like mushrooms. The batter was fantastic though, and they were done perfectly. I also ordered the dirty BBQ sandwich and it was amazing. Seriously, order it. The fries were excellent too. Overall this was a pleasant surprise and a great place to pass some time people watching."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is pretty awesome and has great food.  I came here for a friends birthday celebration.  It's a cute place with an outdoor patio.  They have a great selection of beers.  The people working there were super friendly and on point.  They were pretty busy and I was in a good sized party of people but we never waited long for a beverage or anything else we needed.  

I was really surprised with the food.  I expected crappy bar food but the food they have is really good!  I had the fried chicken sandwich with onion rings and it was awesome - the waitress told me that they hand cut the onions and batter them right before they put them in the fryer.... ummmm yeah... they were really good!  I tried some french fries someone else had and I think they were hand cut and awesome as well.  

This place is super comfortable and is put together really well.  Very clean.  Decorated well.  Good music playing.  I wouldn't consider it a dive but I could easily see this being a great place to hang out all night and have a nice time.  The prices were excellent too - all kinds of specials - but even without the specials, everything was priced good.  Great comfortable place to relax and have a drink and some great food with really nice people running the place."}
{"text":"Great and friendly environment very mellow and chill. My boyfriend and I saw it in the side and thought we'd stop in. It was a great choice. The bar food was good! And for the price the nachos were yummy! Will be coming back and do recommend if you just want a little dive bar!"}
{"text":"This used to be Connolly's back in the day, but now has a facelift. The inside and outside have been completely updated and it looks great. Food was pretty damn good, although a bit on the pricey side from the atmosphere. Tried the 5-0 pork sandwich and had a few brews. Long story short...great food and ambiance, but overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have only been here to eat once and to pick up to go food once. I've only tried a few items, but am so addicted to the mushroom skewers! You have to try them cause you'll experience a total mouthgasm...  I have tried the  fried zucchini, wings, sliders and mozzarella sticks. They add shredded cheese on top of the mozzarella sticks! The wings are delicious but I was too full to enjoy the sliders.   They have great plating skills and I have not had any issues."}
{"text":"The food is great the beer is wonderful but the Mexican waitress with a bad attitude killed the positive vibe."}
{"text":"Unfortunately,  the service has been horrindous the last two times. Tonight much worse than that! Party of six, no service for over 25 mins literally  sitting there. Off crowd as well! We all walked out! Done! Won't be back. Plenty of other tables very annoyed they hadn't received their drinks or food."}
{"text":"I have always loved the food at the glass house. Today we went there to find out the menu changed and they no longer make the Guinness battered onion rings. I am completely bummed, they were the best onion rings I have ever had and I would tell everyone about them. Please bring them back!!"}
{"text":"This place has some good food and drinks. I'd definitely recommend it for that. The service my group and I got wasn't the greatest, though. I was also a little upset that my side of coleslaw had no sauce mixed in. It was just chopped cabbage and carrots. Other than that everything else was fine."}
{"text":"Service was trash. But the ranch and honey mustard were goat status. Good food and decent beer prices"}
{"text":"The wings are good of cooked right but the service is shit! On one occasion my hubby called in some wings while I was at the grocery store and I stopped in to pick them up a half hour later they were still not ready and I was ignored while waiting never offered or asked me if I wanted a drink! Over 45 mins for some damn wings really. Then a few weeks later we meet my dad there we all order wings at the same time well they completely forgot my dads wings and took that off the bill. I think the service could be a lot better!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Dive. Surprisingly amazing burgers! Live Music, Darts, Etc.. Cute little spot for sure."}
{"text":"Primarily, my close friend and I  decided to give this place a chance after realizing it had four stars on Yelp. 
In addition, we were a bit skeptical the restaurant was really 4 stars worthy based off of the horrible reviews for customer service. In the following paragraphs I will provide a detailed story of our night. 

First of all as we entered the pub we had to wait five minutes before realizing we had to sit ourselves. After seating ourselves we had to wait about 30 minutes for a waiter to approach us. We ordered a couple sliders and some wings.  15 minutes later we received our sliders which for $2 were edible. 20 additional minutes passed before we received our wings. The medium wings were rather bland and the blue cheese was clearly store bought. 15 minutes later the waiter asked us if we needed anything else and we said the \"the check please\".  10 minutes later we received the tab. 10 more minutes later she charged us. 5 minutes later she brought our receipts to sign. The thing that bothered me the most is she brought a pen with the receipts. This waitress had the audacity to insinuate that we were actually going to tip her. There's a higher chance of Palestine and Israel establishing peace. Nonetheless, my close friend and I made the most of our night and we highly recommend this place if you have about and hour and 25 minutes to waste. If not, simply don't waste your time. We clearly had time to waste."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this when the restaurant was getting flipped and very happy to finally stop and eat here. First off, Futurama playing in the bar. Yes! And the restaurant is beautiful, decor, tables, everything. Service is ok, kind of what you expect in a dive bar, not a bar and grill, so they need to kick that up with table service. Food took sometime with no one else really ordering, but then you see it and find out everything is made in house, even the fries and the AMAZING Guinness battered onion rings and its totally worth the wait. Ordered a burger medium and it came out well done but it still was one of the juiciest burgers I've had in a long time. The person I was with order the blt and there was no shortage of bacon. Both sandwiches the bread was disappointing with such nice ingredients between them. Like I said service is slow, and we did get ignored a bit but we sat in the dining room at lunch with just a bartender on. She was taking care of her bar, where the majority of the guests were, quite well. Will eat here anytime I'm in the West, because I haven't found anything this good over here."}
{"text":"Just a little dive bar. I've been going here for many years.  Long before it was changed to the Glass House.  Since then the service is better and the food is waaaaay better.  If you're ever looking for a good burger....this is the place!! Never frozen always made to order!  Not to mention they hand cut their fries!! So Good!! Their service is always on point and the drinks are a reasonable price!  This is my Friday lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna jump on the hype train and say this place is hella fun, and serves a quality product at prices that will make your eyes widen in disbelief. Like seriously, you can knock down some beers, and especially mixed beverages without a dent in your wallet. 

The seating is almost exclusively long tables, with comfy booths lining one wall. When weather permits, the outdoor canopy is pretty neat, especially since all the couches are new. 

They pride themselves in a full menu as well, and while yours truly hasn't had it yet, I've noticed they do appear to partake in Taco Tuesday, where you can get your hands on some hard-shelled snacks. Overall, I like it a lot...it's a dive that doesn't realize it's a dive. My only concern is the bit of an identity crisis it's having. The sound system is weak, it's too brightly lit, and there's virtually no standing room, so it feels like a straight up restaurant despite the jukebox and billiard tables. As a result, The Glass House comes across as a place I really can't recommend for spending an entire weekend night, but rather as a welcome destination for knocking a couple back after work."}
{"text":"Daily specials and free breakfast on Saturday and Sunday with seven dollar drink minimum.  My wife had a veggie quesadilla and I took advantage of the Monday hot wing special"}
{"text":"USUALLY a good local spot, but shared jokes from other Patrons this evening has me feeling a certain kind of way.  Not feeling so comfy here at the moment. I'm sure my next review will be much better but tonight...? Should've left the volume turned up when my songs played, I might have not overheard the ignorance. #EditedReview"}
{"text":"Bands were good, food and drinks good, atmosphere clean and updated, the owner is cool. 
However, I was threatened by one of the bartenders 2cm. away from my face because her friends and I got into an argument about using the stupid bathroom stahl. I'll have a hard time recommending anyone there after being told I would be \"f'ing f'ed up\" over something that had nothing to do with them (the bartendress with the shaved head)."}
{"text":"Food over an hour late. Canceled order. Check was wrong.and waited over 20 minutes for refill. Ok for bar but not good for food.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly, low key spot with great food great prices...
Pool table, shuffle board... PLEASE TAKE THE NO HIPHOP/rap sign down...????"}
{"text":"Love there wing special on Mondays great food Amazing People always get Alex to make your wings he's awesome and the rest of the bartenders are great folks also"}
{"text":"This place is amazing when you see it on the outside its nothing to fancy but the food is hands down Delicious got some onion rings and wings with the burger sliders everything was realy good and super cheap I don't think I had such  a good burger before you defiantly have to come and try this place out"}
{"text":"Three words: Pulled Pork Sandwich.
This thing is great. The most amazing part is they use chocolate sauce???? But you can't really taste it. This Sandwich is so good. I'd most likely write about the beers or bartender's on a place like this. But this Sandwich is so good it deserves 5 stars on its own. 

Now as far as the bar it's Not bad or anything but nothing mind blowing. The beer selection is okay. The price are what you would expect and it's got a decent crowd. As a bar itself I'd say 3.5 stars. The bartender's 4 stars. The Cook 10 stars lol because that was some mighty fine food. 

So recommendations... 
Yes I would be back for a drink. I will definitely be back for food, the staff here are pretty good and fun guys to be around. So I recommend if your in the area come in here get a sandwich and a beer."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here the other day after talking about it for a while. They have delicious $5 drinks, and different specials each day of the week. We went on a Friday and got the fish special. $7 for some baked fish, rice, and broccoli. Appetizers were $4.50. I got 8 BBQ wings and my friend got a huge basket of onion rings. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great bar, great food!  It's a cool little spot if you want to get away from the noise."}
{"text":"I have lived in the west valley for years(20) so finally a great neighborhood bar and the food is the best part! No freezers, no microwaves, just 10 items done perfectly!!! Get the wing!!! They are\" miss cuts\". But for less than $4 for a half dozen. Wtf!!,juicy, tender, and saucalicious!"}
{"text":"This tiny bar rocks!  We had the one of the breakfast specials on an early Sunday morning. Sitting at the bar and we are blown away by the great food. Italian breakfast sausage, delicious eggs- just above what we expected. The chef (a real chef) talked about his homemade sauces...he gave me a sample of one of his hot sauces made with a few of the hottest peppers available. So good and blistering hot!  They have daily specials, M-F, and a loyalty program.  Love  this place!  And Audrey and Bryant!"}
{"text":"Authentic.  Neighborhood bar with friendly folks, good bar food, good beer, and prices that are nice on the wallet.  No doubt you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face.

Newly remodeled location has friendly staff and a diverse mixture of people - blue collar workers, retirees, etc.  They open at 10 am for those who want an early start, and happy hour commences at noon.  That $7 pitcher hit the spot for me.  French fries are fresh, handcut with skins left on and they were quite delicious.  Prices and portions gave excellent value.  Lot of eye contact, smiles, and the occasional handshake from a friendly stranger.  Good range of beers, both domestic and local craft.  This place is too nice and clean to be considered a dive, but has many of the other charming characteristics that may sway you to become a regular.  What a welcome addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Went to the glass house the customer service I'll rate it at a 10 plus I love dive bars especially when there's one with in walking distance from my place I've heard a lot of bad stories from your bar I'm glad you guys either clean house or changed employees attitude or whatever you did now I have a bar to go to and the food was very good I own my company since 1985 it took hard work and dedication now company huge were all over the United States with 100 plus employees and we practice every day Customer Service good luck to you guys for having a bar that will be a huge success"}
{"text":"Food, on point.  Dirty pig sandwich was extremely well done.  Avacado and creamy horseradish shows menu designed with thoughtful intent.  In fact,  the food is the single reason I will be back.  

Beer menu,  slightly above par for similar venues in west valley.  Increased taps and better selection of true local craft news l brews would change things dramatically.  

Ambience,  nice blend of neighborhood bar meets comfy lounge.  

Service left much to be desired.  Bartender (female) working twice as hard as wait staff (also female) who were slow and moved without urgency.  Coaching needed here from management.  

This place has alot of potential.  I will be back to try more from the menu.  

This place has big potential, excited to try again.  

Note: you lost a star for the service."}
