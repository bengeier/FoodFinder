{"text":"I come here once a week. Tried many things on the menu everything is great and prices are very inexpencive. My recomenditions are thier Chicken Wings (crisp big and meaty even when saused) and their French Onion Soup. But in looking at thier menu you really cant go wrong with anything. Plus thier staff ar amazing they treat you like family..."}
{"text":"It's Saturday morning and I came with few friends here because we decided that we want to go somewhere for breakfast. The place is your usual diner. They do have all day breakfast which is nice. I ordered the Lumberjacks breakfast which came with a choice of coffee or a juice, pancakes, 3 fried eggs, 3 slices of bacon, 3 sausages, 2 ham and a toast all for $9.49. Pretty sweet if you ask me! You can never go wrong with breakfast. I'm so full right now I'm going to skip lunch today."}
{"text":"Good all day breakfast place, moderate prices and decent food. Service can be quite slow though. Kind of a run down looking place."}
{"text":"A good burger and priced great.  Had a beef burger, onion rings and coke zero."}
{"text":"Dependable oldschool diner/roadhouse/bar. Has a charmingly seedy ambiance, and the food isn't bad either."}
