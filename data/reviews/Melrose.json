{"text":"Les pâtes n'avaient rien d'exceptionnelles. Je crois pouvoir faire des pâtes meilleures que ce que j'avais commandé...Le service était assez médiocre et lent. On comprend vite pourquoi le restaurant est souvent vide."}
{"text":"Been here for a Paintnite. Discovered this peculiar part of town that I have never been to before and love the vibe. The servers were super nice. The music was unique too; they were playing some old Good Charlotte  songs at some point, which was nostalgic. The music wasn't so loud that you cannot hear each other, it was rather pleasant. We took a pitcher of sangria. It was ok in terms of taste, worth it for the buck. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Really great place for drinks and appetizers, especially in the outdoor patio when it's warm out. The service was outstanding - nicest guys ever. The sangria was great."}
{"text":"A great place to catch up with friends, coworkers or family. Don't forget, Thursday nights is ladies night offering 50% off plates and drinks. The drinks we're great - especially the apricot martini. YUM! Staff always ensures everything is OK and is super friendly! Great service."}
{"text":"I came here for a paint nite event and honestly wasn't expecting much, but wow was I wrong! The owner / manager was extremely nice and attentive, he even gave everyone in the restaurant a free shot! We got a margarita pizza and it was super on point and delicious. Would recommend."}
