{"text":"NEW OWNERSHIP, its now called Amherst Dinner. Had a SwissBacon burger which came with two sides for under $7. The meat was FRESH, homemade potato salad, homemade chicken and rice soup. I gotta tell you, it was perfect. Burger had a REAL charbroil flavor, homegrown tomato, lettuce was crisp, and service was grand. The place still looks old but it was clean. I'm going back. Not sure how to tell yelp that its owner new ownership."}
{"text":"Quick--what's the capital of West Virginia?  Amherst, Ohio!  That's a little slam that us folks from nearby towns played on little old Amherst.  Farmer boy is the gossip nerve center of Amherst and its suburb, South Amherst.  It's especially notable for a damn fine sausage sandwich, and a burger with a big slice of sweet bermuda onion called--what else--the Farmer Boy.  Well, at least it was back in my day."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, great pricing, and a decent enough waiting staff.  I liked it for the most part. The interior seemed a little dark, which kind of gave it an odd feel, but didn't really ruin the dining experience.  I will probably eat here again given the opportunity."}
