{"text":"Hands down best coffee shop. This place is a gem. I'm a chai latte fanatic, and these guys make THE BEST chai. Ask them to top it with dark chocolate-WOW. They also make fantastic baked goods, especially their muffins. The chocolate chip streusel and red velvet are my current favorites, and their avocado toast is delicious. You really can't go wrong here, and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot.  I work in the area and there are not a lot of great local places to grab a quick bite unless you want fast food.  I tried this out today and loved it.  The staff was very friendly, soup & sandwich were yummy, and it was relatively cheap compared to some of the other local deli's in the area."}
{"text":"Micro foam was perfect, and the roast had an interesting flavor to it. Not quite light roast, and not quit dark roast. Staff was very friendly as well. Priced just right. Great spot in Green Tree!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee.  They always have different flavors that are unique and taste awesome.  My favorite is the vanilla nut or the apple pie flavors.  This place switched me from Starbucks!  Huge fan and highly recommend!"}
