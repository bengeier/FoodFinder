{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.  Their pizza is not that great, go get yourself a five dollar pizza for better taste.  They mess up your order, and when you go to call to get it fixed they tell you, \"I really don't care sweetheart.\"  Don't waste your time unless you like shitty food and liked being insulted with it at the same time."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for the last 6 months and will say they have the BEST PIZZA AND BREAD STICKS IN TOWN!!! I cannot attest for the rest of their menu but their pepperoni and cheese pizza is the best!!!"}
{"text":"My parents ordered from here. Pizza wings 2 liter coupon, and a steak sub. Delivery time wasn't too long. Pizza was thin. Little sauce and was cooked lite. Not to bad. Wasn't great but I had worse before. Wings were kinda small but tasted ok. Ranch was good. Steak was ok too. Fries were ok but fries on delivery don't stay fresh. Can't help that. They use some kind of cheap ketchup. In my family anything but Heinz just isn't ketchup. Overall not too bad but not great either."}
{"text":"Been there twice in the last few weeks.  Got the veggie pizza and plain chicken wings.  Service was fast and polite.  Pizza is not out of this world or anything, but pretty tasty (clearly all fresh ingredients) .  Wings, good.  It is close to my house and they make everything easy.  I plan on returning."}
{"text":"This place is great! We have ordered from them several times and have had their food delivered for our kids birthday parties. They are always on time and make everything very easy! Good food for a reasonable price! Try the 30 inch pizza for catering parties! Great deal!"}
{"text":"We just ordered from here for the second time and not only was the order incorrect but there was hair in our gyro. When I called to inform the lady about the mistake and disgusting hair she said I ordered incorrectly and that was it. She had absolutely no concern about the hair in the food. I can't believe that as a small business you wouldn't try and correct a problem from someone who is willing to be a return customer. We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Well I was excited to try an Italian bistro in the neighborhood... But was it ever disappointing.  Restaurant that is in a bar, didn't serve drinks, you had to go to the bar and order for yourself.  Then after a long long wait, our order was taken... My husband ordered Chicken wings, and I ordered Chicken piccata with angel hair pasta, salad and garlic bread... After a 25 minute wait  my salad comes out with ranch dressing in a cup, but I had ordered Italian dressing. After another 10 minute wait out comes a huge bowl of spaghetti with lemon sauce and capers.  When the waitress delivers my husbands chicken wings I asked if my chicken piccata was coming?  She went back to the kitchen with my bowl of spaghetti a partial eaten piece of garlic bread and my fork.  3 minutes later out came the bowl of spaghetti with chopped up chicken pieces added.  I wouldn't eat anything more.  Don't waste your time.  Too many wonderful places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"i went to this place about 2 years ago and at that time they were 2 stars at the best but nothing else was open and we decided to give this place another chance and wow they blew my mind on how good it was first i ordered online which was easy then i called to ensure that they received my order which they didi picked up instead of delivary the staff was nice had everything ready fries where hot and crunchy and the wings lots and lots of sauce fully cooked no pink and not slimy ranch was amazing i can tell they made it there i hate hidden valley or kens when it come to eating wings oh the pizza was a cheese pizza with ricotta amazing dough was perfect cheese was hot and awsome the chicken fingers were the best i had in years old school chicken fingers bomb i will go there again !!! thanks guys"}
{"text":"I love the food, but the service here is horrible. The family that runs this place treats you like they don't even want you there. I never friendly service unless the younger girl who works there is there. It's a shame that I have to chose to eat somewhere else because of the bad service I constantly receive at Brothers Bistro."}
{"text":"Pizza had very little sauce and the crust had no flavor, tasted like cardboard. Jalapeno poppers were okay. I had questions for the delivery driver regarding my total and he couldn't speak English... Wasn't terrible but won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Called to place an order (thinking it was the Craig road location), gave the girl my address and major cross roads and she never said a word about me possibly having the wrong location. (Considering the fact that the rainbow location is about 45 minutes away from my house) Granted, this part was a mess up on my behalf, but when she didn't say anything about how they don't deliver that far, I figured I had the right one. WRONG. Then we decided to pick it up instead shortly after we placed the order and that's when I realized what had happened. When I called to see if the $70 order could possibly be cancelled, she laughed and said \"the other location is going to take care of it, but we already started the order.\" (???) so she wanted me to go get the order from the Craig location AND pay for an order we would never get from the rainbow location. So when I said well then I guess I'm going to get in my car, and see you in 45 minutes, thanks for all the \"help\" she laughed again and hung up. Totally rude and did not deserve my business whatsoever!! DO NOT GO HERE! They do not care about their customers."}
{"text":"Have use them many times for both pick up and delivery and have always been very pleased with the quality of food and the service. The only thing of which I am very disappointed is looking at the reviews of many of the other customers. Not sure exactly what they expected but you definitely get more than you should for this type of establishment. Great job would use this service all the time."}
{"text":"Where to start.  Their meatball sandwich is pretty good. Their appetizer's...suck.  Soggy and over breaded.  Not to mention the fact that when I was told the delivery charge($3.50) went to the driver, I later found out it didn't.  Long story short, I paid $23 for a meatball sub and 5 jalepeno poppers.  Seems steep.  But the thing that really bummed me out was that when I asked for a side of macaroni salad, it was dated 5 days ago"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. It's around the corner from my house so I figured I'd give it a go. Can't beat $7.99 for a carry out special. I didn't expect much but this is a quality pizza. 

The sauce is sweet like a real Italian pizza, the crust is crispy and tastes extremely fresh. I don't actually know if they make their own dough but I wouldn't be surprised if they did. 

The location is in a bar so I was a little confused on where to get my pizza but the bartender turned me around to go to area that I pay for my pizza. Overall good pizza, great price. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Awful. Never received my food even though they're claiming I did and refused to do anything about it"}
{"text":"DO NOT give this place your business.  We called and ordered food and was told it'd be 45 minutes.  We ordered a medium pizza, a sub, & Alfredo pasta. Two hours and 20 minutes later the delivery driver shows up with our food and calls instead of coming to the door with the food, and tells me to hurry up and come get my food because he is in a hurry!  I went outside and walked over to the delivery guy and he didn't even have our pizza, just the sub and pasta!  After I paid and got the food, we called the restaurant to let them know what happened with the order missing our pizza and the driver's rudeness, & the manager cut us off and yelled \"don't call back, don't order from us!\"  I couldn't believe it!!  Not to mention, the food wasn't even good! It was cold, and disappointing.  Worst experience ever! Will never order from here again!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza and other foods from brothers for a while now. No, you're not going to get authentic Italian food from New York when you order here, but damn, it's good! We don't have local farms in the area where you can get your fresh buffalo mozzarella pizza for $10.

Anyways, I just ordered  the stinkiest pizza. Anchovies, green olives. Pepperoni, and feta cheese. Delicious. The crust is nice and crispy, the sauce is great.

5 stars all day"}
{"text":"Food is average at best and expensive for what you get.  Service is consistently horrible and slow.  Long delivery times to basic locations with many options to avoid traffic.  Will never order from here again..."}
{"text":"Oh man...I wish I would not give this place a chance. Shame on me for not considering the low star reviews!
After placing my order for a pick up special, I realized on the invoice a delivery charge...I guess I just followed the default screen setup. Anyways, I call to let them know and try to get either a refund on the fee or have it indeed delivered. They do not deliver this pick up special. This i can understand and even agree, but they also say there are unable to refund me for that! They instructed me to call a 888 number for the ordering system customer service...wow. 
It was only $1.50. So I could not care less. I believe my time is more important, but after reading the invoice I noticed that they charge you 8.25% tax, not 8.1% like our State mandates. Of course, tip is prompted in their site so I left $3 before I realized this mess!!
Now this is not only piss poor customer service, but it's also illegal. 
 
To be fair, my party was ok with the pizza, even though I am not able to eat it due to my upset state...

Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"So I've read through most of the reviews and everyone is pretty knowledgable about the place, I can't vouch for all the issues but I saw a trend in the bad reviews; they all had their pizza's delivered.  And yes, i live in a neighborhood that does not allow solicitation but they still drop off their flyer all the time. But I have been to the place several times and I have picked up and taken out each time, and I haven't had a problem.  Now it is a bit pricey, and there are definitely places that are better (have you tried Biaggio's) but it's actually pretty good if you give it a chance and my favorite pizza is the Brothers combo pizza.  So I agree with all the validity and complaints that everyone had but if you have the time, pick up or take out, you might like what you get."}
{"text":"- 10 on the customer service skills! Lol 
No kinda of experience necessary to work there.. I guess they don't believe in customer service goes a long way!! \"Perfect example of clowns on parade\"
They're just missing the 2 ton lady!!! No thank you at this riff raff joint"}
{"text":"My family likes to order from here because they have a large menu and they deliver. Their food, is just okay. Not awful, but not really something to rave about either. Honestly like 2.5 stars for the food.  What is truly awful is their customer service. They have messed up my order twice now and both times they acted as though it is my problem. I work in the restaurant industry and I know when an order is messed up and is at the fault of the restaurant, they should be accommodating, by either remaking the dish correctly 'on the fly' to replace it or offer to take it off the bill. Instead this place tells you it will be over an hour to deliver a new dish (when the first came in thirty minutes) and you have to struggle and haggle to get credit to your account for their mistake. Really just terrible customer service. We are done."}
{"text":"Fries are fantastic! Pizza is great too, takes a little long for delivery, but probably because they are busy serving great food!"}
{"text":"They are always super quick and delicious! I order every time i have friends over drinking and everyone always raves about how good it is!"}
{"text":"stay away. this is first review for me ever. I ordered lasagna for delivery, after hour and half it shows up. I'm vegetarian and it had meat sauce. the menu says marinara and if you want meat it's 2.50 more. I called and they said they all have meat. menu doesn't say that. they refused to refund or give me a new order. the few times I've had issues with other restaurants they were very sympathetic, and fixed the problem. when I asked to speak to manager they said there was nothing they would do and hung up. I called again only to have them hang up again. completely unprofessional. once they have your money they don't care. seriously stay away."}
{"text":"I have gone to your Bistro once with work and it was OK, but now I will NOT do business with you because your people cannot respect customers private property!

Please do not support this restaurant. Clearly they do not respect customers.

I clearly have my front door and property marked \"NO TRESPASSING, NO SOLICITATION, Do not leave any materials.\" My request is quite clear, yet they pushed a menu through my door jamb INTO my house. 

STOP THIS!"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings ever!!! Always wonderful customer service.  There menu is great and offers such a variety of foods. We will continue to order from here as always. We support our local small businesses.  We tell our all of our friends and family they have to try this place."}
{"text":"Unprofessional. 
They made my order wrong so I came back but I got yelled at by the chef

(I live 1 minute away)

So this is how the convo went in person

Me: hi I called in and ordered chicken alfredo with *penne pasta* and the girl on the phone said u guys could make anything with penne pasta.
This is actually fettuccine pasta.
Guy: so... u want me to make a new one??
Me: well yes I paid $18 for it that's a lot for something I don't want.
Guy: really!? U can't just eat it!? It's the same exact pasta in different form!
Me: yes, I really can't eat it.. 
(Interrupts me)
Guy: are u serious? U can't eat this!? It's perfectly fine!
Me: yes. (Shows him my tiny bite of the food)
Look, I tried to eat it I just can't. Can you please?
Guy: ok fine, I'll go ahead and make a new one but it's the same damn pasta
(He goes in the kitchen and starts banging sh*t)



(I wait for my food about 10 mins)

He comes back and apologizes saying oh.. Sorry it's not your fault the order was wrong. I'll make sure to talk to the girl that took ur order. I put extra chicken in there for you

I smiled and said thank you but I definitely won't be returning. I mean, who wants to get yelled at especially when I paid you for my food!? Disrespectful.


Take ur business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them many of times my last time ever ordering from them. I received my sandwich burnt and when I called them to let them know, they stated they could re deliver it or refund my money. Are you kidding me???"}
{"text":"After having multiple menus sent to our home, my wife and I thought we would give this place a shot.  It was the WORST choice we could've made!! The food was absolutely dreadful!!

My wife was craving a pastrami sandwich so I went to the restaurant and proceeded to order the pastrami with cheese, along with their Brother's sub and an order of garlic mozzarella bread.  We first tried the garlic bread and it was so bad that we ended up throwing most of it away....the cheese was cold and barely melted, and it was of poor quality and very cheap tasting.  The marinara sauce that accompanied the bread was flavorless.   The pastrami sandwich came with some fries but was bone dry and they did not give us any condiments like mustard or ketchup.  Honestly speaking, the footlong pastrami at Subway blows this sandwich away by a mile AND it's cheaper!!! 

I had the Brother's sub, which supposedly had chicken fingers, bacon, ranch, and something else.....but like the pastrami, it was dry as dry can be and very bland!! It was pretty skimpy for a sub and it was also overdone because parts of the sub roll were badly burnt!  The box that it came in was overfilled with fries as to give the impression that the sandwich had more weight to it....a trick easily spotted by savvy foodies!!! 

Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!! If I could give it negative stars, I would do so!  This place was much better when it was Bella Lynda because the younger guy who made the pizzas back then was awesome, but I'll never go back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 sandwiches for delivery on 2-14-16 at @Noon pst. Waited almost 1.5hrs for the food. Then it shows up completely burnt. Not overcooked. Burnt. I call the store. They say sorry we will give you 10% off your next order. But I just want my food. I have to argue with the girl on the phone who finally says.. \"Fine! But you aren't getting new fries!\"  Isn't the purpose of fries to eat WITH your sandwich? I tried to call back to get the Manager's name for this review, but she refused to provide it, which is strange. There is too much competition in the sandwich market for me to ever order from there again, and I used to get food from there all the time. Never again. Stay away. I will post a picture of the sandwich..."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had in my whole life! Food is decent! They have one person working and one bartender with a full house! If you want good service this is not the place!!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food horrid the manager was disgusting and rude. They banged on my door when asked to wait a moment so I could grab an additional dollar. After presenting delivery driver with money he stormed off. They delivered us chicken wings 10 less than what we paid for. I immediately called to report and the receptionist was nasty and told me it was not possible and I can talk to manager tomorrow. I called several times the next day. Finally got to manager. After calling me a liar and stating there is NO WAY possible in the universe they could have made a mistake... he rudely told me he knew how we could fix this problem.. I asked what do you suggest? He sarcastically responded never order from us again. He has that right... I NEVER WILL. I bought a small pizza and wings for $30 why would I lie about ten wing dings."}
{"text":"If melted cheese on cardboard is your idea of a good pizza then this is the place for you. Seriously, I am a huge pizza fan and this place is right around the corner from me so I thought it could not be worst than Pizza Hut. Well it is, 100 times worse!
I was so appalled, I returned the next day because to speak to the owner and give him some feedback. Nice young guy from Russia or something but he had the arrogance to tell me his pizzas are the best, was expanding to LA and that if I did not like them I could take my business elsewhere. And that is exactly what I will do!
Save your money and go get yourself a decent pizza. Frozen from Smiths is better than this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, service is wonderful, delivery is pretty slow, which brought my review down to 4 stars. They are really great in making sure my complicated non-dairy order is right every time even going so far as to call me before they make the pizza if I order it wrong. Would recommend if you have time to wait for delivery!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at 6:53 exactly, got the order at 8:40, pizza was cold, the driver called me twice apologizing about the wait. What really got me was they charged me 5.50 delivery charge, seriously? I don't think I'll use you again."}
{"text":"I'd also give it zero stars if I could. My wife, granddaughter, and I wanted to give it a shot, so we headed on over. When we got there, there were absolutely no customers or staff in the place. That was a cause for concern, but we were still willing to give it a shot. We waited for a hostess or someone to seat us, but after 10 minutes, no such luck. So I grabbed a menu and called them from inside the restaurant. When someone finally answered, I asked if the dining room was open, and got an unenthusiastic \"yeah\" then informed her that I'm calling from inside the restaurant and we were waiting. Just got an \"okay, I'll be right there\". When she finally came out, the first thing she said was \" no one under 21 allowed\" ( granddaughter is 7). I understand the under 21 rule, because it's attached to a gambling establishment, but it was closed off by a glass partition. So we left. Very disappointing to say the least. No wonder why nobody was in the place. Bad service model to say the least."}
{"text":"White pizza was a letdown. Where's the seasoning?
As was the case with the  spaghetti.
The garlic balls had good dough but no flavor. Even adding garlic,  red peppers, and every other Italian seasoning at home...it was disappointing.
Overall, not a good place."}
{"text":"I will not be ordering from here again. 

The pizza was average at best. The toppings were bland and flavorless, the sampler plate was watery and tasteless and everything was overpriced. The driver also apparently doesn't read the notes either, since I requested that they not ring the doorbell because my friends baby was sleeping. They rang it twice and woke her up.

The only thing worth noting were the garlic bites which were really great, but not enough to make up for the bad price and the fact that the medium pizza was the size of an extra large at most other places. Otherwise, bad food and bad service. Keep away."}
{"text":"24/7 is not always 24/7 I have held off this review long enough!! I can't begin to explain how f****** tired I am of hearing this \"kitchen is closed\" if your kitchen is f****** closed when I want to order don't keep leaving you F****** menus on my f******* door!!! Be true to your advertising or don't advertise!!!"}
{"text":"I've never dined in at brothers, only ordered through grubhub or bitesquad. Every single time we've ordered (probably 10x in the past yr) our food has been correct, hot and delicous. We mainly order from them because by the time we figure out where we want to eat we are starving and Brothers is quick. We're about 8 miles away and have order for a family of 4 during dinner rush and it's here with 45 min. 
The cheesesteak sandwich Is the best. Flavorful juicy meat on a crispy and yet still soft roll.
I wanted spaghetti and meat sauce, but they only have meatballs. I risked it and they were tender, flavorful and  you could tell made with sausage and pork. I was worried they'd be too spicy/over seasoned but they werent.
 And their desserts also taste homemade! 
Never, ever once have we had a bad meal - highly recommend."}
{"text":"worst pizza ever. end of story!!! go with dominos!!!! theres a reason it has a low rating."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here multiple times and I keep meaning to post here on Yelp, but this place is awesome!!  The carryout special for $7.99 is awesome - dough is fresh and crispy and toppings are abundant.  The garlic fries are TO DIE FOR!!!  And the best thing on the menu???  The extra extra crispy, deep fried wings!!  Fresh wings, super crispy, and the garlic parmesan flavor is amazing.  Plus the ranch is homemade!  Sometimes service takes a little longer because they tend to stay in the kitchen, but just call the store when you arrive and someone will come out when you tell them you're there.  I saw people complaining that they won't bring you drinks... seriously??  Why are you looking for 5 star service in a restaurant that's in a bar??  It's not like the bar is far away from any of the seats, walk over and get it yourself, lazy!!  And I've never had skimpy portions on toppings or sides.  I'm just glad there's a real place to get good food here, instead of that terrible BBQ place that was a total waste of space, time, and money.  At least now the food is good!"}
{"text":"NOPE! Petty awful experience and we won't return. We walked in the front door and the family (I think) and employees were bringing supplies in through the front door.  Not one person said anything. (Even after making eye contact multiple times) 
The ceiling fans were on full blast but the A/C was definitely off! We waited at the counter for about 3 to 4 minutes while they continued walking back and forth with boxes. As we began to walk out, a lady came from the back and helped us.  Still haven't been greeted. Ordered the personal cheese pizza lunch special which included a fountain drink.  NO ICE! NO CARBONATION!  Once the pizza finally came out (we were the only customers) it was hot and seemed fresh but it tasted bland. So....NOPE!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza always soggy and cold and the always forget ranch. Save you're time and money and skip this place."}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that it took an hour for a small order, the driver literally said \"what, no tip?\" when he handed me the food. Aside from the fact that I tipped on the card already, he gave me a really vindictive look as he was leaving.

Never ordering from this place again, christ."}
{"text":"The food is awesome ! The only bad thing is that their delivery takes foreeeeeeever ! Their Mac-n-cheese bites are great & the pizza is so delicious , even though their flyers say their 24 hours they aren't ! I love the homemade ranch & the awesome lunch specials ."}
{"text":"First off the food sucks cold pizza the girl did not know what she was doing taking orders. They messed up my order had to go back and get the rest of my food and had to wait even longer to get my fries. Every time I go it a the same thing nasty tasting food.  I was hoping it would be different this time. Well i was wrong"}
{"text":"We didn't even eat here because when we walked in and sat down, we were completely ignored. Seriously, it doesn't take a genius to come to the table and take an order. So we walked out."}
{"text":"Sauce on the pizza was great, not too sweet like some can be. Great crust too, slightly crispy on the outside soft in the middle. Got wings and fingers too which were tasty accompanied by a great ranch dressing. (Medium on the wings was just enough spice. ) MUCH better than the major chains we normally get delivery from. The online ordering system was great and our order arrived in the time allotted and was correct. We will definitely get delivery from there again."}
{"text":"Really good. Just wish it would've been warmer. Had to reheat it to eat it. But once we did - it was delicious.  30\" pizza?  Yes please. 

We will order again!"}
{"text":"Shady Shady Business.   So I have been here 1 time before and I knew they had some carry out special.   I called them up to place a pickup order for a 1 item pizza large or xlarge.   Woman tells me the price is $18 and change for a large and 23 and change for xlarge 1 item.  I ask her i've been there before isnt there some kind of special ?  she starts stating specials with wings, pizza and soda.   I told her all i am looking for is pizza.  she says that's all i have.  I walk in the place and there is a 1 item carryout for 7.99 on the door for a 16 inch which is a medium.  versus 18 inch large for 18 and change.  she never mentioned it and i told her when I got there and she still acts ignorant.  I hope you are the owner miss because that is the last time you got my business.   hope that $10 for extra 2 inches of the pizza was worth it.  she knew i wanted a 1 item pizza.  why not at least inform me about the 7.99 carryout?"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Called 3 different times and hung up on. I asked her please not to put me on hold because she keeps hanging up on me and still she does it anyways. To make matters worse i was already having one of the worst days seeking comfort food in a slice of pizza. I wont forget this. Last time i eat here and no good word-of- mouth coming from me. Brother's Italian Bistro lost me as s customer and I'm good with that. No loss on my end. Plenty of of other better options here in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever. The delivery guy is rude because he is always on the phone and never says anything to you....how about a thank you. When I called to speak with a manger the person on the phone made all kinds of excuses so I couldn't speak with a manager.  Plus they are over priced on a lot of things."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else please. 

Waited an hour and a half for 1 pizza. Which I wouldn't mind for some mind blowing pizza but this was far from that. 

Super cold, driver didn't have change, and a sad excuse for a white pizza. 

I wish I took a picture cause it was just like wow, but I was hungover and ate it anyway lol. Seriously. Just so bad."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new to try that delivered.
We ordered a few different things to try. Fettuccine Alfredo with Grilled Chicken, I found to be bland. My husband liked it. Chicken Parmesean dinner was good. A bit greasy but good. The garlic balls with ranch was really good. I also ordered strawberry shortcake. I received frozen cheesecake. Ive never liked cheesecake and wouldn't have ordered it had I known I was getting cheesecake. That was my biggest disappointment.
The guy that delivered wasnt rude at all to us btw.
I dont know about having this again but it was nice to try something new. Wasnt worth $50 maybe $30."}
{"text":"The worst delivery experiences ever!  Don't waste your time with this place there is much better and that does not routinely screw up orders."}
{"text":"Came to eat here and when we first arrived the owner/driver backed out so fast he almost hit us. We went in to eat inside and while we were eating and looking outside the owner/driver came back and parked next to our car, looked around and pushed his car door into our car on purpose, we watched the whole thing. We couldn't believe it. We did say something too. We will NEVER go back there again. I can't believe that was the owner of this place. Do NOT go there!!!!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER order food from this place again!!!! I ordered delivery from EAT24 and the food was 30 minutes late. DO NOT TIP them! They are filthy rich, the owners make the deliveries and pull up in expensive cars and clothes."}
{"text":"Like many reviewers of this... establishment, our complex was spammed with menus. We were in the mood for a calzone, so decided to give this place a try- without checking Yelp first, of course. Stupid. 

So I call and try to order. I wanted some sun dried tomatoes, as advertised on their menu, but I guess they ran out/lied/didn't feel like it. Whatevs, it's cool bro, just put mushrooms instead. Then he asks for method of payment- card. Ok, well there's a charge for this (I hate places that do that shit). So he then asks for my card number- wtf, why do you need this if I'm picking it up myself? I tell him, \"I'll just pay when I get there,\" and I guess at that point he just walked away from the phone for a minute.. then he comes back and demands \"Card number??!\" So I'm like, okay.. I'll play your game, silly man.. don't expect a tip, though. He says it'll be ready in an hour and I'm thinking, okay, this better be good 'cause we're freaking hungry and dying over here.

Upon arrival, I got to see who I was dealing with, but some other dude rang us up. Neither were particularly friendly. The guy said \"We have your card number in our system, but it wasn't rang up.\" Da fuuuh? Seemed shady to me. 

Finally, onto the food itself. The calzone (family size) was enough to feed 3-4 people, so I'll give them that. But it was pretty void of cheese, thus wasn't worth the wait, drive or money. That, and it didn't make me feel too good. We also had an order of garlic fries, which were bland. We learned our lesson: check Yelp reviews first.
Needless to say, we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Just an average GrubHub delivery of spaghetti and meatballs.

I placed an order through Grub Hub with the expected deliver time between 6:10 - 6:20 and my food arrived at 6:17. The prompt time and friendly delivery guy is the only reason that I did not two star Brothers Italian Bistro.

I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs that came with garlic bread and a salad. The spaghetti and meatballs had to be my order's only saving grace. 

Everything was very generic but what else was I expecting, Katie Mantalini's circa 1994? The salad was generic- lettuce, black olives, red onion and a few other things for color. The garlic bread reminded me of what was served in high school passing off as garlic bread. It was pretty harsh as I ended up cutting it instead of tearing it with my teeth. 

The spaghetti was ok, it was decent with a lot of cheese. The serving was large and it could feed two people for one meal or one person for two meals. I am doing the latter of the two and saving the rest for leftovers. Like normal spaghetti, it should taste better the second day. It should!"}
{"text":"Every time I get a new flyer stuck in the door, I give them a shot on pizza night.  Not too many have impressed me thus far, and I usually end up just going with Papa John's.

Brothers was the latest one, and I ordered some last night for the family.

I got a 16\" 4 topping pizza, 12 wings, and an order of fried zucchini.

I have to say, I was impressed with the zucchini.  Seemed like the real deal, vs. the typical frozen mass produced products typically included with pizza delivery.

The wings were pretty par for the course.  Not burned...standard hot sauce & butter recipe.  Can't complain.

The wings came with fries, which we ended up throwing out.  Just thick and a little soggy.  Not a good delivery item.  

The pizza was pretty good overall.  Can't say it was too much better than Papa John's, and for the price, I probably won't repeat as a customer, but as far the whole package, dinner was satisfactory."}
{"text":"And they got THIS because there was no way to give them anything less.

Was in town for New Year's Eve and thought that we'd grab a bite to eat before heading out to the strip for the celebrations.  Didn't know the area so we called down to the front desk of our resort to get a recommendation, the girl at the front desk recommended this place.  Ordered wings, cheese steak sub and an appetizer which came to a total of $46.  The food was delivered barely warm after one hour and 30 minutes.  Chicken wings and cheese steak sub were beyond dry.  I called that evening and several times since trying to reach anyone in management and all I get is 'Don't know where the Manager is, but we'll forward your message'.  Still haven't heard back from Management, but not bothering to hold my breath.  With customer service (should of listened to Nat's review 12-17-2013) like this, it's a wonder they're still in business."}
{"text":"If you like \"soggy middle\" pizza then this is your place! 
Yes we have tried this place twice. 
Large cheese pizza is what we ordered both times...and both times it was soggy in the middle.
The reason I was just reminded to review this place is this flyer stuck in my gate.

Honestly there is one there EVERY OTHER DAY. It's horrible. Trashes up our beautiful neighborhood. 

NEXT TIME THERE IS A FLYER I AM CALLING THEM AND I WILL NOT BE NICE.

PS I love how the newest edition says \"new lower prices\" stop printing fliers, fix your nasty food and you would get our business."}
{"text":"I downloaded the Yelp app specifically to review Brothers. We just moved into the area and I thought I would give them a try, as they left a menu on our front door. My wife said to be wary as we had never ordered from them. She gets home from work about 9 pm. I ordered her one of her favorite dishes, veal parmigiana. I got the ribs and they were ok, but it was a tiny rack. When my wife went to eat her dinner we discovered it wasn't parm but Marsala - which totally sucked as the meat was tough and the sauce tasted like Salisbury steak (yuck). I called Brothers and got the same guy that I had ordered from.  I told him they had sent the wrong dinner.  He asked what I wanted to do about it. I said they needed to deliver the dinner I ordered. He had the gall to say \"oh you mean the expensive one\".  Mid you I had just spent about $50 for two dinners, one of them the wrong order. He said he had to call the owner to see if he would agree. Really?!? So then he calls back and says it's been 4 hrs and they have a 2 1/2 hr return policy. Say what?  First of all I don't think this clown called anyone. Secondly this was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had in my well traveled 58 years. Don't waste your time with these fools, there's too many quality eateries to choose from.  Trust me, they will never get another order from us again. I would honestly give them 0 stars if I could for the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR SELF THE TROUBLE
CHOOSE PIZZA HUT OVER THIS CRAP
THIS PLACE DESERVES TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS VIA THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY


called today, I am an empathic person who was worked in customer service and go great lengths to not put negative reviews online

When I called this kid on the phone was a complete jackass.  He asked my name twice and the third time I had to give my address I spoke a lil annoyed and he interrupted and told me not to be smart with him. he was immediately confrontational.  I ended up hanging up and getting extremely frustrated. ..  I'm still in disbelief."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled cheese and asked for pickles on the side. What I got was two pieces of bread that was put in a toaster, barely toasted and the some kind of cheese most likely microwaved to melt it and no pickles of course and it was NOT GRILLED . Isn't that something that every cook knows how to do? I mean really how do you mess up a grilled cheese? Oh I also ordered a piece of cheese cake and a piece of carrot cake. I got two pieces of cheesecake. It's getting more difficult to find a place that delivers that has palatable food. My friend's philly cheese steak was small and he said it was ok. The potato salad tasted bland. I can't believe I paid $38 plus a tip for this \"food\" I Think I'm done with Brothers for a while."}
{"text":"I'd give them zero but that's not an option. We went there on the Friday before Christmas but couldn't get service. We fetched our own menus and seated ourselves in the empty restaurant and finally went elsewhere after 20+ minutes. A couple of employees did appear after about 10 minutes but they didn't acknowledge us at all... even after standing up and waving our arms around. All I can say is, close down so an actual restaurant can occupy the space."}
{"text":"Bella Lynda has new owners. They have just started catering and they outdid themselves. For 8 women, I ordered 1 pizza, 1 tray of jumbo ravioli, 1 tray of eggplant parm and a salad. In addition to that, they threw in a second pizza, a second tray of eggplant, a side of spaghetti, 2 orders of garlic knots, 8 bags of Famous Amos cookies, paper goods and mints.   To top it all off, the food itself was hot and delicious.  Big thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I first want to say that the pizza we ordered was one of the better ones we've had here in Las Vegas in quite a long time. Great crust and the ingredients were fresh and really had great taste. The reason I'm giving this establishment A one star is the fettuccine Alfredo was disgusting and made with or by someone who has no clue on how to properly prepare and make this simple Italian dish. The sauce was made to our knowledge with just butter and a cream or so we were told. To us it tasted like a cream based gravy, flavored with chicken bullion, it was disgusting bottom line. Then to top off this one star rating, the waitress was all but pleasant and in no way interested in providing personal service with a smile. She mad no effort to make sure we were enjoying the food or if we needed any attention. We really wished she would of come around a lot sooner, not when we we're ready for a check so we could let her know that the Fettuccine was crap and we would like it removed from the bill. When she did finally come around we asked that the fettuccine to be removed from the bill, she was surprised of this request. She came up with the lame excuse that she couldn't and the only thing she could do at this time is pay for it herself. She explained or tried to make an excuse that she already had entered it into the system, BS. If that's the system they have or if that's the way the train there staff then this place needs to be marked as a place that would rather scam the patrons and hold the servers accountable, then they need not to be in business at all. This server returned to the table with the check and abruptly placed it on the table (w/ the fettuccine removed, imagine that) and walked away with no explanation or concern for us. My wife tried to communicate with her but she just walked away and just said you got what you wanted and said I'm busy. Any long story short, I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND OTHERS TO PATRONIZE THIS PLACE WHERE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR LIST OF PRIORITIES."}
{"text":"Someone slipped their menu under our door for delivery. Ah we should not have picked it up. Ordered 2 gyros with an emphasis on extra sauce. Food came within 30-40 minutes. There were 2 little plastic containers with sauce so we thought cool at least they remembered....but no. Bone dry inside the gyros, the bread was undercooked, and the French fries were strangely chewy."}
{"text":"Horrible service from grumpy people serving fake food.  What a **** hole! Simply a dump, leftover garbage on tables, leftover food on tables, employees are all careless, employees DO NOT wash hands when returning to shift? Instead, straight to handling food?  I'm absolutely disgusted!!  Service was unbearably unprofessional, employees were extremely sketchy, who is training these guys, monkeys?..  and the food smelled like trash!  Bland, old, NO flavor and just so nasty!"}
{"text":"Rude owner.  Bad food and expensive.  I would not waste another penny at this so called Italian Bistro.  I would give them zero stars but apparently you can't do that."}
{"text":"This restaurant (if you could call it one) doesn't even deserve a star.  This is by far one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  Ordered dinner delivery.  My family lives check to check so having a payday treat of a nice dinner was supposed to be a fun night.  Ordered chicken picatta, a gyro, & deep fried mushrooms.  This is the honest truth.  My son said the mushrooms were ok.  Those were his.  My husband who is never hard to please with food said his gyro was ok.  Which means it wasn't good.  My chicken picatta consisted of a hug pile of linguine w not even a half of breast of chicken worth on top cut into strips.  It was cold.  I touched it and looked and said it's dry, there's no sauce , they forgot the sauce.  Wrong...it was at the bottom.  But it wasn't a sauce by any meaning of the word.  It looked like lemon water and tasted worse than that.  It was supposed to be lighted breaded....wrong.  It looked boiled. 
I called and here's where things went from bad to worse.  The manager came to the phone and I asked is the manager.  He said for now it is.  What? What does that mean? He said well I'm the one on tonight.  He looked up my order and put me on hold three times to keep checking w the cook I guess.  Oh and they forgot my salad dressing also so I had to use my sons mushroom dipping ranch as my dressing.  His answer to my complaints about my dinner was \"well that's how we make it\" ya know? To each their own...he says.  Are you kidding me?  This is customer service? He offered to send another.  Asking me how much of my dinner had been eaten (my guess was they planned to reserve it if I took them up on swapping mine out.  You don't understand I said.  This is not fit to eat, why would I want another?  I asked for a simple credit to my charge card just for MY entree.  I was refused.  He never said he was sorry for anything.   I want to warn anyone thinking of even trying this place....STAY AWAY!!!   It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"This is the only place I get pizza from. Pizza is good, price is good and people are friendly. I was able to get them to make a breakfast pizza with eggs and green peppers when most other pizza places laughed and assumed I was high (which i was) but these guys did it!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I was previously happy with our first order that we decided to order from them again. Placed an online order over 2 hrs ago and have not received it!!!!! Tried calling, no answer! I even received an order number via email saying the order was placed. Wish I could have given ZERO stars."}
{"text":"11/2017 we've tried them a couple more times and they still skimp on the pizza. Though their lasagna is excellent, order the extra meat sauce. 

We moved to LV last Oct. '15. Found their menu stuck in our door so we decided to try them.  Pizza delivery was fast and friendly. Flavor was good but OMG 4 mushrooms? really? They totally skimp on the pizza toppings. We ordered a few more times hoping it was just a one time mistake. Nope. Too bad because IF they actually did put a fair amount of toppings on we'd still be ordering from them."}
{"text":"Ordered thru the Eat24 app. (LOVE THAT APP and the people behind it) Food arrived sooner than was quoted. Got the sausage and peppers and onions sandwitch lunch special. Very tasty. A bit too much bread but good flavors. Fries tasted good but like with any delivery fries order, they were slightly mushy (but I have had much worse delivered. These weren't bad) I had a few special requests in my order and they got everything perfect!"}
{"text":"Fantastic quick late night pizza place. They're open 24 hours and they have one of the biggest pizzas I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Welpppp going to start ordering here for pizza delivery from now on! White pizza was d winner!! Soo yummy n fresh n soft it was almost like the crust was a garlic knot taste sooo delish!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money!!!!

What a dump. Owners and mgr don't care how many bad reviews they get. 3rd or 4th owner in 6 yrs.If you want to order pizza and fingers they make you order a super nasty 2ft round pizza that they chop up in 50 small 1 inch bites. It does taste like cardboard no flavor in sauce soggy in the middle and black on parts of the bottom. I actually threw up after eating there. Maybe it was the big cockroach I saw on the wall.Can I take back my star and give them a negative amount?I agree with other customer...Avoid This Place, and please run over the guy giving out the flyers."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery garlic balls medium fingers and a family size Stromboli and it is amazing...oddly enough I get the flyers all the time and never ordered to all now and been living in my house 2 years...this will be new pizza place for aure ...tummy is happy!!!"}
{"text":"The worst ever.DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE PERIOD, I just received my delivery and I threw more than 3/4 away. Horrible, salty and nasty. Ordered the combo appetizer plate. Salty and not worth it. If you like poppers then maybe because there were 4. We ordered the \"Whole lot of Pasta\" and that is a joke. Same filling just different shapes pasta and very very salty. An extra side of meatballs,ughhh....Ordered the strawberry cake for desert and it was cheesecake. The only semi bright point was the salad. Red, green and yellow pepper plus black olives were good. But seriously do not repeat do not waste your time. Still looking at more than 3/4 of a meal in the garbage. UGHHHHHH"}
{"text":"Fantastic New York style pizza, amazing wings fantastic customer service, I can't say enough good things about Brothers Pizzeria. I love the welcome I get every time I come in. Simply an amazing little restaurant that I will never stop ordering from."}
{"text":"Garlic Balls (or whatever they call them) were tiny, crunchy pieces of dough. Not even worth $2.99. Sausage on pizza tasted microwaved. Pizza was good but not good enough to make me go there again. Ranch on the other hand, was damn good. But they forgot it and I had to go back."}
{"text":"In my opinion the only thing worse than having bad food is being inconsistent. We went there the first time and despite the place stinking of acetone from the nail shop next door the food was phenomenal. I had a calzone that was fantastic. I am telling my wife one night to order in from there and she is hesitant due to the 2 stars the place has on yelp. So the food comes and it is absolutely horrible. Pizza was not cooked properly. Dominos is way better. Se we try one more time and it is horrible once again. The chicken wings were disgusting. My calzone was over cooked and was a completely different shape from the first time. So my advice is to gamble in one of the casinos, not on their food."}
{"text":"Do not order from here.
Over priced food and not even decent food.
After waiting an hour for food (this is a normal thing), the driver at the door stares you down and comments on how much of a tip you should give him when you're trying to do the math. Once we brought it in, the whole bottom of the pizza was burnt AND our other food was soggy. Don't bother."}
{"text":"This place definitely earned my vote! Delicious food! I ordered the spaghetti with sausage (comes with a salad and garlic bread) and mozzarella sticks. My dinner was delivered in the timeframe they gave me on the phone and it was at the perfect temperature. Amazing food! A must try!"}
{"text":"We went to Brother's with a craving for pasta. We read reviews on other sites online and most were positive. So, we were expecting to have a good experience. Not so much... 

The waiter we had was horrible. I'm not sure he knew his name, much less anything else. I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo at first. After ordering, he told me that they were out of chicken. Then, I asked if they had shrimp they could put on the fettuccine instead. He said, 'sure'. Then he comes back and says that the only kind of shrimp they have is breaded shrimp and wanted to know if I wanted that on my pasta. I clearly did not want breaded shrimp alfredo and told him so. He then informed me that they did, in fact, have chicken after all. A whole case, in fact. So, I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo. 

We ordered mozzarella cheese sticks for an appetizer and waited about 30 minutes for them to arrive. After presenting us with our sticks, the owner comes over and gives us a plate of garlic knots 'on the house'. We soon found out that we got the 'on the house' knots because they had obviously wrongly made them for another order about 2 hours previously and didn't have anything else to do with them, so they gave them to us. Besides being cold and hard, the garlic knots were absolutely awful. The garlic was so powerful that it was spicy hot and overpowered everything else. 

On to the main dishes....eventually. It took over an hour for us to receive our main dishes. My mother-in-law got veal parmesan and the meat was overdone and completely awful. My husband got cheese tortellini and a side of italian sausage. The sausage was severely undercooked. My chicken alfredo was some of the most awful pasta I've had in my life. The noodles were super chewy and the chicken was dry as hell. 

No one ever asked us how our food was. Probably because they knew our answer would not be 'great, thank you.'. And if they didn't know, they didn't care. So, we paid our bill and went on our way. 

Post- dining experience... 
My whole family hung out in the bathroom (separately, of course) for quite a while after our trip to Brother's. If you don't want to suffer the same fate, pass on the Brother's dining experience....."}
{"text":"I swear I'm not on some demented mission to try every New York-style pizzeria in town then whine about the crust being, well, New York-style. This review shall be different! (Pinky swear.)

I live near Brothers, which until recently was Bella Lynda, which before that was Bella Lynda under different management, and before that it was Bella Sara. Although the names, decor, and menu have frequently changed over the past five years, one thing has not: the food.

But first, let's talk about the decor - what's with all of the maps of France juxtaposed with mob movie posters and a menu from a German Japanese restaurant? No, wait, don't answer, I don't want to use up my one phone-a-designer question on that. What I'd really like to know is what's with the pile of blankets overflowing near the back tables? Don't make me register \"Bistro or Yard Sale?\" dot com.

Snark aside, compliments first. The bald managerial guy? Extremely nice and clearly oriented to customer satisfaction. Guys behind the counter who gave us free garlic knots while we waited? Very hospitable and busy.

Delivery dude who kept aimlessly wandering around the front? A little odd.

Now let's talk about the red-headed woman, also seemingly a manager. The one sitting at the back table, leisurely reading what looked like credit card slips, surrounded by piles of small bills.

When we came in, she got up and gave us a brochure menu so we wouldn't have to squint at the tiny type on the back wall. Appreciated.

After about 20 seconds of us looking at the (multi-page) menu, she said she was going to sit back down. No problem. Mike was wary of the thin-crust pizza, but I spotted the \"Sicilian\" option of a thicker crust, so I decided to stick with pizza while he went down the block for Chinese. 

The woman hopped back up when he left - it had only been another 30 seconds - as I continued to study the menu. 

\"What's your phone number?\" \"Um, why?\"

She rolled her eyes. (Yes, she did.) \"So we can look you up next time you come in and give you discounts if you're a frequent customer.\" All of this like I'm in 1st grade.

I gave her the number I use for these occasions and spelled out my first name. (Which she still spelled wrong as I saw later.) Of course, this prevented me from getting back to the crowded menu. So, imagine my annoyance when she finished typing and said, \"So, what do you want?\" 

I laughed lightly and told her I was still narrowing it down. \"Okay, what do you think you're narrowing it down to?\" 

I looked up, really surprised now by her impatience. I know some restaurant owners enjoy discussing the menu and being helpful, but she clearly just wanted me to hurry up. a curious attitude for a woman in any empty \"bistro.\"

(More like a place that has nice tables to sit at while you wait for your takeaway box. If they want it to be more, maybe they should move those blankets.)

I said I'd like an extra-large mushroom pizza with a Sicilian crust and an order of garlic knots.

She started to punch it into the computer, repeating the order incorrectly. I corrected her. She spent a long time looking for the \"extra-large\" button on the screen. I noticed her photo in a frame on the counter. Okay, clearly an owner or manager, right? Goodness.

\"Anything else?\" \"Garlic knots?\" I reminded her. She laboriously punched it in. \"You want the marinara sauce, right?\" \"What are my choices?\" \"The computer says ranch or marinara.\"

Maybe I misjudged her role despite the cash table, the photo, and her motorcycle watch indicating she might have something to do with the few biker knickknacks, but \"the computer says\" says it all.

She let me know that there was an extra charge for the Sicilian crust because \"it's like they add a second dough to the crust.\" I only mention this because of what happened when the order was ready.

One of the behind-the-counter guys came out with two pizzas and the garlic knots. \"Um, I only ordered one pizza,\" I smiled. (I always smile. Keeps me underestimated.) The guy said, \"No, you got a mushroom and a Sicilian.\" \"Oh,\" I said, and... chose not to fight the battle. Besides, having corrected me, he was already walking away. Oh.

On the one hand, they just lost money and I wasn't getting a thick-crust mushroom pizza, but I also just wanted to leave.

Back home I opened the box to an XL mushroom with crust so thin you could see through it, and a large, fluffy cheese pizza. My husband helped me transfer the mushrooms over. 

How was it? Eh. The Sicilian's bottom crust was kind of hard, but the middle seemed only partially cooked. The quality of the cheese and mushrooms was fine, nothing special. The sauce was unremarkable but also inoffensive. The knots were smaller and harder than what we got while waiting and as greasy as the previous Bellas.

If you like your pizza \"thin and soppy,\" are getting carryout, and the redhead isn't on duty, you could do worse than trying Brothers. For me, the quest continues."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before for their lasagna because it's good.  Unfortunately this time, I was sold Stouffer's lasagna.  Completely identical in every form. Really upsetting to pay $14.99 for a piece of Stouffer's I could have bought in store."}
{"text":"Quality just isn't the same and prices have gone through the roof. They used to have a 8.99 large cheese carry out. Now that's how much a \"personal pizza\" aka something you feed a 5 year old is. 16.99 for a cheese pizza that's mediocre is a no for me. I feel like they changed the sauce they use or I don't know but my family used to eat here 2 years ago at least once a month and loved it. But everyone commented on how it just wasn't as good. Customer service has never been their strong point. But now that the prices are different and the quality has gone down we will have to pass."}
{"text":"I haven't even had the food yet so I can't comment on that, but we just ordered and it was more expensive than any other Italian food around here. The staff is so unfriendly. The cashier seemed as though he didn't want us to be at the restaurant, almost like we were inconveniencing him."}
{"text":"I love this place - until tonight. They are supposed to be open 24/7 and I called at 1:30 on Friday night and the guy that answered the phone said they were closing \"a little early tonight\"."}
{"text":"I love this place- y is everyone trippin- good as pizza, not bad price and the service is ait. Id recommend to a family member for sure."}
{"text":"you guys used to make good wings. i don't know what happened... new cook? get the old cook back!! i'v given it like three chances lately... the first screw up was shorting me TWO wings on my order, second time ordering they were SO cheap on the sauce, not even sure it was the spicy honey bbq i ordered, then the third time the wings are cooked only until they are BARELY done. i even popped em in the microwave, still tasted like barely cooked chicken meat. what happened, Brothers? Dissapointed."}
{"text":"Love this place, the Italian wedding soup is my favorite!  Good size portions and yummy Italian sodas."}
{"text":"first time ordering from Yelp. ordering went fine and Yelps customer service was great!
As for this delivery service/restaurant, was quoted a latest delivery time of 1245 (an hour and 10 min after ordering)  At 1247 contacted yelp, they called and said no more than 20 min and sent a coupon. 35 min later still no food. contacted Yelp again, 2 min later delivery shows up. All the food is cold, we have to cook the food. the point of delivery is to not have to prepare the food!!!"}
{"text":"yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm
we order from her at work and home. love this place. always fast and tastes good. great pizza place. almost like back home in NY."}
{"text":"Brothers pizza is delicious! They also offer generous portions and are fairly inexpensive. Sometimes we splurge and get the chicken fingers with fries dinner, so much delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Bartender service was horrible & we lost our desire to order the food before the server arrived to take our order. Too bad, because we have lived in the neighborhood for 3 years now and need a late night spot for good food."}
{"text":"I've ordered from several different places on here, I always get a chef salad, and I was so impressed with this salad I came back a 2nd time.. Regardless of the reviews and ratings of this restaurant I placed my first order. I only give 4 stars because the man who delivered was a little monotone and didn't seem happy to be there which I found rude..
but the salad was HUGE and delicious! not disappointed at all. I have no idea why this place has such bad reviews, though I haven't tried any thing else off of their menu, I am not disappointed so far!"}
{"text":"Delivered before it was scheduled to! Actually pretty good despite sketchy reviews. Will order again"}
{"text":"The staff here is sooo rude!!! As I'm ordering delivery the guy keeps getting annoyed as I'm customizing my pizza. 

After my pizza arrives, I call to let them know they got my pizza order wrong, some other guy on the phone says \"sorry for the inconvenience but next time make sure whoever is taking the order repeats that to you before you hang up\" really???? So it's my fault lol

Sorry guys good pizza doesn't make up for bad service!!! There won't be a next time ciao!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered off of Yelp since I got the munchies a work, delivery took about 30 min which was what was estimated so not bad there. sub was good enough to hold me over but the bread was burnt which is one thing that always bugs me. Tiramisu was frozen (which anyone who has had it knows that its definitely supposed to be soft and moist not frozen and a bit difficult to get through) and subpar. Also guys, if someone orders delivery PLEASE include napkins and utensils because some people are at work and dont have those things available to them."}
{"text":"Newly opened at Town CenterLounge 1. Tasted several dishes and eere very satisfied.The chicken eings were crisp and very good, The 24 inch pizza is huge. The crust slightly crisp, sauce was good. Also tried the Italian Wedding soup and the minnestrone, both were very tasty. The ribs were tender, very well cooked. They were good even without the barbecue sauce.  We also tried the seafood linguine, again this dish was good.  The service was very accomminating and friendlt. All in all it was a pleasant experience and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good food, nice delivery driver and food was hot.  Took about the right time they said,  so I'll Give it to them."}
{"text":"Work locally so I stopped in for lunch one day.  There were 2 guys sitting behind the counter who watched me walk in and go set my stuff on a table.  Neither one said a word to me.  I walked up to the counter waiting for one of them to greet me - my mistake - they just stared at me as if I was a stranger who had just walked into their living room.

So I finally said \"Lunch menu?\" and one of them pointed at the paper menu on the counter.  

The rest of my experience pretty much echos this.  

Not impressed, not returning."}
{"text":"We were a little sceptical to try this place with some of the reviews, but went ahead anyway. We decided to try for pick up since some reviews reflect negatively on delivery and in establishment experience and to be completely honest we were thrilled! We got there to pick up our order, it was ready on time, polite employees, and everything was correct. Everything tasted pretty good to us! We will absolutely be back. And just a side note, the baked shells are BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"They make great chicken and garlic knots. They are really generous with the wings and fingers. The pizza is pretty good also!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, convenient location and great if you're craving some Italian late at night because the kitchen is open 24hrs"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place and found it to be mediocre. I looked at the reviews and I really had high hopes but was let down. I ordered the chicken Philly and was not please, took a few bites and was not impressed. The roll the sand which was on was good and soft. The chicken meh and the veggies and cheese eh. I expected it to melt in my mouth but it didn't it lacked flavor and it was missing something. My brother got the veal parmesan again same roll which was good and this sandwhich was a bit better. The veal melted in your mouth and was quite delicious. I would order this sandwich again. I also ordered the Mac n cheese bites. Who doesn't love a comfort food deep fried?! I have tried many many fried Mac n cheese bites. These were terrible. They tasted like cheese mush or mash deep fried. You couldn't even tell there was macaroni in it because it was all mashed in there. I am giving this place 3 stars because the veal pamesian sandwhich was quite good. I suspect there could potentially be other good sandwhiches I just didn't choose wisely."}
{"text":"Spicy BBQ wings have always been my weekness, but after Buffalo Wild Wings stopped doing Wing Tuesdays I needed to find a better option to feed my cravings. This place has 12 wings for $2 less than it costs to get 10 wings at BWW and you can add a huge side of fries for a $1. The food is also delicious, and if you choose to dine in there are plenty of screams to watch whatever is on TV. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fuck these guys. Ordered food from them at 9 o clock, by 10 o clock I was wondering what was taking so long. I called them and no one answered and then noticed they were closed at 10. So instead of calling me to tell me they could not complete my order they just ignored it while I sat at home waiting on them."}
{"text":"Rude staff!  Food was ok but not great. Will not be going here again. There are better places with polite staff."}
{"text":"I hate to write such a negative review, but this might be the worst pizza I've ever had delivered. Womp womp. Even the  antipasto salad was disappointing (black olives, tomatoes, and bell peppers on a bed of lettuce) :T"}
{"text":"This has quickly become my favorite pizza joint in Las Vegas.  I'm not a fan of franchise pizza chains, so I always try to find decent one-off places in whichever city I'm living in.  This location was simply a fluke find as they were listed first in GrubHub on a night when my roommate and I wanted to try something new.

The food is AMAZING!  Probably the best pizza that I've ever had inside or outside of Las Vegas.  Their prices and specials are reasonable and they always deliver in a timely manner with fantastic customer service.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered dinner which was supposed to take an hour for pickup. Went there after an hour and 10 min because the person on the phone said they were really busy so allowed xtra time. It literally took 2 1/2 hrs upon which the food was seriously worse then just stopping in a mall food court. Then one of the \"brothers\" I guess, decided to give me crap about taking a dessert that another had already told me would be on the house due to horrible service. I live across the street from here and will never give them another dime."}
{"text":"Rude staff and food was terrible!!!

They must use the most low budget ingredients EVER 

I will never return!!"}

{"text":"So first off, how I found this place was by eating left overs from my parents and I instantly fell in love with how delicious even the leftovers were. 

So i now go here when I want good fresh pizza. And their wings are my absolute favorite bone in wings. Fries have a good seasoning. Well worth the wait. Always fresh."}
{"text":"We had one heck of a mess happen using their website that uses a \"Snap App\" to order your food. We ordered at 7 PM and the money was taken out of the account. Called an hour later to see when the food would be ready. They never got our order from the app. So we tell them the order, address, name, go back & forth for awhile on the phone, they checked the emails on their end & still no good.

SO my boyfriend & his mom decided they wanted to go in person.  We know most of the late night staff there so I knew once they saw who it was that placed the order they would exactly who it was. Long story short, they walked in and were greeted with smiles and good spirits. They tried to hand my boyfriend & his mom the pizza for FREE!  That was nice, but it's a business they have to make money. She wouldn't have it,  she insisted she paid for it.  She can always fight the charges to the card, no biggie.

So they sat and re-ordered the food face to face this time.  They ordered Garlic knots while they waited, fountain drinks... HECK even the older gentlemen behind the counter that usually delivers, HE took his PERSONAL mobile phone out and handed it to my boyfriend's Mother talk to the manager. She was the card holder so she had the reason to speak with him. That really shows the trust relationship we have with them here.  Great customer service every time we step in the door we're greeted with smiles.  They felt really bad that it happened to us but it was not their fault.

They're great folks that work here, they're never rude to us, even on the phone they tried their best to help us out as best they could.  We're always polite and respectful customers. They show us the same respect.

Sicilian pizza takes longer because it's hand made. They had to bake the crust, and then load the toppings then cook it.  It came out MmMm good.  Light sauce, Black olives, Pepperoni, & BACON! Here's the picture of what was left I was so full off one slice!  Worth the wait. The portions here are large and you can't beat the prices. Moderately inexpensive when you know the menu as well as we do.

Learned our lesson eat HERE.  It was Google maps fault. Our address was incorrect by one letter! Shake my head.

Thank you guys again!"}
{"text":"I was pretty nervous to try this place out because of the reviews, but it looked like they were based on customer service so I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I went into the bar side and the bartender got someone from the pizza side and everyone was so nice. Maybe because I didn't order delivery, I don't know, but the service was great and the pizza was phenomenal! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Be careful what you order! We ordered online and when called to see if it was ready they read the order back to me which was wrong. When they realized they made wrong pizza he said 10 minutes. When got pizza they took off wrong ingredient and put correct one top of where wrong one was-the issue, the wrong item causes an allergic reaction to a family member which got ill. Bad and unethical move!"}
{"text":"I am super surprised to see that they only have 2.5 stars. This place is impressive. Their food is SOO good. We have ordered from them about 4-5 times for delivery. Each time we got different items and each time we were very pleased. They exceeded our expectations. Everything is home made. I LOVE their ranch, omg. The Italian wedding soup is so good, meat balls, calzones, salads, chicken fingers, subs and marinara are all totally worth ordering again. I hope they stick around forever. Their delivery is fast and always friendly. I have not actually been to their restaurant, we only order out."}
{"text":"*****BUYER BEWARE WHEN USING A CREDIT CARD, DEBIT OR GIFT CARD*****
I ordered a 18\" pepperoni pizza with 20 chicken wings for pick up on 12/27, my total was $23.78. I gave the employee (blonde hair lady with a strong eastern European accent) my Visa gift card for payment which she proceeded to go to the kitchen to run my card. She returned with 2 receipts and the first thing she says is that my balance is $88.02 left on my gift card. I immediately knew that the balance was incorrect because I have been keeping account of all my purchases that day and it was almost $5 less that what it should be. I signed her copy of the receipt with a $1 tip because it was a pick up and no service was given. I immediately called on the gift card for the balance as soon as I got home because of the fact that the first thing she mentioned and was more focused on was my balance which I found quite odd. She charged my gift card $28.54, which is the total plus 20% tip. This employee which I was told her name is Sylvia took it upon herself to give 20% tip without my consent. She charged my gift card that full amount before I even signed the receipt. THIS IS FRAUD AND IS ILLEGAL!!!. That was probably why she was so fixated on the gift card balance printed on my receipt, she wasn't expecting the balance to be on there. I called and spoke directly to her and she said maybe the gift card company charged me fees? I tried calling the manager the next day and left a message with Daniel who claimed he was acting supervisor and explained the situation to him to have their manager call me back. It makes me wonder how many times she has done this before unbeknownst to the card holder No one has reached out to me from this establishment. I will never return here again and will file a report with The Better Business Bureau."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery, it was excellent.  I have read reviews saying this place has bad customer service, we bypassed this by ordering online and almost didn't even gave a word with the delivery person other than a thank you.  Food was good, reminded me of an italian corner restaurant in Philly.  Well order here again."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd and last time I order here.  Mediocre and overpriced food and horrible customer service.  The last time the food was decent, but not great.  It's close to home and delivers so after a long flight from the east coast I ordered a calzone and meatball sub for the family.  I placed my order at 5:55pm and was told it would be 45-60 min.  At 7:10 (1 hr 15 min) I called and they said it was on the way......5 min later it showed up.  The first thing I noticed was the delivery guy reeked of cigarette smoke, and when I got the food in the kitchen the box and bags did too.  I set the table and dished up the calzone and sub only to find they were cold.  Not lukewarm, but cold.  I immediately called back and spoke to a very nice guy Ron who told me that his boss wasn't there but he agreed it was unacceptable and said if I was willing to not eat it he could make it again and send it back out.  I told him I would just microwave it for now and he said that as soon as his boss comes back he would call me back.  In addition to being cold the calzone was literally dripping with grease and the sub was mediocre at best.  I didn't get a phone call back last night but Ron called me this morning and said he had talked to his boss and they were willing to give me a $5 credit to my next order.  I said no way, I expected at the very least to have those items credited in full for my next order.  At that point he asked me if I could hold so he could go talk to his boss again and said that he (boss) doesn't speak good English so he was going to be the go-between.  Ron came back and said that the $5 was all they were willing to do.  I told him not to bother and that was the last time I would give them a penny of my money.  Honestly, dominos or Pizza Hut is way better food at a much more reasonable price. The poor customer service just adds the icing to the cake."}
{"text":"As of a month or so ago this place has YET ANOTHER set of new owners. Over the years this place has been called Bella Sarah, Bella Lynda, Brothers Italian Bistro and has had at least five different sets of owners.

Being always keen for decent pizza I dropped in on the way home to pick up a pizza with pepperoni. The \"bistro\" is as unremarkable in appearance as it ever was, but the staff seemed fine and the pizza was ready reasonably promptly.

When I arrived home I opened my door and my hopes for my pizza sank before I had even opened the box. There, jammed into the door of my apartment complex which specifically prohibits trespass for the purposes of solicitation, was a menu from Brothers Italian Bistro - In my experience, the sorts of places who ignore the rules for free advertising NEVER provide quality food as they tend to be as \"cheap\" as the thought process that arrives at the conclusion that rules don't matter as long as they can personally or financially benefit.

Sure enough, my pizza was burnt on the outside, sloppy and wet in the middle, unevenly topped and generally tasteless. In fact, it was pretty much exactly like food has always tasted from this establishment. I'm starting to wonder if the \"new management\" thing is all a ruse to score some business from hopefuls who think the food might not suck anymore.

The following day I went down to the apartment office and gave them the menu and watched the manager phone brothers and read them the riot act about trespassing (as they do with anyone who spams us). A week or so later, there in my door again was the same menu. On my way to get the mail I ran into the maintenance staff to whom I complained bitterly about Brothers lack of respect for our complex and discovered that one of the maintenance guys had \"nearly gotten into a fight\" with their spammer who had claimed to be \"authorized to be there\" before being kicked out. The guys and I had a bit of a laugh and one of them hit the nail on the head \"Those guys have had so many owners over the years but the food has always been terrible\".

If you receive a menu from Brothers or any other pizza restaurant in your doorjamb, remember the lessons of this review and save yourself a lot of grief. Don't reward people too cheap to buy proper advertising who litter your home with their trash and don't trust in the integrity of their food."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I must have caught them on a couple of good days, but I actually enjoyed my pizza.  I ordered off the Slice App, and the pizza was reasonable.  They delivered it on the time they said they would.  My only complaint was I asked them to call my desk phone number upon arrival, and they did not.  Luckily, Security noticed them on the camera and I was able to go get my food, but had they paid attention to that detail, they may not have been outside so long.   I got a 14 inch Pepperoni pizza the first time and then I shared a 16 inch Pepperoni pizza with friends the second time.  Both were decent.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but I have had MUCH worse here in Las Vegas.  It could have had a little more sauce, but it was flavorful.  It had plenty of cheese and pepperoni and the pepperoni was a little spicy, like I prefer.  And most of the folks at my job, like the place.  One of my friends ordered the garlic fries and it was a huge portion and I had some, and they were the best garlic fries I've ever had!   I've not been in there to experience the \"rude staff\" that others have reviewed, but both my delivery drivers were prompt and friendly.  It is definitely one of our \"go to\" places at work."}
{"text":"It wasn't as hot/warm as I would have liked, but considering it was delivery and he may have had other orders to deliver before mine, I wasn't too upset. The chicken parmesan it was good. I would order from them again :)"}
{"text":"Ok...Ok for those of you that have eaten here you must be wondering how in the hell I could give this place 3 stars?
It's because I rate places on what I expect them to be not what I wish they where.
So I find their cheesy menu flyer sitting on my door step. Hmmm so much for secured entry.
So I sit back and peruse the menu. First thought. Oh god, this place is a mess. They have over 100 menu items (no S#$T). You should get your food permit revoked for having a menu like that. These guys obviously skipped restaurant 101.
So I sit back and try to envision what this joint looks like. I'm thinking 2 triple door freezers, 2 deep fryers, Sysco orders coming in on pallets blah, blah, blah.
So being new to town and not knowing my way around yet and feeling lazy, I decide to order some wings (boneless & real).
What I expected to get was something reminiscent of those wings you see sitting in the hot case at the grocery store deli right before close. You know the ones that have been there for hours right next to the crusty mac n cheese. 

Well guess what...They nailed it! That's exactly what I got. So I give them the A-OK, three stars.

Yeah, this food is crap. I have no idea (yet) where this place is but, I can tell you this...I would have never made the effort to go into this place to eat and expected something good to come from it. Because I would have been in my car which would have afforded me other options (I'm assuming). Look at the menu for christ's sake. Use your head. You can't expect a (so called) restaurant to offer 100 things and expect them to do any of them well.

So I give my fellow yelpers that ate there and where disappointed 2 stars for using poor judgement. Come on...YOUR better than that!

Suckers ;)"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since it was down the street from my apartment. They are also open 24 hours. I ordered from them a couple times and the pizza typically shows up within an hour and is a little overly greasy. My biggest problem with this place is how rude people are that pick up the phone. Both the people that I've spoke to have given the impression that I am bothering them. The words please and thank you are not known by the staff. The third time that I ordered I actually hung up on them because the man was so rude. He asked me what did I want delivery or pick up. When I requested delivery he made a long sigh and told me to wait a minute. At that point, I hung up the phone. A few moments later a lady called me back from the restaurant who spoke clear English and I explained my situation to her. No discount was offered so I decided instead to never give this place my business again."}
{"text":"Brother's pizza is one of the best pizzas I've ever had! Definitely doesn't taste the same in every bite as Pizza Hut/Dominos. So if that's what you're looking for, don't go here! But every bite into their pizza is different and keeps me wanting more. Sure the service isn't amazing, but they weren't rude either. That's all I ask for."}
{"text":"Love the Blanco pizza! Amazing. My coworkers recommended this place so we ordered delivery. The first time we got a pesto pizza and a Philly cheesesteak pie as well as a sampler platter. The sampler platter was just ok but the pizzas were fantastic. Tonight we had the Blanco pizza. You must try it ASAP! I read some reviews about the customer service. My family has had great service and courteous delivery drivers."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are decent price, but their pasta dishes are WAY over priced for the potion you get, and the quality is mediocre at best. Service is nothing special either. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery through yelp. It took an hour to get here. I don't know if they're slow or it's just logistics between yelp and the restaurant.

I got the 24\" meat lovers pizza which was $25.99. Delivery charge was $3.50. The delivery guy seemed nice. 

I enjoyed the pizza. It was more than what I expected. Right amount of meat. It wasn't overwhelming with the meat or other ingredients. It's very cheesy which I love. It's also very oily so prepare to use your napkins a lot! 

I would order from this place again."}
{"text":"Normally we are a fan. In the 2 years buying pizzas, calzones, and fresh salads from Brothers my husband and me have enjoyed flawless food and fresh ingredients. That changed last Tuesday evening, July 4th, 2017. My husband picked up the antapasta salad I get almost every Tuesday and I opened the styro-foam container to reveal the end of our patronage to Brothers.  

The lettuce was brown, every single piece...oh well, I'll pick out whatever is inedible and try to salvage what's left. Only then I feel slimey cucumbers! My husband told me he'd go all the way back to Brothers to exchange it but I insisted that if this establishment's standards have slipped this low, it would not be worth trying another meal from them. 

I ended up throwing most of the salad out and soaking the rest in a strong vinegar & water solution and tried to eat it but the tomatoes were mealy and my stomache churned all night long. A sheer disappointment because we used to brag to friends of Brother's ultra fresh n clean salad ingreds. I tried to contact them but after several attempts I decided they deserved the Yelp cuz their help is bringing this restraunt to the ground!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The pizza is delicious!!! The garlic balls are to die for, the marinara sauce is flavorful!  We also get the boneless buffalo wings, they are huge, they normally give you a few extra! The ranch dressing is home made and you can dip anything in it and it's amazing. Be sure to get extra!!!!"}
{"text":"I normally don't trash a business but this evening we got burnt chicken fingers and under done pizza. Now I have to wonder who lets this type of food go out to a customer that pays some $50 for pizza and fingers. We have ordered from Brothers before and had a great experience, but for some reason tonight was just not their night and whomever was in charge of quality control just didnt pay attention or didnt care."}
{"text":"1st time ordering with brothers Italian bistro.... has to be one of the best pizza's I have eaten all year... definitely will be using them as my first choice for pizza.... you have a new customer today.... thanks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not even worth the one star. Ordered eggplant parm.  Got spaghetti with some eggplant on top.  Terrible and will not go back.  This cost 16 dollars.  Salad was also bad.  Get a real business."}
{"text":"I routinely pickup pizza on Friday. In my opinion, Brothers Bistro is the best value for NY Style pizza in Southwest Las Vegas. La Familia is terrific, but costs twice as much."}
{"text":"I'm from Upstate NY, and I have to say, I like their pizza. It's good. The wings are great, unless that one time you get the really small ones. The boneless wings are top notch, and the subs/sandwhiches are fantastic. Do yourself favor and go here when they have the $6.99 lunch specials. You get quite a bit of food for a great price. I'm a fan of this place, definitely my go too pizza place. I didn't give them 5 stars because they're slow as molasses when it comes to delivery."}
{"text":"This is not my first time ordering from brothers but this is my first experience where I had to wait over 2 hours for my order to show up. We placed our order at 6:58pm, the receipt from the pizza actually shows it was entered at 7:45!! So for that whole period of time while we thought our order was in it was not. After an hour of waiting we called to be told our food was done he was waiting for the driver to return.. So our hot ready for however long pizza was basking in the air to end up cold. 30 mins later still no pizza we call again, same answer. Finally 9:10 he shows up, food is mildly warm and of course he forgot our 2 liter and the spicy bbq wings we order ended up being plain wings with no sauce. Every time we've called tonight to speak to a manager either someone did not know who was in charge or the name of a manager or that the owner does not speak English. I find all this off and more importantly absurd. This will be my last order from Brothers Pizza. There is nothing original or Italian from this bogus place. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"The food quality is average at best.  The delivery service is horrible.  I have ordered two times previously and it took 1-2 hours for the food to arrive.  Last time I placed an order two hours after a confirmation email they say they received it and forgot to make the order.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, you will be thankful you did.  They will probably be out of business soon."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via Eat24 to get our pizza fix. First time ordering from Brothers and we liked it. The delivery time was super fast for a late night delivery, it only took 30 minutes and the delivery guy was really nice. 

Loved the pizza and garlic mozzarella bread. Our only slight complaint was that the crust of the pizza was a little burnt but the pizza sauce was one of my favorites. Great flavor. 

I'll have to order from them again and try their other items for sure."}
{"text":"I called to order and nobody answered. They advertise that they are open 24 hours but don't answer the phone. I will not call back."}
{"text":"I do not tolerate restaurant going around and JAM the advertisement through resident's door, my door seal already have a tear because of all the advertisement paper jamming through my door, they can just leave it out by my front door, and I wouldn't be as mad, but jamming through the door is the most horrible thing you can do to a POTENTIAL customer, by doing this you will only make the customer NOT want to come to your restaurant because you already damage their door seal and continuous advertisement is consider harrasement.  If you want customer to come to your restaurant, STOP jamming the advertisement through their door, just leave it BY THE DOOR, or even better, don't send anything at all."}
{"text":"2 hours for food not even that great cold by the time it arrived. Warm soda and cold food. Really great. And when I called to say something about it she said \"sorry\" nothing to make amends or to keep my business. Never again. Let's also take into account its WEDNESDAY night."}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying that I love the blanco (white) pizza. I usually order a small which is pretty huge. The wings are great as well. But OMG...I never get my food on time. Ever. 

I ordered my meal at 12:26am on a Tuesday morning (Monday night), thinking that I would absolutely get my food on time. No. I check the status of my order after 50 minutes to see that it was set to be delivered at 1:50am. 1:50am! So at this point, what can I do? 

At 2am, still no food. I call and they say that my order is on the way. 2:14am, my doorbell rings and the only explanation for reviving my food almost two hours later is that, \"We couldn't help it, we were really busy tonight. There was nothing we could do about it.\" Oh really? A refund would be nice, for starters. 

They'll never receive another dollar from me. Horrible customer service. They are consistently late and inconsiderate."}
{"text":"They are very unprofessional the way they handle business. I called to talk with the guy in the front about his guy throwing flyers all by my front door and the guy wants to threaten me.( I have a no soliciting sign right on my door) I say guy because either one of them would give me their names. The guy said my door is open come get your ass kicked. What kind of a food establishment provides this type of service. I got upset how they handled this matter. I made a police report and for fun found yelp to my advantage. Beware of company of this sort. The good news is I'm a professional advertiser and I provide business with all the exposer they need to build the right customer base. I guess I will do opposite for them"}
{"text":"I wish I would have been able to try this place out....but the Christmas dinner that we had planned with them never happened. Our family had set up dinner at 4pm on Christmas day for 25 people and the owners never showed up. A few family members had even gone a few days before and planned the menu and tested out the food with the owners, but they didn't even have the decency of giving us a phone call to cancel.  What a joke of a business!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This may possibly be the worst pizza I have ever had. We got a bbq chicken pizza, garlic knots, and mozzarella sticks delivered. The delivery guy pretty much there the pizza at us and ran away. Rude. The pizza tasted and looked like cardboard. The mozzarella sticks tasted like the cheap frozen ones from the grocery store and the cheese was not melted as it should be. The garlic knots were bland sponges. The pizza sauce tasted like water with some red food coloring. The only thing that was good was the ranch. That's pretty sad. How do you mess up pizza? Ok don't know how this place is still in business. I wish I read the reviews before placing my order. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"I should've read Yelp before I ordered here. I know about this place from the menus stuck on my door. Thinking this place was a mom and pop shop, I thought they were probably good...You know when you're hungry at work and there is nothing to eat but you eat something just because you're hungry? Well this is that case. I ordered a steak philly. My bread was a bit burnt at the corner and there was a packet of ketchup on top of my sandwich. Why would you throw ketchup packets in my food box and not in the bag?! People touch them! (Im a Germaphobe) It tasted just meh, nothing special and the curly fries were stale. I couldn't finish my sandwich. They were great on delivery time but I do live really close; however I rather have them take their time on my food then be left unsatisfied which what seems to be rushed food. This is a fair review. I'm not angry, just an unsatisfied foodie. Will I ever order here again? No, but give it a try, you might like it?"}
{"text":"I asked a couple of friends at work (from NY) where they get their pizza these days and they both said \"Brothers\"... Looked them up on Yelp and thought Hmmm. Pretty mixed reviews. Decided to give it a shot. The web ordering did look a little dubious so I called for the pickup special. 16\" 1 topping 7.99. The pie was very good and the people were nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I decide to give this place a second chance even though I ordered from them quite a few years back and had a bad experience....

The guy who answered the phone (Sunday 530pm) seemed super flustered and told me the wait would be about an hour and ten-twenty mins. I said sure that's not a problem.... i asked one question about the specials they offered on their menu and he said that they had over 25 specials and didn't have time to answer my questions and if i had any questions i should consult their website. Seriously? You don't have time to answer a customers' questions? What *AWESOME* customer service. So he asked if I just wanted to call back later, I said no, I know what I want that it was #18 and before I could get that out he hung up. COOOOL! Never again. Way too many other restaurants here in Vegas to choose from to be treated like crap. Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"So I'm really hungry go onto eat 24 and stumble across the lunch specials. I ordered 2 orders of hot wings with the fries my 5 year old daughter an her dad ate all of it and they both said it was good. I'll take their word since they both finished it. & I ordered the philly steak not the best you can eat but I did finish it. Satisfied my hunger now I'm about to take a nap I'm so full . I will be ordering again only thing I was supposed to get 2 dr.peppers and a sprite they forgot the sprite . Got everything within 45 minutes as well."}
{"text":"We went in with a coupon that they no longer accept but they offered us 20% off. Pizza was great and big too. Chicken Marsala was yummy and the cheese ravioli was good too - great sauce. Garlic knots and salad came with entered and the ranch dressing was super (I'm a picky ranch-er too). Polite waiter as well. Don't live in the area but will go back if we are around for sure."}
{"text":"On February the 18th I ordered a 30 inch pizza it arrived in 45 minutes at 10 pm 3 pieces were eaten . The pizza came with 27 slices so less than 5% got eaten the pizza is completely disgusting beyond belief. So I saved my receipt and the other 24 pieces of pizza and I brought all of it back with my receipt to the pizza joint I even called first to let them know I was coming back. The owner was supper low class and not customer service oriented at all. When I got to the pizza joint with in 1 minute I was greeted by a low life Mexican cashier that looked beyond tacky . I told her that I called and I was returning the horrible pizza her response to me was the owner told me u were coming and he told me to tell you to go and fuck your self ... THE OWNER TOLD HER TO TELL ME THAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME MAN . I said look all I want is my money back because this pizza is disgusting. The cashier said the owner said go fuck off again to me and then she tells me she called the police but she never did at it was a total lie so I called the police and the police told me to rip them to shreds on Yelp so I'm sitting in the parking lot in front of this dumpy Las Vegas pizza joint tearing them a new one on Yelp avoid that place like the plague there food is disgusting and they don't have a clue what customer service is about they call them selves Brothers Italian bistro. But it's owned and run by Russian Jews.

Beyond horrible and beyond disgusting this place will go out of business guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Got a super Mario pizza delivered which was very tasty and larger than expected. Surprisingly they delivered to me in deep southwest Vegas late at night. 4 stars solid. Gonna have to try some more of their specialty pizzas esp bc they are on of the few places to deliver to where I am at for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"I am not sure about the dining in experience at Brothers. We have always had their pizza delivered to our office. Roughly ten people and everyone always loves their pizza. Caveman, Super Mario etc all have been great."}
{"text":"Pretty ungrateful business owner. Went in to pick up their special and was basically told the owner would throw a fit if we decided to eat it there. We had an hour to kill before our appt close by. We decided to not eat here.

I have ordered the pick up special before and their pizza is under sauced! 1 out of 5 for quality also!"}
{"text":"Yes !!!!! Amazing !!!!!! Just what I wanted !!!! Love their pizza! Felt like I was in heaven !!!! I'm officially DONE ordering from Pizza Hut & dominions ! This is for now on my go to ! & it got here within good timing. So happy I found this place !"}
{"text":"Went in for a slice of pizza.   Stood at the counter for 5 minutes. No one ever came out.  So I left,  this wasn't at a weird hour either.  It was noon.  Not impressed"}
{"text":"The Sicilian crust pizza was absolutely amazing. Will definitely order it again. The wings were alright but it would've been nice for them to throw a ranch in there. Other than that, pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The food was terrible at this location. I had hair on my food and the guy when I complained threatened me. F this location."}
{"text":"I went in and ordered a 24\" to go because it's supposed to be quicker than delivery, right? The guy told me 25~30min. I ran to get drinks then came back.

Once I got back, I waited 15min before asking what was taking so long. At this point it had been 45min. The lady went back to check on the pizza. It sounded like they hadn't even put it in the oven. She came out and said it was in the oven and would be 5min.

I waited another 15min before it came out. I asked for a side of ranch and was charged over a dollar. Not even a consolation prize for waiting an hour? 

The pizza is about little Caesars quality (decent when you're really hungry, but not amazing).

Overall verdict is, it's not worth it. There's other pizza places close by.

*Edit: I was hangry when I gave 1 star, but that broke my rule. 1 star is for disgusting food, or food I wouldn't eat if given to me for free. Bumped to 2 stars because if someone ordered from here and gave me some, I'd still eat it."}
{"text":"Only have had food delivered but always speedy service and fresh food. The ranch dressing here is on point also."}
{"text":"Nadia swore at us when we cancelled our order.  We were quoted \"10 minutes\" for our lunch special takeout order, almost 30 minutes later when inquired about an ETA, I was told \"7 more minutes.\" So we decided to cancel our order and go elsewhere.  When the lady who was up front told Nadia to cancel it, she yelled back \"it's almost done are you fucking serious?\" 
If the food is actually going to take 30 minutes, tell your customers that when they order so they can plan accordingly.  If you can't manage your time that well, at least don't be rude when they can't wait 3x the quoted time."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious change! First off, we went inside and the ONLY person by the counter wasn't even saying anything, it's like we didn't come in at all. He pretended not to notice us. Fortunately, another staff came out and he took our order. We sat down, the place looks dirty and it smelled really weird.

The food was REAL SHITTY, the salad is NOT fresh, the chicken is DEFINITELY not fresh (im guessing microwaved), and i feel like they didn't cook the pasta sauce from scratch. NEVER coming back here again."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the pizza. 

I ordered the extra large and it was comically large I laughed when I opened the door and saw the size of the box. The pizza was baked evenly, toppings and sauce was good. Delivery took about an hour which is the same as most pizza places. We also ordered the chicken fingers and fries. They were really good. The ranch was very good and not store bought packaged stuff. 

I will order from them again and encourage you to give them a try."}
{"text":"They have amazing pizza. Best pizza I've had in awhile. Ribs are pretty good to. Me and my roommate order from here all the time, they usually come pretty quick."}
{"text":"I will never order from this place again! We got the menu on our door, and thought we would try a new place. I wish I would have checked YELP before ordering. After ordering they gave us our total and it was double what the menu said.  They said the menu was printed wrong. So I tried it any way, it was the worst pizza I have ever had, but the wings were good."}
{"text":"We drove by this place and thought we would try it out, and now my husband and I eat here once a week. You can dine in, take out , or  have it delivered for a small fee of 1.50. so worth it. Everything they make is fresh and so good. Such nice people own it And the prices are great! I highly recommend this place. 

Don't expect a 30 min delivery because like I mentioned before it's all made fresh, and well worth the wait"}
{"text":"Do not order from here. 

I called for delivery to my hotel room. Simply 1 pizza. \"It will be delivered in 45 minutes\" he said.....

1 hour and 45 minutes later we get a phone call and were told that our pizza was waiting in the front desk???!!

So now it's 10pm, in pajamas, picking up our \"delivery\" at the front desk. In Las Vegas it is not that simple to walk to the front desk!

Don't waste your time. Service was horrible.

I ate a slice, not impressed. And pizza was not warm by the way... Good night"}
{"text":"We were going to try this place twice, but each time when
I presented a local coupon they refused to accept it.
I don't trust businesses like this who play games to try to
get you into the restaurant ... kinda like bait & switch."}
{"text":"I'll continue to order this place over and over for the garlic knots, they are incredible and the ranch is amazing! Portion sizes are large and delivery is fairly quick. Ive had the Philly Cheesesteak and the Chicken Fingers, both of which were great as well as the Frys with both."}
{"text":"I look forward to Pizza Friday every week... and I was SO happy with the food I ordered from Brothers! The Gouda Mac and cheese bites with marinara... ON POINT... The white pizza is probably one of the best I've had in a long time! My son LOVED his personal pepperoni! I charge food taxes so of course i tried it... it was amazing! The zeppolis... didn't even know what those were but holy moly... i couldn't start thinking about them. And last but NOT least... I've been dreaming and drooling over the baklava ever since Friday. I can't wait for my next pizza night!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! !!!  I ordered a $10 sandwich wich the cashier took the order I told him what I wanted. ..the order was wrong i go back to speak to the manager he said it's ur fault lady he's just a cashier not a cook so he refused to give me a refund or any information on the owner....I am a customer service manager and he is by far  the worst manager I've ever met. ....
  This place will not ever grow with him running it...he was rude and insulting"}
{"text":"So I've ordered pick up from here several times and just happened to look on yelp to see this place isn't rated very well. :-( So I decided to help out because I love this place!  
My boyfriend and I work swing shift so we get off work around 2am and we're always hungry, but usually we always have to resort to bar food. We discovered Brothers Italian because of a flyer we had received on our doorstep and saw it was 24/7!! Score!! Italian food whatever time of the day?!? Yes please! 
So I always get the garlic balls which are simple but so delish! They compliment any dish you get. The smoked Gouda Mac n cheese bites are to die for and don't forget their homemade ranch! Yum! For the main dishes, I've ordered their pizza, calzone, baked shells, linguine pesto, and the whole lotta pasta. All dishes have just been so delicious and I'm always satisfied. My boyfriend always gets the Stromboli and he loves it! It's always more than enough food too and we  always have leftovers for the next day. 
I really don't understand why this place has bad ratings. Maybe because they go during the day and its busy or something? I don't know, but every time I've gone in the middle of the night it's been perfect and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't even know if I should call this food, let alone an Italian bistro. This place was ridiculous. This was by far the worst pizza I have ever had, and there was no authentic taste to it. I'm astonished at how horrible it was, and I still can't get that bitter crunchy taste out of my mouth. The bottom of pizza was straight black. I don't thonk I've ever tasted a pizza so crunchy! To recommend this place to someone is like killing a baby, you have to insane to do it! The people don't even care that their reviews are horrible. They take pride that they even get two stars on here! Bottom line, avoid this place at all cost! Don't waste your money! I'm shocked this place is even in business! A piece of cardboard with stale tomato sauce, some cheese and a couple pieces of sausage would probably get a higher review of this place! Horrible experience, terrible food, and rude service."}
{"text":"We had Brother's at it's other location and it was very good. This location is near our house. It's inside of a small bar/gaming place so we ordered to go since its 21 and up to enter. I had the White pizza and my husband had the Stromboli. They were both fresh, hot and so delicious!!!  The best pizza we've had in Vegas. The man cooking was the only one working so I can understand that he would get busy at times. We are already planning our next visit. Super friendly employee and wonderful food!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery: eggplant parmesan & tiramisu. It was awful! My entree was clearly a frozen meal they probably bought from Walmart and heated up. Then my tiramisu was still a little frozen in the middle. Over priced microwave food!!!"}
{"text":"Piiizzaaa. Not the fastest delivery, but not the worst, ya know? Expect at least an hour.

My order is 98% right most of the time I order. 
But for me, it's little things they forget. But I understand that they're human and busy so I overlook it because 100% of the time the pizza is delicious :) 

I'm addicted to Brothers, I normally order at least once a week if not more (don't judge me ok pizza is a food group. Pizza is life.)"}
{"text":"Ordered the carry out pizza special last night and it was made fresh, hot, and delicious. It was not greasy and I thought it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!!!!! Garlic knots are on point as well!!!!! Customer service was really good as well! Owner definitely took care of my family as we came an hour before they closed. I am a very satisfied customer and would recommend everyone to come here! You wont be disappointed seriously!"}
{"text":"Not only is their pizza, fingers, and fries delicious but the carry out special and other specials make the deal that much sweeter!"}
{"text":"Well. My roommate recommended this place because of the flyer they left on our front gate This place is horrible. When they delivered the food they delivered the food with an attitude didn't even say hi to the children. The real complaint is when I called them because the burger was undercooked, he had an attitude with me . He stated  that if we get the burger and he didn't see any pink that he was going to charge us for the new burger that he had to deliver, after he picked up the burger that he already delivered. Then he goes on to say \"We'll did you eat the whole Burger\" \"Really\". Why the hell would someone eat an  uncooked Burger better yet why the hell would I even call them to tell them after I ate the burger that  it's undercooked if I had planned on getting a new one made. So after my brother explain to him what the burger looks like he accused my brother of cursing at him \"really dude\" \"really\" I just hung up because he looked like he was already having a bad day and he just wanted to give me some problems and I wasn't going to add the cherry on top of his f*****-up ice cream cake . Anyway don't order from them. FYI the chicken wasn't seasoned either. It was a waste of my tip and time."}
{"text":"Brothers Pizza saved my life. 
After ordering my usual boneless chicken wings with garlic Parmesan sauce, I decided to order a special sandwich for later in the evening. OK you take some philly steak (no onions), add bacon, add more bacon, bake with buffalo mozzarella, and add some chipotle mayo for kick. 
Anyway, this there's this badass Eastern European guy named Alex who shows up with my order. Kinda looks like Vin Diesel, but with hair. I don't remember what he was wearing, but it doesn't really matter for this review. Get over it.
Might've been a black shirt and jeans.
Anyway, Alex shows up, but between him and me (or is it \"I\"?) are these Amish gangbangers threatening me with happiness and simplicity. 
Anyway, then these Tibetan monks showed up, wielding enlightenment and oneness with the universe. The gangs had a Zen off.
Anyway, Alex made his way across the minefield of peace and understanding, got me my food, and gave me a high-five.
Thanks, brothers pizza. You totally saved my life."}
{"text":"Try the breakfast pizza, omg so delicious me an some awesome cowokers( 6 of them to be exact) got this 24' pizza and boy was I in for a surpise. 

This pie is loaded with cheese,egg, sausage, bacon, and ham. It fed all 6 of us,(there are still left overs)
the quality and quantity is tremendous.I love it

I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner off my BeyondMenu app only to receive a phone call a couple of minutes later saying we lived too far and they had to cancel my order. We ended up ordering dinner from another Italian eatery only to have the manager of Brothers call us 90 minutes later saying they would deliver.  ??"}
{"text":"They're still doing it.  Trespassing and littering on properties in Mountains Edge, which is almost 6 miles away from their store.  DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR BUSINESS, PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"We got the lunch specials they have during the weekdays which include a free 20 oz drink. I got the wings/fries combo & my husband got the cheeseburger/fries one. We placed an order & 15 mins later went to pick it up which was quick. The girl at the counter was nice & the place was some what busy. The fries were more like seasoned fries & my husband's burger was pretty big that he didn't even finish it but both were very good. My wings were delicious & came with homemade ranch, a side of carrots/celery but I didn't finish them either because of the good portion sizes. Overall we would come back for the lunch specials, as we got a free drink & lunch for 2 for under $15 bucks."}
{"text":"Ordered late night delivery. Did not get here on estimated time nor did they pick up my phone calls."}
{"text":"This is an update review. I ordered delivery from Brothers Italian like I've done several times with no issues. I'm not picky and I'm not one to complain about things. I ordered the seafood dish which is 17.99 (pretty steep) but seafood dishes tend to be a little more than others, so I thought \"why not\"? I have a cheat day once a week and for those of you who have the cheat days, we all know how magical this day is;) The menu stated linguine pasta with homemade white sauce, shrimp, clams and crab meat. When I got my food and opened it up, I was a bit shock to discover the IMITATION CRAB STICKS cut up. They couldn't cut those things up pretty enough to fool a great seafood lover. How on earth can they advertise crab meat and then turn around and throw imitation crab in the food?? The clams were not fresh and tasted like they opened up a can drained the juice and threw it in there. Seafood pasta?? Lets call it shrimp and Can Clam linguine...and call it a day. Sadly this time is the last for me. Thank you for spoiling my cheat day and making me eat a salad."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel that apparently had very little security.  Every day when I returned to my room to retire for the evening, at least two pizza places had slide menus under my door, raising questions about the hotel's security and about marketing strategies in Vegas.  
This time it worked.  Drunk and hungry, I grabbed for the first menu that was under my door that day.  It happened to be \"Brothers Italian Bistro on Rainbow Rd.  

Good enough I says.

I don't have a microwave in my room, but I do have a very small mini fridge.  This comes into play in a moment.  

I saw the 30\" pizza and in my drunk state I was thinking that it must have been a type.  I don't know how much I had been drinking, but I decided to get a 30\" pepperoni pizza.  Also, the Combo Platter appetizer, and a 2 liter of diet Coke.
About 30 minutes later I get a call to my room that the order was downstairs.  The pizza box was enormous.  I guess they really do make 30\" pizza's!  Carefully balancing everything back to my room, nearly needing to tilt the pizza box sideways to get it through my door, I opened up the box of pizza.  I must confess, I was disappointed that it was cut into squares instead of the traditional method of slices.  It was only then did I realize my tactical error.  I knew that there was going to be a lot of leftovers.  I also knew that I had very limited space in my fridge.  I had not even managed to get to the combo platter and I knew I was in trouble.
I had about 5 slices of pizza and that was pieces in about a 3\"x\"3\" square.  Crap, there was a ton of pizza left!
I decided to let the pizza cool off, get some more beer, and then tackle what I could again later with the beer.
The next day I woke up hung over and saw this massive pizza box.  Opening it up, only 6 slices had been eaten, and now became the logistical nightmare of preserving the remaining pie.  I ended up folding it over a few times and cutting some of the slices up, and got most of it into the tiny fridge.  I never even got around to the combo platter the night before.
Long story short, I don't remember what the pizza taste like, I assume it was good.  I ended up not eating anything from the combo platter, that got tossed away.  I decided to eat one or two more cold pieces of pizza, and then decided to see how long it would take for all that pizza to spoil, so I unplugged the fridge and let nature take it's course on the rest of that pie.  
The last day I was in Vegas, four weeks later, I was cleaning up and packing up my belongings when it hit me that the pizza was still in the fridge.  
It still looked edible, but I didn't dare try a piece.

In conclusion, your marketing strategy worked once, but never again on me.  Also, you pizza rivals McDonald's french fries regarding longevity."}
{"text":"Expensive and subpar!
It's said on the paper \"try our pizza one time and you'll get our pizza every time!\"
Lies!"}
{"text":"Staying in Hampton Inn Tropicana for the weekend we got a few fliers under our door when we got back around 930pm.  We had eaten before our show and were looking for a bit of food for the end of the night.  Decided to give them a shot without yelping them first.  Worst choice I could have made.  The pizza is horrible. Ingredients taste like they are old and nothing is fresh about it at all.  The delivery guy had no idea what was going on.  Took a long time to arrive.  Seriously one of the most disgusting pizzas Ive ever eaten.  I had two slices and the rest is in the trash."}
{"text":"My kids and I walked inside and the recepionist who was on his phone didn't even look. We sat ourselves and got our own menus. We waited and waited and didn't even get our drinks. Another staff came inside the restaurant and just looked at us. We were still waiting and did not get any \"HELLO \". I finally decided to stand and walked out. My kids were all confused and embarrassed and followed me. And the receptionist was still busy on his phone.  What a very pitiful place to eat."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, however their customer service has been bad in the past. Tonight's call into this business takes the cake. The guy answering the phone was rude from the start and when I asked him about his specials, he stated they had 20 specials and didn't have time to go over them. I didn't ask him to go over them. It's not like there isn't competition in this city. Will not return to this business because of their arrogance."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is some of the best chicken chings ive ever had in my life, and I've eaten a lot of chicken. Wonderful selection of flavors ,but just the way are prepared. Their fries are crazy good as well. I recommend the lunch special, Inexpensive and filling."}
{"text":"There's Only One Word To Describe The Food Here...DELICIOUS!!! We Eat Here At Least Once A Week. The Value You Get For The Price, Is Truly Worth It!! If You LOVE Pasta...You'll Fall In Love With This Place, Just As We Have"}
{"text":"Soooo good! The pizza was perfect, the lemon pepper wings are so good, and the ranch is amazing too. Satisfied my pregnant woman cravings perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving some spaghetti and meatballs last night so we decided to try out Brothers italian Bistro delivery and omg it was amazing! We had never been there so we weren't sure the food sizing so we ordered breadsticks and the Mac and cheese bites too. The Mac and cheese bites were delicious!! And the breadsticks were 2.99 for 12 big breadsticks!! Definitely worth the price and will for sure be ordering with them again!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to think about this place it took them 20 minutes to make a grilled chicken Caesar salad with grilled means hot chicken and they give me a cold chicken.... Not impressed I'm sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"We were SO tired of all major chain pizza. Just, yuck. We got a flyer for Brother's in the mail and are very happy that we did! This was our first order. We got the 18\" pizza with onions and black olives. It was hot and very good. Exactly what I wanted. Garlic knots were good, but the Gouda mac and cheese bites were AMAZING! Oh they were so good! Delivery took about 45 minutes, about average for delivery in this area. The only issue I had was when placing my order online, the payment screen was acting up and wouldn't let me enter my credit card info and we had to pay cash. Hopefully they get that fixed, because I usually don't have cash on me and I'm definitely ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Just ordered lasagna and came home only to find literally one piece of lasagna ...never returning"}
{"text":"I was excited when I got the flyer, but I should have read the reviews...
I had the chicken fingers they had a lemon taste to it and the fries don't get me started 
They tasted kinda old I was not happy with my experience I gave it 2 stars cause the people where at least kinda nice"}
{"text":"I have been going by this place for awhile now.  I work in the area and finally decided to stop in. I went in for lunch and had the eggplant Parmesan sub with fries. Everything was delicious. I'm very pleased. The woman behind the counter was pleasant and helpful. 

To all of you people complaining about fliers at your apartment, if you don't want fliers for food left at your residence, move out of the city. Don't try to kill someone's business just because you don't want a menu. Complaining about that is the equivalent of being mad about the billboards by the freeway. 
*end rant*
Food is good though. Check this place out."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Years ago, there was an incident where they messed up our order, and instead of fixing the issue and having the driver come back with the right order I was told by the owner, \"We are too busy tough luck.\" I can not make this up. He then called me sweat heart which I felt was very demeaning and sexist, so I called him an ass. Years later....years later, my boyfriend places an order and is told that we can not place one over the phone. He was told the only way they would take the order is if he placed it in the restaurant, according to the woman on the phone she said that is what the \"note\" on the account said. I find that to be disturbing, why the hell does he need to go there, did they want to confront him? Also? They litter, horribly. I see their pieces of wasted paper all over where I work and live.  Obviously, they don't care about their reviews either. This place needs to be shut down, anyone reading this...please don't give them your business and hopefully they have to close shop."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken wings & added on fries for only $1. We also got fried mac & cheese & garlic balls. Everything was pretty good. I've seen complaints about dry chicken wings, but our wings were just right. I've seen business after business fail in this establishment. I hope people are able to discover this location & enjoy their food like we did."}
{"text":"2:30 am in the morning on sunday. My wife and I got hungry but didn't want to drive anywhere. So we looked online and found very few places that were open and delivered. So we stumbled upon this restaurant and ordered chicken wings and garlic fries. They delivered 30 early of the time they gave me, their website  technically speaking is pretty good and help show everything on their extensive menu however has no pictures. Medium spicy bbq Chicken wings I give a 2 of 5 stars the bbq sauce was a bit bland and was there wasn't anything about it that was spicy. The garlic parmesan wings were also 2 of 5 stars as well. Hardly any parmesan and garlic seasoning. Garlic fries was the same it seems all the seasoned fries were the only ones in the middle. As if they prepared the seasoning separately and just dumped it in the middle of their fries. Pretty much the only things I appreciate about this place was their website which was built well, their quick delivery service and that they are available late. So if you just want something to just fill you up they got some plain fries and wings that can do it. Unfortunately it's everything but their food that holds the weight of the stars. I believe your only as strong as your weakest link and think they need to asses all they weak links before I'll order anything from there"}
{"text":"Morons! 2 times I've ordered and 2 times they are big time messed up my order. First time the wings were naked when I ordered spicy, and bread was hard as a rock. So I call and ask for a discount on next order. Called and didn't even mention the discount offered and get a completely different sandich. HERE IS THE BEST PART... I call and speak to Johnny on the phone to have the right one delivered and he first says to have the wrong sandwich untouched or id have to pay for the new one lol. So then I have to read their menu off to them so he gets exactly what's on the sandwich right. Then Ask Me if I wanted the sandwich like it reads in the menu. What the..... I will throw their menus away this time."}
{"text":"This pizza place messed up our 2 pizzas...yes we did eat them cuz I had a house full...i just called to tell them and the owner threatened me...what a professional... maybe I should call metro to handle this.... don't do business with this store...."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, wings n chicken fingers. I got the wings with bar b Q sauce n the fingers are plain. The pizza is 18\" of cheesy, sausage n pepperoni heaven. I like this place and the way they do business!delivery was in decent time and courteous. The special comes with soda so I got a sprite to help not choking on all this wonderful food!! Gotta remember to breathe in between bites!!"}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza. super suprised how good it was. not even that far from my house. nice job."}
{"text":"I would give a review on their food but that would mean that actually delivered the food to my house. After waiting 1 1/2 hours for our pizza (we were told 45 minutes max and they are located 10 minutes from my house) the delivery driver FINALLY showed up, took the food from his car but then dropped the 2 liter bottle of soda. Instead of giving us our food, he put everything back in his car and drove off without an explanation! When we called to complain, we were told that the delivery driver was the owner and that they had no idea why he would take off without giving us our food. Food never came, we never got an apology and they still charged my debit card. This place is an absolute joke."}
{"text":"I have ordered their $7.99 carry out special three days in a row now!  Legit I  am completely obsessed with this place.  My mind is completely boggled on how this place only has a couple stars!"}
{"text":"The worst 
Don't order
Don't touch 
Don't try 
The worst of everything from consumer service to know how to make a pizza"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this 2 starts instead of 1 is because their pasta is amazing. Customer service could use a little work.

Ordered from GrubHub and when they arrived they rudely handed me my food without a word and just left. Rather odd.

I ordered fried shrimp, jalapeño poppers and cheesecake. Total including delivery and tip was $27 and I don't think it was worth it. Barely and shrimp and the cheesecake that was delivered was frozen solid. Jalapeño poppers were delicious, though seemed like something I could get at SAMs Club and fry up myself."}
{"text":"The food is great, customer service not so much. The Turkey burger was delicious, but I ordered chili cheese fries and received regular fries. When I called about my chili cheese fries I was told I'd have to pay an extra delivery fee. I told the person on the phone I felt this was unfair and they said there wasn't anything they could do."}
{"text":"service ok -  pizza was very average - not bad for late night pizza delivery. will probably use them again for late delivery."}
{"text":"I ordered lasagna. The piece of lasagna was small and drowned in marinara sauce, making it look like a lot. Never ordering here again. Too expensive for such a small amount. Taste was okay. Nothing special. Sorry but I don't think thats right."}
{"text":"Let's start with the pizza is average. 
Better the dominos but not Ny real pizza

Delivery charge was suppose to be 1.50 but they charged me 3.50 and did not tell me.  

Driver was nice , but the cost of the pie with delivery is not worth it.

Called the cashier back they charge 1.00 a mile after the first mile."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has such horrible reviews but I definitely don't think it's deserved. I ordered 3 lunch specials for delivery. Not only is the price good, but they didn't forget anything. Not even the forks, extra bread, nothing. It takes about an hour to deliver, but that's standard for delivery. I got the spaghetti lunch special. It came perfect. Needed a little extra sauce but no big deal. I also got the ceasar salad lunch special. Came perfect. And the chicken fingers lunch special, it's supposed to come with 3 strips. It's actually came with more than 3 so I'm super happy. They all came with drinks too so I think it's a steal. I called as well to see where my order was, the lady on the phone was super nice and the delivery guy was nice as well."}
{"text":"Eh. Twice the price of Pizza Hut and not as good. Burned cheesy bread and frozen red velvet cake. I should have just had McDonalds delivered."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and threw their ads away for months. I looked up the reviews and they were either great or terrible. So, I avoided this place thinking it was like the other local places that have mediocre pizza. 

I was getting tired of Pizza Hut and was trying new places for the wings. I decided to give them a shot for pickup because a couple of the Yelp posts said they were good. They exceeded my expectations:

7.99 carryout special - pretty good
20 wings - really crispy and great sauce
Garlic knots - too full to eat them

I went again tonight and got the big 26\" pizza. Boy, the kids freaked out and I'll say it was really good! It's like the bigger the pizza the better! I seriously plan to get the 30\" for the next birthday party.

I will certainly go here now instead of Pizza Hut. It's kind of pointless to get delivery because it's so close, but the people there were way nicer than what I expected. Maybe the people who got bad customer service are a little sensitive around guys or something. Who knows."}
{"text":"Just happened to find out about this place from a menu stuffed in the door. I was excited to try them out until I read the reviews and saw it was formerly Bella Lynda, which we ordered from once before and thought was pretty terrible. But, tired of ordering from the only other 3-4 places that deliver to Mountains Edge we took a chance. We had chicken wings, curly fries, I had spaghetti and meatballs and my hubby had veal parmesan. I have to say we were very pleased with everything. The meatballs were surprisingly very juicy and seasoned well. Veal was good. Portions extremely generous. We will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered from here regularly (I hate to admit). The food has been inconsistent, sometimes great, sometimes wrong, sometimes burnt. The delivery driver (young man) is great, friendly, social, makes us want to order from there again, however there is a tall 30-40 year old man that delivers for them as well. He is always talking on his cell phone, or listening to his ear plugs when he comes to our door. He does not say anything, he just shoves the food in the door and walks away. He delivered to us today and peeked his head in our side window 5 seconds after ringing the doorbell as we were heading toward the door. He again, did not say anything. We will NEVER order from here again. That is unacceptable behavior. Not to mention, the Philly Steak Sandwich had a burnt bun which ruined the sandwich. We ignored the low ratings for awhile since we experienced some good things from this company but after the behavior today, that is not going to happen. Save your money and enjoy your privacy and order from somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here at least weekly the last year. Lately they're slipping fast. Every time I call to place an order there is a new counter girl answering the phone and having a hard time understanding the order and getting it right. The last two times all
In the last week they've messed up major twice. The first time I ordered two chicken parm suns picked it up drove home to find two chicken philly subs nothing like what I ordered. Drove back explained their mistake though he says the ticket stated philly and I said well on the phone I ordered Parms and your counter girl entered philly. Regardless hard time and had to wait for correct order. The correct order was actually good and tasted great so I'll give them hat. 

Next order I ordered a philly cheese steak with steak and cheese only I pick it up it's loaded mayo veggies etc. return it state plain steak and cheese got a steak sub plain NO cheese ! So damn dry it was hard to choke it down. Again there is some barrier that's preventing them from getting the orders right. 

On a good note their white pizza is very good. It's always hot or miss here"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery. First off it took over an hour from the time I placed it to be delivered. $44.00 order and when it shows up in have one of the 2 dinners I ordered. I called them back to tell them I didn't receive my order. He asks what I ordered and then says \"oh yeah. it didn't get put in the oven.\" I said well that's nice, so how are we going to fix this? His response  was that he will have a \"new\" one made and have it sent to me. He gave me a time frame of 15 mins. As I right this we are already going on almost 30 mins. When I asked to speak the manager the young guy said he was the manager. I said \"that's sad, cause your customer service is horrible.\" He then again repeated that he would get my meal to me when it was done. I just hung up since I could see it was obviously going to go no where."}
{"text":"Don't order through their app. They always get it wrong. Great food when they get it right. ONLY call if you want takeout. Disappointed that they have ruined 3 meals with not reading the notes in their own app and sending the wrong things."}
{"text":"We came here after getting a flyer on our front door. I was pleasantly surprised to see the wide assortment of their menu. It is incredible! The prices are competitive, the selection is impeccable. Service is great. I am impressed!

As I walked into the parlor I was impressed, the smell of the location eased my mind, I knew right then that I was going to have a great dinner. The first bite into a cheese pizza made my day. The cheese was great, sauce yummy and the crust was perfect, although it could have been a little crispier. 

I am so happy I was able to introduce my family to Brothers. It really reminds me of the pizza pies I would get in New Jersey. This will be a location that we frequent as we love pizza a ton! 

Thanks for placing a menu on our front door! Your marketing brought is there."}
{"text":"Delivery was spot on, and order was perfect. I feel kind of bad as the driver didn't speak english well. He didn't say who it was when he knocked at the door. I believe in beeing safe and as a visually impaired person doubly so.  What scared me was the driver opened the door after I had unlocked it. Not cool with me, and it did startle me. to be fair though I did shake his hand to make up for slamming the door in his face when I didn't know who it was. I did say I was sorry.  He did stand. If you want quick food, this would be the place to go. Delivery was about 20 minute early so be aware of thatteh plaundertThey"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and our family ordered pizza and calzones.  So delicious and they give you your money's worth.  I would recommend coming here. Delivery was as promised.  Now it's our favorite ordering pizza joint!  Thank you Italian Brothers for a job well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Still no personality and I stopped in and ordered waited over an hour for pizza and fingers! Plus the fingers didn't taste as good as they used to."}
{"text":"Bad food horrible service fettuccine alfrado made with NO CHESE . The waitress yelled at me ! DONT GO"}
{"text":"Confusion in flavors I think for this place. 

I ordered meatball jalapeno pizza chicken wings italian soda and 2 desserts ( 1 apple and one brownie. ) 

The Pizza was done perfectly to my taste, you can tell the dough is home made or house made. The tear or texture in the crust you can just tell.I liked the sauce and everything maybe could use a dash of salt and pepper somewhere, just lacking a little of it. 

The chicken wings -- good cooked threw good taste. 

Know this is where the confusion sets in .. I think the dessert's might be store bought ? or partly store bought. 

The apple pie was frozen - leads me to think it was in a box. 

The brownie was hard to eat or not cooked at all -- the choc chips in the brownie where rock hard and or not cooked/ melted. 

The Italian Sodas -- either ice melted into the drink or something lacking flavor in it. Traditional Italian Sodas I have had either have sugar in it or something that has a kick to it. These where Really Really bland like when you have a 2 liter of coke cola that looses its carbonation flavor to it. 

I would recommend cutting your dessert menu in half and making items in house. choose 5 of your best sellers don't always over load a dessert menu. Choose taste of quanity"}
{"text":"I get this place zero stars I ordered food two times here the first time I ordered I asked for extra olives in my salad it look like they gave me whole 2 olives ... I didn't call and complain.... this time I specifically ordered extra jalapeño avocado and macaroni salad they gave me a potato salad no jalapeños or avocados they said they don't have avocado and the jalapeños were extra charge so they didn't put it on there because they didn't charge me mind you it was coming to my door and I was paying in cash and on the order slip  when I ordered it it said will be an extra charge so  I knew it was gonna be an extra charge so she said she called me and she gave me a number that wasn't even on my Oder Horrible customer service ...didn't even apologize there is a way to handle customer service I've been in customer service for a while and there rude customer service and  food won't be and we ordered it will be cold and not what you want never going there again"}
{"text":"I like there food but I wish the delivery driver would of remembered my 2 liter soda lol. But I still love there wings and pizza"}
