{"text":"I echo all of the positive reviews that others have posted. I literally don't know how I would have managed if I hadn't stumbled upon Ingrid and her crew. I am a busy professional who is vegan for ethical reasons but rarely has time to cook, which means I was frequently not eating a very healthy or balanced diet. I had tried another vegan food service in town, and without naming names, I was not impressed with the taste or high prices. After digging into my first order from Community Cuisine, I couldn't believe that vegan food this delicious and high quality could be found in Phoenix for such a reasonable price. Everyone's tastes are different, and I don't necessarily love every dish, but there is enough variety every week to keep me more than happy. Plus, I can finally eat delicious guilt-free desserts!!! The chocolate cream pie and maple walnut baklava are particularly amazing. The minor hassle of picking up my order every week does not even compare to the major hassle of going to the grocery store and cooking meals.... so if you are someone who appreciates vegan food or just healthy food in general, you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some GREAT deliciously prepared vegan food this is the place to be Monday nights at 6pm! Each week a new well balanced menu is prepared from scratch with mostly all organic ingredients served buffet style pay as you can. Ingrid also believes in supporting local farmers and often buys whats in season. 
They also have a meal service that is awesome as well ! Order once a week and pick up after a wonderful meal on Monday night.  Packed in mason jars the food keeps nicely for several days. Great for those nights you don't have time to cook a nice meal. I highly recommend you give Community Cuisine a try even if you are not vegan or vegetarian. Everyone is always welcome. You may even meet some new friends."}
{"text":"After recently changing jobs (and now having pretty sad work cafeteria options), as well as trying to eat healthier & vegetarian more often, Community Cuisine has been a perfect addition to my weekday lunches. I've ordered about three times now and the process is very easy. Typically each Wednesday they will send out a link to their weekly menu, and you have until roughly Saturday at 5pm to place your order online. As someone who has food allergies, I also appreciate that their online menu lists all of the ingredients for each item, so that I can avoid certain dishes. 

Pickup is on Monday afternoons, and their 23rd St & Washington St pickup location (just off I-10) is super convenient for me to swing by on my way home from work. Each week there will usually be a few salad options as well as dishes like curries, stir-frys, and soups. Most of the menu items come in (very adorable, Pinterest-worthy) glass jars, but I've also gotten items like raw falafel with a dipping sauce, or a super tasty veggie turnover. Small jar items typically run around $4-$5 and the large jars are around $9. Typically I've ordered ~8 items in a week, and 2 small jars (like a small salad and small soup) or one large jar will make a great lunch for me at work. You'll put down a $20 deposit with your first order which will cover the insulated bags and jars, which you exchange the next time you pick up.  Super tasty & convenient -- I wish I discovered this sooner!"}
{"text":"You simply HAVE TO do this! Sign up on website to receive weekly menus on Wednesdays, place your order online Weds-Sat, & pick up your order on Mon. It's essentially healthy, organic, & vegetarian meal prep that's done for you. When you pick up your order, they send you off with your food labeled in mason jars inside insulated bag. I'm so excited I found Ingrid & Community Cuisine! I will def continue to be a weekly customer. Thanks for keeping the community healthy & giving this vegetarian some healthy, creative, & homemade meals!"}
{"text":"The Community Kitchen is somewhere I look forward to attend every Monday night. It's the healthy, wide variety of vegan food made with love I can always get there, it's also about the community experience I get. I feel a sense of belonging there; an inviting, harmony environment adds value to the whole eating experience. I admire how they use mason jar to do all of their re-ordered meals. That extra effort shows how they truly embrace the world view of leaving zero imprint on the planet. 
I highly recommend Community Cuisine to all the like-minded individuals who care about their health, and that of the planet's."}
{"text":"Amazingly healthy and tasty. I am a true \"foodie\" and love high fat/high sugar/heavy meat and cheese food. So I thought I'd get this to reduce the aforementioned and because I don't like to cook veggies. I had no idea how amazingly great everything would be. One day I had had a piece of key lime pie and that day had the chocolate cream pie from CC delivered, and ate it too as I couldn't stop, and it was better than the 5 star restaurants even tho vegan! The breakfast oats are the first time I have broken from a heavy meat/cheese breakfast and actually feel satisfied.(ok, I sometimes add an egg but...) This is seriously delicious, healthy food and cooked with obvious love by Ingrid and her crew. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this food!   I recently moved to Phoenix and a friend told me about Community Cuisine.  Since pick-up isn't far from where I work, I gave it a try. OMG!  I have been vegetarian for almost 20 years, and I like the idea of being vegan but struggle with it a busy single working mom  (I come from midwestern meat and potato background).  This place has been a life saver during my move and getting settled!  I can grab a jar on my way to work and know I have something healthy and veg for lunch without thinking about it... and it's not prepackaged crap I might buy at the store.  Since their food is so tasty, my friend has even decided to go vegetarian too! We are texting each other every other day about how tasty the food is.  Community Cuisine is helping me to start my Phoenix life the way I want - veggie, tasty, and healthy!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Community Cuisine is a gem of place in the Valley of the Sun! Located east of downtown Phoenix on the SW corner of 23rd St and Washington St (enter the front door of the Toolnet International building). And if you've never been here before, you're in for a real treat of healthy, tasty, and nutritious food! 

From fertile organic fields to our mouths, Community Cuisine excels at preparing a Vegan and Vegetarian culinary rapture and the sweet nectar of the gods! I find myself savoring every bite of one mouth-watering masterpiece and flavor revelation after another; a feast for the eyes, tongue, and body! 

You can discover for yourself their cuisine two different ways. One is a pickup service each week at their venue. Most recipes are low-fat and gluten-free. A weekly menu is posted by midnight each Wednesday evening, with an order deadline of 10am Saturday morning. Visit their website for more details. 

The other way to check out the high quality and delectable taste of their foods is their weekly community \"pay as you can\" Vegan dinner each Monday throughout the year at 6pm. It's a buffet, so bring your appetite. And if you're new to healthier ways of eating, be prepared for an explosion of taste with each and every morsel of delight!  

They also offer cooking classes for tips of the trade to building a healthier, happier you. 

Community Cuisine will rock your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Hello?! How have I not reviewed this gem? The first time I came to the Community Cuisine kitchen was back in August/September of 2015 with a friend who loves them. We came to the Monday night dinner where we were able to try various vegan dishes and everything was delicious. It's a pay as you can set up, so some people put money in a box while others helped out in the kitchen, serving, and cleaning up. As a pescetarian, I lean towards vegetarian foods because I know I can eat them, since my only dietary restrictions are any meat besides seafood. I love the variety of dishes and the creativity that they use. Seasonal fruits and veggies are incorporated and they do their best to stay local and organic. Lots of gluten free options too.

After attending the dinner, I began ordering food online. The first time, you pay a $20 deposit for the reusable glass jars and bag (which you get back if you decide to stop ordering from them). This is what you will get most of your food packed in and its eco friendly, which I appreciate. The menu opens on Wednesday and ordering is available until Saturday. You can pick up at this location or at another in Phoenix/Scottsdale, with address information given after you place your order. They have soups, salads, rice dishes, veggies, and even desserts. Everything is marked clearly; the ingredients, whether the dish is vegan or gluten free, and which ingredients are organic and/or locally sourced. They even offer delivery for a pretty broad area, which can be convenient for some. 

I don't order on a regular basis anymore, but I appreciate the friendly service and knowing that what I'm ordering is healthy and serves a bigger cause of promoting food consciousness and bringing people together. I would check them out and give your support to a hard working small business!"}
{"text":"Delish food. Incredibly kind people. Convenient ordering. And HEALTHY!! Sanity saver as pre-made lunch during the week."}
{"text":"I helped a friend of mine set up for the Monday community dinner last night. Ingrid and Daniel are incredible people whose love and humanity show in the food that is created. Pay as you can and if you cannot you are welcome. The world needs more people like these two. And did I mention the food? Phenomenal. I had the pleasure of feasting on: samosas, falafel, 2 kinds of salad (both with exquisite dressings) roasted root vegetables, rice with dahl, no tuna - tuna salad and for dessert - thumb print cookies and chocolate coconut cookie bars. I plan on helping out when I can as well as ordering food for the week on their website. Community Cuisine gathers people from all backgrounds to come together for an evening meal and isn't that the true beauty of food?"}
