{"text":"The worst Mexican food ever! The owner had no personality. Had to ask for stale chips and salsa that tasted like tomato soup! The tacos come in one tortilla so they fall apart on first bite. The enchiladas came with the \"special sauce\" which tasted like spaghetti sauce that they topped with lettuce and  sprinkled Parmesan  cheese  over. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The owner is nice, the prices are good and the food has so much flavor. This was a nice discovery. With its small dining room and adjacent kitchen area you almost feel as if you're eating in someone's house. I'm not one to notice or care about service usually, just bring me food and I'm happy, but the man here opened the door for us when we arrived, adjusted the window blinds by our table when we sat down, and was very helpful and attentive. . I love it"}
{"text":"This is (by a considerable margin) the worst Mexican food I have ever had, and one of the worst meals I've ever had.  I ordered Combo #2, which included the following: a chicken burrito (less than 3 inches long and almost completely without chicken), a chicken taco (which had nothing other than a few bits of chicken in it, along with a small chicken bone), a tiny cheese quesadilla (I would expect more flavor from a single slice of white bread), and a chicken fajita that was unfit for a high school cafeteria.  This came with rice (bland) and refried beans (watery), and a side of guacamole, which oddly enough tasted like bacon.  This sounds like a lot of food, as it should be for $12, but it wasn't.  Each item looked like it had been miniaturized for a children's menu.  I am not someone who expects culinary greatness from a hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant, but this was truly terrible food.  I would expect more flavor from a frozen TV dinner."}
{"text":"The food is great . Very good flavor . The workers are very nice and sufficient.  I will definitely go back anytime."}
{"text":"This review is for the chorizio tacos because every time I go to Mendoza I vow to try something new and I always end up getting these. The chorizio is finely diced, well seasoned, and topped with fresh cilantro. There delicious and at $6.00 a great deal as well.  The reason for the 4 star review versus 5 is the sides at Mendoza are middling. Certainly no reason not to give it a try though as everyone I've taken here has always enjoyed their main course."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Traditional atmosphere. Friendly employees and go od prices. Best local Mexican place, in my opinion! Looks like a hole in the wall, but it is clean and great."}
{"text":"Mendozas is great! It may not be the best mexican food in the world, or even the city, but it is authentic and quick and great for a lunch out from the office. The chorizo tacos are awesome.  Its super tiny and a little cramped but it has charm and the owner is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here somewhat often, never have had a complaint. We usually end up ordering for a few people, which makes the order quite large, and they never get anything wrong. Everything is always fresh and delicious, best Mexican I have had in Pittsburgh. I am from the Louisiana, we have authentic Mexican on every other street, and this is definitely the best, authentic Mexican I've had here. Nice portions too! People who don't like the rice there probably aren't used to how it's supposed to be made. delicious!"}
{"text":"Very authentic mexican food. The service is always great and fast. I have been there numerous times and I have yet to have a bad experience. The portions are huge and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I need a regular dose of Mendoza Express in my life. It helps that I work less than a mile away from the restaurant. I don't know what authentic Mexican food is, but this food here is dee-lee-shus! I love the tacos here and love how simple they are. Their veggie dishes are very flavorful, I do not miss meat in my veggie meals here at all. There is no fake this and that in them, just plain ole vegetables. My fave is the eggs and chorizo dish. I think you can also get that in a burrito, but I like the version that resembles scrambled eggs. The service is quick and friendly. The man at the counter is super nice and helpful. If you are ever in the Greentree-Crafton-Carnegie area, stop by!"}
{"text":"Ok so I gave in and tried again, just because this place is so darn convenient for their location! Still sucked. Pretty sure I chipped my tooth on a piece of rice (not kidding)  I give up officially."}
{"text":"We 4 had the special which was chicken chipotle fajitas.  Amazing.  So delicious.  BYOB.   2 person staff.  Mom and  pop duo so be patient.  We were and we're rewarded.  They do breakfast too.  Wonder how yummy that is??  Hmmm...."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place. My husband and I went there for lunch today because we had eaten there last year and it was fantastic. We lived in FL for a long time and are always searching for Mexican that compares to the Mexican food there. The first time we ate at Mendoza Express it was fantastic, authentic, and reasonably priced. This time it was awful. They have changed everything. They use yellow nacho cheese now. The refried beans are not only no longer mashed, but lacking flavor. There was Parmesan instead of queso fresco on my husband's enchiladas. The food was barely warm. We were the only people there, so it makes no sense. We are so disappointed! What was a diamond in the rough now seems to be a mediocre at best Mexican restaurant. I think they must be doing budget cuts or something...."}
{"text":"Ah, perfection!  Authentic Mexican cusine?  Check.  Fresh, daily ingredients?  Check.  13\" TV blaring Spanish programming?  Check.  Mendoza is the best and most authentic Mexican I've had the pleasure to stumble on over the past few years.  Abe and his wife; sometimes joined by their son, bought an old sandwich trailer (think house).  Abe and his wife used to work in hospitality in Acapulco, had the American dream, realized they could do what they do here and earn a living, and did it.  Move over Don Pablos, Mendoza has authenticity.  That's what makes them great.  Sure, they only seat 15... but who cares when (sometimes) you can watch the ingredients get received and then have them on your plate.  I've never had a bad experience here... even my ~gasp~ parents loved it (they don't love anything, including me).  The decor adds to the charm.  Blissfully tacky-touristy items load the walls... and it all fits just fine.  Leave your tux at home.  Street food with a roof, and if you want it, a sit down Mexican dinner that can only be found south of Texas.  If you allow the outside to detract you, great... it means there is a seat for me inside, where I can squint and watch some lucha libre and enjoy one of the best meals in this city."}
{"text":"I would go elsewhere for Mexican food. You're better off driving 15-20mins out of the way to another Mexican Restaurant. No flavor. Food was barely warm."}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic.   If you love real Mexican food, this may be the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  May seat only 20 people total. Get here early for lunch !"}
{"text":"My bar for hole in the wall Mexican is pretty low. Especially in the northeast. It just has to taste good. This food here, in a word, sucked. Chips and salsa were bland. Basically tapatio hot sauce mixed with tomato sauce. I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas. 14.98 with tax. Tasted like the meat was pregirlled and then both mixed with the same sauce that again tasted like hot sauce mixed with chili powder and tomatoes. The soggy meat, onions and green peppers were piled on top two tiny tortillas and surrounded by rice that had the texture of microwave uncle bens, and  pinto beans made of chalk. Like I said, I'm not real picky with my Mexican food tastes, but this place just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Coming from Houston, my view is that this place is NOT authentic Mexican. The owner does a good job with some  regional Mexican seafood, but the tacos/quesadillas/burritos/whatever the typical person looks for at a Mexican restaurant are skimpy on toppings and really tiny for the money. I would get your takeout somewhere else."}
{"text":"As you walk in your eyes realize how small this place is. You're arm to arm with your face feeding neighbors but the food is so worth it. The walls are covered in pictures of folks who have eaten the mega burrito(no longer on the menu). You get to listen to Spanish tv so brush up on your high school classes.   To start we ordered the beef nachos which were covered in beef, jalapenos, cheese and side skirted with lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream.   We ordered various burritos, shrimp and steak to the want to know it alls. You get 1 refill on drinks and then its $1 per fill up. The service was cordial and happy as was the visit to this small establishment."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, but not incredible. I would recommend the Al Pastor tacos as they were quite flavorful and came with pineapple! The chicken tacos were bland and unremarkable. Unfortunately, the tacos were only served with a single corn tortilla which fell apart quickly.  This is better Mexican food than many places around Pittsburgh, but only in the middle of my range. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, but would probably try it again if I was driving by."}
{"text":"soooo im not sure if it's because i'm a California Mexican and not a Pennsylvania Mexican, but this is the first time i've seen that i cant have refills on my chips and i cant split my taco order to have different meats, ie. 2 chorizo tacos and 1 al pastor taco.  Also, why cant i have rice and beans... why rice OR beans??? Why is that???  Salsa was nothing to write home about!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants period. My wife and I eat here at least once a week and would eat here more if we could afford it. I have tried just about everything on the menu and everything has been great.   I would recommend chipotle chicken fajitas and dinner enchiladas."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd favorite authentic mexican restaurant. It's a cute little place. There's not much room to eat there so I'd suggest ordering takeout instead. I love that they have a create your own combination plate, I never have seen that at any other mexican restaurant. This place never disappoints when I get food there."}
{"text":"This place was a very small Mexican restaurant. The tables are covered in plastic(not appealing). To start off, each table received chips and salsa. I actually enjoyed both. Each additional chips and salsa you would have to pay extra for. I got a lunch special at a reasonable price with a small beef burrito and a small chicken fajita with a side of rice. The flavors were actually great, but they were so juicy/watery that it made everything very soggy and hard to eat. I like salsa on top of my fajitas and burritos and I had to pay more for some salsa for my meal. Overall ok, I'd at least go back again and give them another shot. Like I said, the flavors were there. Also for lunch, the portion sizes were great."}
{"text":"My family decided to try this little restaurant after driving past it so many times.  We heard mixed reviews about it and wanted to see for ourselves.  The numerous signs made it very clear that only the first basket of chips was free and drinks only came with one refill.  The food itself wasn't great.  I got a chicken taco and burrito that came with rice and beans.  The taco and burrito were bland and seemed thrown together. The rice was hard and painfully bland while the beans were soggy and seemed to be watery.  There are many better options for good Mexican food.  The food here just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I've only had the chorizo tacos and beef quesadilla so far but I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu. The chorizo tacos are some of the best I've ever had and the quesadilla was very good as well. You get 3 tacos and a side of beans or rice for like $6 bucks. Such a good deal. Your money goes a long way here. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews prior to coming here but took a chance since it was recommended by a family member and we are visiting from out of town. I was excited to try this place. Upon walking in I really respected the \"mama and pop\" tiny restaurant ambiance. The owners are friendly. But I also knew as soon as my guacamole dip was delivered, that we had made a big mistake. It wasn't even real guacamole rather it was processed garbage squeezed from a pouch. So much disappointment as that told me everything I needed to know right up front. And like a prior review had mentioned, the salsa is tomato sauce mixed with some hot sauce it seems.  I expected so much more and was dreading my meal coming that I ordered. And sure enough, it was what I figured. Bland. A parmesan cheese salad on top of my enchilada, fake processed everything. So because I couldn't trust the quality of this food I chose not to eat more then a couple bites. Being I am on vacation I did not want to take any chances on getting food poisoning. Also there were ants on our table"}
{"text":"Food took a very long time to arrive and tasted like it was straight out of a can or jar.  Maybe they had trouble finding the can opener.  The colorful decor and low prices are the only things this place has going for it."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but nothing special. If you're in the area and don't want Taco Bell, give it a try but I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"We sat at one of the few tables and were entertained by the pictures of Acapulco on the walls. --Acapulco is a beautiful beach in Mexico therefore this thought crossed my mind: \"Why on earth would this guy move to Pittsburgh, of all places?\"  I don't know and I don't care. We want him to stay in Pittsburgh forever! He's got one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Burgh.   Owned by a couple, the wife does her magic in the kitchen and the husband runs the floor. The typical menu look has plenty of entrées. Our food here is always outstanding; you get what you ask for, not a dish filled with lettuce or cheese or sides as you often see. Consequently when our friends asked us to meet us here we couldn't wait to drive across town and enjoy another dinner with them. Too bad we don't live near this place, with this quality and price we could eat here almost every day!"}
{"text":"Basically they put store bought salsa on everything. The staff was rude and they are super cheap with their drinks and chips/salsa. Maybe I'm just used to the great service and food at Emilianos. The food looked like a bunch of slop and when someone at my table asked for double meat on their tacos they were rude and said no because the meat is already portioned out. Ok...... So you don't want extra money for extra meat? Weird."}
{"text":"We accidently found this place while sitting in traffic and starving. I have to say, they have the best soft corn tacos around! We always order the Al Pastor tacos and they are ALWAYS AMAZING! For under $7, you get a basket of chips with salsa, three soft corn tortillas al pastor tacos, rice, hot sauce and great service! Their flan is also homemade and very, very good!"}
{"text":"Driving passed the place you may think it looks sort of sketchy, but believe me, it's so worth. If you like authentic Mexican food, this is the place for you. Not may places like this exist in the 'Burgh (the last I remember was Taco Loco in the South Side, which is now closed) so it's worth the drive. The menu is huge and not too pricey either. Always check for the lunch specials as well because you can find some good deals. Another plus is the free chips before/during your meal. The exterior isn't anything special, and definitely reflects what you see on the outside. To be honest, it sort of looks like they just transformed a house into a restaurant. However, I think that's how the place gets its charm."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop Mexican restaurant. I had the tacos al pastor and the pork tacos they were great. Rest of the menu looked good. Great prices. Very friendly owners. Will defemitely try again when in this area."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic find. The food is wonderful we had a party of 8, no one ordered the same thing and everything was so delicious."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and I've always enjoyed it until this last visit. It had been a few months since my last visit and I'm hoping it was just a bad night, but it was a very bad night. We were the only people in there upon our arrival and the owner acted like we were disturbing him. The food was awful.  We were a party of 3 and we all barely ate any of it. The rice was over cooked and the burrito was cold. If I had written this review a year ago I would've easily given it 4 stars. What a shame. It used to be such a cute little place that had fair prices, friendly service, and consistently good food. After this experience, I'm doubtful that I'll ever try it again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've had several items off the menu and I'm always pleased. It's an excellent option if you want take out on a Friday night and I think it's also a BYOB. The al pastor tacos are the best. Make sure you order a side of hot sauce to go with your meal! It's definitely a better option than any of the local pizza places for take out."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food I ever had. There wasn't any taste and it was cold. If that was the last place to eat in this world I would starve."}
{"text":"I am from southern Orange County, so I might be a little bias. The decor and ambiance of the place is pretty fun, but the place is a tight squeeze. I was there for a quick lunch and ordered the Al Pastor tacos. It came with three tacos and rice for 6.50, no complaints on price. The tacos were yummy, just wished they used fresh pineapple instead of canned. Secondly the rice was a little hard, as if it were oldish or stale, but good flavor.   I was there during lunch and the place only has about 9 tables. They were considerably busy and I felt like they were trying to rush myself and other customers out.   Overall all pretty good considering price. I would give it a shot if in the area."}
{"text":"You should get very excited right now because this place is AWESOME. I can't stop talking about it. The corn tortillas are really, really good. Maybe some of the best I have ever had. The al pastor taco is also very, very delicious and I have never had anything like it before. It is authentic, but relate able for those who have mostly a tex-mex cuisine in the past. The staff could not be nicer and the place is cozy and cute. It is worth the drive. Oh, did I mention it is crazy affordable?  Get there, really, hurry up. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Little Mexican place run by some nice Mexican nationals.  Very friendly and good service. Food is authentic.  Small with only 9 tables and most only seat 2 people.  Place was crowded.  Some chips and salsa arrived immediately and they were good.  Had a Eggs and Chorizo Burrito,  the tortilla shell was good with a nice soft texture but the chorizo with egg had an odd taste..not a chorizo taste.  Guess I should have tried something else.  Oh the name is actually Mendoza Express, not sure why Yelp has Mendoza Abraham.  Added website and set note to Yelp about incorrect name, hopefully it will be changed."}
{"text":"I've been to Mendoza Express about 2-3 times to give it a fair shot because Who doesn't love tacos!?! The owner always seems rude. He stares at you while you're eating, like you're inconveniencing him by being there. It's very creepy. I decided not to go back... anyways, about a month ago I saw the owner buying all of his taco meat, tortillas, etc from the local Carnegie Aldi..... seriously dude? Couldn't you get a distributor? Granted, I love Aldi. However, I might as well buy the cheap crap myself & make it at home. It sounds like mine might have more flavor anyways. Wouldn't be shocked if you're all paying *extra* for pre made Aldi Guacamole. Yikes. Completely turned off."}
{"text":"Okay -- I really wanted to love this place... despite some of the reviews... But, they are true. Signs everywhere about only getting one basket of chips and salsa and one free drink refill are not very welcoming. At all.  The salsa wasn't even good. Too runny and not enough flavor. Also, I'm wondering if their recipe changed since some of the photos a few years ago? My rice was so plain. Didn't resemble Mexican rice at all.  Oh, before I forget... I AM Mexican... I realize different parts of the country do things differently... but the majority of items I had lacked flavor.   Positives: in and out in under 40 mins so good for a lunch trip The tacky décor keeps you busy The spicy salsa is REALLY spicy... (that could be a negative for some) Price: I ordered the Dinner Combo #1: Chicken enchilada, chicken fajita, chicken taco and beef tostada with rice and beans and guac for $13 Guacamole was decent Server/owner was very nice  Negatives: Bland and soggy food Very tiny space Cheap signage everywhere and the sides of guac and sour cream are TINY (and cost extra)"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that Pittsburgh isn't a great place for Mexican Food, but Mendoza Express is the best place for Mexican Food in Pittsburgh. Try the al Pastor it's the best."}
{"text":"A truly wonderful place. The Rebozo and Zarape are wonderful. Never had these two dishes anywhere else. I heve enjoyed lunch there when ever in the neighbor hood. I'm glad they picked Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Mendoza Express is an authentic restaurant serving up some of the best tasting dishes. My former office was a hop skip and jump away and I'd have lunch there 3-4 times a week. Now I'm lucky if I get back every six months but when I do it's always perfection. The homemade chips and salsa are so good that I fill up before my meal arrives."}
{"text":"This gabaucho may be a rube when it comes to Mexican food, but for my money, this is the best place in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because the people who own it were very accommodating and nice.  But bad food is bad food.  And in this case, it was both meanings of bad.  I ordered a vegetarian burrito and an order of juevos rancheros to go.  The burrito was made from greasy thrown together onions and peppers with a splash of a salsa that tasted like Rotel out of a can.  It was so wet, the tortilla fell apart.  Later that evening, it would also prove to be my Montezuma's revenge.  Maybe jeuvos rancheros isn't the best take out item, but, how do you screw up on eggs?  Mendoza's did.  What was that stuff that was supposed to be a tomato based item?  Only 1/4 was eaten out of hunger.  And yes, a second person became physically ill from this food.  It made for some tense moments in our 1-toilet hotel room."}
{"text":"We got food to go.  It was very good, and the portion size was appropriate.  The chicken was seasoned well, and the vegetarian burrito was delicious.  The chips were perfect."}
