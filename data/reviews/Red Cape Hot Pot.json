{"text":"Worst dinning experience ever. I had a meal with three friends, but I got a bill of 5 people (this is a buffet restaurant), plus automatic 15% tips without any explanation. $168 in total! The supervisor rudely ripped our menu off, when I questioned the total price. Never try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Bad attitude and rude. Unreasonable price. Charge you any price they want without any permission and explanation. Worst restaurant."}
{"text":"Aside from the hot pot being not tasty nor authentic, service attitude their was extremely terrible. They have this rule of time limit and food remains that's essentially never told until we begin got the bill. 

Seriously, if you do care about service quality, don't even think about this place. My most candid advice."}
{"text":"My favorite hot pot spot in town. Fresh ingredients and great services. Various choices for soup bases and food is yummy! PS. the owner has a taste a la mode for background music:))) If you are looking for some Bona fide Chinese hot pot, this place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"my favorite hot pot in champaign. Both the spicy pot and tomoto pot are yummy.. Hearing that the chef is from Szechwan?the sauce and seasoning are very authentic...It is a buffet style hot pot and the price is reasonable. I ate many fish balls and there are so many kinds of drinks we can choose. Good dinner experience"}
{"text":"Was once good when they started. Not good any more. Limit the time even though there are other tables available. Rude service to drive ppl away when it comes to time limit."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. They recently updated the menu to buffet style so the price is very reasonable. My favorite is the garlic beef, little fried pork, and deep fried buns. The tomato pot is amazing, seriously the best I've ever had. My girlfriend had the mild spicy pot which she loved as well. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I am from Notre Dame and there is not hot pot restaurant in my local area. Glad there is one in UIUC and I liked it a lot. It is a buffet style, but the meat is still fresh and there is a large variety of food. The price is good too (30ish includes tax and tips). Will visit again when I get another chance to go to UIUC."}
{"text":"No joking this is prob the best hot pot I've had in my life. The tomato soup and the varieties of vegetables brought my vegan diet to a whole new level. Reasonable pricing and very good service."}
{"text":"Love this place!
This has been my fav and definite go-to place for hot spot in champaign. When it comes to hot pot it matters a great deal whether the ingredients are of reliable sources. I'm sure for those who believe in quality over quantity would agree that the price for this place has always been fair"}
{"text":"Good price. Quality meat. Unlimited nice drink. Their spicy hot pot are quite authentic actually. Their service is fine though."}
