{"text":"I don't know if I'm the only one but for me they didn't season the RICE at all. There was no taste of the usual rice vinegar taste to the sushi rice that's usually in normal sushi. Did anyone else experience that or is it just me?"}
{"text":"Vegetarian review here! We ordered take out sushi from this place. We pointed to the one we liked on their brochure and paid about 60.00. Whoa, expensive!!! BUT, It was a pretty big platter and everyone, about 5 of us, with huge dinner appetites, enjoyed it. We had some leftovers, too! The platter came with a lot of soy sauce, ginger and wasabi. Honestly, it seemed like it was the real thing. I was even scared to eat the salmon pieces because it looked like real salmon. Every single roll I ate was delicious! I would serve this platter to all my meat eater friends just to impress them and freak them out! I can't wait to go back and try other platters and their lunch specials! Fast service and friendly service. 5 stars from a humble veggie!!!"}
{"text":"We discovered Tenon a few months back and ever since we've been hooked! We live in North York around Dufferin and Finch and we make the trek just to Tenon because it's THAT good! The sushi is fantastic, the flavours are delicate and intricate, we haven't had a roll we didn't like! My favourite is the house special roll, the serve it warm it's mouth watering! The Thai dishes are good as well and there's a lot on the we haven't yet tried because we always order the Sushi. We highly recommend Tenon!

RE ANTONIA'S REVIEW - Did you miss the big sign outside the restaurant that says Tenon \"Vegetarian\" restaurant??? I'm not sure how you can complain that there was no fish at a restaurant that is called Tenon VEGETARIAN. If you are going to write a review, please make it useful next"}
{"text":"Bad survice and bad experience. Much lower than my expectation, the cook is not dedicated at all, so the food is not what good veggie food should be like."}
{"text":"Very satisfying meal! Would go here again! 

I was with one other person (who is not a vegetarian but still loved the food!) and we ordered a mango salad, yam tempura roll, assorted veggie tempura, spinach tofu, and pineapple \"chicken\" fried rice. It was just enough food for us and we were both really hungry! The meal also comes with tea so that was a nice touch! We also asked for everything to be made vegan, to accomodate my dietary requirements. 

Service wasn't anything special, but that was made up for in the food. The mango salad was very fresh, with an interesting dressing. The Yam tempura roll was nice, although nothing special. The veggie tempura assortment was nice and had a variety of veggies including eggplant, yam, sweet potato, broccoli, zucchini, and mushroom. It was nice and crisp. What really made the meal for me was the spinach tofu. It was soft but crispy tofu slathered with a delicious peanut-y sauce and served with some dehydrated spinach. The spinach was seasoned and almost reminiscent of those crispy seaweed snacks you can buy. The pineapple \"chicken\" fried rice had other vegetables in it and the soy chicken was not overwhelming which was nice.

All in all, I can't wait to dine here again. Fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"This is our new favourite go-to restaurant for special occasions and any time we can come up with an excuse to drive all the way to Markham. My husband and I have been working our way through the all-you-can-eat menu and have loved just about everything we've tried. Even the items we've liked less have been good, if not great.

My only two complaints are that they don't clearly label which things are vegan or which can be made vegan (I think we've only been served vegan items there, but I'm never 100% sure, since nothing on the menu is labeled), and that they're located so far from downtown Toronto. Open an East End location, please!

They have a new freezer section with various veggie meats and things like house-made won ton. 

The staff is very friendly and the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"Excellent food! My husband had the sushi and said it was excellent! I have some other dietary requirements and the staff was kind and helpful. Food and service were above average. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been here a lot, but on Friday night (April 22)  we went, all three of us got sick right after when we got home. We had a few sushi/maki and the orange and teriyaki chicken. Something was off on the taste that day, maybe they served us old food. We have been there regularly and never had this experience. But unfortunately we won't be going there again nor recommending it like I used to. Such a shame, their food was really good, but not worth it if they have chosen to lower their quality of food."}
{"text":"I was caught by surprise,  it was very good!  I 've always been a meat or seafood person, I thought it be just no taste etc. to my surprise it was very tasty and not taste greasy at all.   What really impress me was the crispy duck dish, portion was quite big and nice presentation, shared  among 5 of us.  It  taste like meat !  Crispy and tasty.  It was dried tufo dehydrated tufo! 

Presentation of food and the atmosphere is very nice and very clean . Would recommend to try it out ! U be surprise , shrimp taste but it's not shrimp ,  then  the Fish  taste like fish but it's not.  Have to try it out !!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian and this was my first time going to a completely vegan restaurant. I had the lunch buffet and I tried most of the sushi rolls which were too bland for my tastes. Guess I'm just not used to imitation meat/seafood. That being said, I think a vegetarian would enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Went for all you can eat lunch. Having been a vegetarian for years but never having tried vegan sushi, I was excited to try. I was not disappointed! Service was friendly, food was super delicious, and prices were fairly cheap! I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"10/10. Best restaurant in Markham! Has immense vegan options. Even if your not vegan you'd fall in love with this place. The servers are also so friendly. Go try it now!"}
{"text":"The food was honestly 4.5/5 stars and was absolutely delicious. The decorations and restaurant itself was gorgeous.  The problem was the service.  I was highly disappointed as noticing that I was getting treated worse than a biracial black and white couple with their daughter.  The waitress smiled so friendly to them and used a nice,friendly tone and handled things very politely.  Then to me,as another Chinese,she just used this casual,aggressive tone. This has never happened to me before.  When asking for something,she rudely asked what? But to the biracial couple,she was like yes? With a pleasant smile. In the beginning,we asked to sit in their nice unreserved private area. SHE IGNORED OUR QUESTION AND TOLD US TO SIT IN THE NORMAL TABLES. Later on,there were two white women who asked to sit in that same area and the WAITRESS SAID YES WITH A FAKE SMILE. I was feeling that she was trying way harder to treat the white people better.  She treated us Chinese people as if we weren't customers.  She even smacked the bill out of our hands when we payed.  I have never had someone so rude to me in my entire life as me being a customer.  Amazing food. Expensive food. TERRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite veggie sushi place to go in Toronto. They serve more than just veggie sushi. They have sizzling plates, noodles and a whole bunch of other items on their menu. I consider the AYCE option each time, but I end up opting for the regular menu, which has the sushi/sashimi options and I end up ordering enough food that I'm stuffed full anyway.

I've been here with family and friends and all of them are initially quite fascinated by the concept of veggie sushi. They agree that it tastes interesting, but we all agree that it is quite pricey for veggie sushi. It's the handiwork that goes into making this stuff.

In any case, this is a great go-to vegetarian option for me in Markham! They accommodate larger groups and there are even tables that are sectioned off for privacy.

I've been quite a number of times, but I still haven't gone through all the items on the menu. There are just that many options, which is amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was very tasty. Went for the ayce to be able to try different dishes. A bit pricey, but the food is very interesting and I didn't miss the meat. I would go back for the experience if I was in the area or out with vegetarian / vegan friends."}
{"text":"I found out about tenon from a friend and decided to try it out since my favourite vegetarian sushi place closed down. I thought the service was nice. Overall the food was good good choice of soups and appetizers and as for the rolls the faux spicy salmon was my favourite."}
{"text":"Not bad for a vegetarian restaurant. The food is fresh, creative, and inspiring. It's not easy to replicate sushi or duck/pork using soy, but they pull it off in a fresh and tasty way."}
{"text":"Tony the owner and sushi chef is incredibly creative. I've been going there for the past 8 years (since before they went vegetarian) and have never been disappointed by the food. 

Service can sometimes be slow, but the sushi makes up for it in folds. Best vegetarian sushi in Markham and the best that I've have including the GTA!

I sit in traffic to eat at Tenon. Just go already!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love going here, but they took away the all you can eat option, I won't be returning. Also poor customer service :( too bad to see a place with good food lose regular customers!"}
{"text":"This Sushi restaurant features 100% Vegetarian fare. 

What's interesting is they have vegetarian sashimi, so you can order hand rolls etc that have \"salmon\" or \"tuna\" and it actually looks like salmon or tuna.  Taste is quite good.  The owner told me that this is all brought in from Japan.   There's a very full menu, bento boxes, noodles, maki, hand rolls, etc.  

Decor is quite nice and there are several small rooms off to the side with one or two tables in them.  

Green tea is free. 

It's really nice as a vegetarian to walk in and be able to order anything on the menu at a sushi place!"}
{"text":"The sushi doesn't really taste like sushi but it is interesting to try, it's kind of chewy. But definitely get the soy chicken teriyaki, it's amazing and tastes so good. Can't even tell that it's not real. Also had the sweet and sour eel, it's interesting, not bad but nothing amazing like the teriyaki. I wouldn't get the eel again if I go back"}
{"text":"All the food was great. The House Special Duck and the sushi roll with deep fried king oyster mushroom were my favorites, It was packed but moved quick enough, and the servers were nice. I wish Toronto had more restaurants like this."}
{"text":"I don't recalled other ALL U CAN EAT Japanese restaurants has VEGAN only, but TENON. 
Space is small, but tiny and clear (includ. their bathrooms).
Very nice service once I got inside the restaurant. And nice service we got from the server.
Quite lots of choice from menu.
We ordered BENTO boxes and all food don't seem VEG., seems really like raw fish (me and friend of mine wondered how they can made it !?) Price is average.
Tempura not too oily at all. Ice cream is complimentary.
They also automatically 10% from the bill (even though I ready 10% coupon from one of Chinese free magazines)
Surely will go back again. Next time might try ALL U CAN EAT (even though choices not much from that specific menu).
They only accept CASH & VISA.
Strongly recommend to all Vegetarian to try !!!"}
{"text":"We had a buffet lunch there over the weekend. Very nice and cozy restaurant. Good selection of delicious vegetarian food. Reasonable price and convenient location. Will go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 4 times. The food is good, massive menu. Most items are vegan friendly. The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star review is that the service is just ok."}
{"text":"It really pains me to give a mediocre review as this was my third time trying the restaurant!  

We waited forever for service today, after being seated. We opted for the AYCE option. The server took our full order. 

The items started trickling to our table very slowly - sloppily thrown together rolls that were falling apart. We noticed that some of the more \"expensive\" items on the AYCE menu never arrived - seaweed salad, salmon rolls, taro tempura....but the cucumber and avocado rolls kept arriving. 

The server finally came back and asked us if we were done. We were still waiting for some those other items to arrive!  I think this was deliberate on their part. Food never arrived even though we asked for it three times. 

But the last bit is what really irks me. The menu we ordered from showed the price of AYCE as $16.99 for adults and $7.99 for kids. We were with our kids and decided it would be worthwhile to go for the AYCE options based on some quick math. 

Imagine my surprise when the bill came, and we were charged $12 for each of the kids!  Turns out that our menu had an outdated (lower) price on it. Instead of honouring the price because it was the restaurant's mistake, the server told us that we simply had to pay the additional amount. That's it, that's all. 

Graceful Vegetarian restaurant all the way when I'm in Markham. Done with Tenon."}
{"text":"Love the sushi and vegetable tempura. I got a mango roll and it was amazing, the amount of mango in it was perfect. Vegetable tempura is cooked to perfection, crispy batter. Definitely going back to get more."}
{"text":"went here yesterday with my friend at a really odd time (hadn't eaten yet that day). it was around 4pm... super late lunch, super early dinner. I was blown away!

I will say that everything was very fresh - but I don't know if that's the standard or because we were there at an odd time. When I go back (and I will be going back) at a regular dining time, It will be interesting to see if the quality is the same.

My friend and I were ravenously hungry and ordered way too much food (which we ate more of than I care to admit). The portions were almost 2x the size of what I normally expect from a sushi restaurant. My favourites of the dishes we ordered was a bean sprout and tofu \"chicken\" salad, and an eggplant tofu dish. The salad was big enough for 4-6 people easily, and its deliciousness was in it's simplicity: crisp bean sprouts with a delicious tangy dressing and cilantro. There was imitation chicken in there but I kind of didn't notice it was in there because it didn't really add anything. The eggplant tofu had such a good flavour, and eggplant can go really south really easily so I was impressed!

Even though I'm pretty proficient with chopsticks, the ones they have there are really nice but slippery - so if you're a white fool like me, ask for a fork & spoon.

The tea was genmaicha and not regular green tea - a pleasant surprise because I usually skip over the tea at sushi restaurants for that reason.

Service was excellent! Seating was comfortable, and those are the only two non-food aspects of eating out that matter to me. Even though we ate way too much, I didn't feel horribly gross and bloated afterward, which is a good sign regarding the quality of their ingredients.

I'm giving 4 stars because I've only been once - consistency is key. Great time overall!"}
{"text":"I went dinner with my family.  The food are great, tasty and enjoyed most of the dishes we ordered.  
We ordered the sushi combo.  Green dragon rolls. Spices salmon roll, Jing mushrooms avocado rolls.  One of the highlights of the dinner was when we tasted the spices salmon roll, we all thought it was real fish.. even my husband cannot taste the difference. 
My husband wasn't a big fan of vegetarians dishes, but he said he want to come back again."}
{"text":"Pleasant ambiance, rather large menu wiyh vegetarisn snd vegan options. Service is friendly. Prices very reasonable. Worth comming back."}
{"text":"We had some great vegetarian food here - couldn't believe how good the Spicy 'Salmon' Sushi was...incredible flavours...

Portion sizes are small and the menu is expensive so will probably come for the odd sushi fix but will not be a regular"}
{"text":"The only resto that sells vegan . Also had the \"chicken\" teriyaki. Pretty good, I'd definitely come back. You can also purchase frozen vegan items."}
{"text":"The mock sashimi for dinner are rather impressive due to their looks and taste to the real sashimi. Being a small vegan cuisine at the corner of New Kennedy Square (facing Kennedy rd), it is pretty unique in the Markham area. 

Points are deducted due to the slow service (especially if you are in the rooms) and the lack of options for AYCE. Overall a decent experience and will recommend for people to try."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian sushi hands down. The general tao chicken is the best and tastes like chicken! All the \"meat\" dishes taste real and you can also buy the ingredients from the store. The red bean ice cream is also delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for the vegetarian salmon-like nigiri. The salmon sushi is pretty cool however the rest of the food was ok. I ordered the box special with a variety of sushi and rolls for two people. It wasn't too filling in my opinion but some items are definitely worth checking out since I don't know any vegetarian sushi places that have imitated raw fish. 

Four stars for the unique factor."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5. I've tried both a la carte and ayce sushi. I would say a la carte is the better deal. Alternatively if you like the variety in ayce, it may be more economical to get a few bento box orders so you can get tempura and a variety of rolls and/or \"sashimi\". The price of the ayce is comparable to sushi places with real meat/fish, and I feel kind of ripped off paying that same price for fake meat/fish which cost less.

 Speaking of sashimi I was quite impressed by how close to the real thing this place got. The texture is like a firm jelly and they lay the sashimi on top of seaweed so some of the fishy taste latches on to the \"sashimi\". Their specialty rolls are also very good. In particular I recommend the super yam roll and the one with mango. Each roll is very sizable and are loaded with ingredients. 

They also offer some chinese/thai dishes. I recommend anything that is fried and slathered with their sweet and sour. This ranges from fake chicken to bean curd slithers and all are delicious. Batter is super crispy and sweet and sour sauce reaches the perfect balance between the two tastes.

Overall great place to go with a vegetarian friend who's tired of the typical vegetarian fare!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the \"duck\" noodles I  soup was pretty good...definitely come back to try their buffet sushi menu"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian dishes and can customize to your dietary needs.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to visit this restaurant because it came in fourth on People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA's) list of the \"Top 10 vegan sushi restaurants in North America\" (http://www.yorkregion.com/community-story/2511035-vegan-eatery-in-markham-gets-thumbs-up-from-peta/).

Neither of us are vegetarian, but we quite enjoyed the food and were impressed at the lengths to which the restaurant went to mimic the flavour, appearance and texture of meat. To me, \"vegetarian\" usually means something that's entirely vegetable based or something with chucks of tofu in it. Occasionally you'll get something like a veggie burger that tries to mimic its meat-based cousins, but it was a bit of a surprise to see this approach being taken across an entire menu!

We had the \"vegetarian duck\" and the \"vegetarian beef.\" The \"duck\" actually tasted quite a bit like the real thing! It also really looks like cooked duck. It's a bit surreal, but overall a solid dish. The \"beef\" didn't taste like anything that once had hooves, but the curry sauce they used was delicious and more than made up for this.

For an appetizer we had the won ton with peanut sauce. Again, the sauce was what really made this a winner. I would highly recommend this dish.

It was quiet on a weeknight, and the service was excellent. Unsurprisingly, the restaurant is unlicensed."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at Tenon.  We decided on the bento boxes rather than the AYCE.  I chose box C with sushi, sashimi, california roll, futomaki and edamame.  I was quite disappointed with the sushi and sashimi.  The sushi was just pieces of gluten on sushi rice and the salmon sashimi was mediocre. The futomaki and california rolls were very good.  

Mr Leny had box A with chicken teriyaki, veg tempura, california rolls, seaweed salad and rice.  The chicken teriyaki was very good but the tempura was quite greasy.

Service was friendly and quick.  I had such high hopes since Joe Yee closed.  They had the best bento lunch boxes.  I am still curious about Tenon's AYCE and will probably return to try it."}
{"text":"They have the best tempura and fake chicken I have ever had! It was so fresh and crispy! 

I actually go back there every month and purchase 3 pounds of frozen fake chicken. It's $9/pound. 

The sushi is good too, the sashimi on the other hand is not as good as I thought. 

I had an eggplant hot pot - nothing great

Teriyaki beef - weird taste

I will definitely go back but not to eat, just to buy frozen fake chicken."}
{"text":"The chef pretended he knew what gluten was. He did not. I have Celiac Disease so this went horribly. I asked him and the waitress 5 times about the ingredients. They verified it was only rice, avacodo and cucumber with salmon. The chef decided to add in tofu with soy sauce for some odd reason without disclosing it to me, despite my continual asking of verification. He did not know that wheat contains gluten when I mentioned the soy sauce. He was surprised. I even brought my OWN gluten free soy sauce from home to avoid this problem as a condiment. Wasted effort. Sigh."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for vegan sushi   I heard super great things about it and it only exceeded my high expectations ! The Bento Box was super yummy and my boyfriend ordered the sushi platter which we also loved ! 
Portions were very good and the workers there were very helpful and accommodating. 
Definitely coming back !"}
{"text":"Wow. This place was fantastic! I was quite impressed that this place pulled off vegetarian versions of all the favourites you'd find in a regular sushi restaurant. 

Fishless sashimi?? Looked just like the real deal and tasted like the real deal too. I wasn't sure how on earth it was going to be, but I was quite impressed with the results.

Started with a vegetable gyoza which was absolutely perfectly prepared. The sushi party platter came with a great variety of sashimi and sushi and was very tasty. There were a couple of items that I wasn't able to identify but didn't really care because it was delicious. 

So this is where they lost a star. Tempura. I didn't care for the batter they used. It was a little doughy and wasn't nearly crispy enough. I was a tad disappointed and really..it's all about the batter for me. 

The service was fast and friendly and I'm so happy to have found this place. It was worth the hour drive from where I live and I will be back."}
{"text":"The mock salmon sashimi is impressive - it looks and tastes similar to real salmon. The texture is similar but not spot on, the mock version is made from tapioca so it has a jelly-like feel to it. The vegetable tempura is crispy and sliced thin. 

I will only return for the salmon sashimi mock (I can't have real sashimi during my pregnancy). Otherwise, I did not enjoy with the rest of the food. The sushi rolls were made with too much rice and little filling. The chicken terryaki was fairly \"chicken like\" but I still didn't enjoy the dish."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to do with my life now that I've been here. The variety is immense and its the best sushi I have ever had as a meat-eater and as a now vegan of many years. It just can't be beat. The AYCE had so many delicious options and was a measly $20.  The mock fish made me nervous but the textures were beautiful and the flavour mild yet complementary to the veggies. How can I just go back to eating sub par cucumber rolls now?? 
This place is just so far away from me and all other veg sushi is ruined forever. How is this gem in Markham and not in Toronto?? This is making me want to finally learn how to drive. 
I'm distraught but so impressed. If you can, go here and try as many things as possible. Take your friends. TAKE ME. Demand the owner to open a downtown location. Aah!!"}
{"text":"Went to Tenon for birthday dinner Friday night because we were looking for a vegetarian/vegan place and heard from friends that this was the place to be.

Service was quick and friendly. The restaurant wasn't too busy, but we did make reservations just in case.

We had the a la carte menu instead of the ayce. We ordered a couple dishes like the special dragon rolls and mango rolls which were pretty good. Also had the agadashi tofu which was disappointing to say the least as it was dry and tasteless. We also ordered thai style noodle which was essentially udon noodles in sweet red colored sauce with basil.  Also ordered stone pot mixed vegetables with 'chicken' tasted pretty good, the 'chicken' which was gluten was ok but still doesn't really taste like chicken.

All in all the place was not bad. If anyone is looking for vegetation/vegan in Markham  then you should try it out."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian and vegan options! There is no meat served here, and only a few fish options, so my vegan girlfriend was very happy with the selection. As a meat lover, the menu was a bit challenging but this was expected.

We got the edamame, vegetable tempura, spicy salmon roll and gold roll. The edamame and vegetable tempura were pretty standard. Both were good.

The spicy salmon roll was not made with the small chunks of salmon and mixed with spicy mayo as other places. The roll contained a full thick strip of salmon, tempura bits, and then a small dollop of chili sauce on each piece. It was my favorite item, but also the only non vegan item.

The gold roll is filled with a fake crabmeat and topped with mango and sweet mango sauce. I won't comment on the filling of the roll as I strongly prefer really seafood. My girlfriend found the mango topping just right for the roll."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing here and I would boldly state that although this is the only vegetarian Japanese restaurant that I've been to but it's the best one.  

A few points on how I feel their service can definitely be improved on:

-1 or 2 staff on a prime Saturday with over 40 patrons.
-service can be very slow and takes awhile to get somebody's attention.
-been here on 3 separate occasions where they forgot to bring the bowl of rice that comes with the combo.
-would be helpful for them to announce what the dishes when they bring it to you instead of just leaving it on the table.

Now for the POSITIVES:

-the food is absolutely amazing.
-must try: Tenon sushi roll, king mushroom roll, smoked duck with spinach, green curry."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I'm not a vegetarian myself but I went with a friend who is and to give you an example of how delicious the food was, my friend nearly knocked me out thinking that I tricked her into eating real meat! But not to worry, everything is soy based with vegetables even if looks fool you. We ordered the chicken teriyaki and some sushi rolls. Heads up, even though the sign says sushi, they actually have a grill menu, Thai menu, and other Asian dishes as well as sushi. This place is a must try for both vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores! Yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very vegan friendly. PETA approved. Most of their dishes are vegan and only few items contain eggs. Mention that you are vegan and they are going to accommodate. Friendly service.

Fake salmon tastes like the real deal (to be fair all salmon is fake anyways). A la cart items can be a bit pricey. I suggest that you stick to bento boxes. Complimentary tea.

Overall great place for vegan sushi."}
{"text":"I was in the area the other day and remembered I always wanted to try this place as it offered vegetarian and vegan sushi besides the basic rolls offered at most places.  

I ordered their \"fish\" and sushi combo.  The fish was \"meh\" and wasn't spicy, but more sweet than anything else.  I wasn't a fan of it.  

In terms of the vegan sushi, OMG, it was delicious.  Almost everything tasted like real fish. I really enjoyed the mock salmom sashimi.  It had a very similar texture and an even better taste than real fish, but less slimy.  It was amazing.  

The mock shrimp was pretty good too.

Verdict: I'll be back for more soon.

Only con: I thought service was a bit lacking as I had to ask for my miso soup and the server seemed unhappy that I was asking. Maybe it's because I was by myself in gym clothes, but still, I ordered almost $30 worth of food.   Maybe I'll dress better next time????"}
{"text":"Not AYCE resto but quite impressed with the food! I'm not a vegan myself but decided to give it a go since my friend couldn't eat meat on Good Friday. Heck, the \"salmon\" and \"chicken\" tasted like the real thing! Scary! I would be returning and dine here on a regular basis. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Great place to take your vegan(and not so vegan) friends . The food is very flavourful and filling. Very clean place and pleasant staff. We have been here numerous times and will recommend it to anyone. I would recommend the buffet menu as it has a wide variety to choose from.
And if you want some frozen vegetarian meat substitutes to prepare at home there is a great selection."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I've been out to sushi before with friends and had limited options of food being a vegetarian but here I can literally order anything on the menu and it all tastes great! 

I came in a Saturday evening and it was so busy - had to wait a few minutes for a table but once we got seated and ordered - our food came within minutes and it was piping hot!

We started with the vegetarian tempura which was freshly fried and so delicious. 
Then we had combo A which is 8pc sashimi, 6pc sushi, 8pc rainbow roll and 8pc California roll. 

Everything was so delicious and looking around seeing other people's meals - their choices look awesome too!!

So happy with my meal but I'm sad that it's 1hr away from me :("}
{"text":"Fun fact - Apparently this place is one of the top 10 vegan sushi places rated by PETA! 

I really admire Tenon's creativity in conjuring up vegan dishes disguised as meat, but I wouldn't say it's something that I would crave often. 

I can see how a restaurant like this can be appealing to either vegetarians/vegans who miss the meaty taste and texture and to meat eaters who are wanting to go a healthier route, but this is not for me. It was really strange eating foods that resembled the taste and texture of sashimi, chicken, and DUCK after not having it in years! They use some magic and manage to create plant-based raw fish, isn't that insane?!! Albeit an interesting experience, it was just too weird for me. I would very much rather eat avo and cucumber maki instead of fake tuna sushi. 

They also managed to mimic the taste of scallops which really freaked me out! Vegans should definitely give the scallop skewers a try if you want to throw off your taste buds - the texture and taste resemblance to scallops was uncanny. 

Overall, an interesting experience with creative food, but a little too real for my tastebuds to handle. You should definitely come if you're looking to experience a unique meal."}
{"text":"VEGAN HEAVEN!! THIS IS IT! RIGHT HERE, IN MARKHAM!

I'm so happy I found this place and it's so great because it's fully vegan.
So much yums... I don't understand why this place is never packed, if this was situated downtown, it'd definitely do very well. (Name me at least 5 vegans in markham that you know. Exactly) 

I came here twice so far and I la-la-love it. What blows my mind is the 'salmon sashimi' and fake salmon.... omfg, it's ridiculous how close it tastes to the real thing, texture wise. It's everything salmon was to me except it doesn't have a fishy smell AND it's cruelty free - 100% approve! That smell that smells smelly. Even my omnivore friend was mind blown by how good it was.

Also, the fake chicken tripped me the helllll out. The texture was on point and I lowkey got scared. The sauce was tasty as well and gave me a flashback of my love for teriyaki chicken back then. Such a good replacement and tasted exactly the same.

Honestly it's kind of expensive, considering real fish isn't used but it's a great vegan friendly treat and it's nice to know we have one here in Markham aka meat-lovers land!"}
{"text":"Went here super hungry after a 2 hr massage and really excited to try their vegan sushi rolls!

My dad, bf and myself ordered 7 dishes  talk about ordering with our stomachs!

We had the udon, eel sushi, spider roll, pad thai, general Tao chicken, hot and sour soup, tempura!

Everything was on point, fresh, crispy and delicious! 

Favorites were spider roll and general Tao for sure! 

Friendly service with great presentation!

Will def come back :)"}
{"text":"Who knew Vegetarian sushi could be this surprisingly good!  Came here on a Saturday with JC because she was still on her vegetarian diet and it was surprisingly good!

We ordered the Agedashi Tofu, Sushi Combo A and a Green Dragon Roll to share.

The Tofu was the first dish that came and it tasted so good, tofu fried to perfection with a cucumber in the middle and topped off with a sauce that was very delicious (I wish I knew exactly what it was but it looks like soya sauce?)! 

Sushi Combo A was the next dish that came, it was a little smaller than expected but sharing with two people is still a good portion.  Out of all the items in the combo A, I was super impressed with the imitate salmon sashimii! How can someone make fake salmon so real where it tasted like salmon too!!

Green Dragon Roll was the last dish that came and it was delicious as well! The imitate crab tasted great and the avocado was very fresh.

I am really interested to know how they make such great imitate Japanese sushi and sashimi!  If you got friends that are vegetarian, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A delightful restaurant for those who are vegan or for those who just want to place less meat into their mouths. Their service is extremely satisfactory with a wonderful assortment of delicious dishes to choose from. Their location is within Peachtree Plaza / New Kennedy Square (facing Kennedy) so if possible, avoid the prime busy times to dine there, such as on Friday evenings or on the weekends when parking is extremely difficult to acquire."}
{"text":"Vegan life! Love the options to enjoy sushi. A little pricey but very much worth it. Love ambiance of the restaurant and staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Was a pretty good vegetarian take on meat inspired foods.  A lot of the menu (other than sushi) is deep fried."}
{"text":"Finally went to this restaurant after months of having it bookmarked on Yelp. They have an all vegetarian Japanese menu! We ordered the tom yum veggie seafood soup and sushi combo F (comes with 5 sashimi, 5 sushi, and 6 california rolls). The sashimi was so good, the highlight was definitely the mock salmon, which tasted exactly like real salmon. If we just got the combo, I would've given this place 5 stars, but the tom yum soup is where the restaurant fell short for me. The soup was incredibly sour, so we told our waitress. When she came back with the soup, it was pretty evident that all she did was add some hot water to it.

Service itself was kind of lacking for me, as well. The server was curt when we were asking questions about the menu. Additionally, she forgot to bring the miso soup to us; we had to explicitly ask! Overall though, food came out quick and efficiently.

Verdict: Would love to come back to try other menu items, and will definitely be getting the salmon again!"}
{"text":"First time eating vegetarian sushi and boy, was it a nice surprise! I ordered the sashimi platter, agedashi tofu, and mixed kebabs. Between myself and another person, we figured that we could fill up on a la carte rather than AYCE - either way, our bill will come up to be the same. We sat in one of the private rooms which was pretty cool but it was a bit of a struggle to get the attention of the waitress whenever we wanted something. I wish they had a call button like Korean restaurants tend to have. 

The tofu dish came first and was okay - I didn't enjoy it too much because it had the ginger flavor, but the teriyaki sauce was a great compliment. The kebabs is surely a must-try. I was so surprised to taste the \"meat\" and have all that awesome flavor! Warning though, the imitation meat contains a lot of oil which may cause upset stomachs to some (like myself). Everything that came in the platter tasted awesome - lots of variety of imitation seafoods/meats. The only thing I didn't like was the salmon - the texture was very jelly-like and tasted mild; nothing like salmon really.

The prices are not exactly cheap but if you want to try super tasty vegetarian food, this would be a good place to try for the first time!"}
{"text":"Came here for some vegetarian food one evening to give this place a try since someone I know is in love with Tenon.
The thought of vegan sushi just made me think....how? lol.
Located in the busy Peach Tree plaza just south of Hwy 7 and Kennedy Rd this is a busy plaza and parking can be a nuisance during weekends.   
Upon entering, the interior is clean and cozy with ample seating arrangements.  In terms of service, it was superb since we came on a quiet Tuesday evening. 
Their menu features a lot of options, especially for vegans which is a plus.
For food we ordered their Combo A: 8 sashimi pieces, 6 sushi rolls, 8 California, 8 rainbow roll.
In addition to our house SAKE! we also tried their A-13 Cashew nut chicken which was vegan as we requested.

An overall great experience; service, food, ambiance and selections!"}
{"text":"You honestly would never know this sushi is vegetarian.  Everything was a delight to the palette.  I think the fish is soy, but the flavors are all still the same and the texture hasn't changed at all.

Portion sizes are what you would expect, except for the seaweed salad, which was huge.  The portion size was about four times what you would find at any other restaurant.

Beyond the sushi I also had the dumpling soup.  If you like warm wet dumplings then this soup is for you!  I liked it because it eliminated the amount of time I would have otherwise been dipping dumplings into a sauce or broth.  

Fun fact, this restaurant is recognized by PETA.  So if you're into ethically treating animals and you're a person give this place a shot."}
{"text":"This is the best vegetarian/vegan sushi restaurant.   It's a small little place with great food and service."}
{"text":"We were looking for healthy options for dinner and thought we'd try out Tenon Vegetarian Cuisine. It is a vegan Japanese restaurant with foods that mimic meats, seafood etc. It's a good option for those who are vegan.
Service was good.

GREEN DRAGON ROLL (4/5)
(Avocado, imitation crab meat sushi roll)
We loved it! The avocado was fresh and the imitation crab meat was still warm (I think it was served tempura-style). Yummy :)

SALMON SUSHI (2.5/5)
It's fake salmon! It's actually very cool. The texture of the salmon is similar to konjac (konnyaku) or jelly but the taste is like.. salmon!! D: Why the 2.5 stars though? It's just too weird for me to try again hahaha

BENTO COMBO - CHICKEN TERIYAKI (2/5)
I didn't like this. The fake chicken meat tasted very mushy and the sauce wasn't good."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was a pleasant little joint. They had both a la carte and AYCE vegetarian sushi. We ordered a few amount of dishes, since not our whole party wanted AYCE. We tried the Orange Chicken, Sushi & Sashimi Platter, Deep Fried Scallops, Bean Curd Dish, Spider Maki Rolls, & Seaweed Salad. Overall the food was good. I especially like the chicken, the sauce they used went well with the dish."}
{"text":"Really kind of disappointed. 

Food is not prepare in a dilicate way, sushi even loosing. Eel is nothing like eel, just a piece of been curd. 

Service is not good, it's hard to get attention, we try to get a piece of paper to write down and get refused.

Price are too expensive, we went for a all you can eat dinner, it's 24 but not even have sashimi, sushi is only rolls. Many things in their menu are not included. Very limited choice.

Not suggest."}
{"text":"Soo good, if u are eating only vegetarian foods this place u must eat, everything so nice"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Tenon, cause it was the first vegetarian and vegan Japanese restaurant I've ever been to, and it's not super far (like in downtown). They offer both vegetarian and vegan options!! They used to offer all you can eat, but they stopped a little while ago! They still have a great dinner menu though- when I went for dinner after they stopped their AYCE, I ordered a vegan duck noodle soup, but the \"duck\" was actually just bean curd rolls - which was still very nice and I enjoyed it. It also came with a good substantial amount of noodles, soup, bean sprouts, and a side of lime! 

My friend had a tofu pad Thai and the portion size was pretty big, so she couldn't finish the whole thing. We could've probably shared that pad Thai and maybe had a small side dish as dinner to be honest! 

The seating areas are really nice, it's tidy and clean, there's a washroom that's kept clean, and both the chef and server are really nice!!"}
{"text":"Try not to go to this place during the vegetarian Chinese holidays (using around the time there's a full moon) as those are the days this restaurant is busy due to people who are vegetarian on these specific days. In other words, 30 minute wait for a table, 15 min to get the menu,  20 min to get their attention and then something happens where they forget and then attend to something else. 

The food here is not bad, especially if you're a vegetarian. If you have lots of vegetarian friends, expect to see somebody you may know there. Bento boxes were decent but the portions were pretty big imo. Couldn't even finish my portion considering how hungry I was with all the wait time. I would have to come again on a non-busy time. Until then."}
{"text":"This is a Just an ok sushi vegetarian restaurant. They have lunch sushi buffet for $13.99 but there are very few choices.Nothing extra ordinary, food is on the bland side."}
{"text":"UPDATE (December 2016):
Note that the AYCE options are no longer offered. Unfortunate, because that's what made this place unique.

---------------------------------------------------------

One of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in the city and I visit whenever I get a chance!

They have many options here, not just sushi/Japanese, although that's where the place really shines in my opinion. I don't come here for the cooked stir-fry stuff, there are plenty a dozen of other Chinese vegetarian places whipping up that stuff in the city. Bento boxes can be had for $11-13 with a variety of combinations, accompanied by a miso soup. But what I really love, especially with good company, is the all-you-can-eat option. There's no other Japanese vegetarian place in the GTA that I know of that does this!

It's great to get a break from just being able to order generic avocado rolls, cucumber rolls, yam tempura, etc. like you would at regular AYCE Japanese restaurants. The rolls are much more varied here. They are well made by any standard -- the filling to rice ratio is excellent, the food is well presented, ingredients are fresh, and it is delicious. My only gripe is that it can be quite slow at times (depending on which guy is working behind the counter making the sushi). 

The dinner AYCE option adds a few more specialized rolls and items, like the green dragon and caterpillar rolls. Worth the price difference? Not really in my opinion. Regular Japanese places charge more for dinner only because you can order special items like sashimi at dinner time. Here, there is no sufficient justification for the higher charge. When they first introduced the AYCE option, the dinner and lunch menus were completely identical! Now they've improved the dinner items a bit -- it's good to see that these guys are constantly improving! Note that dinner does not include any mock sashimi. Personally, I don't care much for it because I'm not really a fan of it -- it's impressive how much it resembles actual sashimi, but I don't particularly enjoy it.

Service has always been courteous and friendly (and the servers speak decent English as far as Asian restaurants are concerned)."}
{"text":"Im a regular here and the food is exquisite everytime I come here. I always want to order much more but can't! This place never dissapoints and the chef knows whats up"}
{"text":"The sushi chef who works there, is extremely generous and friendly. 

My boyfriend and I were seated at the bar area, on a Saturday night, because all of the tables were taken. The sushi chef was polite, he asked us about our day, and made the occasional small talk, when we made eye contact. We order from the AYCE menu, however, the chef hooked us up with fancy sushi that were on the regular menu.

On a side note, I was recommended to this restaurant, for them having the best vegan sushi in Toronto. When I was there, I've noticed that the restaurant had the word \"vegan\", plastered on placemats, posters... Etc. (Which I thought was quite deceiving, because this isn't a vegan restaurant). They use actual dairy dressings, for their salads, the wontons there contain eggs, and the spicy mayo topping (for sushi) isn't vegan as well. The ice creams are regular dairy ice creams.

Vegans need to notify the server before ordering."}
{"text":"To start off, I am not a vegetarian, we came here for friend's birthday who is. The restaurant was quiet on a Friday night.

They offer all-you-can-eat vegetarian sushi, which has an impressive amount of options that you would see at a reuglar all-you-can-eat..they have vegetarian general taro chicken, salmon, rolls, sushi, etc! 

It was definitely an experience, some of the fish looked quite convincing, but I am not sure I liked the imitation fish, as it could be described as a moist sponge with a fishy taste...I did very much enjoy the rolls with bean curd on top though.

The service was great as the staff was friendly, we were able to bring in our own cake."}
{"text":"Well, this was our first foray into the veg sushi world and we weren't disappointed. Veg shrimp, veg chicken, veg beef, and - get this - veg oyster! I had no idea some of these things existed. 

Dynamite roll (veg shimp) and the combo of 3 veg rolls came out very fast and tasted pretty good.  The bill was very moderate. 

Leaving here happy as a veg clam."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi- the food and the art!
It will leave you stunned! The way imitation fish and meat have been rolled into sushi. 
The service is great. The portions are pretty decent, a huge variety of food and everything is excellent."}
{"text":"Im no vegetarian and no vegan but my buddy is so i go here to eat with him, and this place doesnt disappoint! The place is small and its sometimes busy mostly not, but the food is good no complains for service its ur typical asian joint"}
{"text":"No one in our group tonight is vegan or vegetarian. I'm currently pregnant and was desperate for sashimi, so we checked this place out. Service, ambiance and food were all fine - nothing to complain about. However, contrary to many others' experiences here, I didn't think the \"salmon\" tasted, looked or felt like the real thing. The food definitely was creative and made a concerted effort to mimic real fish, but wasn't entirely successful. I'm also weary what ingredients were used to make the mock fish. 

The tofu chicken and duck were decently good. But, this is probably due to seasoning and teriyaki sauce. 

Overall, I think this place does a good job at serving a specific type of clientele, but it wasn't for us. I will wait out my pregnancy and gorge on real sashimi later :)"}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars. 

They have a lunch all you can eat optin for $13. The bento boxes are like $10-11 so add a few more dollars and you can all you can eat. Although it is veggetarian food so its a lot of carbs but they don't downgrade the quality if you do the all you can eat vs a la carte.

pssst, They also have black seseme ice cream, only if you ask :)

Usually pretty quiet and they have little rooms so good or groups."}
{"text":"I was excited for all the great reviews on yelp. But when I made the journey to Tenon for Mother's Day, I was underwhelmed to say the least. Maybe I just didn't order the right items, but it was VERY pricey. And the food was just average. The positive is that I didn't miss the meat too much. The downside is that I just had higher expectations on taste and service. Service was extremely slow. Had to request the same items multiple times before they actually brought it. Interesting vegetarian dining experience, but likely would not return."}
{"text":"To start off, I don't believe this place has the right kitchen talent to \"bring it\" so to speak.  Compared to Graceful, which shut down due to their lease expiring, Tenon is not anywhere close.  A good sushi place \"always\" make their own wasabi and ginger, never depending on some wholesale junk.  As for the imitation meat, there was nothing real or authentic to it.  I give 3 Star only to be fair since there is only 1 vegan sushi available right now to compare to in the Toronto area.  I hope things can improve someday so I can upgrade my ratings, this idea was successfully tried in Hong Kong back in the 90's..."}
{"text":"The location is easy to find, good atmosphere and decorations. Server was super nice and the food taste great! I can barely tell the difference between the veggie version and the regular ones. Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Who says vegans can't have sashimi! Best vegetarian/vegan sushi place! I can have their spicy salmon rolls everyday!"}
{"text":"Tenon Vegetarian Cuisine is not a bad choice if you dine with your vegetarian friends... 

There are a great selections of Japanese, Chinese and Thai items on the menu to choose from, hopeful you will find something that everyone will enjoy.
 
But if you are dining alone or you just not into sharing, at least they have Bento boxes you can choose from.

My Bento Box B ($11.99) comes with:
- Miso Soup: serves lurk warm.. meh
- Seaweed Salad: quite standard supermarket quality
- Vegetables Tempura: batter is light, maybe too light and they are all super oily
- California Roll: quite good, taste wise compatible to the non vegetarian version
- Beef Teriyaki: great presentation.. they do looks like beef.. :) 

For $11.99 as a non vegetarian, I could have get the \"real\" beef teriyaki and it probably taste better? But Tenon is a great place to dine with fellow vegetarians... 

15% Specials so at least I am not paying full price. Lunch Specials till 3 pm but no extra discount...

What?!! My friend just turns Vegan!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good choice of restaurant when dining with vegetarian friends and families. 

We had teriyaki chicken (mock) bento and beef (mock) bento. The bento boxes came with miso soup,  rice, stir fried veggies, edamame or seaweed salad, veggie tempuras, a few pieces of California rolls; and a small scoop of ice cream at the end. The bento box is $11.99 which is not a bad deal. The \"chicken\" was better than beef IMO.
We had veggie gyoza for appetizer (which came out after the bento boxes), big portion for $4.99; it was freshly made and the filling is cabbage.

Overall, good choice for vegetarian food, not greasy like other chinese vegetarian restaurants. I would come back when craving a vegetarian meal or dining with my veg friends."}
{"text":"Ok vegan sushi?! How can I say anything bad?! I can't! Everything on the menu can be customized to be vegan (this is a vegetarian restaurant). Even my mom was amazed that what she was eating wasn't actually real shrimp! The service here is good and the restaurant is fairly large. I would honestly recommend any item off the menu. I come here for lunch and dinner and have never ever been disappointed! It's so nice to see a vegan restaurant so close to work and home!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars

A group of 7 of us met up in Unionville Main St on Boxing Day and realized that most of the restaurants weren't open for lunch that day. Solution? Head to Hwy 7 and Kennedy down the street, where Asian restaurants are open 365 days a year. There was bound to be food! 

We got to the plaza and one guy remembered eating at a sushi place. It was still there, but it appeared to have changes name to Tenon. Oh well, in we went for sushi. Unfortunately, we ALL missed the part about it being vegetarian cuisine @_@ 
Looking through the menu, I silently grumble that they have a poor selection of fish and note that they appear to only have salmon, tuna, and eel. I chalk it up to just being a low quality sushi resto.

We ordered a huge sushi platter to share, an eel/avocado roll and some beef soup of some sort. The eel/avo roll came out first. It had cucumber and the tofu skin they use for inarizushi, no avo or eel in sight. We called the waitress over \"uhm, sorry we ordered the avo/eel roll.. I think this is the wrong one...\" No problem she takes it back to the counter. Then the platter comes out. Looks pretty enough, but there was something just weird about it .. square slices of fish, funny looking white thing lots of arms... then our eel/avo plate comes back and it now has avo but still has fried tuna skin slices. The waitress probably noticed all of our perplexed looks because she then states \"This is a vegetarian restaurant. This IS our eel roll.\"  Boy were we fooled!

It's hard to judge the food because I've never wished to try vegetarian sushi given the choice of real fish versus some hard jelly that's made to look and feel like salmon. To be honest, I didn't like it very much. I suppose if I was a vegetarian, I might think otherwise. The presentation was nice and funny enough, after slathering soy sauce and wasabi on the sushi, some people at the table remarked that the texture could have fooled them. 

Final thought : It was expensive."}
