{"text":"Friendly environment, great service, and food was fantastic, really. You must try one of their micheladas surely will be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, I am picky. We were looking for a good Mariscos restaurant. I saw the other yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. The food was excellent, fresh full of flavor, just delicious! The other review is accurate, the food is priced a little higher than other Mariscos restaurants but the quality and taste was worth it. We will be back."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good mariscos spot on the west side of the valley, so when the 'Grand Opening' sign went up, I knew it would be a matter of time before I would be there.  I've been there twice in the past week, ordering something different each time, and twice have been pleased with very delicious meals, as well as the people I've been with.  

The service was friendly, and given the meals ordered, there was a slight wait, but along with awesome food, there is also the presentation of the food, which adds to the flair of the meal.  While waiting, you do get a bowl of warm chips and freshly made salsa to chomp on and there is an assortment of hot sauces on the table to test as well.  The owners would mingle and talk to the customers instead of just watching people spend their money there. The prices were a little slightly higher than the average mariscos place, but the food is just a little better than your average place.

The menu proves this isn't just a Mexican restaurant with fish and shrimp added to fit the name, the menu is real deal mariscos! The decoration and design of the place is very fitting with the mariscos theme and really adds to the comfort level, there was some actual thought and effort put into it.  There is also a small bar with a wide variety of assorted liquors to mix up type of flavorful concoction, from a michelada to a margarita, to a bucket of coronas and almost anything in between as well. 

It's an overall very good restaurant and to me a very high 4 stars! Will most definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Walk in and there was only two tables occupied we seated our selfs with out being greeted whatever not a big deal. Ok then i hate when the server knows we are new and doesn't give us the chance to check out the menu and wants us to order like right away . Like naw we just got here come back  
Then after our food was serve we were totally forgotten after no refill did not offer if i need another beer anything there was another waiter that saw us being hang and stepped up and and started to pick up our waitress slack ok maybe it was the waiter not the place right ? But the owner was there not paying attention to the his waiters and walking around enjoying the mariachi play and dancing with the cooks . Not coming back the service was lame . Food was alright not the best 
They got all kinds of good reviews because there is a sign saying if you leave a good yelp they hook you up with a tostada plate . I saw that and i was like no wonder I ended up here ."}
{"text":"I personally love this little restaurant. They have great food. This is the only restaurant where I will order Culichi Shrimp, it's simply amazing. I have not had a single bad experience food wise. The owner is a bit awkward, he is always there and seems to be in a bad mood. The waitresses are super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"By far the worst mariscos ever. I ordered shrimp empanadas, an agua chile and horchata to go paying almost $60. The empanadas were burnt and i the agua chile had maybe 7 shrimp. Way over priced. Disappointed with the empanadas because theyre hard to find."}
{"text":"Terrible food...terrible music....I will never comeback to this place the Stake is cheap and the food too expensive  ....very disappointed no lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"Worth a try. I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied.  Clean, good service, tasty and good portions. Looking forward to my next visit and getting more adventurous."}
{"text":"Muy sabroso todo, el consume de casa esta de.. cache. Definitivamente regreso! Los aguaschiles"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! The prices are really high and the food is not all that good at all. If you are looking for a good mexican mariscos restaurant beware...DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place and gave it several chances. The food is good, however the management is terrible. They play incredibly loud music which makes it difficult to sit and talk with anyone or enjoy your food. The last 2 times they messed up our order. The very last time I called in ahead for a to go order and they didn't start cooking it until after I arrived. My experience with this place has been very disappointing."}
{"text":"First time here,  had really high hopes as it's semi local for me.  Ordered the shrimp enchiladas, rice was average....beans were warm at best, the cheese sprinkled on top didn't even sort of melt.  The enchiladas were more like deep fried shrimp rolled tacos. They were hard and crunchy even slathered in sauce,  definitely not the type of enchiladas I'm used to.  Overall the service was decent no complaints however  food was meh...nothing spectacular but not the worst.  MIGHT give this place another chance, maybe...."}
{"text":"Good micheladas good food ( except ceviche de pescado) ... good horchata clean place, small place, a bit pricey .. Service was great ... Over all was good."}
{"text":"Way to pricey, charged me 3.50 for a cup of horchata and 2 dollars for an avocado that should come with a 20 dollar cocktail.  Definitely not going back. Plenty of other mariscos in the area"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. The Shrimp Ceviche was very good. It's not in the greatest neighborhood and my server didn't speak English, but that's what makes it so good."}
{"text":"It pleases me to be the first reviewer for this recently opened restaurant, especially as the restaurant is worthy of your business.

Like some other Mexican restaurants we went to in \"dicey\" neighborhoods, we were the only white people to eat here and that's hardly surprising as most of the white people I've met will either only go to upscale Mexican restaurants or, more often, chain restaurants which hardly represent the best of Mexican food.  As the name of this restaurant suggests, seafood is their specialty here, but the menu is by no means limited to that.  Being new, the place has a fresh, clean and bright air about it:  the restaurant IS small, but the tables, floors and large amount of woodwork inside give it a welcoming and appealing air.  People seem to be very happy to be here.

As for the food, as far as I'm concerned, the star of this place is the ceviche:  for $3.50, they serve you a tostada so weighed down with seafood, that lifting it to your mouth can only be compared to trying to do pushups with weights placed on your back.  Thankfully, the tostada is really crisp, because you otherwise wouldn't be able to lift it  ... that's how much seafood is on it!

As for the rest of the food, while I saw people getting big portions of shrimp cocktail and the like, the fish dishes we had were OK as far as quantity was concerned.  Tasty, as well; but we've reviewed two other Mexican seafood restaurants to date, which you can find under our profile, and which beat this place hands down (with the exception of the ceviche).

Service is quick; but interestingly, all the servers are women and all ... mmm ... well-endowed.  Whether this is a coincidence, I don't know; but it does give the feeling that you're dining at Hooters (my partner's view ... to me, it reminded me of some of the 'hotels' I ran into in eastern Poland, where the servers in their restaurants were \"available\" after hours for fun).

Overall, if you live in the area, this is a very acceptable alternative to the myriad of restaurants in the West Valley, which claim to represent real Mexican food, but, interestingly, don't have fish dishes on their menu with the possible exception of a fish taco.  Don't hesitate to try this place:  it's not expensive, the portions are reasonable and, like I said, if you like ceviche, you can't do better than here.  Let's hope, with time, the realities and expenses of running a restaurant don't affect the serving size."}
{"text":"Never again bad costumer service and not so good food. And so expensive!  I rather make it myself or wait till i go to cali"}
{"text":"Servicio horrible.  La comida me cayo mal.  Y aparte te cobran la propina doble,  llevaba a mi hijo de 3 a√±os y contal de salir rapido de ahi despues de esperar y esperar que te tragieran la cuenta y agarre mi cuenta deje propina aparte del total que decia y me doy cuenta  dias despues que ya habian agredado la propina.  Este es un fraude por que le correspondia decir ala mesera estas dejando propina doble.  Yo page por 4 personas y como nos sentamos con otra familia nos cobraron por un party de mas de  5 personas.  


La mesera se tardo demasiado en atendernos no te dan el servicio adecado para gastar y perder tu dinero en un lugar que te cobra doble



Service was horrible . Over charged,  and they added the tip to my bill which I did tip.  So be careful .  Eating there is not worth the money you are paying,"}
{"text":"So the night started out great, we arrived and my reservation for 8 was spot on and ready for us. The food quality and taste is up in the 4 stars, very clean and tasty food. The service was very rushed as closing time approached and I had contacted the owner to verify if the UFC fight would be shown for which he answered yes, unfortunately no UFC fight and very poor in taste for music and trust me I am Mexican. I would return to eat for an early dinner or even lunch but not to spend 2-300 again.

Note for the owner: Invest in a juke box(rocola)!!!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience so I'm telling everyone I can. I ate there with my wife. We both ran out of soda refills twice. My cocktail crackers were not replenished,not because they refused to but because the waitress never came back to the table to check on us. I had to get up and walk over to the counter to have my chips filled. I thought that would let them know I wasn't happy but it didn't work. They didn't come by my table or the other two tables that were occupied by patrons. The food presentation was excellent but the flavor was mediocre at best. I get a request from them for me to post my review on their website. When I post my experience I receive a response telling me they know what kind of person I am. I couldn't believe it, I spent good money there.... More than other restaurants that have better service and now they are telling me they have formed an opinion on what I am like because I rated them a 1 star. They have probably removed it from their website if they have any sense but they can't remove this one. Don't waste your time, the food looks amazing but has no flavor. There is no value in the overall experience. Don't let the website pictures fool you, there's not enough clientele in my opinion to keep the food from sitting too long. I believe that's why there's no flavor. You have been informed. Don't say I didn't tell you."}
{"text":"The service was great, clean and good good 
I didn't get impress with my Campechana but was good anyway.
I think having great service every day as the same o got today, you not need to buy comments in Yelp
I mentioned this for the sign I red in the wall"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying any business that has 99cent coronas instantly gets my vote. I had a chicken burrito, it was delicious. Our waitress was super friendly. The place was pretty empty, but they also just opened a few weeks ago. The food was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try some of the seafood next time I'm craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. A delicious soup, salsa and chips came out right away. I had two shrimp tacos for a light lunch and they were so yummy I wished I would've ordered three. My husband had a steak burrito which was equally as good. Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"One of the best seafood  places in Avondale. This place is always clean and service has always been great. There's always people, so you can tell it is liked by many. 
The shrimp cocktail is my favorite. And I looove the shrimp stew they serve you before your meal."}
{"text":"We are from LA and been looking for a good Mariscos spot. I found this on Yelp so we came down and it is the bomb! Micheladas are bomb and all the food was excellent!!! I will definitely come here again. They also have Mariachis"}
{"text":"Way overpriced! I ordered a tostada de ceviche and the shrimp had no flavor it tasted old and a coctel de camarones size medium which was tiny and also tasted so gross. We had stomach aches after eating here . Ended up paying $32.00 just for that and for the grossest mariscos"}
{"text":"As someone who's not A Spanish speaker, I was a bit intimidated by the menu but everything has translations and the wait staff is extremely kind and accommodating. My boyfriend had the shrimp ceviche & was extremely impressed. I had the oysters plain but I wish I would have upgraded to their deluxe version. HOWEVER, the carne asada Taco put everything else in this area to shame! I also went on a Sunday evening and they had a live mariachi band. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  I had some excellent Carne Adams Fajitas and my wife had. Chipotle Fish Fillet that was even better.  I will remember this place for my next Phoenix trip."}
{"text":"Way over priced and the food was just okay. I sat and watched my food in the window just getting cold as they were finishing my boyfriends food. I was hoping it wasn't my plate, but sure enough it was. After his plate was done, it sat up there for a couple minutes as well while the cook & waitress sat there talking. So he got cold food is too! We won't be returning and paying that much for the cold food they serve here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Never fails. Best shrimp cocktails. And it's very quiet the other marisco places,"}
{"text":"The food was great. A true Mexican seafood place. Our server Cristiana was prompt, attentive and very helpful. We started with guacamole which was clearly just made. The shrimp in it was a first for me. We also had bacon wrapped peppers stuffed with cream cheese and shrimp. They're very big so make sure you're hungry. And for my main course I had shrimp enchiladas which were more than satisfying."}
{"text":"Food was authentic as well as the atmosphere. intense flavors and the Margarita was one of the best ive had. it was clean and the server only spoke spanish which was cool."}
{"text":"Came here with mom for some dinner after some errands. Mom had a feel for mariscos so we decided to try this place. We arrived about 30 minutes before closing and sat down. We were then told by the waitress that the kitchen is closed for hot dishes but they do have cold dishes since it was near closing time. Although, she wasn't nice about it at all. Ok, we were understanding of that since we knew they needed to clean the floor and do anything else before closing. So we ordered two cocteles de camar√≥n. Pretty easy and simple. As we were finishing up she came by with the check and placed it on our table. I was near to finishing at about 10 after 9 and not nearly 3 minutes go by until she comes by to tell us we need to hurry and pay in such a rude way. I'm big on customer service and that completely changed my mind about the place. I mean the coctel de camar√≥n was good but the service from the waitress was awful due to her rudeness, which makes me not want to return. I know maybe she was tired and wanted to finish her shift but there was still a family of 4 next to us who arrived much later than us and she could have been said it in a much better form. My mom asked her a question in a polite way as I was paying and when the waitress was going to answer she seemed bothered to answer the question. Really?! Bottom line, food was good but service was bad. I mean I've never been to a place where they hurry up their customers to pay. Who does that?! And if that's the case, maybe they should consider changing their closing hour in order to give them enough time to do what they need to do before their actual closing time. Including having their customers pay their bill."}
{"text":"The food is really good here. I love the way they prepare the dishes. I ordered the peppers stuffed with shrimp and it is delicious."}
{"text":"Came to eat on 12-31-2016 and while eating the owner gave us a FREE bottle of champagne to celebrate the new year!!! But the food was really good too, super good mariscos spot!"}
{"text":"Let's begin with. Place was hot!!! The AC was either not working or owner was trying to save some money.  Portions are small and prices are big. Food quality was ok.  Would I recommend this place? Not likely and most likely I will not be back either."}
{"text":"Extremely big menu. Live mariachi on Sunday. Big portion on the tostada de ceviche. Coctel de Camaron was authentic. And they have plenty of options for kids! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came during lunch. 
Good waitress.
Place is really clean. 
Negra Modelo Bottle. 3.50
tostada Ceveiche de camaron is tasty. around 8bucks
Aguachiles is weak I was expecting chile not agua."}
{"text":"Family owned with great service. The food is very good. They have live mariachi every Sunday."}
{"text":"Wanted ceviche, was craving it all day, ordered a fish ceviche order, right before that a Modelo Especial beer and my lady a sweet drink(designated driver) after 10 minutes girl comes over says they ran out of fish ceviche, only reason I was there for......
I guess I understand since it's lent and all 

I was being charged for drinks since I did ordered them
I immediately went to pay my beer and sweet drink we ordered but owner type person asked if it was all ok
Which obviously it wasn't, he waived charge for my drink (should've drink it) i didn't 

Never the less, although I was treated fair
I didn't get what I was there for 



Owners suggestion 

Don't run out of ceviche on lent 


Not sure if we'll come back, if I do We'll see 


I ended eating monster tacos  from jack in the box"}
{"text":"Great place for Mariscos! Stopped here while visiting with family. Restaurant was clean, food was excellent and our service was fast & friendly! Would definitely recommend people try this place!"}
{"text":"We were with a business group and one of the colleagues from Puerto Rico said this was the most authentic he had in a long time.  The rest of us just enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"I gave them 3 stars because they forgot my ceviche that I paid $$$ for. When I called they told me to come back. That's not possible as I live too Far East. This place has great seafood and food, just priced way to expensive and when you forget to put the main purchase in my order it was just a disappointment. I'm changing my score to a 4 star because Guillermo reached out to me and offered to correct my order. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service ! Waitress did not tend to us! She only took our order and never returned to see if needed anything else ! The food was burned and very bland! DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! Will come back ever!:("}
{"text":"The little one (8 yrs old) and I came here for some seafood (well, she wanted Mexican pizza but I talked her into shrimp cocktail as I wanted to check this place out). We walked in and the Mariachi band was playing kinda blocking the door. My first thought was, \"this is cool and appears to be authentic\". My second thought was, \"I hope they move before we open the door so all eyes aren't on us!\". Thank goodness they moved in time (I'm a little shy w/ age ). 

We were greeted with a smile and menus. We pointed to the table (booth) we wanted and sat down. Chips, salsa, limes and a cup of liquid came to the table. I tasted it and it tasted like Old Bay seasoning so I figured it was some kind of juice for the seafood and set it to the side. The server didn't understand English and my Spanish wasn't working well (maybe because it's 116 degrees outside or because the music was too loud) so she got a nice gentleman who may have been the owner to come to our table. He was great with recommending dishes (& a drink). And he told me the cup of liquid was shrimp soup which we can squeeze the \"limon\" in and it's very good. Duh! That's soup! Not only is my Spanish not working but my brain isn't either (did I mention it's 116 degrees outside). Anyway, I settled on the mango margarita (not on the menu), seafood stuffed steamed fish (no cream or cheese), and a side of guacamole. My little one had a medium shrimp cocktail. Drink was tasty (although I didn't taste the alcohol) and food was fresh, lightly seasoned but flavorful. Side note: as I type this I am feeling a little sweaty and realize it's a little hot in here (A/C not very strong). Anyway, back to the food. My little one loved the soup after she squeezed a lot of limes in it and then she enjoyed using the big spoon to find the shrimp in her shrimp cocktail! 

Throughout the entire visit the service was great with the servers and the manager/owner coming frequently to check on us. When I told the manager/owner that I didn't taste the alcohol in the drink, he gave me a glass of champagne (nice!). The band was gracious too; they asked if we had any request to which I couldn't think of any songs. I'm  a Celia Cruz fan which is not mariachi music. But I enjoyed everything that they played and loved when they gave the mic to a few of the patrons who had amazing voices. It was like mariachi karaoke! 

Overall, 4 stars and we will be back. If this review was in the fall/winter then it may have been 5 stars. Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but not great.  The carne asada tacos had a mild taste of taco seasoning,  which is not my thing. The fish and shrimp tacos are topped with grilled onions and red and green peppers like a fajita instead of cabbage and cilantro.
If you are here because of the entertainment.com coupon, they do NOT honor it. They claim to not have signed up for it."}
{"text":"We came after searching for good Mariscos. We went to a few places in the Maryvale area, but since it's Friday they all had loud Banda groups playing. We came here as our last resort before going to buy pizza and go home. We were pleasantly surprised. There was no loud music, the staff was friendly, and we were able to enjoy our date night."}
{"text":"The food is great but a bit pricey. You do get what you pay for food wise, with good sized portions & ice cold drinks. The only knock is the service is slow, even when the place is empty."}
{"text":"After reading reviews of how good the food was I decided to try it. I was very disappointed, I ordered a large cocktail shrimp to go it came in a 32oz styrofoam cup halfway full for almost $20. I thought well for that price it must be delicious,but it wasn't. I didn't like it at all that I tossed it away. This place is so crowded with tables and chairs that I  needed to find a way out to the exit door. The music was so loud that I couldn't hear what my friend was saying to me. I needed to use the restroom, but I saw how narrow the hallway was with more chairs and tables that I knew I would be bumping against them, so I decided to wait till I got home instead. If you're someone like me that don't like to be in small crowded places then don't go there. I didn't like the good anyways so I know I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Michelada was good  and the shrimp were delicious. . The rice was good . It came with flour or corn tortillas. Never had shrimp culichi. But it's a must to try."}
{"text":"Food was good but service TERRIBLE. They speak no English What so ever. Can't answer a simple question. Very slow service there was only 3 other parties there in it took us 2 hrs"}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktels (Mexican cocktails) were good, filled with shrimp, veggies, and either Cooked shrimp water or ketchup or both. We also had ceviche tostadas and they are good also. Everything we tried was good. The only thing about this place is it's a bit pricey. But there aren't many Mexican seafood places in the area so I guess they can have higher prices."}
{"text":"A Mexican Seafood shop in Arizona!?!  Try this place out!

The minestrone-like soup that comes as a free app (Me: \"what's the name of the soup?\" Her: \"soup.\") is really really good!  I completed it and she gave another small bowl. Bonus!

Had the octopus veracruz. And it was excellent, incredibly tender (octopus is so often like pencil eraser) and flavorful.  Would get many times again.

Only OK stuff: had the oysters.  They were good, but nothing to write home about.  The sides that came with, rice and beans, we're pretty pedestrian.

Ambiance: little greasy spoon with an authentic flair. Quite nice. But probably not a place to impress your date with (unless they're a foodie...).  Mexican music videos playing (somewhat) loudly... Some nights they do have a Mariachi player...."}
{"text":"My son and I found this place the last day here of his visit. We should have found it on the first day, if we had, we would have been back many times. Great food, great prices. Their specialty is seafood, but I am not a big fan of seafood. The did, however, have a chicken burrito and damn it was great !!! My son had fish tacos and he said they were very good. Our server was friendly and helpful, even gave us some coupons to use on the next visit. A great little place with great food. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good ceviche tostadas, soda fountain has good ratio for soda to taste sweet! Got the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise

I live in the area but have never been to Mariscos Camaron Pela'o that is until today, and all I have to say is, it was was definitely a good stop.

The restaurant is pleasantly decorated, a cross between a Mexican beach bar and a sports bar with large screen TVs.  

On this visit my lunch companion and I each ordered a grilled tilapia platter, one regular and one Veracruz. Our entrees were nicely grilled, light and fresh. The frijoles are made on site, and each entree is served with a small salad. The portions are generous and the prices of wallet-friendly.

If you're in the area you should stop by, you won't  be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sitting in restaurant now.  Girls (Employees) too busy talking and visiting and on cell phones.  They don't understand English or my Spanish so I'm confused????  I asked for a sample of their hottest sauce for our chips.  What they brought was left over Diablo sauce that was disgusting as it was very fishy and smelled fishy.  We just asked for the check and we are leaving.  Very sad"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and I would say that overall I was really impressed. They brought us chips that were delicious.  They were thin and we actually preferred to use them rather than the crackers or tostadas that came with our food. They also brought us a cup of their soup which was good but a bit too warm for this weather (it was still good, maybe as the weather cools I will order some of their caldos). I ordered the campechana while my wife ordered the pescado ceviche and even though we ordered the medium size it was a very healthy portion of food. Many places skimp on the seafood but this place gives more than enough to fill you up.  I actually wanted a bit more veggies because it was packed with shrimp, etc .  Service was great but at first we were one of only two tables but the place was quickly filling up.  My only complaint would be how warm the place was because they had a few fans on the counter to help cool the place down (my reason for four stars). Maybe something was up with the air conditioner but with seafood you really want to be in a cool place.  Looks like they listen to their reviews because the music was low and you can easily hear yourself or your partner. Place was clean and they were attentive. Will return again to try some of their other dishes. Hope they keep the quality and cleanliness and I will be a returning customer. I thought prices were fair but I eat a lot at Scottsdale restaurants so it could be an unfair comparison in prices"}
{"text":"The seafood cocktails are plentiful, and tasty. The micheladas are ridiculously on point. The garlic shrimp is consistently delish. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The seafood platter was a good deal and a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Now I see why this place is always packed. The food and service were both really great and we will definitely be back. I had the Governor's shrimp tacos and highly recommend them.

To the people who say it's pricy, you need to get out more. If you're looking for Taco Bell prices, go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This place is way over priced for the average seafood they try to serve in addition to the poor service. Then when I tried to use a certificate from Restaurant.com they wouldn't honor it and I ended up paying full price. I wouldn't ever have gone there if I hadn't seen it on Restaurant.com. I will never go here again and I will tell everyone I know not to go here either."}
{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre food. Very bland taste, every dish we ordered could use some seasoning. There was nothing worth a $110 check. Shrimp empanadas are just not good. We will happily stay with Mariscos Hermosa! Sorry we took a chance elsewhere. Should have waited for more reviews"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service dope af,  chill vibe, and omg chiles rellenos con camaron wtf those were bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on a Sunday night when they have live mariachi music.  The place is not fancy and has a ton of fish dishes.  I had calamari a chicken burrito and a margarita.  Way too much food and I had to take most of the burrito home.  When you sit down they give you chips and salsa and also a small cup of soup.  The calamari was tasty not overly breaded.  All in all a good experience"}
{"text":"Could actually be a great spot if the music isn't as loud....went in to eat with my husband and couldn't have a conversation with him because the music was LOUD. Food is good and other reviews complain about bad service, mine that day was actually good and fast. I usually take out though."}
{"text":"The place was amazing...  The sauces for the shrimp are top ten!!!  I can not wait to come back.  The owner was wonderful.   Brought us champagne and desert for one of the lady's birthday....  It is an amazing seafood resturaunt.

We travel all over the country and this has become a favorite for us. Plus it's a family business..."}
{"text":"The ceviche was delicious, the ambiance was good, the service was a little slow but overall great experience. Would come back"}
{"text":"Este es mi favorito lugar los camarones est√°n frescos y toda la comida que e probado a tenido sabor. Me tomo tiempo encontrar este lugar porque usual mente los lugares de mariscos hacen toda su comida con el mismo saz√≥n y d sabroso. Pero aqu√≠ no!! El servicio tambi√©n es muy r√°pido!"}
{"text":"Seriously, one of the best experiences for dinner we have had in a long time.  Exceptional service, food is wonderful, and the owner is an awesome guy.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried the tacos \"Gobernadores\". These are great. You must try them! This is a nice clean seafood restaurant. Not really expensive and the portions are a good size. Highly recommend this small business!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican seafood! The best cheladas almost as good as the one I make. Great ceviche service and place is clean."}
{"text":"We ordered a small shrimp cocktail and it wasn't what we expected. It lacked flavor, spice.  We had to ask for avocado as It wasn't included. We also ordered the ceviche tostada and it also lacked flavor.  The pico de gallo on the ceviche had a refrigerated taste.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this place. It was a Friday afternoon, we ordered a shrimp cocktail and fish tacos which included rice and beans. As far as drinks it was a soda and 2 beers. The food was okay, the price was over the top. We will not be going back to eat there again!"}
{"text":"I just love Mariscos, Im also very picky when it comes to the taste and how authentic they are. This place is on point, the servings are also very generous. The quality of food is amazing and the freshness is also there. I haven't been to any sea food restaurant that starts you off with the soup (vich√©) of the sea food. Usually you have to ask for it. 
Anyone who likes Mariscos will really enjoy this one, from the service, to cleanliness and feel. I give this place all 5 stars. Delicious. Clean. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! I used to have to drive for authentic (& fresh!) Mariscos. Not anymore! Micheladas are on point to start with. Tacos gobernador, campechana, & shrimp ceviche tostadas are my fave!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, small family owned restaurant with good menu.  We just tried the jalape√±o dish stuffed with shrimp and cheese wrapped in bacon.  It was delish!

The restaurant is very small and well decorated. Nice new tables and dishes. 

The room was a little warm, but that was OK.  It wasn't unbearable. And the service was slow but expected as it is a very small space and only one waitress.  

We loved the food. It was great! But I gave it 3 stars for the room temp and slow service."}
{"text":"Tostadas de ceviche where delicious, but a little high priced @7. My boyfriend got a tostada of aguachile and for $9 it wasn't spicy at all, he even had to add hot sauce. I would recommend the ceviche but not aguachile. I would also recommend going midday since other reviews complain about loud music and I went around 2:00p.m. And the  music was fine, it was actually pretty empty, so service was good. Not sure if I will be returning to try their shrimp cocktail or just wait to go to CA?"}
{"text":"Needed a place within shuttle distance of the hotel and this filled the bill nicely. Very good seafood authentic Mexican style. Immaculately clean, friendly service and great menu."}
{"text":"terrible place! food is ok. service is fast. overpriced for what you get. music is too loud.  staff not empowered to do their job. Will not go back."}
{"text":"This has been the worst cocktail I have ever had. It was watered down and not enough crackers or avocado or cucumbers or anything inside this cocktail shrimp. I paid $35 4 cocktail shrimp I was better off just buying the stuff and making it at home. I will not go back and complain two management it is not worth my trip and I know they won't make it right. I feel as if take advantage of Mexican Americans just because we can't speak your language well. I will not be going back to this place and rating it 1 star was because the cashier was nice."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd. time here... Nice relaxing environment. The food is the best mariscos I've ever had here in Arizona! The oysters on a 1/2 shell are the largest vs. other places! Everything is fresh... Even the chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Had a Aqua chillier tostada great size portions one tostada is a nice size! Taco Gorbenador off the chain good get the green aqua chilies if you like it spicy tried my boys red it is great but prefer the green I got really spicy and tasty. Las micheladas are preped really well!!nice to have a good mariscos spot in the far west valley !!"}
{"text":"The food was ok here. My niece did not like her steak tacos and I didn't really care for the shrimp cerviche...which was more like shrimp on a tostada and nothing else! Very plain. They automatically charged me 20% gratuity on my bill for a party of 6, which included kids!!...come on, really?! They also got my nephews order wrong! Aside from this, I didn't know the food tax was 11%, wow, I probably would have not bothered coming here had I known but I'm not from AZ. All in all, if you are in the mood for seafood without much flavor other than hot sauce and onions, then this place is for you. The guacamole was okay...had to put salt in it to give it more flavor...they didn't even give me chips with my guacamole!! They charged $2-3 extra for a few avocado slices...they don't even tell you, they just ask you if you want avocado when they bring your shrimp dish to you like it comes with it...then just charge you when you get your bill. Don't bother complaining, but they DGAF! (Dont care).  Dine at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Great food and great speedy service. Both perfect English and spanish service.  I had the medium Campechana and it was delicious. Briught me chips and meal was out without seconds.  Super friendly staff. Family own."}
{"text":"The food is delicious... 
My niece and I decided to stop by for lunch it was great. The staff is friendly and the food is very tasty. I am definitely going to go back with my hubby I'm sure he will enjoy the seafood they have a lot of variety."}
{"text":"I went to eat there today, Tanya was my server, gosh it was really amazing! She was very friendly, funny and talked to me about the specials for lunch for every single day during the week. Service was very fast also. I loved my lunch time today and I will be coming more often! I'm grateful for Tanya, for taking care of me when I told her I only have 20 minutes to eat, she was the fastest person ever! Hahaha"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. We ordered our drinks, me and a couple of other friends got horchata. We tasted it and it tasted disgusting! It tasted like it had lemon in it ... it wasn't sweet at all. After we got a hold of the waitress, we told her it didn't taste good and she gave us new drinks. We later saw them cleaning out the horchata because i guess the filter or something was broken.... they should check if their stuff is ready to serve to guest. Really disappointed. I wouldn't recommend. Do not come here... it wasn't good :("}
{"text":"Fabulous locally owned Mexican seafood with a huge variety, great salsas and you must try the Cafe de Olla afterwards!"}
{"text":"Fast polite service, these guys are legit. Delicious refreshing, makes me feel like I'm in Ensenada."}
{"text":"Bomb Mexican food! Good service and good food . Love how this place is well attended and clean inside. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, try the Mojarra (fried fish), seasoned perfectly. The campechanas are one of the best I've had in the Valley, will definitely come to visit again."}
{"text":"Que rico!!

This place is amazing. Clean, great staff and the food is the bomb. Not your normal American seafood joint. This is a Mexican style place that many latinos love. If you're willing to try some new style fishX shrimp or cocktails. Come venture to this spot. I ordered the plate called \"Reina del sur\" (queen of the south) and this thing was nuts! had the whole office in awe. im coming back."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise that we found by luck. We were next door shopping for shoes and just went in. First we got great service from our waiter Gabriela, she was very attentive and super nice. Gave us chip and salsa as well as a complimentary soup which my wife ate right away and was offered another one right away. The place is small but cozy, clean and well kept. The food is good although I am not from Mexico and the flavors were a little bold for my taste. Also good portions and priced reasonably."}
{"text":"Walked in and wasn't even greeted ! Sat there for 10 minutes and not even acknowledged. $10 for a Michelada and overpriced menu. Horrible service always makes a place SHIT ! Walked right out!! I'll take my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"$27!!! For some measly shrimp? That's insane. I can't believe I actually paid this for an aguachile Chile. I've paid this for a large T-bone steak and fixins. Further, the shrimp was tough and it did not come with any cucumber, and only a small bit of tomato. The flavor was good, it's just a shame everything else sucked. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good and affordable the food was on point. It's a small place but so if you go just make sure you don't go on busy day."}
{"text":"I walked in to a grossly warm room temperature for my comfort zone. 
The woman who own the place kept giving me dirty looks I'm a very attractive girl and I do not be appreciate being treated differently just because of my looks
 I'm a paying customer just like anyone else. 
The food is ok. I had shrimp chevihie. Was ok. 
The alcoholic drinks were great. 
I did not get carded"}
{"text":"Wooow la comida en este restaurante est√° deliciosa le doy 5 estrellas y se los recomiendo... buen√≠simo 
El pezcado Zarandeado relleno. Y que mejor la amabilidad del personal. Con ganas de volver 
Gracias"}
{"text":"I have got to come back here when I have more time. I was just stopping by before a late meeting. This place does not look like much from the outside, but do not be fooled. 

I got the fish tacos, DELICIOSO! I did not expect them to taste so good. Now I want to come back and try more food and bring more people. I was already full from the abundance of chips and salsa but made room for more. 

And they have a happy hour special. .99 Coronas. But beware they are  Coronitas (smaller) and you have to buy the whole bucket of 6 to get them for that price."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was slow for no discernable reason. Not busy and yet felt abandoned a few times. I don't like to be rushed yet also dislike being completely ignored. I practically never judge on service in reviews so this really stood out. The food was pleasant but not outrageous."}
{"text":"I love getting there chipotle shrimp plate served with rice, beans, and salad. Service  wasn't too fast but if you have enough time to wait food isn't too bad. Service is okay. Not the best nor too bad."}
{"text":"Excellent service courteous staff. Best Mexican seafood in the valley. The waitresses are very friendly and the seafood always fresh. The reina del sur is to died for.  It has a little bit of everything for you too enjoy.  The micheladas are very cold and delicious. Best all around Mexican seafood."}
{"text":"Lived for 3 years in AZ and finally found a legitimate Mariscos spot. Taste is great everything I ordered, the fish and shrimp ceviche, was all good. Normally I only find restaurant like these back home in LA but I'm happy to have found one here in Phoenix. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Phoenix for a few days and decided to check this restaurant out.  Upon arrival we kept driving.  The area was not desirable."}
{"text":"Oh my Lanta, can we say delicious... I was craving some mariscos (seafood) seen all the reviews so I said this place I must try..here I am in awe of how authentic and delicious everything is. From the consom√© they serve(squeeze lime) to their salsa..hands down this salsa is the best I've had at any Mexican restaurants. I ordered the tostada. It filled me up, it's so much food it has octopus so tender, shrimp, scallops and so many more things. It's oh so good. I would recommend to any one. The waitress was very friendly and attentive.."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! Service is awesome. I'm not gonna lie at first I was hesitant but once inside totally what I did not expect!! I'm new to the area and I think i found my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Mariscos are on point I've never been disappointed and I have been here quite a bit agua chile bomb cocktails ceviche everything really good"}
{"text":"Me and my husband just came in from NY. Service was good! We both liked our meals very much! Just what we needed after a long trip today!"}
{"text":"Siempre ordenamos los aguachiles estan al 100 !!!!! Y las micheladas estan riquisimas!!! Cinco Estrellas para este restaurante"}
{"text":"Very good soup they give you when you get seated.. really great michaladas and guac this place is great"}
