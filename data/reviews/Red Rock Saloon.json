{"text":"As a barbecue enthusiast, I was really looking forward to trying Red Rock Saloon. We arrived with a fairly large group and were seated immediately. Unfortunately, the food ended up taking almost an hour to come out after we ordered. The Mac and Cheese was pretty delicious, but the barbecue was quite dry. Overall, Red Rock seems like a great place to grab a casual drink, but I would definitely recommend grabbing dinner somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service that I have ever been to. If you're wearing athletic shorts, don't bother waiting in line because they won't let you in. Apparently that's the cutoff for the dress code when the bartenders are practically naked. Then when you get in (after a $5 cover charge), you pay double the price for same drink you could get elsewhere. 7 dollars for a \"double\" jack and coke when it can't be more than a 16 oz glass of coke with a splash of jack in it is not a special. Never spending my time or money there ever again."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. The server asked if she could get us anything else and we had to reply with our food."}
{"text":"Disappointed....visited this RRS last Friday evening right around 5 p.m. Of course parking was/is an issue in that area. Got lucky at a meter on a side street. Enter the establishment - not overly busy obviously at this time of day. Hostess sat us quickly. The waitress/waiters definitely remind of a group of high schoolers hanging out at lunch time. They were hard pressed to leave the hostess stand. Our waitress did not know the specials, was looking on the menu for them? Did not know the menu items at all, ran to the kitchen twice to get answers to our menu questions. Since open for over a month now I guess I expected more. The bbq brand they are trying to promote, um..needs alot of work. My food was cold when delivered, cold pork, cold beef, and slightly warmed mac & cheese. The only thing hot was the sweet potato tater tots, obviously not made from scratch either. Manager & chef both appeared at my table to offer an apology but no comp of the meal or drinks was offered. Once warmer food delivered to me the bbq pork & beef again was not ideal in flavor or presentation. A $14 dinner should be something you would want to eat.  Much work is needed by this restaurant as they are competing in a town where there are award winning bbq establishments. Chipolte mac & cheese not a flavor combo needed to go with bbq. Why would anyone need a chicken breast sandwiched between 2 hamburger patties and then on a bun. Seems they are trying to way over due the menu. They need to hone in on a few GOOD BBQ items, work to cook them well, have good accompanying side dishes and do away with the kitchy names & failed flavors & attempts to pass off pre packaged food as homemade."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Showed up around 4 and were \"ushered\" outside and around a corner, presumably because it was two guys, which they seemed overly awkward about upon arrival. Ordered the bbq bowl, which was decent. Bread rolls are blah. Got the check and because of an event at 7pm, our drinks, which should have been half off for happy hour, were full price. No mention upon ordering, or being seated. Waited about ten minutes for check and was given change in 5's and one single...needless to say, and i hate undertipping, they got the single. Rule #1 for servers, give ones back as change. Not sure i'll be back, wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Went for trivia (Monday @7:30) and to try some $0.50 wings. I was extremely satisfied with both. The wings were huge, their sauce was 10/10, and the meat was tender and soft. Trivia was well done, though it was more of a YP crowd, not the greasy college scene I tend to thrive in. Service was excellent, and dealt with our team being a bit chopped in an excellent manner.   My only issue: the strange beer special they had going. $2.50 for any Wisconsin beer for people playing trivia. On the surface this sounds decent, but of their ten taps, only three were Wisconsin brewed (Fantasy Factory, Hopalicious, & Spotted Cow). Why have that deal if you have such a limited beer selection? I love craft beer, but would almost prefer some cheap beer special alongside wings. Also, any pint special that doesn't have some equivalent pitcher deal (simple math y'all) is  imo.   Sort of a nit-pickey issue tho, I will most certainly be back, and look forward to my next batch of wings."}
{"text":"Bailey is the best bartender ever!!! She makes the best bombs on $1 bomb night and she's super nice and outgoing. Ask for her!"}
{"text":"I would have thought it was common courtesy to let someone on their first beer of the night know why they were being kicked out but I guess not. I'm NEVER going back to this place."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night with some friends and this place is a total riot! I'm not a country person, but the band was great and I LOVED watching the mechanical bull riders. So much fun."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 meat platter & even though plenty of food -it was just okay. Ribs were very dry. Pork & brisket were fatty. Hubby thought dry as well. I thought the pork was okay. Chicken was moist & really good flavor. Restaurant was empty & we had very slow service. Cornbread must have been made last week -very dry. Gentleman behind us left a plate of ribs-obviously didn't like them either. Overall -looked like a fun menu -may give another try & go for a burger next time."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for a burger and Bloody Mary and was very happy with our experience. There are several booths to sit at and the bar area is nice and big. We sat at the bar and was waited on right away. Drinks came fast and we enjoyed our meals. The service was very good and we loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My company rented out the whole place for a meeting, and it was my first time ever in the door- so my review peobably does not reflect day to day vibe. They have a decent selection of craft beer on tap, inlcuding Left Hand Milk stout and Fantasy Factory. The meal was a buffett of pulled pork, beef, sweet potato tots, veggies, and BBQ beans. The sweet potato tots anf BBQ beans were THE BEST. And, both meats were tasty and tender.  This place has a mechanical bull...enough said."}
{"text":"We walked in and a guy behind the booth waved us in and said sit wherever so we found an empty table in the middle and were going to sit down at one of the empty tables when the bartender YELLED at us that they had a host would seat us and we couldn't just sit wherever we wanted. The \"host\" proceeded to sit us in the exact table we walked to. We immediately ordered a cheese curd appetizer and proceeded to wait well over 45 minutes for said cheese curds. We were trying to get our servers attention and she made a point of avoiding our table for the entire 45 minutes.  We ended up having to ask two servers if our appetizer would ever be coming out. The excuse we got repeatedly was the food runner was super confused. After waiting well over an hour for the rest of our food, a burger, two sandwiches and a salad, we received our food with another apology. I don't usually write these reviews but the service was extremely subpar. On a positive note, the macaroni was good."}
{"text":"We used our first groupon here, and it was a great deal.  The sausage melts in your mouth, and all of the BBQ is on point.  Wash it down with a Shiner Bock and you are golden!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party because they supposedly had a live dj and dancing that night. Yeeeaah...we weren't really expecting the dj to be playing club-ish covers of country songs! It was very strange. And no one in our group expected THIS amount of country hickness at this place. The mechanical bull riding, the real bull riding on TV, the cowboy outfits the guy bartenders had to wear or the assless chap jean outfits the girl bartenders had to wear. I will say that the girl bartenders do have great assests, so very jealous there. The drinks were strong enough and reasonably priced, though not strong enough to make me forget where I was. No one in our group wanted to stick around for round #2.  This place definitely has it's target audience. And for those who are in that group, I'm sure you'll love it. For the rest of us, unless you're looking for an impromptu weekend ho down, best keep walking on."}
{"text":"We dined for the first time on an early Wednesday evening with a Groupon we purchased for the Four Meat Platter with two beers.  Our server was a very friendly young lady who didn't miss a beat.  We started with an appetizer of fried pickles.  No complaints there.  Our platter included delicious smoked chicken, ribs that melted off the bone, pulled pork which was juicy and not drowned in sauce.  They leave it 'naked' so you can decide which sauce on the table you prefer.  That was a plus because the three sauces were pretty good.  The smoked sausage was also pretty darn good!  Our favorite side were the baked beans.  Thick and flavorful.  The Shiner Bock beers that were included were gulped down in no time.  Would we return, YES.  Friendly service, goooood food and cold beer.  Try it out."}
{"text":"I feel like Red Rock Saloon is going to be a hit or miss for most people.  First, the whole country meets Hooters theme is not really in tune with Madison culture (just my two cents, by the way). I enjoy my hoedowns as much as the next person, but this place was missing the southern hospitality vibe to it.  Our servers were kind of distant and cold, which I guess was understandable, since we went on their grand opening night.  Second, they could have done a better job promoting the restaurant. Maybe have a 50% off deal to prompt people to try your food, or offer something like a free appetizer. Instead, people got a free coupon to try their mechanical bull, which is something most sober people would avoid. On top of that, they didn't even offer rides for the majority of the night because their \"operator\" wasn't there. I guess you needed to be a licensed joystick handler or something.  Third, their food simply wasn't great. If you're going to be offering BBQ with Brickhouse BBQ down the street, you better be prepared to throw-down. Unfortunately, Red Rock missed the mark, and opted for a bland menu of items instead of something of quality.   Fourth, no drink specials? You're a bar, learn to cater to your audience, c'mon!  However, all that being said, this place does have the potential to be a great night out. With live music, large spacing, plenty of seating, a dance floor and some catchy tunes, this could definitely liven up the dance scene in Madison.  For now, I think I will stick to the status quo."}
{"text":"Had a fun time at Red Rock Saloon. Came in on a Sunday night with my friend. Kitchen was open till 10 so we ordered the brisket nachos which were delicious.  The brisket was juicy and just melted in your mouth. I liked that the nachos actually had the gooey nacho cheese, unlike other places that just melt cheddar cheese and it soon becomes a harden mess. The cook stop by and asked how our nachos were and we told him that they were great. He recommended that on our next visit we should try the collard greens and the homemade corn bread. A+ for the brisket nachos. Bartender who made our drinks was really friendly. She did forget to bring out plates and silverware, so we did eat our nachos like messy drunks for the first few minutes. Other bartender noticed and brought us plates though.  The drink special that night was doubles for the price of singles. My friend and I both had two vodka press doubles and they were pretty easy to drink. We liked that they weren't strong drinks because we had planned to continue bar hopping. Over all I enjoyed my time here. The place still smells like new and the decorations are fun. Will stop by soon for those collard greens, and possibly to try the BBQ pork nachos."}
{"text":"I'll say I like the original more (Milwaukee)... but I find myself biased towards all things Milwaukee. Red Rock Saloon in Madison is pretty spacious, with a bar in the middle and seating all around. Then stage in the back corner and a bull once you walk in. It's quite an inviting atmosphere. If memory serves correctly, there is also a smaller bar off to the right of the main entrance. It's been too cold to utilize the patio (unless you're a smoker... then it's never too cold to be out there) but I think that will be a nice spot to go during the summer. Which, for outdoor seating ... Madison may have the edge over Milwaukee.  It's a Country bar... if it's not obvious by the logo or other clues along the way. If you don't care for that style, this bar is not for you... go for the food, not for the party at night. But if you like Country music, this will easily become your favorite Madison drinking spot!"}
{"text":"I quite liked this place in the past, but the new menu isn't great. The worst offender being their new fries. They taste like they were bought from a supermarket frozen section and the \"poutine\" that has replaced the (much-beloved by my friends) chili cheese fries is a strange combination of BBQ and cheese sauce over baked beans, cheese curds and their awful new fries. Additionally, the half priced starters during happy hour does *NOT* count the addition of meat to any of the starters (such as the poutine or quesadillas), which lead to quite a nasty shock when my party saw that they were paying on average $1.50-$3 more than they expected to on each appetizer. Overall I think it's cool that they're trying new things, but between things feeling generally more overpriced than they were before this new menu and the really quite bad changes to certain previous staple menu items, I can't really recommend Red Rock to any fans who haven't visited it in the last few weeks."}
{"text":"This was by far the best brisket and barbecued chicken I've had... And I'm very picky when it comes to brisket. It practically melted in my mouth. My husband said the pulled pork and Mac & cheese were also amazing"}
{"text":"Oh god no Where do all these frat boys find cowboy Hats ? They should call this place red cock saloon cause I'm sure these guys have the herpes I'm just saying it's skanky  Like a Florida prostitute  Then again that's downtown"}
{"text":"Food awesome. Drinks fantastic. Live music incredible. But....beware...they move the tables close to the music right before the band starts. Wanna sit and watch? Sit farther away."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love country music, especially live cou try music. I love good quality cheese burgers, and I love beer. All that equals a 5 stars.  For those that complain about 1$ burger nights. Of course there are stipulations. They are reasonable stipulations. No bar is going to give you a dollar burger unless you order drinks and patronize the bar. Don't drink? Order a pop or soft drink. The burgers are really juicy and they even melt the cheese on them. So so so guilty good."}
{"text":"I like bbq food about once a year! So this review may not be best for you. We had 4 people for dinner on Friday night.  Service- very good, some of the girls working the floor were dressed to draw my focus away from the food- lets just say.  Food- We ordered appetizers and the 4 meat sampler platter which was plenty for 4.  Ribs- fall off the bone good Pork- too much fat for my taste Brisket- excellent flavor- felt fat could have been trimmed better. Chicken- juicy and tender- excellent  Cheese sticks- frozen-avoid Wings boneless- I'm gonna go with frozen again- good but I would pass next time.  Country music- great band, very good  Ambiance- cool place- feels like a country bar.  If you like nascar, beer, bbq- this is the place for you.  I gave it 3 stars because everything was just good- I believe this place has a ton of potential, mgmt just needs to take it up a notch."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! I had the BBQ pork bowl and my wife had the pulled pork & brisket sandwich. The apple pie Manhattan cocktail was super yummy, albeit it was pricy ($8). Our server Abby was so sweet and attentive!!! Would give 5 stars to her alone. I can't stand country music so I withhold one star :-)   We will for sure go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to swing by for a beer, grab some good BBQ, and meet up with friends. Nice wait staff, friendly. They have a packed crowd of college kids until 2 am on weekends, and a few too many fights where people have been hurt. Be careful after 10 pm ..."}
{"text":"Went back for the $1 burger night. It was pretty good! They had a lot of fun topping options, which made choosing a burger oh so hard.  We went in a group of 5 people, ordered beers from the bar and then sat down at a table. The bartender was not knowledgeable about any beers, and was rude to us until we tipped him. Disappointing.   Once we were at the table, the service was prompt and our waitress was nice. The food was very good. I had bleu cheese coleslaw on mine, which I would recommend. Very tangy and a great addition. Make sure you get the sweet potato tots (fries). YUM. So delicious! I ate half my burger and took the rest home for lunch the next day. It was about 15 times more delicious the day after because all the flavors simmered together. I will be definitely be coming back for burgers.  Overall, a better experience than before. The vibe when its only a restaurant is pretty cool. I can definitely see this place becoming a hit spot for late-night eats and whatnot, but with drink prices so high I don't think it will become a regular Madison late-night spot. Overall, I had a better experience this time around; however, service wasn't up to par. The rude bartender and our waitress's clear annoyance/sneer when someone in our party paid with cash instead of a card was what caused me to vote down. We were being very compliant with both of these workers, so there was no reason for them to be so hostile. Not good.  Would recommend for food!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go. Food was pretty good. Fun atmosphere after 8:00pm. I kept getting a waft of sewer gas coming out near the kitchen which was off putting. Also, the music was so loud that I couldn't talk to the group I was with. I'm a drummer in a heavy metal band and it was hurting my ears."}
{"text":"Very good!  We were pleasantly surprised.  I had the pulled pork and my husband had brisket sandwich.  Both were very tasty.  Mac n cheese was flavorful and not too greasy.  Sweet potato fries were good as well.  Great big place with live country music at 10pm."}
{"text":"I recently attended the \"Grand\" opening this past Friday. I was so excited to go, their social media really got me pumped up. Once there, it was just disappointment after disappointment.  First, charging a cover charge (even if just $5), without advertising it is just plain wrong. It was not posted ANYWHERE (which I am pretty sure is against the law) and really rubbed me the wrong way. It is very unlike Madison, and to be a successful bar in a college town, you better know your environment.   So cover charge, its annoying, yeah but I can get over the $5. I cannot get over being deceived into coming to a bar. Don't you want your patrons to WANT to come, instead of being tricked into paying to get in?   NO DRINK SPECIALS. What the heck is up with that? Again, college town, again, know your demographics. And even worse, it was $7 for the worst vodka lemonade I have ever had in my life.   The bar tenders were dressed like hookers, so that was...interesting?   It just seems like, all in all, the owners of Red Rock Milwaukee thought they could take some fancy, expensive trashy bar and drop it into downtown Madison without changing anything at all.   They get two stars because I think their food could be the saving grace, so I am going to have to go back and try it. But I don't see myself going again on the weekend unless Tim McGraw's in town."}
{"text":"I'm always prepared for a bad meal when I ask what's good and the waitress says, \"everything\".  Lies. The food was dry and overcooked. Go for the drinks and eat before you get there.   The music was so loud we couldn't hear each other talking and it only got louder at 9pm. They need to figure out if they're a restaurant, a bar, or a club. The current situation is lacking."}
{"text":"Drinks were great, staff was incredibly friendly, and if you're an adult, this is a fine place before around 10 pm, at which point it turns incredibly...we'll call it bro-y. Kinda like Hooters with really loud music. The female bartenders went from wearing pants to...not pants, basically underpants with chaps that had more or less all of the denim material cut out. Kinda weird, but if that's your thing, have at it. There's a mechanical bull, the music gets earsplittingly loud, and the crowd gets rowdy, which is great if you're looking to get rowdy as well, but notsomuch if you're looking to have a conversation. If you're not super duper hammered, this is a terrific place for a drink or two before 10. If you're not part of a bachelor/bachelorette party or looking to get super hammered, I'd recommend finding another bar in the area after 10."}
{"text":"Bartender looked at me as to see I needed a menu, however, she caught the gaze of the d bag bouncer behind me.  All I wanted was food. Its literally 3pm and no service. All I could think of is \"is this really happening\"?"}
{"text":"Wow!  Such a surprise.  We went with a good coupon and weren't expecting great things from this large campus-area restaurant we figured was just a bar that also served some food.  But we all enjoyed our meals, the service was good, and we were very impressed with the fit-and-finish - Red Rock sunk some serious money into remodeling this old barn!  I can't claim to be a BBQ connoisseur, but I had trouble picking my favorite among the 3 unique sauces on the table.  They have some great happy hour and daily deals too.  My only disappointment was that the onion strings were lackluster.  I'll be back for sure, and maybe even take on the mechanical bull."}
{"text":"I've been to Red Rock a handful of times and generally have more fun than I think I'm going to.  Highs and lows:  + spacious; even when it's busy I feel like I can maintain personal space - the bathrooms, while similarly large, are often horrendously disgusting; one night there was literal sewage backing up into the pipes and the men's room had to play double duty with a bouncer letting alternating lines of men & women in + a nice patio area - the music of choice on the weekends is country EDM + it turns out I will never tire of watching people I know get thrown off the mechanical bull - the crowd tends to be very young, but there are enough post-college patrons that I don't feel completely out of place +/- the booty short/chaps combo the women wear; if they want to wear them and they feel awesome doing it, great, but I've never seen a female employee in pants (or regular shorts, for that matter, or a male employee in any sort theme-wear) so I don't know if they're given a choice  I still haven't been for food, but they have some decent-looking offerings. Maybe someday, Red Rock!"}
{"text":"Ugh...college bars.  I'm really too old for this!  I was quite offended that all the female bartenders were wearing booty shorts and weird low chap/boot covers...no, the booty shorts were really more like Victoria's Secret cheeky underpants.  The male bartenders were all fully clothed...no cowboy boots...no chaps...nothing saloon-y.  I hope the female staff's attire is their choice and not a requirement of the establishment.  The bar here always seems wet.  And I always manage to get my arm/sleeve/some body part in it.  Yuck!  I'm also apparently too old to get service.  I stood at the bar with money visible in my hand and watched several other people who arrived after me get served first before I could finally flag down a bartender.  So why do I come here?  It's always when I'm with my younger friends.  The mechanical bull is a novelty, the   first time.  The music is good though...a nice dancy mix of old and new, pop, rock, and country.  The restrooms are ok.  There are at least 6 stalls which is good because it gets crowded.  They have a bathroom attendant though which is odd.  This is not a classy place, your restroom doesn't need an attendant and I'm certainly not going to tip her.  Writing this review makes me realize I really should not be going back to Red Rock.  Next time I'll talk my friends into riding the mechanical bull at Whiskey Jack's."}
{"text":"I feel that there are certain places that you have to rate for what there are and not compare them to what you wish they were; Red Rock Saloon is one of those places.  With Red Rock you know you are not going to get top quality food but you can at least hope for good service and great drinks.  I was here on a Saturday morning the day after it opened and was completely impressed by how large the space was.  Turns out, the location used to be a brewery which makes sense based on space alone.  Either way, we were greeted by a nice hostess who sat us immediately and briefly went over the menu with us.  We were there at 11 or so and they don't serve breakfast so we called it an early lunch.  Our server arrived and she was all smiles.   Super pleasant and super attentive.    We started with their wings that were supposed to be Asian flavored but were more like grilled with chili sauce on it. I ordered the chicken wrap and my partner the brisket, chicken with a couple of sides.  He really dug his dish I thought mine was just fine.  My expectations weren't super high but I also wasn't super disappointed.  I would come here again.  It seems like a fun place; they have video games in the back with a bull that you can ride in the front.  I would also even eat here again.  You really can't go wrong with bbq for a night out.  I will however wait until the hype wears off as I hear it was pretty packed on their first couple of nights open."}
{"text":"Disappointing food and service.  I will never be back.  Food took a long time and none of the four of us enjoyed it.  My daughter and I split a big order of wings and the were the worst I ever had."}
{"text":"Groupon oh I have to admit  Hubby bought one and I was scared! Reviews weren't great. Hmm but what a cute place and what fun! The deal was for a sampler plate two sides, two drinks or desserts. The ribs fell off the bone, sauce was just right with additional sauces on the side if you like. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. Brisket was super fresh and  moist. Blue cheese coleslaw was sweet and savory, I want the recipe.   Not my idea for dessert but the kids would have loved them. Deep fried oreos and poptarts, even if you don't go for these they both came on top of an ice cream sunday; pretty presentation!   Great country music, and good service!"}
{"text":"Really good food! I like a good BBQ, and they delivered. I've been here about four times now, and staff has always been friendly, prompt, and helpful. They have a nice little out door area, but it could be spruced up a bit more. They have random stuff laying around and it's more of an after-thought. But on a nice summer night during a week night it's usually empty and just us sitting out back. Guess I can't complain too much, it's our own personal outdoor area.  One thing everyone HAS to try are their deep fried oreos. I'm not kidding that you'll come here just for those by themselves. It's a HUGE plate of icecream, hot fudge, and deep fried oreos and cream cheese balls. While the thought initially of a deep fried oreo seemed off putting, it's now one of my favorite deserts. They are SO SO SO good. They were only like $4 and it was enough for a table of four!"}
{"text":"This place is Texas.   Only want to comment on three things: 1. Mechanical Bull - So fun. Came twice. First time $2, second time free. Do it at least once.  2. Drink Specials - I believe they had $2 local beers and $5 speciality drinks when I came. Affordable. Tasty.  3. Space - Huge. I was there on weekday nights, so not super busy. A welcome place to chill and hangout with folks.   I had fun when I was here."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I'm in town! Burgers are always cooked to the perfect temp, we get seated right away, and the waitresses (holla, Hannah!), hostesses, and bartenders are always polite, engaging and positive. Make sure to stop in on Wednesdays for their $1 burgers - it's a steal."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a county show or rowdy bar night, however, I can only reflect on the lunch I had on the only time I have been there. A Groupon motivated me to set foot in this bar/venue that I drive by almost daily. The staff was more than friendly, I was even given a up close and personal peak on the inner workings of the mechanical bull after I inquired about it.   The smoked chicken was great! It had the essential pink smoke ring and was moist. Unfortunately, the beef brisket was overly dry and not too beefy. The pulled pork was good. I smoke meats on the regular and have no objection but the brisket was not top notch at the time it was pulled for the pit. But it being lunch time, these slices were from the previous day and had dried out. I noticed the meat's consistency and can almost vouch that it was probably good when it was fresh, by sorry guys.   I will give them another try though because I see the skills. Maybe being early isn't the best time for them."}
{"text":"Their $1 burger Wednesdays is the way to go! This is a 1/4 pound cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, house sauce and onion. You can opt for an additional burger or two for a buck a piece each. They have a selection of sides for $3 each to go with your burger. I pretty cheap and tasty meal. I've had their sweet potato tots and they are pretty darn good. They do get pretty busy for Wednesday lunch, so plan accordingly if you have a larger group. I haven't been in for any other food or drinks (other than the burger deal), but I took a peek at their menu and it looks like some good options. I may have to come back for one of their bloody marys. I saw some photos and they look amazing. They do have free wi-fi for their customers. Just have to ask your server about it."}
{"text":"Wednesday $1 burger. Starts $1 for beef patty, $2 for grilled chicken or veggie. $1 for cheese. $1 for fried egg and $0.50 for most other toppings like sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, etc. Sides are and extra $3 which includes 5 cheese mac n cheese, beer battered fries, sweet potato tater tots and more. If you only order the $1 burger, they will charge $2.50 for water. So might as well get soda, or get upset that your \"$1 burger night\" has just become a \"burger-on-any-other-night night.\"   Food doesn't match what you pay for. And for people who aren't a fan of country music, you might feel that you're paying for more than those who are. Food was bland and extra greasy. Not the good greasy. I was hoping the grease meant nommy guilty butter and fat dripping down my face. Unfortunately, chancing the possibility of pimples on my face wasn't worth it.  I am curious how often the mechanical bull actually gets put to use, such a prominent item in the bar/restaurant, more than the stage that has live performances, Friday and Saturday nights, that was tucked in the corner under low lights. The mechanical bull might be the reason why I go back...yeah...not really. Still a pretty new joint. We'll see if this country niche will keep the joint open."}
{"text":"Everything else was booked on Valentine's day except for Red Rock. Here, we were seating within minutes of entering.  We were told that they'd completely redid the space after acquiring it from the previous tenants of the building, and it is very obvious that they put a lot of thought into the design of the space and the decor (my favorite is the antique motorcycle piece at the center of the bar).  I ordered the Two Gun Corcoran sandwich with a side of beer-battered fries, absolutely guilt-free. I thought the sandwich was pretty good, but that may have been because I don't have particularly high standards for bar food. The pulled pork and brisket were tender and fell apart easily, but they were also quite charred (way too much for it to have been purposeful). Anyway, I kept myself entertained by trying all of their BBQ sauces with the beer-battered fries. There aren't THAT many options, but I do like that they offer different sauces.  I like the concept of Red Rock, but it does seem a little out of place in Madison. My friends and I have a running bet on how long they will stay in business. I say a year to a year and a half, my friends say six to seven months. I guess we'll see who wins the bet?"}
{"text":"Bull rides are always a good time! Beer pong and darts on thirsty Thursday's will put you in a good mood too! Fun atmosphere and good service!"}
{"text":"So we went in today, wanting a seat on the patio since it was a nice day, no one really in the bar. Asked the bartender if we could have a seat outside, she said sure and would send someone out. Never happened. But when another random table came in, some server was there in a heartbeat. We purposely walked out the restaurant and heard the bartender say \"oh shit\" as she realized she forgot about us and said nothing else. The saving grace is this really  cool worker let us ride the bull and that was entertaining."}
{"text":"Honey Teriyaki Chicken Wings are great, drinks could be stronger, atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"Was with a work holiday party last sat night, 12 of us arrived at the bar about 830 we took a couple of tables in the back corner up against the wall. At about 9pm the staff came around and told us they needed to remove our chairs, and were rather rude about it?? There was not 1 person on either dance floor and maybe 30 people in the whole place. Why on earth are you taking away chairs from the few guests you have there?? We then went down to whiskey jacks and had a much better time... they even had to remove our table and chairs but guess what it was because they were actually crowded... not just because."}
{"text":"After being to Red Rock twice now, I plan on keeping it in my regular rotation of weekend nights out. We had a mediocre experience when we went for opening night, but now that everyone isn't swarming the place, it seems to be much more organized.  Let's start with the positives: reasonable drink prices, awesome atmosphere, great music. Beers are $3. There's a lot of unique decor. They play awesome country music. The crowd is pretty diverse, too. The country aspect definitely brings out some of the rural folk in Madison, so it's awesome to see the different groups interact. Everyone seems to be having fun when you walk around, so this place is not short in that department.  And of course there's a couple things that could be improved: cover charge, the live bands, and the mechanical bull. Both times we went, the cover charge was $5, which they justify by having live music. You can usually get out of paying for cover by slipping by the desk or saying that you're with one of the groups. Also, the bands that have played when I've been have been pretty mediocre. The crowd seems to be having more fun when they play regular music. Maybe it would be better if the band played 8-10pm, or something like that, but I'm definitely not a fan of going back and forth between live and regular music. The mechanical bull looks like it's about to fall apart after 2 weeks of use; it could definitely use a makeover.  I'll be back in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"I'm in love...  With the sweet potato tots! I am not a big sweet potato person, but these things are friggin' awesome! When I do eat sweet potatos, I load them up with salt, and these salty and sweet bites of heaven deliver. The rest of the menu is pretty good. I've had some of the barbecue and other selections, all serviceable. A little pricey given the atmosphere, but the wait staff was efficient and friendly.  I mentioned I was in love... well I forgot a credit card there when eating prior to a state HS tournament game. When I went back to retrieve it that evening, let's just say I fell in love a second time. This time, it was the interesting attire of the female bartenders. It was dark enough that at first, I thought they were only wearing chaps and skimpy t-shirts. Turns out they were actually wearing pants or shorts, but they must have been painted on. I was not ready for that.  That whole thing is not really my cup of tea where I am eating, but for those of you who love a good breastaurant, this place (in the evening) fits that bill."}
{"text":"Heck yes, $1 burgers every Wednesday - also a disclaimer that I have only been here on a Wednesday and for lunch.  Each patty is $1, so you can stack up and get lots of patties, if you want. It comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and house sauce. It's not the best burger, but it is a dollar and that is cheaper than making lunch (effort + ingredients is way more than $1).  They also have a variety of sides for $3. I can't bring myself to get anything else besides the beer battered fries. First of all, holy cow! They give a huge basket of fries and they are fried to perfection. Secondly, they are seasoned very well and go with their house BBQ sauces.   It's pretty quiet there mid-day, mid-week. They still play country music, which is good if that's your thing. I remain ambivalent on the music topic."}
{"text":"I love country music, so I love Red Rock. I love drinking out of mason jars, eating BBQ, playing darts and riding the mechanical bull, there's just a lot to do here, plus there's a nice outdoor area for when things get too sweaty inside. Sometimes there are live bands or DJs, and there are always a lot of friends here."}
{"text":"So, ordered Uber eats from Red Rock. Wings, and fried pickles.  Told them extra crispy on the wings. Got rubber. They're in the oven now. Sauce (red rock buffalo) is good, celery is ugly, and should not have been served. Why do restaurants put wings on their menus, when they don't know how to make wings? Or they're just unwilling to put in the effort?  Do you know ANYBODY that likes rubbery skinned, undercooked wings? The fried pickles were amazing."}
