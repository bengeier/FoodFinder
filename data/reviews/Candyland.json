{"text":"Performances are great but the crowd and music needs a little work. Also they shouldn't space out all the wicked performances sooooo far apart."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve one star. Food was horrible. Staff was horrible. The waitress was an idiot. The cocktails were almost 20$ and not even tasty or special. What a joke of a place. Acts were cool if you want to wait forever in between to see them. Would never go back. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Loooove Candyland.   The ambience, the decor, the paintings, the lovely hostess girls, the wall of candy (yum!) and not to mention the sexy risqu√© shows. I only hope it gets to the raunch level of the Box in London and NYC. Definitely my fav spot in the city right now."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! Made a reservation for 15. Spoke through various e-mail communications that I had to commit to a pre fixe menu and had to call to provide credit card for deposit - did that to confirm reservation. Showed up at 8:30 PM for reservation with 15 people on a Friday night and the place was CLOSED. No phone call to let me know or e-mail. I called and e-mailed the night of but did not hear back for a few days - they said they had previously e-mailed to cancel (they did not). Worst experience and any properly run business would not let this occur! Will never attempt to go again and would highly suggest you don't go to let them ruin your night as well!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Box in London and this is nothing in comparison.. But it's still a unique place to be entertained. The place is relatively small so be prepared to wrestle/tip toe to get a better view with all the people and their cellphones ."}
{"text":"We went there last week for dinner and drinks. The ambience was nice and food was great - good portion too! Their wings are a must-try.  After the dinner, we decided to stay to watch some late-night performances. The DJ played nice old-school tunes which we also enjoyed.   The shows - were just fantastic. This girl was swinging off a ribbon (or rope?) from the two-story ceiling and we also watched some other unique performances that you can't find anywhere in the city. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Not only is the quality of entertainment is low (pedestrian level performances that do not qualify for burlesque or so-called vaudeville), their staff members are thieves. We left a $300-worth birthday present with a hostess who promised to put it in a safe box for us to never see it again. After a month of back and forth, we didn't get as much as an apology from their management. No calls. A short email after multiple attempts to find out what happened. With such brutal unprofessionalism and quality of entertainment, this place won't stick around for long. Too bad there is no option to give it zero stars."}
{"text":"Came here on a girl's night on Friday. It was really empty when we arrived at 11pm, but slowly started filling up towards 12am. The crowd was a lot older than what we were usually used to. We paid $20 cover only to find out once we got inside that there's only one show per hour (11:45pm, 12:45am, etc.). Bar rail drinks start at $11 each and wine is $15. Those are pretty steep prices for a show every hour. To make things worse, the show only lasted 10 mins each, starting with the most boring shows first. I think this is probably to keep you waiting so you continue to buy their drinks.   There's an upstairs and downstairs portion, but 80% of the entire place (it's really small to begin with) is blocked off for booths. So there's actually very little viewing space to see anything when you're finally done waiting for that hour to pass by.   I wouldn't come back nor would I recommend."}
{"text":"We did not see any of the acts like the photographs on this page. We went here last night for a bachelorette party. It was not what I expected. I was thinking it'd be a classy burlesque show. It was not. Penises are spray painted on the walls, along with dirty words. We saw a waitress take off her top and flash the bartender. There's a big beam upstairs blocking the view of the stage. We only saw one performance while we were there, 11-12:30. It was two girls rolling around and crawling in army boots. Not my idea of burlesque. It was extremely dark and seemed seedy. We ended up leaving early."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place was really lame. Came here at 11pm on a friday night with some friends. $20 cover. We waited inside, cant sit on any seats, and the place is really small. We didnt really know whats going on. After a while of standing awkwardly near the bar and the couches that we cant sit ( probably only for bottle service) , we finally asked one of the staff there when the show will start. She said it usually starts at 11:45-12 midnight. Then my friend asked how she can rate the show and the staff member replied that she cant speak good english. Lol. Okay. So we stepped out the club for a bit to get some drinks at another bar where we can actually sit and chill!   We head back to candyland at about midnight and nothing was still going on in there. Finally around 12:30am, some burlesque lady came out of the stage and did some \"sensual\" dancing but it was really corny, no offense. she did for 30 seconds. Then there was a bachelorette party there and she let the bride to be slap her ass with a paddle. Okay. Then curtains closed again. DJ played some mediocre music. We convinced ourselves that maybe theres more. So then around after 1am, we saw a lady doin some acrobatic moves with a big circle thing. Maybe only for a few minutes. Then she offered vodka drinks around. We got so bored there. We left disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely a great concept...but don't bother. Terrible service, mediocre food. Recently went for a friend's birthday and was never told how the night actually works. We made reservations for 9pm and were told there would be live entertainment. It would have been great if they mentioned the entertainment starts at 11pm...especially when our table sitting was done at 11:30pm.  Our bill was over $500, not crazy for downtown Toronto when eating and drinking, but would have definitely been better had we seen more that a 2 minute show of a girl singing...not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Cool concept for a fun night out. Prepare to be entertained. We really enjoyed the shows; aerial ribbon dancer, snake charmer, fire eating, contortionist and other amazing acrobats. Music was good and not too loud for conversations. I can't wait to see what the next show brings!"}
{"text":"We love Candyland.  Their operator/partner Mike Ullman is the best, always takes care of me, my girlfriend, her friends and clients.  Here's someone who knows how to host a good party.  The acts are good, music is good they use DJS that play different tracks from the other clubs.  Definitely fun and unique"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Just another King Street bottle service focused place. Nothing special or exciting about Candyland. Don't bother."}
