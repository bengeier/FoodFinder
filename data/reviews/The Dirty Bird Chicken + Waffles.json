{"text":"Pricy but really good waffles    Good chicken portion. Let's keep it like that don't turn into home of the brave portions!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Dirty Bird was amazing.  I ordered the ODM and it was delicious.  Boneless fried chicken thigh on a fluffy waffle!  There was a sauce on the chicken which was a mixture of red hot hot sauce and medium chicken wing sauce, which was so good.  Their coleslaw and potato salad are also a must get!  I would recommend take out as there is very limited seating!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to find out if this chicken tastes good - I have no idea. I never got to eat it!! I waited for what seemed like 14 Drake songs. I checked in multiple times with the cashier, who double checked with the 4 guys in the kitchen, who all promised: \"It's coming right up.\" We watched order after order come up, wondering what happened. Seriously guys. I ordered two pieces of good damn chicken. TWO PIECES OF CHICKEN. No fries. No waffles. No drink. WHen we finality realized it was never coming, we went to get our money back, and with some surprise but mostly a lack of training on how to keep a customer happy, we got our money and left hungry, annoyed and wasted 40mins of our lives.  The only saving grace was that it was cool to watch hipsters eat fried chicken with their bare hands."}
{"text":"So yummy! Went there for a lunch with a girlfriend for the first time! To be honest I was a little apprehensive about it. What a combination eh?! Chicken ? Waffles?!?! Lol LOVED IT! Don't know why I didn't try it sooner. It's awesome! The place is chill, love the decor and their choice of drinks too.  Food is delicious, service is great, and the people so friendly."}
{"text":"Gross - inedible soggy waffles and fried chicken that was more fatty than meaty.  Having heard so many good things, I was really disappointed. Definitely won't back."}
{"text":"Dirty bird? That's absolutely correct. The chicken was pure grossness and the waffle was drenched in maple syrup. I had the ODB and I'm pretty sure they served it with suspicious vegetable mixed with bird poo. I paid $18 and they didn't even provide me with water to wash down the bird poo. If I could I'd give negative nine stars! Atrocious!"}
{"text":"ODP is a must try and the friend chicken is pretty bomb.  Would go here again.  Drizzle that maple syrup on everything"}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles that I've had in Toronto by far.  Only gave it 4 stars because seating is at a premium.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.  One thing, don't make plans after going here as it is very filling."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to The Dirty Bird because Toronotians really hyped this place up for me. Went to the new location on Bloor. Staff was not inviting and friendly at all. They work like that have no purpose to satisfy the customer and lolly-gagged when preparing the food. The waffle tasted like Aunt Jemima's waffles, actually I take that back because I can make better Aunt J's waffles from home. We got the ODB. The waffle was super soggy and their panko fried chicken was bland, but it was juicy so I give them that. The sauce that came with the chicken was Thai chilli sauce you can buy at Oceans or somewhere in Chinatown. The Mac salad tasted like Costco store bought in a tub. From the reviews it seems like The Dirty Bird is inconsistent with their cooking. I'll pass. I rather go to Denny's for some waffles."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for a long time, heard all good things & really wanted to love this place. I finally ate here and it was....ok, not great. It was also pricey. I think I had really high expectations & probably won't go back there again.  I prefer Stockyards fried chicken."}
{"text":"SO. DAMN. GOOD.  I've only had The ODB meal here. Its big piece of perfectly cooked juicy, fried chicken and a mega sized warm waffle is a match made in heaven. Maple syrup and maple sauces are so delicious and the side of potato salad or coleslaw are a great little touch.  The only minor issue I had was seating since it's such a small place. HOWEVER, in saying that, I visited during their grand opening week on a Sunday in Kensington Market, so I'll let that slide.  I plan on trying everything else on the menu and can't wait to do so. This little spot is my new obsession for my days of indulgence."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken waffles, and the sauce is perfect. I tried other places in Toronto and other cities with supposedly great chicken waffles, but nothing near as good as this place.   Things that make it so good:  Perfectly crispy batter but not too heavy They use dark meat, making it much more tender than breast The sauce and syrup gives a perfect combination of sweet and savory"}
{"text":"Even if chicken and waffles are not the best combination for a healthy meal, this is one of those times where I am willing to make an exception.  I ordered the ODB and was very impressed with the visual aspect of the food. The food tastes as good as it looks too! The waffles were above average compared to what I'm used to having, and the sauce they top off the chicken with was delicious, albeit a little bit spicy. Chicken also had a very crispy skin. The only part I didn't like as much was the coleslaw as the flavour was lacking, so it could do for some improvement.  I would definitely come here again when I'm in the Kensington area. There is not much seating for eat-ins, so I would keep that in mind when planning to come here with friends."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating chicken and waffles. I ordered in via hurrier so a friend and I could eat this during the game and we were not disappointed. Everything tasted delicious, and the packaging for delivery was really well thought out. This is one of my new faves."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. I found this place through TO's finest food passport and was pleasantly surprised. The passport allowed us to order just the chicken and waffles (no side, and none needed). This has to be one of the best fried chicken I've had and most notably because of the sauce. The chicken was not drenched, but it was certainly well dressed and the sauce was a rich maple taste which complimented the salty, crunchy batter. Glad the passport brought me here and will definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"The chicken was mostly skin and bones and cartilage and fat (!). The fries were okay. Overall quite disappointing! The chicken cuts should be better, for a place that mostly serves chicken."}
{"text":"Had the dirty bird-gur. When I saw it I thought it was tiny, however that little guy was filling. The dirty burd sauce that was on it was really tasty too! Coleslaw was pretty good, except the bottom half was way too saucy thanks to gravity. I'd get both again. Fries are nothing special though.  Service is done by walking up and ordering and then waiting for your name to be called. I suggest making sure they take your name - someone else didn't give their name when they ordered and it caused a lot of confusion. Also the wait was short of long after we placed our order, about 20 mins.  Decor is plain, nothing significant about it, and the space overall is small.   I'd recommend."}
{"text":"The Dirty bird for sure has the location but to overpriced for heavily battered and deep friend chicken legs or thighs with 2 small fragile waffles that can't even hold on to its own texture. This place is for sure making good dollars just because of long line-ups and a great spot. Overall, one can pay this amount for way better once in while junk food . The staff are very friendly :-)"}
{"text":"Its your boy from the hood that eats good, Nav...Just got paid and I know where Im gonna make it rain do you?  So I'm back again with another review - I was craving this over the last couple days so I stopped and had some yesterday after work. I was not disappointed always good and always fresh.  I was listening to some Action Bronson before I stepped in and order the ODB. I had that ordered up and damn, spices were nice and subtle in the fried chicken and the chicken is fried ever so nicely - and yes we talk like that in the hood.  So my meal is 5 star I think you guys changed up the batter just a bit or something cause it improved...Guys if you're gonna take your lady out to a meal take her here, light your own candle and be your own waiter - she'll appreciate the effort and you wallet will appreciate you.  Shout out to Giant Tiger and Wal-mart for unofficially sponsoring my wardrobe while out on my meal."}
{"text":"I have been to dirty bird twice and both visits were fantastic.  I had the dirty club and first visit I had a gluten free waffle with regular chicken and the second time I had the dirty bird club on a gluten free waffle with white meat.  This place is sooo yummy and totaly worth the trip and money.  Filling and the staff is absolutely fantastic.    On our most recent visit we had to wait a very long time for our meal and the staff apologized and comped half of our order.    Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like fried chicken and waffle combination when it's done well. This place definitely knows how to cook them right. Their waffle is cripy outside and fluffy inside, and coating for fried chicken has amazing seasoning while meat is juicy.   However, they lack on number of waffle makers, and the wait for the waffle to cook is very long even when you have only a few orders ahead of you (if you order the waffle).   I had to wait for more than 20 minutes for my order to be ready and that is the only reason why I am giving this place three stars."}
{"text":"Stopped by for curiosity during our visit to Kensington Market. There was not enough seats and it was very crowded. We weren't sure about waffle and chicken combination, so we just ordered waffle ice cream sandwich and fried chicken. They were very good. The chicken wasn't greasy at all, yet crispy and juicy. The ice cream sandwich was delicious as well. We ended up ordering wings as well, they were so well seasoned. It took a while to get out food, however, because there were not enough staffs in the kitchen for the number of customers they were serving."}
{"text":"I haven't had the good fortune of eating there in person, but I have ordered takeout to my office via UberEats several times.   I have an absolute love affair with their ODB. The chicken is fried so well that it doesn't taste greasy whatsoever, the skin is perfection and the coleslaw perfectly compliments the meal.   The waffle is a definite 9/10 as I feel it could be a tad bit crispier, but I love how sweet it is and how it really adds texture and balance to the chicken and dirty sauce.   I really don't think I can order anything else from there, but next time I will force myself to go rogue. I don't think it will be a problem. :)"}
{"text":"Chicken was fried nicely, waffle was ok. I liked the dirty sauce but wish it had more of a kick to it."}
{"text":"Finally got to give this place a go, the ODB did me in! The portion is huge and delicious,that sauce though a little spicy omgggg it compliments the chicken and waffles perfectly! I couldn't finish the entire thing.No regrets though...I'd definitely head back there to try something else off that menu."}
{"text":"The service was super slow, about a 15 minute wait for our chicken and waffles. The staff were super friendly. I got the ODB. The chicken and waffles were good, but I expected something a bit better for 15 dollars."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times and tried the Dirty Club and ODB. The fried chicken is very good. However it wouldn't be my top choice if I'm in Kensington Market and starving cause it's a tiny place so limited seating and it's a bit of a wait for the food.  Checkout my full experience here: http://jade-eats.weebly.com"}
{"text":"Was bad... ld rather eat old KFC. I realized when I left that they only give me 2 pieces of chicken when they were supposed to give me 3. It was clear that the oil hadn't been changed or cleaned in a while as soon as I opened the box there was a fishy smell. If I hadn't been on my lunch break I would have returned it and complained. The dirty bird really was dirty."}
{"text":"Great chicken n waffles! chicken was tender and flavorful.  waffles were good but not as moist as the ones at cluck cluck's.dirty bird sauce was excellent. would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Staff was brutal! They definitely did not want to work today and they let the customers know.  Ordered great white North upgraded to fries. Male Cashier  offered me a second side with my up north trip cause I ordered fries l thanked him and waited. Walked up to the counter, before i could say anything I was told order will be ready in 3 mins. Asked for the scotch bonnet ranch on the side. He said its too late it was made. I said I'm Sorry its too spicy. I asked for a new one to be made. Then the female employee that had just started walks halfway through the doorway and washroom with a coleslaw in hand and inhales it. Having worked in several restaurants I thought this was unprofessional. Then my order is up, no second side as promised.  When I asked the cashier he denied saying it and said he didnot recall.  We ate in, Tables were very dirty with food debris. I had to wipe it off to make it decent.   The food.  The chicken tenders were the same one's that had the sauce one them but were fried again to try to fry off the sauce. It didnt work,  It made them gross and too spicy to eat.  Both waffles were soggy no crisp at all, pretty sure they were gluten waffles too, I ordered gluten free.  3 piece chicken from up North trip was amazing.   We were here on Saturday and had a totally different experience. Which is the reason we came today (on thanksgiving).  I should have know when we saw the cashier that was working today as soon as we walked in. On Saturday he was complaining at the start of his shift that no one would come and he should be cut.   Management do yourself a favor and either fire this guy or dont leave him alone.  He will destroy your business."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Better than any chicken and waffles I've had in the States. I was ecstatic to find that they have a delicious gluten free waffle option and that the chicken itself is gluten free. The only problem with this place is that it is so far away from my home in California!"}
{"text":"We had the dirty club and the ODB but both were meh... meh-diocre. Thought the chicken would have tasted better, thought the spicy sauce they slathered would have a kick to it too, but unfortunately it wasn't as good as it looked on pictures. The restaurant was quite dirty, unclean and unhygienic. I felt that the staff there were just doing piecework and not actually going above and beyond to serve customers. No smiles at all, in fact they look like they were auditioning for Walking Dead for goodness sake. Hope y'all make the cut for Season 7 ladies!"}
{"text":"For the only chicken and waffles joint in Toronto it's good. The chicken is moist and flavourful and the waffle is not so bad. I had the ODB and I liked it, but I feel it's a bit steep on price. Staff is friendly and chill."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best deep-fried chicken I've ever had! This tender chicken is coated in a thin, yet crispy and mouthwatering batter that pairs excellently with the Belgian waffles they have made almost to perfection. My only complaint is that they provide metal utensils, as they give you plastic ones that are flimsy and wasteful."}
{"text":"Went there the other day and ordered the ODB and a 6 piece chicken dinner. The place was busy and the people working there were very nice. I may upset some people with this review so please note that this is my families opinion. The chicken was moist, and very tasty.  The waffle was basic.... wished it was sweeter. The potato salad was disgusting... it had way to much salt, so much so, that everyone who tasted it, spat it out. The coleslaw was ok. What I don't understand are the toppings on the dirty fries. There was way too much that the fries were saturated. We ended up throwing them out. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went here to grab a bite for lunch, we had been out all day and we're hungry. As soon as we stepped in, we knew it was gonna be amazing. My friend, a simple guy, ordered the tenders where as I ordered the \"Great White North.\" Took a little while to get out, due to the fact the chicken was being fried FRESH. Yes folks, fresh. When we got it it was hot, fresh, tasty and made me feel guilty about eating such a fatty dish. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce was amazing. The waffles were great. I went up to ask for a dream condiments and the staff were super friendly. I saw them unloading the truck, giving me the sense that the meat was fresh. After that, my friend was stuffed, BUT I WASN'T!!! So I ordered the \"Backwoods.\" It was one of the best ice cream sundaes I've had in a while. The cherries were delicious and the ice cream was great. All in all, great experience!"}
{"text":"Decent chicken/waffle. Fries were cold. Worst attitude and service by a truly snotty staff on SAT night. One and done."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited to try this place as all the reviews and photos made our mouth water! When we got there its was a bit later, 8 pm on a Saturday night. It was not too busy, just a few people eating at a larger table. At first we noticed how filthy the dining are was. There was garbage, used napkins and empty pop cans all over the place. It was gross. We figured that it was a busy day and the staff had not had time to tidy up. Well, what ever we can move things around and throw some things out.   The guy taking our order was obviously hot, but he was nice and answered our questions. We paid then waited in line. It was then that I saw the same guy who had just been working the till go into the kitchen and start handling food without washing his hands. He wiped down his sweaty brow then picked up the waffles that landed on our tray with his unwashed hands.   Now, I am not a food purist. I eat BBQ with my hands and get that when you eat out not everything is going to be 100% sanitary, however, this was way beyond gross. Sorry Dirty Bird, you need to be less worried about your public bathrooms more concerned about your filthy dining area and unhygienic handling of food."}
{"text":"Chicken was really good. Problem was, it had a bubble of oil that spilled out when we went to eat it. The staff should have noticed this. Overall the staff wasn't on top of things - they wanted to clear my plate too early and failed to remember what I ordered and put it on the warming table until I told them it was mine.   I suggest they use number stands for orders, so you can order, get a number stand and then go sit down without wondering if they remember who you are and what you ordered."}
{"text":"I came in on a Sunday around 12. It was busy and there was limited seating, so took it to go.  I ordered the ODB, which is a boneless leg and thigh on top of a waffle ith syrup and dirty sauce. There was a bit of a wait since they make waffles to order.  Despite the wait, service is friendly. The cashier was attentive and offered to answer any questions I had.  Some of the other menu items look really good, such as the dirty fries and the Up North Trip. I'll try both the next time I come around.  The chicken is nicely seasoned and not too greasy. The dirty sauce is tangy with a nice  kick to it. I had my ODB with a side of coleslaw but you can choose from potato salad and macaroni salad. My meal was a great combination of sweet and savoury!  I would come back again for my chicken-and-waffles fix!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Up North meal (3pc bone-in + waffle) $14 plus tax. Seating is limited. Food was mediocre, but I wouldn't come back again. Worth visiting? I say maybe, don't go out of your way though. I had similar expectations to Cluck Clucks and felt let down (unfair but can't be helped)   Skip this place and go feast on Japanese crepe instead lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We had the chicken and waffles and couldn't believe that they're also gluten-free (upon request)!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for gluten free fried chicken and waffles. Chicken was flavourful and crunchy and the waffle didn't fall apart like most gluten free waffles do. Absolutely delicious!! My only gripe is that I wish they had given me more maple syrup with my waffle but otherwise I am smitten"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in Kensington market. With so many different funky restaurants around, it may be easy to miss this gem.   We ordered the fried chicken with waffle for a light snack. The chicken was crisp, and the waffles were perfectly soft. Would definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"We got the ODB and macaroni salad. The chicken and waffles were great. The tangy sauce went well with the syrup and the waffles were big and fluffy. My husband enjoyed the macaroni salad. The place was small and busy."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I'm always pretty skeptical of places that try to duplicate the fried food we love so much in the south. I got the Dirty Tenders and while they were good, they left something to be desired. $10 is pricey when you literally only get tenders. Maybe some fries on the side? Nevertheless, it was pretty good for a first meal in Toronto"}
{"text":"I haven't had chicken and waffles in a long time, and Dirty Bird has rekindled my love for them.   I walked in on a starving stomach and shared their Top 3 signature menu items with my friends. The ODB was probably my favorite - The chicken was perfectly fried on top of a freshly-made waffle, drizzled in this fantastic sauce. The most surprising aspect was that it didn't even feel as greasy as I expected.   The space is small since most people seem to be getting take out. Food delivery services like Foodora runs in and out constantly. It was a weeknight, and the place was bustling with people, so if you want to get a seat, it might be tough.   I was too full to get dessert, but next time, I'm getting the PB&J Waffle. Will write an update once that's in my belly!!"}
{"text":"My Besties and I were so lucky that we unintentionally found this restaurant. We were literally walking through the Flea market trying a few of the eateries and definitely saved the best for last. When I say looks can be deceiving. The restaurant is very small. However, we arrived at a good time and was able to eat our food comfortably.   We ordered The Dirty Club which consisted of three fried chicken strips, a waffle and a side. All I can say is that chicken made you want to slap somebody. The chicken was crunchy, spicy and juicy. Just how we Southerners like it. The waffle even had a slight spicy kick.   I can't give the restaurant 5 stars because it was not clean. We used Clorox wipes to clean the counter we ate on. There was trash on the floor and trays everywhere. Maybe we had just missed the lunch rush/crowd. I'm not really sure. Thankfully, that did not stop us from giving the restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Very good Fried Chicken & Waffles. Just wish there was like a melted butter/maple syrup sauce that you could use to moisten or dip the waffle and chicken in.  The coleslaw that came with it was also just OK, and was probably sitting in that pre packaged container for a whole.  We also ordered the fries which were very tasty/firey with all those sauces, and the white sauce on top added a creamy cooling component. The fries were also cooked just right, and I could tell they were seasoned well out of the fryer.   Only negative would be the washroom situation (but that's how it is in most places in Kensington), the menu is a little confusing (chicken with a side, or chicken and waffles(are sides extra? or included?)), and the lighting inside (does not go well with black walls). 4* for good value, good flavors, and a solid Chicken & Waffles."}
{"text":"Went here on an afternoon for late lunch. We meant to go to Moo but we saw how busy it was inside here so wanted to try it. The lack of seating was a little disappointing (no seats at 2pm) and also the wait time... it took like 30min for mine to come out and another 10 for my friend who ordered right when I did. Just standing there at the cash side for that long is a little boring. Luckily for them, it was one of the best chicken n waffles we've had in town. The chicken and sauce were awesome, so we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The chicken & waffles were amazing, but the service was even better. You have to try the the dirty fries too. The food was fresh and hot. I would recommend this place to all.."}
{"text":"FOOD: 100% INCREDIBLE - so good my husband a gluten eater, couldn't even taste the difference!  The gluten free waffles were fluffy, and a soft, chewy, but with a hint of crunch texture.  Fries were on point - hand cut and crispy!  Loved the tato salad, mayo based with onions and I think capers, and the slaw was vinegar based. I LOVED the fact that EVERYTHING here was gluten free EXCEPT the mac salad and a gluten waffle BUT the french fries and chicken are 100% gluten free and have dedicated fryers ! WOOT WOOT ! Safe service, clean establishment and they asked about an allergy right away.  I am sensitive to pepper, so for me, the fries and batter for the chicken was a bit \"potent\" but so flavorful I did not mind the pepper, and it was not overpowering.  I ordered the Great White North and loved that I had THREE tenders to work with - to eat as fried chicken with ketchup (since it's rare to get fried GF chicken) and the rest with my waffles with the REGULAR maple syrup.  I did NOT get the buttered maple or ranch on my entree - personal preference!  The waffle DID has a small amount of butter in it - and the counter staff even knew this when I said no lactose - VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE COUNTER STAFF!   AWESOME SERVICE BEFORE I EVEN ENTERED ! Traveling with Celiac Disease can be tough, and it becomes more difficult when I need to try my best to avoid lactose as well - so I need to do A LOT of research before I enter an establishment so I can feel safe, at ease, and not have to ask a million questions upon arriving - JOSH ANSWERED FIVE EMAILS FROM ME BEFORE I WAS EVEN A PATRON I have Celiac Disease, as well as severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome - I do NOT eat gluten, and avoid lactose as much as I can - he answered multiple questions with enthusiasm and was even able to provide me with the amount of butter used in the waffle - which was minimal so I felt comfortable eating it (I do not have a lactose allergy, rather an intolerance).  He was SO helpful - HIGH SUGGEST A VISIT HERE FOR A SAFE AND TASTY CELIAC TREAT"}
{"text":"Read incredible reviews for this place and was inspired to venture over with my wife. We ordered the signature ODB with potato salad and the Up North Trip with potato salad. The chicken had great crisp texture and good taste. The dirty sauce was okay, nothing too special and the waffle was - a waffle. All of that together with the somewhat boring potato salad made for a 3 star dish. My wife found her chicken to be okay but a little too greasy for her liking.   Having visited Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA, this definitely wasn't the best chicken and waffles I've had - the seasoning, sauce, and sides could be more flavorful. However, that said, Dirty Bird has the best chicken and waffles I've had in the city (I've previously tried the ones at Harlem restaurant), so if you're in need of this type of food, this is your place."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised to see that this spot doesn't have a higher rating! This place is centrally located in Kensington market and a true gem. I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered the wing/waffle meal and learned that there's a delicious list of wing sauces to choose from. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken wings and the combo of sweet and salty from the sauce/syrup combo was delicious (and this is from someone who doesn't always like their food to touch). The wings were also crispy which is my favorite. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing!! When I'm craving chicken, this is the only place I will go now for my deep fried chicken goodness. Their sides are really yummy. I've had their potato salad & their coleslaw and the usual fries. Everything is really delicious my only complaint is that their sides with the 10 piece meal is not big at all! They are so small, I wish they would increase their sizing because after two to three bites, it's gone. (It's literally that small) Other than that it's a must try and absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I heard from Dirty Bird. They are committed to making their patrons very happy. That is a unique trait so the effort is very much appreciated. I will try their establishment again. Way to go Dirty Bird."}
{"text":"Service: Genuinely friendly and helpful. The service was also not that bad considering I popped in on a Sunday night after 7PM to find the place pretty busy!   Ambiance: Pretty casual. More for people who are there for takeout or a quick bite. The space isn't that big, so seating is only for a few people and there's one large table for sit-ins.  Food: Of all the proteins, I don't even like chicken that much, but I can definitely say I'm a fan. I got the 1/2 lb wings with buffalo sauce ($6) and the Dirty fries ($7) with a side of 'tato salad ($3). It was divine. Althought I was super hungry, I shared some of my food with my boyfriend, he thought it was good too! The chicken was juicy but not greasy. The fries were great, but a little too sweet. And the 'tato salad, although super small for the price was a nice way to finish it all off.   Price: I paid about $18 after tax for my entire meal. For the size of the 'tato salad, it should've at least been a little cheaper. Otherwise, I would definitely go back to try their signatures!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here at lunch on Saturday, and were delighted to find a couple of stools in this tiny, 16-person joint. (What happens to people who order and can't sit?)  My \"The ODB\" was OK. Chicken was a bit greasy. The Dirty Sauce was tasty, but a bit spicy to really enjoy the salty, sweet, spicy combo. The waffle was perfect, and their maple (or maple-flavoured?) syrup was great. The coleslaw is OK, slightly creamy, slightly sweet, but undistinguished.  My husband got The Clucker. Five meaty wing pieces tossed in salt, pepper, butter and chives (?) on a waffle. Way too much salt. Way too greasy. He asked if he could have fries instead of coleslaw or tato salad, as they are the same price on the menu... \"Sorry, no substitutions.\" If the are the same price on the menu, why not substitute?  Our conclusion: We'd come back just for a waffle."}
{"text":"I loved every single thing about this place. The food was great. I would defiantly go back. The chicken was soft and crunchy, had a kick to it. Waffles melted like butter in your mouth. I would defiantly go back. Only thing I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't make an substitutes. I didn't want coleslaw or a potato  salad and wanted fries instead, but that wasn't allowed. What you see on the menu is what you get. Unless you order separately."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo chicken bites with fries and a soda for $6.99--really good deal. The bites were probably some of the best I've ever had and the fries were great too. I'll definitely go back. I looked at some of the dishes others ordered and they looked delicious as well."}
{"text":"Came to Dirty Bird after unsuccessfully trying to go to another cash only place for so lunch. I ordered the Sticky-Icky with the regular buns (to get mini waffles as the bun it's an extra $0.95). The food came out really quickly and looked great. The taste itself was also beyond my expectations. The maple fried chicken reminded me of Korean marinated chicken and the dirty aioli was a nice touch too. As expected, it was a little heavy, but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Located in Kensington Market. We came for the chicken and waffles (duhhhhhhhhhh). The place is very small and you have to order first before you take your seat (fast food style). They will call your name when your order is ready.  We ordered the ODB which was chicken and waffle with their signature dirty bird sauce. Came with a choice of side (we chose MAC salad). Also ordered the 2 piece chicken that came with a choice of side; we chose fries. Loved how the chicken was really crispy and the flavour was spot on.   Will definitely come back when we crave some chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"First time here, and a little disappointed. The waffle did not seem like it was freshly made because it was crunchy, and fresh waffle Off the waffle maker is generally warm and fluffy. The chicken was tender but also not very warm or crunchy. A friend says it almost seems like it was left over and reheated. Her opinion was \"meh\" The Mac salad seemed like it was store bought. Definitely nothing fancy and not worth $15. Glad we got one to share, would've been disappointed if we got 2!"}
{"text":"For my second time to The Dirty Bird, I ordered the ODB, the Original Dirty Bird, with coleslaw, fries and a Nestea iced tea. Total cost including tax was $22.04. It was interesting reading after I googled on the origins of chicken and waffles.  ODB - Is one piece of deep fried, deboned chicken thigh and leg served on a fresh made waffle. Delicious piece of moist chicken with a crispy skin, not greasy. Dirty sauce on top of chicken. Sauce tasted like Thai sweet chili sauce, which I like.   Waffle - Made to order and was served with maple flavoured syrup. Light and fluffy like other reviewers said.  Coleslaw - Made from purple cabbage. Not creamy enough for me.  Fries - Came with skin on. They were golden brown and crunchy :-) Similar to NY Fries. Sprinkled with a bit too much salt for my liking :-(  The Dirty Bird is on my rotating list of eateries to eat at in the Kensington Market area. I'm there for the chicken!  My rating - 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Making a Mobb Deep song reference on the menu (\"Up North Trip\") is impressive enough. However, The Dirty Bird's street cred comes from the food itself.  A chicken & waffle place is a perfect fit for Kensington Market. The area is a perfect microcosm of the cultural melting-pot that is Toronto. Being able to find this recently iconic American dish in the area only makes sense.   The Dirty Bird definitely gets an A for branding. Their menu items are all creatively named and marketing themselves as \"Northern fried chicken\" is pretty genius in my book.  As far as the fried chicken goes, it's really good. I ordered the ODB which included boneless thigh & leg. Usually I opt for the bone-in chicken, but the boneless chicken at The Dirty Bird was surprisingly moist and flavorful. Without bones, it was also very easy to eat without making too much of a mess.  The accompanying Dirty Sauce was nice, although I was looking for a bit more tang and heat. The coleslaw was just okay. Overall, solid fried chicken, but the Stockyards' version with their chili maple syrup slightly edges out The Dirty Bird. With that said, I would still come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The food is quite average and they dont even serve a glass of water. I would not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Despite my honest review below, Brian, the owner, reached out and displayed such class and pride in his establishment that I've decided to give it another try (on them, no less) and hope to update my review again.  Hopefully I visited on an off day.  Original review to follow:  I was surprised.  First impression is the place was a mess, dirty trays of half eaten food everywhere, but I think that's part of their \"dirty bird\" look, so I can't fault them on that but it is disgusting when you're trying to eat.  The food was shockingly poor.  I'd heard so much about this place and I'm a big fan of the Stockyards, but I can admit their waffles are pretty wack so I was hearing this might be an upgrade.  Well, their waffles are better than Stockyards' waffles, true.  And maybe their sauce is too... it probably is.  But everything else was way worse.    The chicken was almost inedible.  It's shocking, yes.  But it was the fattiest piece of chicken I ever hope to eat, covered in an a batter that would be tasteless if not for the excessive amount of supermarket seasoning salt.  It's ridiculous to pay money for fried chicken that tastes like this.  The fries are single-fried, utterly unremarkable in flavour and texture except for, get this, they're sprinkled with the exact same seasoning salt that they've afflicted the chicken with!  It's ridiculous!  Two dishes tasting the same and both tasting like bad seasoning salt.    I have never had fried chicken this poor from a well reviewed place.  We didn't finish the chicken or the fries.  We ate the waffles and sauce.  Would never do again and if you're used to Stockyards, stick to it!"}
{"text":"Got their signature ODB and dirty fries. I love their chicken and waffle. Waffle is perfectly done. Chicken is super crispy/crunchy exterior and moist interior with the perfect amount of sauce and a teeny tiny tad of spice but you can always kick it up a notch with their honey mustard hot sauce on the side. I devoured that thing so quick.   I didn't enjoy the fries though. I mean first few bites were good but afterwards I was like \"what am I eating?\" I think I only thought it was good because I was so hungry. I also didn't like their coleslaw.. It was tasteless and wasn't fresh (imo).   Nonetheless, I'd return for the chicken & waffles!"}
{"text":"The \"dirty bird\" is right... Three of us had the ODB and two had the Bird-gur and the ones who had the larger pieces of chicken (ODB) had the poops and the other two had a queasy stomach. It was delicious but damn if it didn't make us ALL sick."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's just me, but I think I'm over the chicken and waffle fad that has dominated most Toronto menus the past year and a half.  I thought i would give this specialized chicken and waffle place a try to see if they can rekindle any sparks I once had.    I had the Up North option and was not a fan.  There just didn't seem like there was any synergy between the chicken and waffle.  Both individually were done properly, but the meal also felt like eating two different individual parts.  I had a taste of the ODB, which was much better.  The hot sauce of it really worked to blend two different textures together.  If you come here, go for the ODB.  But overall, I think the Stockyards serve the best C&W in the city."}
{"text":"Honestly... I really had high hopes. I heard about this place and wanted to try it, plus it doesn't take much convincing with my husband when it comes to fried chicken.  He ordered the OBD meal and I got the three pieces with 1 side. $15 for his meal is not worth it. Yes it's boneless but it seems so little next to mine which was only $10. The chicken itself was crispy, and the meat was moist. The chicken lacked flavour tho. It was very bland. I'm not a ketchup person but for this I needed something. The fries were good but they got cold really fast. Dave got a very very small potato salad with his meal and he described it as basic. He actually barely touched it and threw out the rest.   The wait is ridiculous for what seems to be a fast food spot. We were there from ordering to getting the meal for close to 20 mins... not worth the wait.   The guys working there are friendly. You just have to be patient about the wait."}
{"text":"I got the odb with side of potato salad. Everything was just average and more of a gimmicky food. I don't see people becoming regulars here or even coming in for a weekday lunch. This is more of a food fest or CNE thing.  Price wise $15 for waffles and fried chicken is pretty steep for what you are getting. Yeah you can come in and try it once, that's what i did but don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Solid place to eat at. They got good chicken. Good Waffles. What more can you ask for. Also the syrup they leave out is solid"}
{"text":"A less busy location compared to their main one at Kensington market. I would say service is better here and less people!   Their ODB is the best - the waffles are light, crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside. The boneless chicken is super crispy however if I was to be critical, the meat was a little bit dry. However, with the delicious sauce on top and everything else, I still loved it. The spicy-ish sauce paired well with the syrup and the chicken. It came with a side of macaroni, which was average. It seemed like they prepacked them and put it in the fridge so it was very cold and clumped up. I didn't care much for this side as I came here for the chicken&waffle. Regardless, I would definitely come back! A little pricey though, $15."}
{"text":"My first time crying chicken and waffles and I have to say it did NOT disappoint!  The waffles were light and fluffy and the chicken was super moist and crispy on the outside, definitely one of the best fried chicken i've ever had. I didn't give it a five because of the lack of seating and even when u do find a seat, it's a pretty small area"}
{"text":"I'm from the south and we are very serious about our chicken and waffles! These were pretty good- not the best I've ever had but I liked that they had many variations. The staff was great and gave me some recommendations for things to do around Kensington market. Great stop for lunch overall!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try fried chicken and waffles, but I couldn't say that it was super satisfying. 3.5/5 in total for taste, but it is worth the wait.   I believe this place really has some potential if some parts improve.   We went there in a large group, around 8 people. The menu pretty much says it all, and I ordered the Dirty Club after reviewing many yelp reviews. Each of us waited for 10-15 minutes. We initially did not have a place to eat, but once we all got our food the table in the middle was empty and we crowded there. I don't mind eating while I stand, but the place needs more seats for sure.   I was suspicious of the waffle sandwich that's worth $15, but once I got it I knew it was totally worth it. It was HUGE. I absolutely loved the fried chicken and the beef bacon inside. Bother were juicy and freshly done. It was the biggest boneless thigh & leg I've ever seen in my life, and the skin was so CRISPY. The first bite was full of oily meat and it felt fantastic. But as I went on, I felt bored. There was only the taste of meat, oil and nothing else. I tried putting on lots of syrup, but the flavor seemed to disappear each time I bite it. I feel that it needs some kind of sauce or marination to get the \"omg\" feel. I also think that the Dirty Club is in a larger portion than the ODB in comparing the price. The portions of the sides were also tiny, don't really recommend them if they are not included in the meal you want.    Next up the waffle. The waffles I had were supper crispy, which was the way I like them. However, I noticed that the waffles did not have enough batter inside. So they were pretty much empty in the middle. They also hurt my hard palate (the flesh above the tongue), since they were dry and crunchy...I tried the waffle of an ODB's and they were softer, honestly hoped I had the thin but fluffy than the thick but empty, even though I like crispy waffles.   I don't know if it was only me or does every Dirty Club gets waffles with less batter than the ODB?"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Food was soooo yummy and our family filled up every single seat! Great flavors, quality food, awesome service! The dirty fries and ODB are a must!!"}
{"text":"This is a long over due updated review. I actually gave them a chance again last year and ordered the OTB and it was delicious (I dined in). I remember the chicken was crispy and juicy!   Yesterday we ordered take out , 3 pieces of chicken with fries and it was pretty tasty even though it wasn't fresh and hot (we drove for about an hour).  The fries looked quite burnt but for some reason it was still good and addictive and I couldn't stop eating them!  So they must be doing something right !  When there's a chance to dine in again I'll definitely go back and next time will try their dessert as well."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has high ratings..I've heard about chicken and waffles and had to try it so this was my go to experience and it was terrible. The staff were great for helping me pick out what to order as a first timer but the whole restaurant itself was extremely lacking in the sanitation department. I ordered the ODB and after eating, my stomach started aching so I went to use the washroom. There was no sign to not go into the washroom because as I stepped in, there was a big pile of puke in the sink with flies flying around it and that itself made me nauseous on top of my stomach ache. I didn't finish eating after that and I don't plan to go back to this place, at least not this location."}
{"text":"It's the day after and I still feel Dirty, Dirty Bird that is, and by feel Dirty, I mean I could go for another helping of delcious boneless fried chicken proudly mounted atop a freshly made waffle coated in special sauces, syrup and hot sauce!  Mouth fills with drool...  I was in the Kensington market area yesterday to see a man about a suit and somehow on the trip back to my car, I saw a sandwich board and blacked out. Next thing I knew I was nose deep in a plate of fried chicken known as the ODB, licking my fingers (and pretty much anything else my chicken grease got on - I apologize to the couple next to me for my actions).  On yelp this spot is listed as hot and new, and for that to happen you gotta have a fresh, tasty product that is driving the yelpers in your area wild. The DB is doing all of these things.  I'm always kinda greedy when it comes to fried chicken so when I heard there was only one piece of chicken included I almost ordered a second. No way! Thank goodness I didn't. The chicken included was amazing and almost too much, however it was the perfect ratio of Chicken to Waffles!  I hope they don't change a thing, I love this place, I'll be back many times this summer!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Had the Up North Trip (3pc bone-in, waffle, buttered Maple with mac salad, slaw or 'tato salad) for aroound $16.   Chicken was average. Unseasoned thick batter and it was quite greasy. Looking at the Yelp photos, seems like the pieces of bone-in chicken are variable. Today we had 2 drumsticks and 1 thigh, but I see that people have had 2 thighs and 1 drumstick before.  Waffle also quite average. Not crispy. The maple syrup is already poured onto your waffle.  Mac salad was underwhelming and really was a bland macaroni concoction.  I prefer Cluck Clucks near St. Lawrence Market although the wait time there can be quite long as they make the orders one by one."}
{"text":"Been to Dirty Bird twice now.  Love the fried chicken and the chicken Waffle.  Place is quite small as with all the food joints in Kensington Market.  The size of the food is quite big as well. Price is decent.  I did not like the dirty fries and the slaw they serve.  Other than that this place is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Food Good fried chicken and fluffy waffles, it also came with a nice red cabbage slaw.  The chicken had a nice deep golden brown to it, had a nice crunch and its steaming hot. By far the best coleslaw ive had!!   Space The dinning area was nice and clean had all the utensils needed, extra napkins, extra syrup"}
{"text":"A small place but the chicken and waffles are definitely great!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago with a group of friends (5 of us) for lunch around 12pm. The place had a few tables already waiting for their food to be made and served. It didn't look too bad so we decided to head in and get some nice chicken and waffles. This is my FIRST EVER chicken and waffles experience! Hurray to the exposure!  Service was fine, polite and patient and you just walk up to their partial kitchen area to order. I got The Big Dirty order and then sat down and waited...and waited...and waited...my friends ALL waited for quite some time for the food...at least a good 30-40 min. They were clearly quite behind orders and quite \"busy\" at that point, we concluded. If it wasn't for the food, this review would have been a 3 instead. I understand making food and prepping takes time but is under 30 min not possible for chicken and waffles? I'm actually not sure which is why I throw this question out there.  In any case, the timing of the orders was slightly off. One of my friends got their order first and was ALMOST done eating before the rest of the orders came...that's 1/5 orders! It was a huuuge tease waiting for our food while watching my friend eat his...when all the food was out, it honestly tasted great. The maple syrup with the chicken and waffles was perfect. The waffle was made just right; light, soft and crispy around the edges. The chicken was tender and moist enough. I even tried the hot sauce on it and that worked very well too! But then again if you like spicy, hot sauce on anything tastes great/even better haha! The slaw was unfortunately small but if you ordered the side of fries instead it was a good portion.  Overall, not a bad place at all for some chicken and waffles. I would come back just to see if the wait time is the same, comparing obviously under the same case with a few tables waiting already. But who knows, could be the one off, could be not. I'll find out soon enough!"}
{"text":"We had dirty club and odb and It was so fresh delicious. The place the place was small but clean and the service was fast. Kudos to you guys! We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Location/Service Right in the heart of Kensington Market. Street and a small lot of car parking is available. Also readily accessible via TTC.  Restaurant is relatively small with high bar tables. Staff were friendly and nice and fast with the order.   Food The Dirty Bird'ger. Essentially a chicken waffle in a sandwich style. Mini waffles are used and it's filled with a boneless chicken thigh topped with lettuce, tomato and dirty sauce. The sauce is what makes this amazingly good, especially for the chicken as thighs can get pretty dry. We also added in the Dirty Fries, which goes well with the dirty sauce or ketchup. Nice compliment meal between the two.   The ODB. similar to the burger, but it's in a larger portion and an actual chicken waffle style and not a sandwich. Again, the dirty sauce gives a kick (cause it's a little spicy) to the meat and the maple makes the waffle extra tasty.    Overall a very nice first visit and it's good for people dropping by for a quick meal or if you're adventurous to share."}
{"text":"Maybe im just spoiled coming from where im from? The dirty bird was just ok. I actually could have went to KFC or Popeyes and have called it a day. At the crib for 15 to 20 buck you could literally feed a family with like 20 pieces with sides. Here it will get you enough for 1 person. 15 bucks for 3 pieces of chicken..... (shakes head)  We ordered the 3 piece and shared it. When we walked up to the counter we noticed an entire rack of chicken that looks like it had been cooked. Im hoping they dont par cook the food then recook it upon order that would be sinful.  We weren't in the mood for waffles but we did want chicken. The chicken was not as crispity crunchity as i expected. It was seasoned ok but it was something very sweet that was in the dish. The fries were ok..almost over cook but acceptable none the less.  The Dirty Bird is not bad at all, If you have had really good like southern fried chicken you would not rant and rave over it. If youve been eating sub-par chicken then this is your \"ish\" i swear!"}
{"text":"Having tried the seemingly odd combo of Chicken and Waffles with syrup and enjoyed it this place disappointed. I tried the the Great White North version on a whim. This comes with a boneless fried chicken on a waffle, buttered maple and a salad.  First of the chicken wasn't fried to order as they just plucked it from a hot tray and topped it with the sauces (maybe the whole pieces are fried to order). Hmm the waning sign started from the get go as the flimsy plastic fork and knife that was provided wouldn't even cut through the pieces. After a few tries I have up and picked the piece of chicken by hand. First bite was a thick batter that had dried out from sitting under the hot plate. I gave it a second and guess what this piece was all batter! Can happen I suppose so I tried the next piece while this piece of batter had chicken in it was all dried out. A poor attempt at fried chicken. The side of mac slaw was forgettable as well. I don't think I will revisit this spot as there is a chain offering of fried chicken nearby that fares a lot better."}
{"text":"A great new spot in the heart of Kensington. Along with neighbours like 7 Lives, Rasta Pasta and Cold Tea, Dirty Bird is a novelty sure to please someone looking for something other than KFC when it comes to fried chicken. I had a ODB. Sourcing their birds from neighbours like Sanagans means the meat is never frozen and is from farms rather than factories and the taste does bear that out. The meat was not tough, overcooked and dry, rather it was moist and delicious with a light coating that was crunchy and yummy-good. The waffle was freshly made so melted in your mouth. And it does go well with the chicken. The sauce is sublime as well. They take credit cards and the place looks spotless and well cared for. Props to the creators, you've done the market a favour."}
{"text":"They mainly ran out of everything !! Smh but I got the dirty fries and it's was sooooooo goooooddd visiting from the states (Florida) my sister had chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"Wins: breaded chicken is crispy and juicy, great waffles  Things that could use improvement: Mac & cheese side tasted bland, better customer service during understandably busy/stressful brunch hours"}
{"text":"As a long-time fan of the savoury and sweet combo, it is needless to say that chicken & waffles is an ideal combo for me. I've always wanted to try the dirty bird location in kensington but I'm rarely in the neighbourhood, so I was super excited to see this place open in a more convenient location for me.  The space is large, clean and modern. Service was also fast and friendly.  I ordered the signature ODB for $15. Admittedly I was prepared for this place to be overhyped and at $15, the ODB had a high bar to live up to. Much to my pleasant surprise, my expectations were met and surpassed!  Let's start with the waffle. Super fluffy, and not at all doughy or dense. Perfect hint of sweetness that doesn't need syrup, but is enhanced by it. The chicken, crisp on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. Best of all, the chicken is boneless so you can focus on enjoying every bite of chicken + waffle without having to pry the meat from its bones or get messy. Now the signature sauce. Great balance of sweet, savoury and spicy. Admittedly, I didn't expect the spice but found it delicious!  The only drawback that prevents this from being a 5 star review is the side that comes with it. I got the potato salad. Portion was small and the salad quite frankly was a bit bland. Not sure if other sides are better."}
{"text":"I LOVE fried chicken and waffles so when I passed by this place I had try it out. I got the ODB ($15). The fried chicken was excellent - well-seasoned, good breading to chicken ratio, moist-chicken. The waffle was fine. I liked the sauce. But you know what, I think the sauce (which is slightly spicy) ruined it for me because it really didn't work with the waffle and the buttered maple. And as a result, the fried chicken didn't work with the waffle. The whole thing just felt... disjointed. And this is not coming from someone who doesn't understand fried chicken and waffles, it's a dish I love and have enjoyed elsewhere.  I will happily recommend fried chicken lovers go there for the fried chicken. But I don't think I would get the chicken and waffle options again.   By the way, this place is pretty small. There's basically one medium-sized table in the middle and a long counter along a wall. If you want to eat in, there's a chance you might not get a seat and if you do, expect to be cramped. Service is a little slow (I saw four waffle makers, only three of which were in use, and not constantly, either, despite the line)"}
{"text":"After this being only my second time trying chicken and waffles - both times at different locations, I can say I'm not really a fan of the pairing. I find the waffles to be too heavy - maybe if they were less fluffy and soft, but thinner and crunchier than the chicken, that would be more ideal for me. The chicken was decent. I wouldn't say it had much flavour attached, so thankfully there were dipping sauces to accompany the meal. Will say I thought it was kind of rude that the cashier was on his phone before I ordered. Took a good minute for him to acknowledge that I wanted to order. In that time, the cook just walked back into the restaurant from outside and was able to make the ODB's. Wait took about 15 mins."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Chicken, not so great waffles. Overall a good experience. The sides and syrup were great to go along with a comolete meal. Overall pretty satisfied.  One thing to also mention it is pretty overpriced. No where to sit but you pay sit down restaurant prices."}
{"text":"I had the two piece meal - leg / thigh and fries.  The chicken was juicy and though I smothered it in pepper sauce it was really tasty. The fries were luke warm and that is the only complaint I had.  Yes I had to wait for a seat but big deal. It's small and new so to be expected.  Are there better fried chicken places out there? Maybe but this place is really good and I'd come back.  Recommend"}
{"text":"Overpriced!  Came here on a weekday afternoon at 3. Service is good and friendly, but the food took pretty long to come especially considering there was no order in front of us!  Cool décor, but barely any legit seating. Most of it is  bar stools.   First we ordered the ODB. The waffle is to die for! Super fluffy, with a nice crisp edge. If I could I would just order this waffle. The chicken is pretty good, flavourful and crunchy. However the meat is on the dry side and the sauce is overly sweet.  We also ordered dirty fries. They were alright. The fries themselves were amazing!! But again, I didn't like how sweet the sauce was.   Honestly, I would have given this place a higher rating but it's too damn expensive. Like almost $30 for fries and chicken and waffles?? At a place in Kensington?? Uhm no."}
{"text":"Ouuu so good though! I got the ODB ($15), a little pricey but Halal chicken & waffles are so worth it, everything was hot and fresh, portion is definitely large, I usually like to share with someone then get something else since we're in Kensington Market and all. The sauce they put on top is on point, if you want put a little hot sauce and drown it in syrup and omg party in my mouth!!!! Hot sauce and syrup is located on each table, the ODB comes with \"Dirty Sauce\" which is a flavourful red syrup sauce, kind of sweet and a little savoury at the same time   The only thing was the place is always a bit on the dirty side, tables are super super sticky but its more of an eat and run kind of place not dine-in, they should definitely try to fix their table game though, no one likes their shirts sticking to the table   Next up is \"Cluck Clucks\" which is supposed to not only be as good as the dirty bird but also has a jalapeno & cheddar waffle base and a chicken+waffle+taco?!! I love TO"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken, I love waffles, I love maple syrup.  So naturally I love the 3 of these things together on one hot steamy mess of a meal.  I have fairly high expectations for Chicken and Waffles having eaten at some of America's finest like Roscoe's and Gussie's, so I came in here expecting a lot.  I want to start off by saying the place looked dope!  I felt like I was in a store selling high end kicks or a hip hop clothing store in NYC.  I was really feeling the way the kitchen looked along with the seating area.  Man, even the little hooks to hang your bag on the tables made my girl get all giddy and excited.  The prices are very reasonable and the menu is pretty extensive.  I would prefer more options for Chicken and Waffles though, as those seemed limited for some reason.  Like what if I wanted 1 piece bone in and half a waffle cuz I just drank a 40oz and feel a bit bloated knowmsayin?  Overall the service was aight and it did take a mighty minute to get my meal (waited about 15-20 mins for my triple bone in and waffle).  The taste though was on point, my chicken was as crispy as your toes hitting the sand on a hot summers day.  The syrup they have on the table, is some high end business too.  Dat waffle tho, could use a bit more crunch too it.  As soon as I hit it with some Maple Sizzurp, that thing got mad soggy 0-100 real quick.  All good, I ate it up anyway!"}
{"text":"Be aware this is a dine & dash kinda place! Not in the sense of not paying for food but the place is extremely small and can get packed REAL quick. Were playing 90's rap/hip-hop & R&B which the staff were grooving too...brings back the memories!....Back to the food....the chicken was quite moist, fried quite well and batter not soggy at all. The waffles were made on the spot and extremely complimentary to the chicken. Went quite well together! My girlfriend has never tried chicken & waffles and she loved it! I am NOT a big fan of salty/sweet together so I got the chicken club sandwich. Mmmm! Would recommend but be prepared to eat quick and eat standing!! Enjoy folks!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something before I start the review.  I rarely eat meat , I only eat vegetables and seafood.  I try to avoid eating meat if it's not necessary or if it's not tempting enough! Haha!  Anyway, I broke my rule today.   We ordered THE UP NORTH TRIP ($14).  It came with 3 pieces of bone-in crispy chicken on a giant fluffy waffle!  We chose TATO SALAD for the side dish, instead of coleslaw.  We weren't disappointed with any of those and I ate the chicken (--\")  I actually wanted to have a tiny bite from my husband's chicken.  I just wanted to see how its taste.   However I couldn't resist how crispy the chicken skin was and how tender of the meat was.  I almost fought with my husband because I tried to steal the chicken skin!  :D very funny right!?    Anyway, we didn't order the dirty sauce this time because I didn't have enough time to check it well on Yelp.  I only roughly read about it in the beginning.  Now I know that many people said that the \"dirty sauce\" was to die for.  So we'll go for it next time.   P.S. Let me give the credit to the register staff too.  He was very friendly and attentive.  He didn't seem to get tired when new customers came and didn't know what to order.  He was informative and helped each of them out.  Cheers!   Food : 4 - so crispy!!!! Yum!!! Service : 5 - they have one nice staff for sure :) Place : 2.5 - very small. When it's busy, no where to sit or wait Price : 4 - reasonable price Promotion : 3.5 - they should add on something to make it more exciting"}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles ive ever had .. huge portions.. great for people into IF .. the syrup was perfect and the staff is super friendly.. i only wish this location was bigger as it is a little cramped especially when its busy.. other then that, amazing chicken.."}
{"text":"Good Fried Chicken, though i found it on the greasy side, maybe their oil isn't hot enough. Ordered through just eat and the delivery was on time and the food was pretty good, i've been on this Fried chicken sandwich kick for a few weeks now and finally go around to trying this place. It was tasty, crispy and a little well done, which is fine with me, though theri batter could use a bit more kick to it, it was for the most part flavourless.   Love the julienne  fries, sadly they were a bit cold and soggy by the time they arrived. Lucky the chicken wasn't, the sandwich had a nice fresh bun, well dressed and it was a good size. That being said i think PG Clucks has the edge on these guys, bigger portions, and better chicken, not as greasy and their batter is really, really, tasty. I'd still likely order from here again as my back up to PG Clucks."}
{"text":"Heard all the rave about this place.  Had the opportunity to do lunch with a friend there.  Its my first foray into chicken and waffles but won't be my last.  Loved the taste of the breading on the chicken alone, the maple syrup only added to it.  I polished my plate in a heart beat.  My friend couldn't finish his - found it too rich and needed to do it in the comfort of his home ;)  I got there at opening so everything was fresh to order.  Bottled FANTA GRAPE . . aw you had me at that!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food, but slow service.   We stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch as it was rated as \"the place to be\" for chicken & waffles. I got the signature dish, and it was tasty. The chicken wasn't too oily and the sauce they use on top of the chicken was good too.   My fiancé got the honey garlic wings - 1lb. They screwed up that order and only have us half a pound, so I had to go back to ask for the other half... At which point they claimed I paid for only half. Luckily I had my receipt with me, but there wasn't too much back and forth before they agreed they made a mistake.   Anyways, this took another 20 minutes to make, and there was no compensation. Not happy at all! The next day I found out they recieved a couple infractions from DineSafe... So yeah, I won't be going back.   Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend. The service is subpar, it's fairly pricey, and the infractions got me worried!"}
{"text":"I'm a fried chicken fiend. I love crispy, tender fried chicken. I wasn't wild about the waffle and syrup thing, though. I tend to like things more savoury than sweet, so I stuck with a 6 pcs take away with a side of coleslaw and potato salad. Perhaps this is where I went wrong; not having the hot sauce and syrup. But I really don't like all that stuff on my fried chicken and I think that may be what makes Dirty Bird Chicken taste so good. Maybe I missed the point.   The chicken was wonderful from a texture standpoint, but definitely on the bland side. I wish there would have been more of a zing or something distinguishing it flavour wise from just the taste of chicken. The potato salad was much the same. Great creamy texture and the addition of little green peas was a nice contrast, but it just flopped on the taste. Coleslaw was meh.  The sides were also hideously small. For over $21 for the meal I didn't feel that I got my money's worth.  Nothing was bad. It just wasn't as tasty as I was expecting. Again, maybe I missed the point."}
{"text":"I was craving fried chicken and I ordered this from foodora The food came fast but unfortunately, the thigh piece was raw The taste of the chicken was forgettable  It was pricey and I don't believe it was worth the money. The fries was okay, normal fries Overall, 2 stars for the lack of attention and dull taste"}
{"text":"I'll lean towards a 3.5, only because the service was efficient and the location was spotless.  Having tried other chicken & waffle offerings, I decided to go with the ODB. I wish there had been more sauce, to start. I found while the chicken came out extremely hot (complete with steam emerging when I cut into it), the actual chicken inside was underseasoned and not as moist as I would've expected. Maybe it's because my piece wasn't bone-in, which would've assisted the moisture a bit. To be fair, the ODB is known to be boneless, but I feel it's not a great representation of fried chicken if some dishes are more moist than others.  The side I chose, the potato salad, was pretty tasty. The waffle was fine, but not sweet enough to contrast with the salt of the fried chicken.  If you're already in Kensington and hungry, definitely check it out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go again.  Further to the owner's comment below, I'd like to note that I have not received a message; if that changes, I'll update here."}
{"text":"I feel conflicted about this review because I feel like Dirty Bird should be great. My friends have said it's great and when I walked in and looked around, my mouth was watering. I just didn't leave feeling particularly wowed.  I ordered the signature Up North Trip ($14) with three pieces of bone-in chicken, waffle, and potato salad (coleslaw was the alternate option). It's a lot of food. If you want to be full, this will do it. For a downtown location, I'm not mad about the price. It seems on par.   The waffles could have been cooked a little longer for a little more colour. They were a bit soft for my liking. I prefer waffles that have a bit more of a crunch to them.   The chicken was just average. It's deep fried, but it's done in a very ordinary way. I feel like it's just missing something, like more batter, crispier, seasoning. It just felt a little bare bone.   The limited seating is an issue, but I also wouldn't recommend take out unless you intend on bringing it somewhere you can transfer the food to a plate. This isn't Dirty Bird's fault. The meal itself just doesn't lend well to the takeout format. To their credit, the takeout box is a very sturdy cardboard box that is perfectly sized to fit everything. I'm positive eating it in the restaurant with enough space to spread the syrup over everythingggg would've upped the enjoyment factor.  I feel like I should visit again and try another one of their signatures and their dirty fries before I solidify my opinion. For now, it gets an A-OK."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Kensington Market. We both ordered the Dirty Club. Very tasty and comforting. I'm a huge fan of this kind of food. Waffles and chicken work together flawlessly. The restaurant is small and only has some high tables to sit at. I wasn't a fan of the bar stools used. Very uncomfortable. Otherwise it was great! I might run into the other location to see if it's any better."}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite restaurant. It was so good we ate here both lunch and dinner on same day! I first had the ODB and it was really tasty! The chicken itself is great, crispy and spicy outside and very tender and juicy inside. The sauce was im not sure what it is but the taste was very playful in my mouth, I'm not really fond of hot sauces but this one was amazing. The waffle and syrup are so good. I can not even imagine how I liked chicken and waffle on the same plate. For dinner I had the clucker, maple garlic sauce. Sauce was good but it did not shout as much flavors as ODB.   I wish they had more sauces and I want garlic parmesan chicken please!!!  Will definitely come back every time I am around the area."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I love fried chicken. My boyfriend had the Dirty Bird'ger and I had the ODB. I really, really enjoyed my lunch. The chicken was juicy, perfectly fried and boneless. As people have mentioned, the ODB comes with a waffle with syrup, fried chicken on top with a special sauce (that I loved) and 'tato salad or slaw on the side. I HATE PEAS and their potato salad has peas, still loved it. I also had a bottle of Coke on the side - perfect meal. I legit ate the whole thing and I am not a big person. My waffle could have been less crispy on the edges, that's my only criticism.   Cost-wise, you're not looking at a KFC or Popeyes here people - this is a stand alone entrepreneurial enterprise. If you want cheap fried chicken go the fast-food route. Also, this is Toronto. We have hardly any good fried chicken places downtown for reasonable $$. My ODB for $15 was well worth it to me because I actually WATCHED them make my meal and fry up the chicken.   I will definitely be back and frequently!"}
{"text":"Decent little place. It is bit on the more expensive side when all you get is not a lot of chicken and waffle. It is cheaper than other establishments that make his dish though."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmyyyyyyyyy *commences salivating* It's halal, which is surprising and a bonus. I don't keep halal, but it's nice to know it is, and also, that means they don't use any pork, which is important to me, but I can still eat bacon (beef bacon), which is fantastic. It's yummy.   It's not cheap, but it's pretty average for fried chicken and waffles, in terms of pricing. The menu is pretty awesome, with a lot of great, artery-clogging selections.  The people who work there are nice, too.   I had the club sandwich and IT. WAS. DELICIOUS.   Definitely go."}
{"text":"Finally got to try chicken and waffles at the dirty bird! I decided to try this because of the buzz surrounding this place. I had low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised!  Atmosphere 3/5 - Casual seating  - Small place - can get crowded sometimes and the seats are limited  - They have purse/coat hangers at the bottom of the tables - clever!  - Other reviews commented about the lack of cleanliness but it's actually not too bad!  - The kitchen at the back looks kinda dirty tho   Service 4/5 - The person taking our order was polite and friendly - We asked for wifi but apparently it's for staff only  Food 5/5 - ODB ($15) - this is their most popular dish. Overall it was good but the chicken was drier than the burger. They added maple syrup to the waffles which I thought made it too sweet because the sauce on top was already really flavourful and delicious. The macaroni salad was refreshing and paired well with the heavy flavours of the chicken and waffles - The dirty bird'ger ($7) - I highly recommend getting this!! It was sooo good. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce in the burger was delicious!!!! The waffles were light and fluffy.   I hope to come back soon and try their other signatures dishes!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why some people give 4 stars instead of 5...maybe I am just generous or maybe Im not cheap with my stars...they are Unlimited right?  Gulp... I hope so.  Even if they were not Unlimited I would give this place a SOLID 5 STAR rating.  I came here with a group of friends after we finished a 3 hour workout so we were definitely Starving!  Yes yes spare me the \"you ate fried chicken after a workout?\" judgement and I can tell you that \"HELL YES WE ATE FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES AFTER A WORKOUT!!\"    We all ordered the ODB and I think one of my buddies ordered the Great White North....it was all a blur because once that Chicken and Waffle touched our lips it was over.  We all went from a chatty group to a silent movie giving each other stares of approval and thumbs up to the one buddy who suggested we devour chicken and waffles after our killer workout.  Im telling you that those waffles definitely helped our GAINZ!    Perhaps the best part about this experience is while we were eating they turned on some tunes and T Pain and Akon were bumpin in the place!!!  Needless to say.... I will be back !!! Ssoo sooo dirty dirty delicious!  A Cluckin good time I tell u!  Make sure u Waffle on by! (insert pun here)"}
{"text":"We had just eaten dinner but we popped in only for some frozen yogurt at the huge self serve machines at the back.  They had 4 sets of machines with 2 flavors each with 3 handles the ones in the middle being for a twist of those 2 flavors at each machine.    The toppings they had were plentiful and while the cups are huge you only fill what you want and pay for it by mass.  From what I saw they don't tare weight the container so you're paying for that too it seems.    The air smells of freshly ironed waffles and while I didn't want to eat chicken again (that's what we just had) and only wanted dessert the place wasn't that busy so we were able to get seating at the high top big table.  I can't say I'll have the chicken and waffles here because I'm not really a believer in that but I don't mind the froyo at all."}
{"text":"Simply impressive fried chicken for a northern establishment. I've been to many places in Ontario for fried chicken and none of them match this place's take on their straight up old school fried chicken. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I was literally blown away by how good the chicken was. Seriously some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffle was sort of whatever, I wouldn't even get it next time. Just tasted like regular doughy waffle. Similarly, the sides were kind of bland. That chicken though!! The line was also super long and we had to sit outside because no seats were available, but the chicken was worth it."}
{"text":"Between the three of us,  there were 9 pieces of chicken in our order,  not a single piece of white meat in the lot.  Chicken: meh. Fries: yecch.  Coleslaw: insipidly bland.  Waffles OK,  but how could you mess up Waffles?"}
{"text":"Did I enjoy my fried chicken here? Yes.  Would I come again? Yes but don't think it will be my first choice if I ever crave fried chicken.  There are always a long line up and their juicy southern style fried chicken rightly justify that line up. Price is reasonable - $7 for 2 good size piece of drum and thigh + a side. The sides are small but were all a good balance with the chicken.   I don't know if it's just me but I definitely can taste celery on the batter. Perhaps it's a celery salt? And after mentioning that, my two dining companion cannot untaste it either. Is this their subtle way to make us kids eat veggies? Bravo, Dirty Bird. Bravo"}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE: The staff that I spoke with wasn't very helpful when I asked what would they recommend for first-comers. He just said the name of the order and didn't explain about the order.   FOOD: I ordered the ODB. The portion was worth the cost. The Waffle separately was very crisp and delicious. Fried Chicken was of course so good and crispy. I loved the syrup, not too sweet and it came with their dirty sauce. All those three together was such a good mixture. My mouth was just exploding with different tastes and textures all at once  I would highly recommend this place for first-comers. And when I come back to Canada and visit Kensington Market, I would consider coming here."}
{"text":"Being a fan of fried chicken..you already know I had to find myself a good spot.  Kensington is known for its food and art.   Came across Dirty Bird on instagram (I run a food blog) and had to come check them out in person! The food and service was"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. It's a quaint little restaurant in the Kensington Market area of Toronto. It's hard to miss as there's a sign facing the street that says chicken + waffles that pedestrians can see walking towards the restaurant from either way. It is quite small.. like maybe 10-15 people will put them at max capacity. I did however notice a lot of people took theirs to go.   The menu is limited but I appreciated that seeing that they chose to stick to their specialities. Fried chicken and waffles. I ordered the 'ODB' which consisted of a Belgian waffle, a fried chicken thigh, Macaroni or Potato salad, and their 'Dirty Bastard' BBQ Hot sauce. All this was for $15CAD and if you wanted real maple syrup it was an extra $2CAD. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and fried leaving the inside mouth watering juicy. OMG it was sooo good. The waffle was well... a waffle. The BBQ sauce was also extra delicious. And the portion was well worth the cost. My friend and I shared and we both felt full.   With my experience I'm actually surprised this place is not rated higher."}
{"text":"I had the Dirty Club. I thought it was decent.   Since The Dirty Bird and the restaurant next door are connected by a hallway, I could smell the fish coming from the other restaurant. I hate the smell of fish so it kind of ruined the meal for me. Obviously The Dirty Bird is not to blame. If you haven't tried it, I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"Came to Kensignton Market on a Sunday evening and met up with a friend for dinner at The Dirty Bird. We both weren't too hungry (I had basically eaten brunch and afternoon dessert before this haha), so we shared a two piece combo, which came with fries. It was quite busy around the time we arrived (a line of about 5-6 people) and the restaurant is quite small, but we found ourselves a seat at one of the counters soon after we ordered. Our food seemed to be taking a long time, and it turns out some lady had taken our order by accident... And once she had taken our order, for some reason she was still hanging around the restaurant, and then when we went up to ask, her real order was called out and then she returned our order and picked up hers and then left. So that was a bit weird... The takeout box that contained our chicken and fries was half-filled with fries, which seemed a tad suspicious or the big box made it seem like there weren't as many fries to begin with and they skimp out on the fries...?   Anyways, besides that weird hiccup, probably a 3.5 stars for me - the chicken was moist and quite tasty, so I definitely cleaned up my bone. A decent place for some good fried chicken."}
{"text":"When I'm craving fried chicken, and in Kensington Market, I drop by Dirty Bird. The fried chicken is always spectacular, though the waffles can be dry.  Venue: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Overall Experience: 3.5/5  I've visited this location twice, having the ODB (Original Dirty Bird?) waffle and the 2 piece combo. The fried chicken is always perfectly crispy and juicy on the inside, with a wonderful spice flavouring. The fries are well seasoned, and irresistible. The size of the fries is huge, it's easily comparable to a large size or more at any major fast food restaurant. The other sides such as the coleslaw are much smaller in comparison; imagine a tiny takeout sauce container.  The waffles are supposed to be a staple here, yet they are quite dry. Even when drenched in syrup, they still manage to soak out all the moisture out of your mouth. As well, the size of the individual non-quarter leg pieces is pitiful. For a $10 two-piece combo, you would think you'd get a nice thigh and drumstick. Let's just say I've seen chicken wings bigger than the drumstick. Definitely not worth the $11 for a two-piece meal which was the size of 4 chicken nuggets.  Nevertheless, if you're willing to fork out $20?!? for a 6 piece combo, I'm sure you'll be full. Otherwise, you're not missing much from other \"gourmet\" fried chicken places such as Chimac, The Fry, or Mymy Chicken."}
{"text":"I love Kensington and I love the Annex but to me it's rather strange that I've been to the Bloor street Dirty Bird before going to the original at Kensington and Baldwin.  The thing is I've only ever had dirty fries and froyo at Bloor and never actually had the fried chicken.  Yes, that's right... a lover of fried chicken has never had the fried chicken at a place that sells fried chicken as their main staple.  What's up with that?  So having to wait about half an hour to go to an event what better way to get a fill of fried chicken than right at the Dirty Bird (original).  Like most things in Kensington it's small but establishments in this hood are never to be judged by size and footprint.  Here in Kensington being the special place they are just about everything here is charmed and home to some of the best this city has to offer.  The Dirty Bird is a small place and space is limited.  The menu consists of chicken served in a variety of ways such as on sandwiches made from waffles or pulled into a tasty meal of seasoned fries but the standard and baseline is that fried chicken.  The servings are all dark meat pieces (drums and thighs) and the prices are quite reasonable.  For a single person, a 2 piece with a selection of one side (potato salad, fries, etc) is 7 bucks.  A 3 piece and side is 10 so I went with that and gave a piece to my meal companion who had shared her wonderful dirty fries with me.    The fries are well cooked and not greasy and the same can be said about the chicken.  The chicken pieces are juicy and pretty standard on the seasoning.   Hey, this is a filling meal for 10 bucks and is quite the deal for freshly made and generous portions of deep fried chicken not to mention the fries was a rather large heaping portion as well.  It's understandable how this place is popular being that they serve better than decent food for a decent price and have great sized portions to boot.  Yet another place that makes Kensington so cool, the Dirty Bird does their part to bring the charm of this neighborhood and raise the coolness factor up a notch as much as each place in the area supplements the other."}
{"text":"My friends brought me to try this place when I visited Toronto,m. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was some sort of festival going on so it was SUPER busy in the entire area plus at least 30 degrees outside... But regardless I had to get me some fried chicken.  The wait was not too bad considering there were so many people in the restaurant. Similar to other people, I agree that they definitely need more seating. it's a little hard to eat fried chicken and waffles when you're standing, so you definitely need a seat to be able to eat it well.   The fried chicken was pretty good - it was crispy on the outside and definitely well seasoned compared to a lot of other fried chicken i've had before. It was very fresh and super juicy because of that. The waffles were decent but nothing too spectacular. They did pair well with the fried chicken though so I guess that's good.   I also got the chance to try the dirty fries, which were alright. I think it's hard to make fries with so many toppings because the fries always get soggy. I felt like there was too much toppings and sauces in comparison to how much fries there were.  The one thing that I actually really loved from this place though, was the waffle ice cream sandwich. I highly recommend trying it because the smaller waffles that they make for the sandwiches helps the waffle become crispier and have a better texture than the large ones that come with the fried chicken. Again though, this is something that you definitely need to be sitting down with the table to eat because it's super messy and it's not really a sandwich as you can't actually hold it in your hands to eat."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Kensington.  My partner and I ordered the Signature ODB.  Chicken arrived hot, fresh crispy on the outside but very moist on the inside. The meat was a deboned thigh and leg.  It would be ideal for me if they offered white meat I would be willing to pay extra for the option.  The waffle was slightly vanilla flavored, light and airy it soaked up the sauce but held up decently against the chicken.  Staff were super nice, very enthusiastic and helpful."}
{"text":"I came here for Memorial Day weekend based on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Toronto and she was spot on!  She told me the place started out as food truck and then expanded into a brick and mortar location.  The place was small and packed so I figured all these people must be on to something.  Looking at everyone's food, my eyes bulged out of my sockets and became bigger than my stomach.  Everything that I saw looked amazing and everyone really seemed to be enjoying their food.  This was our first stop on a food crawl so we didn't want to get too full.  So, we decided to split The Dirty Club.  It was a waffle, boneless thigh and leg, beef bacon, tomato, lettuce and maple aioli.  It was sooo goood!  I secretly wished this was our only stop so I could order another one.  I know one thing, the next time I'm in Toronto, this will be my first food stop."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffle I've ever had. Mind you I got the sandwich version and just poured syrup inside it. So damn good. The waffle was perfectly fluffy and the chicken was juicy. We got their 'Dirty' poutine which was very good as well. I can't wait to come here again and get the same thing lol"}
{"text":"LOVEEEE. SOOO GOOOOD. pretty much, come here.  i was actually on my way to my favourite taco joint when i noticed this place. i didn't want to wait in the semi-long line at the taco joint so i opted for this place instead. and boy was i happy i did. this place was busy but there were still a few spots left where we could sit down and enjoy the food instead of scarfing it down while walking or standing. the waffle was so fluffy and delicious and i got wings with a dry rub which were also very moist and flavourful. my dish came with a side and i went for the mac salad - no regrets.  i would defintely come back and try their other dishes.  i recently had chicken and waffles at another restaurant and this place is much better in my opinion. it's like what people say, sometimes simple is best. the other place i went to had loads of chicken and other toppings and flavourings added that it was overwhelming. mind you, the first couple of bites were good but then it became too much. and because of this, their waffle became flat and mushy. here, they kept things simple with their maple butter sauce, just enough to enjoy it with every bite but not overload. i was very impressed after spending about 30 minutes eating my dish, the last piece of waffle was still fully in tact and fluffy. impressive. i can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lack of seats is a major impediment. Guess as long as one doesn't mind eating while standing or finding a curb to sit on outside, then this problem is solved. Their food portions are massive and delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered one ODB with fries, which came to $20. My review: YUM. Fluffy waffle, great chicken, delicious sauce and the fries are so tasty. They're covered in a herb salt and go great with maple syrup, which is provided to drizzle all over your meal. You totally have to hit up this (tiny) Kensington gem. They use locally-sourced ingredients to ensure ultimate freshness. I promise it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"First time here and was not disappointed!    Ordered the Up North Trip - 2 drumsticks, 1 thigh, syrup and a waffle, and a choice of side. I choose the Mac salad and it was delicious.  The one thing about this order that didn't please me is that it didn't come with their dirty sauce. But to add it for a $1 it's still good value when compared to the ODB which only comes with 2 pcs of chicken.  The chicken comes out perfectly fried, super crispy skin on the outside with tender, succulent meat on the inside. The extra dirty sauce was just enough for the 3 pc.  The waffle was superb as well - both crunchy and fluffy.  We also tried the dirty fries - a must try!"}
{"text":"Sooo delicious!! I had the the clucker with the jerk BBQ sauce. Perfect amount of syrup and the chicken wings were crispy with juice meat inside. We were sooooo satisfied after this meal"}
{"text":"This was my first experience trying chicken and waffles and it didn't disappoint! My friend and I stumbled across this place because we wanted to hit up a taco place next door but the lineup was super long so we opted for this option. A small fast food joint with limited seating. It wasn't super busy but still took about 15-20 mins for our food since they make it fresh on the spot. I ordered a waffle with chicken wings (can't remember the name) combo for $15...the wings were maple flavoured. It also came with one side so I opted for the coleslaw which was decent. The chicken wings itself was fresh and succulent tasting. Not too oily or overcooked. But I'd have to say the best part of the meal was the waffle. It was fluffy and cooked to perfection. Don't forget to add the maple syrup for the full indulgence. I'll definitely come back to try their other menu items such as their waffle and salted caramel ice cream."}
{"text":"At first I thought ewww...chicken and waffles? I never tried it but somehow I was already being judgmental. Maybe because I'm usually not a fan of sweet and savory combo. But this....this place! Holy...I ordered the \"ODB\" boneless chicken and waffles and it was crazily delicious. The waffle itself was fluffy and the sauce on the boneless chicken was a triple threat It was sweet, sour, and spicy all in the same bite. The various textures when eating into it too was awesome (soft/crispy etc)  Okay. I love chicken and waffles now.   I would also recommend coming to this location as I would assume the Kensington one gets pretty jammed. This place had plenty of seating area and barely any waiting time."}
{"text":"The food was less like dirty and more like nasty. Service was pretty bad too.  I had the 6 pieces of chicken and waffle with a side of coleslaw and potatoe salad.  The waffle was on the drier side and the chicken was really bland and needed to douse it in a crap load of hot sauce to get some flavour out of it. I'm not even a fast food lover but I was wishing I was having KFC in that moment. The coleslaw was what really got to me. It tasted like it was mixed with melted vanilla ice cream so it was more like a cabbage ice cream..."}
{"text":"This Dirty Bird location shares a space with a Yogurty's. There aren't too many tables/seats since many people just come in for takeout for either Froyo/chicken. There are about 3 small round tables and 2 larger rectangular high tables though!  We had the ODB (fried boneless chicken quarter thigh/leg on a waffle with their dirty sauce) with slaw as the side, and a 3-piece chicken combo (2 legs and 1 thigh) with fries. The waffle was great, and the chicken was pretty good but a bit too oily and salty/heavy on the seasoning for me personally."}
{"text":"I \"discovered\" this place at lunch and braved the April showers (really wet snow) at dinner time to savor \"The Up North Trip.\" 3 pieces of chicken + waffle + cole slaw = feast-sized portion for me. I probably should have ordered less and 1/2 the way through, I was full but I didn't want anything to go to waste.  The food is delicious--chicken might be a tad salty but to me the waffle and coleslaw (more sweet than sour, but not in a cloying way--actually really enjoyed  this side) were perfect. Since the waffle is a bit sweet, I didn't need more syrup and I didn't need ketchup for the chicken either.  The place was packed at lunch, so I almost didn't write a review (to keep this place secret) but that would be wrong.  I can say that this place does chicken + waffles way better than Tupelo (even though I  liked their version). But now that I am more educated about what it could be, there's no going back to accepting lesser versions of the chicken+waffle combo.  Hope Waterfront eateries can live up to the standard set in this \"hidden\" gem."}
{"text":"It's a 3.5 leaning more towards a 4.  I really love chicken so I'm really glad my boyfriend found this place on Yelp.  Sadly, I do have to echo the other reviews and say that the seating and service is really disjointed. No one is mean but it's slow and confusing service. The bathrooms are disgusting. Seating is cramped and the restaurant is boiling.   I think I misread the menu because I never got a waffle with my order. I ordered the maple chicken bites and a leg. The food was excellent though. I really loved the simplicity of their fried chicken. Since I'm not a fan of overly seasoned chicken, this was right up my alley. Crispy, warm, juicy. Really really good. The maple chicken was a bit too suggary but still good.   I'd recommend coming here and exploring the rest of the surrounding restaurants because they had so many good options in this area!  Visited July 1st 2017"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because fried chicken and waffles are both among my favourite things. The waffles were lukewarm and subpar. The chicken was ok. Put everything together and I would have had a more enjoyable experience at Popeyes for a fraction of the price. There are other hipster places around town that offer better quality food. There was nothing special in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about, I've had real southern chicken & waffles and I just can't compare it to this. The pricing for what you get is ridiculous, $3 for a tiny bottle of water and add to that dry waffles. I gave it 3 stars because I understand that chicken & waffles isn't really Toronto's specialty and since it is still pretty new I can only assume that it will get better."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. The ODB's gravy does not match the overly sweet syrup at all. I almost puked just from the scent of it. One of the nastiest and most overpriced meals EVER!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles here are really good but not the best in the city. It's always packed so expect a wait."}
{"text":"OK, when you want to eat junk food, make it worth it.  This is not worth it.   - the oil used for both the fries and the chicken was old - the chicken and fries came out brown - the chicken had no flavor, no spice - the quality of the actual chicken used was good - the mac salad was sub-par - the guy at the counter was meh  If you are going for some calories that you normally wouldn't eat, look elsewhere, for better quality and better taste.  Don't believe the hype!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but then again, I've just come from Atlanta where the fried chicken is fantastic.  So far I haven't found a great spot in Toronto yet, but this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"After reviewing their menu online, I decided to give Dirty Bird a try through uber eats. Unfortunately I was left quite disappointed. Here was my experience:  1) their ODB meal is $15 and comes with a side. On uber eats they charge $16 + an additional $5 for a small side.   2) chicken was decent and a really good size but found it to be a bit too salty.   3) waffle was completely bland, cold and soggy.   4) ODB sauce was a nice addition but they did not provide a sufficient amount of maple syrup (I spent an additional $2 for extra and it was never received ima)  Overall for the price point I won't be returning or recommending them to anyone else. It was a well below the bar experience."}
{"text":"I spend quite a bit of time in Kensington Market especially during the summer, it's one of my favourite places in the city. Oddly enough, I never tried Dirty Bird Chicken & Waffles, so on a recent Monday afternoon I went in to try it out to see if it warranted all the rave reviews.  The place is quite small, a few tables in the middle and counters all around the edges with stools for seating, seating capacity is pretty minimal. I ordered the ODB ($15 plus tax) which consisted of a Boneless Thigh & Leg, Waffle, Buttered Maple, Dirty Sauce with Slaw, Mac Salad or 'Tato Salad, I went with the potato salad as a side. I was able to find a seat at one of the counters.  The potato salad was just average, definitely needed to be more creamier but I was really interested in the chicken & waffles. The waffle was nicely done, light and fluffy. The chicken was good but a little on the dry side. The plastic knife I was given didn't cut through the chicken so easily. Decent seasoning, buttered maple was great and the dirty sauce was really good and worked well with the dish. Overall, it's a good dish but definitely not amazing. A great chicken & waffle dish has to have amazing juicy, tender fried chicken.  One issue I did have, it was a late Monday afternoon, so the place wasn't too busy and the place wasn't clean and the staff need to do a better job of clearing trays from the counter and wiping down the counters. I could understand if the place was super busy and staff were busy tending to customers but it wasn't. There were numerous trays just sitting on the counters and the counters had ketchup residue."}
{"text":"Waste of money, unless you go out for lunch once a month... There is literally nothing special about the waffle or the chicken here- take your $20: get some Eggo waffles and some Popeye's and assemble this shit for your family."}
{"text":"Although the place is small and was packed when we went there, our order was prepared fast. The gluten-free waffles were good and the light maple-flavour to the chicken was nice. Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to something in the food! Originally I thought it was pork (since \"bacon\" is on the menu) however I've been informed that The Dirty Bird is halal and they only serve beef bacon, so I'm not sure what I reacted to. I wish I could have finished my food though, it was good. Especially the fries!"}
{"text":"Delicious waffles and fried chicken! I had the ODB ($15 for a massive portion), which was their speciality. The waffles were made to perfection and you got to add your own maple syrup to it. The sauce on the chicken wasn't my favourite, but it wasn't bad either. I would recommend expansion for this place!! I sat there for an hour while eating my ODB and I saw at least twenty customers walk away because there werent enough seats. I also felt a little rushed to leave because it seemed like everyone wanted a seat."}
{"text":"Had this a while back but didn't remember to put a review. Definitely one of my favourite joints to go to. Me and my ex bf at the time came to check this out, place is a bit hidden but you will eventually find it if you walk around long enough. We ordered two orders of chicken and fries , it was hot and chicken was tasty and slightly crunchy. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area. Place for dining in is a bit small though"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and was super happy with my visit. We split the ODB, and it was the perfect amount for the two of us to split with two sides. The chicken was moist and crispy and the waffle was well made, no nasty black stuff from a dirty waffle maker like you get sometimes. The coleslaw was a drier, and I'm more a fan of wet slaw so it just wasn't my style. The mac salad was fantastic. Although, I wish the sides had been a little bigger for the price point...it was a little metal condiment cup of slaw and mac each. The staff was helpful and chill and answered our questions. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Walked into this place for lunch with some friends.  A new chicken and waffles joint is always welcome in this city!  The place was busy and I suspect with the modest available seating that they intend for a lot of their customers to grab'n'go which is a fine concept.  The decor style reminds me of Rock Lobster Co.  Clean and minimalist.  I decided on the O.D.B (Original Dirty Bird) amongst the 5 or so choices on the menu board.  Although the wait was a bit longer than expected it seems they prepare everything fresh especially the chicken.  I didn't see any heat-lamps keeping any fried chicken warm which is a bonus.  They did run out of potato salad that day which makes me suspect that is a popular choice than the coleslaw which was just ok.  It was a nice generous portion of chicken that was breaded lightly with a nice crunch to the skin while keep the meat inside very juicy and soft.  The waffle was not soggy and held up against the fried chicken.  Depending on who is pouring the syrup behind the counter, it can range from way too much to \"Dude, where is my syrup?!\".  My other friend got a soggier waffle due to excess syrup.  The hot sauce complements that chicken well and it is spicy and tangy which I really enjoyed.  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at The Dirty Bird and will definitely make another visit when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Space is small and it fills up after 530-6pm as the after work crowd flows in. The chicken wasn't the best if you've had southern fried chicken. Waffles were also not the best in my opinion. Service was quick. Tables were a little dirty."}
{"text":"Got the Dirty Birdg'r and was not disappointed. The waffles are cooked to perfection and the fried chicken itself is very tasty. The maple aioli on this waffle burger adds great flavour to an already delicious dish. Excited to come back here and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"We like to walk around sampling from several places in the area. To that end, the $7 chicken waffle burger was the perfect size and amount. I loved the tenderness of the meat and the waffles were so fluffy!"}
{"text":"I loved the Dirty Bird'ger.  It was pure heaven.  The sweetness from the maple syrup, the salty-sour taste of the special sauce, and the tender, fried, awesomeness of the chicken held in a tasty gluten-free waffle.... It was fantastic."}
{"text":"Very good if you like chicken, but gotta warn ya'll. They don't serve white breast Meat only thigh and drumsticks.    There is very little room to sit so ya gotta be quick when someone gets up. I ordered the dirty club and absolutely loved it. My wife got the dirty fries and it was just not doing it for her but she can be a bit fussy at times. We paid close to $35 with 2 waters so can be a bit pricy if ya wanted to grab a bunch of stuff. The music was cool as well, a bit of a throwback to some classic dancehall music which was nice to hear for a change.   All in all I enjoyed it and will try the bird'ger next time."}
{"text":"Went to Dirty Bird once - don't think I'll visit again. There are definitely better fried chicken options in the city, and I felt it was a little overpriced too."}
{"text":"In the heart of Kensington market, this chicken and waffles place does it right and with soul. Love the crispy yet juicy perfectly seasoned chicken at Dirty Bird. They make their waffles to order so they are crispy in the middle yet fluffy and warm in the middle. There are small pitchers of maple syrup which I often find myself drizzling over the chicken (even sans waffles) to give it even more contrast of flavours.  I usually order the Dirty Birdger ($7), which is a boneless piece of fried chicken thigh on a mini waffle with a touch of dirty sauce and maple aioli. To avoid waffle sogginess, I ask for the pickles, onions, and tomatoes on the side. Friends of mine tend to order the Northern Fried, where you pick how many pieces of fried chicken (they usually get 2 with a leg and a thigh for $7) which comes with your choice of coleslaw or potato salad. These options provide plenty of food for one person for lunch (or a light dinner).  And if you're still feeling the need to end off your visit with something sweet, try one of their dessert options of waffles with Ed's real scoop ice cream (which has an amazing dense texture; no cheap soft serve here). We order the Sweet Nuttins with candied pecans, whipped cream, and sub out sweet cream flavoured ice cream for the sweet potato flavour. To die for!  I've tried chicken and waffles at other places, but for me, this place does it just right. No complicated flavours or attempts at fusion chicken & waffles. Just good old fashioned flavour with a modern, urban vibe at Dirty Bird.  (35/100)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a weeknight dinner, and being the lover of sandwiches that I am, opted for The Dirty Bird'ger. This is a boneless fried chicken thigh, lettuce, tomato, pickle, red onion, \"Dirty Sauce\", and maple aioli served on a waffle based bun.  First of all, I will say I'm impressed that everything was cooked made to order. It meant about a 10 minute wait before the food was ready, but you don't want old waffles that have been sitting under heat lamps so the wait wasn't a concern.  From a visual standpoint, its a pretty awesome looking sandwich. Admittedly from a functional perspective, there are some flaws as it seems like a challenge to eat this sandwich without it falling apart into a giant mess which will turn it into a fork and knife dining experience. The good news is that once it starts falling apart into this mess, you can add some maple syrup over it all which is an added bonus as admittedly the dirty sauce and maple aioli was pretty tame in flavour. But overall, it's a pretty decent sandwich for $7.  Side dishes include fries at $4 or macaroni salad, coleslaw, or potato salad, served in a 5 oz container for $3. The potato salad was alright. I think there is a touch of dill which added some better flavour to what is otherwise forgettable potato salad.   Overall, I'll say for what came to $11 and change after tax for a sandwich and salad, I wasn't displeased with my purchase and it is a decent food option for this area of the Annex. However I will say there are better places for chicken, waffles, or sandwiches."}
{"text":"Didn't care for the chicken and waffles, which is a dish I normally love."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of how chicken and waffles are made. The chicken is amazing here, but it's a bit spicy for me. The waffles taste like normal waffle, sweet and scrumptious. I rated this place 4/5 stars because they serve fantastic food for the fantastic price."}
{"text":"So I have a morbid fascination with southern style food and have been looking forward to chicken and waffles forever. I finally had a chance to try out Dirty Bird. I had seen their location in Kensington so I was optimistic.  Here is how it went down:  The Good: The location is bright. The staff are super friendly. The chicken and the waffle are hot and crispy.   The Bad: Everyone else in the restaurant was eating frozen yogurt. I ordered the ODB which was quite underwhelming given the price. The side salad (potato) was served in a thimble and not very tasty.  They are quite skimpy with the syrup.   The Ugly: They were prepping the salads and food without gloves. Press on nails might make the salad a little crunchy when they fall off. The chicken is really salty and without enough syrup on the waffle you don't get the flavour profile. The red sauce on the chicken is unnecessary.   Overall: Not worth the price. $20 for a waffle, a piece of chicken and a thimble of potato salad."}
{"text":"The ODB is AMAZING. It was even better than I expected. A massive piece of juicy, moist fried chicken on an fantastic waffle. How can you go wrong? Everything was prepared well. As others have noted, the chicken is not greasy in the slightest yet and is super crisp. I usually don't eat the skin (I know..) But I just had to eat the skin this time, it was that good! The 'dirty sauce' really impressed me and really brought the dish together. A sweet, tangy sauce with some spice compliments the chicken so well. They have syrup (maple flavoured, I won't call it maple syrup) in a bottle so you can add that to your heart's content if you fancy that on your waffles, It was also delish adding all that together - fork up a waffle dabbed in syrup with a piece of fried chicken with dirty sauce. So much perfection in one bite. The potato salad was tasty and creamy and was a nice side.   The value is fair, yes it is $15 for fried chicken but it is incredible and there is a lot there. You will definitely leave satisfied and full. There is enough to share for two.   Came here on a weekday evening and there were only a couple of folks here. Managed to get a seat without problem and my order was prepared in a reasonable time with a short wait."}
{"text":"Gets you your chicken and waffles fix. Straightforward food but with hella big portion sizes. The chicken was crispy on the outside and really tender in the inside. The waffles were nice and warm, chewy and crispy. The maple syrup was heavenly - very buttery. A must try! Value for money as well! Come here when you're hungry. You'll surely leave satisfied."}
{"text":"6 PIECES WITH 2 SIDES 4 Legs  & 2 Thighs With Two Choice Sides ($20ish)  Chicken: All the chicken pieces are tender and juicy. The outside is good. Better than a lot of the fried chicken i've been having these days. The aunt jemina's syrup serves as a great dipping sauce for hte fried chicken. There's also ketchup and a spicy dipping sauce that are good too.  Sides: Love the coleslaw with the red cabbage! The macaroni salad wasn't bad either. On the smaller side compared to the fries so if you want your money's worth get the fries instead."}
{"text":"Came here around 7.00pm on a Friday night, the place is very small with only about 10-15 seats. We were lucky that when we were ordering someone was leaving and opened up 2 spots along the wall. You line up at the counter and place your order.   I got the ODB for $15. It was easy to eat because the chicken is boneless. It was juicy and well fried. Though I wish it was just a bit crispier, the skin and breading felt a tiny bit toot thin. The waffle wasn't bad, standard but added a nice sweetness. And the sweet spicy sauce that went with it was great. The portion was large and I definitely couldn't finish it. The pop comes in cute glass bottles, but its $3-5 each which makes them very expensive for a standard soft drink. The meal was good but maybe just a bit too hyped up, but a great addition to one of my favourite toronto areas.  You also get some of the eccentric Kensington market folk that come wandering in sometimes, but they are no harm anyways."}
{"text":"Deserving of a 3.5-4. We visited this small joint in the Kensington area as a group of 4 at 7pm on Sunday night. The restaurant has limited seating - only bar stools - but thankfully we managed to get seats shortly after ordering.  We ordered the ODB (boneless thigh/leg on waffle), the Dirty Club (boneless thigh/leg on waffle with beef bacon), the Clucker (wings on waffle), coleslaw, potato salad, and Dirty Fries (hand-cut fries with cheddar and other toppings).   We all enjoyed the food. I mostly had the ODB - the waffle was freshly made and the chicken was cooked well with awesome crispy skin. My one complaint would be the sauce on both the ODB and the Dirty Fries was too sweet."}
{"text":"Loving that hotsauce. Never knew itd go so well with some waffles. Nor does fried chicken. Definitely worth opting out of tacos and going for this. Their prices are pretty damn good for a sit in restaurant"}
{"text":"Located right in the heart of Kensington Market. The Dirty Bird offers an experience that can only be found in the core of Toronto.  Had the ODB. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. The dish is the perfect combo of sweet and savory. The only thing stopping this from being 5 stars was that the potato salad was a bit bland."}
{"text":"Soooo good, who would have thought Toronto had a good chicken and waffle place that could rival those in the south. Glad my friends brought me to this local eatery, the menu is simple and easy to navigate. Got the ODB and was very pleased.   Definitely a must when in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a while, but I was hesitant to visit since Kensington market is always packed with people.  Came here for their grand opening event. We got 2 pieces of fried chicken (only for $2 because they were having a promotion that day!) + a waffle ($4). They have three tables that can sit 2-4 people, two long tables (prob 8-10 ppl. each), and a bar facing the wall (4-6 ppl.) There is also Menchie's if you want froyo for dessert (oops, The dirty bird itself also serves desserts).  Light and crispy one the outside and juicy on the inside! Chickens were perfectly cooked as well. Liked the seasoning in the batter, although they could use more spice in it. Loved the waffle! crunchy and fluffy, the way I like my waffle to be.   Overall, like the new location more than the first location just because it is located in a quieter neighborhood. Solid food and great service!"}
{"text":"I tried the waffle and boneless chicken. I loved the sauce and was very filling. I found it to be a little pricey for what you get. Also I've tried better chicken and waffles else where.  One tip is this place gets pretty busy with little seating so be prepared to eat outside or get takeout."}
{"text":"Oh yes - chicken and waffles.  Why they make such a mouth-watering combo I do not know - but they do, and after saving some calories with a light lunch, I came down to Kensington ready for a gastric indulgence.  Location - on Kensington, the place is just a few doors down from another favourite - 7 Lives tacos, and has a very similar vibe.  Limited cramped seating but once you start eating you hardly notice.  So of course got the chicken & waffles, with coleslaw and a coke.  Down to the nitty-gritty:  - Chicken & waffles: A1, 5/5 for sure.  I can't remember liking Stockyards as much as this, and I liked Stockyards!  Will have to do a side-by-side sometime.  The sweet maple sauce mixes perfectly with both the sweet waffle and the savoury chicken.  Drooling as I type.. - Dirty fries: pretty good, 4/5 - had to try them, they didn't disappoint - Coleslaw: what is this?  Some shredded cabbage, no creaminess, barely a hint of any dressing. What?  I give it 1/5, and that's only because there wasn't a bug in it.  Then again, I consider KFC slaw a 5/5, so my opinion may be skewed.  Perhaps your idea of amazing coleslaw is biting a chunk out of a raw head of cabbage, but mine needs something extra. - Coke: so is Coke in a glass bottle better than that in a can?  I hear Mexican glass-bottled coke is better than local Coke - but unfortunately nowhere on the bottle is it written where it was bottled.  Anyways, not even rating this here - it's a Coke, enough said!  Service - good, but the girl taking the order needs to crank the volume on her voice a bit and speak a little more clearly.  After the 3rd time asking her to repeat, I started feeling bad and questioning whether it was me.  On reflection, nope - it was her.  But no problems otherwise.  Summary: Do it - you know you want it, and you won't be disappointed.  Nomnomnom..."}
{"text":"Over priced and over rated.  I really wanted to like this place since it got so much hype, but NOPE. The chicken was OK (Ive had better chicken at the grocery store deli). Waffles were bland and no flavor. Syrup ... ehhhhhh. The only reason this got a 3rd star is for the availability of the hot sauce in-house and it was GOOD."}
{"text":"I was walking across Kensington and the smell def caught my attention. Ordered an Original ODB and the seasoning of the chicken was everything. Waffles were a bit dry and not enough syrup for take out."}
{"text":"This is Dirty Birds second location - located on Bloor just east of Bathurst on the south side. I prefer this location as it is almost never slammed the way the Kensington one is.  I tried The ODB ($15) - which is a fresh waffle, slathered in maple butter, topped with fried chicken & delicious spicy sauce (& chives). The chicken is light, boneless and juicyyyyy. It's the perfect balance of savoury & sweet - there is extra syrup available if you need (you probably won't) My sidekick got 2 pieces of chicken + fries ($7) - it is so filling and satisfying.   This is most definitely at the top of the list for cheat day!"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken and waffles. Dirty Bird does one of the best in the city. I do find that once in a while, their chicken comes out a little dry... but most of my experiences are great here. I love the Dirty Sauce The place is quite small so a lot of people do take-outs instead."}
{"text":"This was by far the best chicken and waffles I've ever had, however I must add that the extremely vulgar trap music while I'm dinning.....is slightly distracting with  p&$@y this and suck that. It truly took away from the experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the chicken here after National Chicken day had a debate regarding best fried chicken on Facebook. The chicken  is pretty good-a solid 4. Pieces are not that big but it's okay. However, fries are not good and taste like cinnamon. Both my friend and I did not like the fries."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles seems to be a trending food thing lately, and the Dirty Bird around the corner of Kensington and Baldwin in Kensington Market seems to be the place in Toronto to get your fix.  But the $7 \"Dirty Bird'ger\" chicken burger with waffles as a bun? Dangerous!  It was a mouthful of an idea in itself as I struggled to determine how to stuff that hybrid monster in my mouth and wash down the concept of pickles mixed in with chewed waffle. The fried chicken is crispy lickin' great with a savoury batter and sufficiently moist in the inside. (I hate dry chicken.) Waffles were fluffy like a feather pillow soft, held the burger together like a pro without getting saturated soggy even with syrup poured into the burger (of course you would, how dirty is that?).  It's easy to see why many people eating here are drooling dirty. There is a good handful of bar seating (yes, do note even the hooks for purses underneath), and a 10-15 wait for your food to be ready. For those who rather not consume chicken on a dirty-hot summer day, Dirty Bird offers their take on that carnival classic the ice cream waffle sandwich, featuring the ice cream of fav neighbourhood haunt Ed's Real Scoop.  Suffice to say there is now competition for my post-haircut meal. That constant Seven Lives taco lineup is looking less and less attractive."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here and get some fried chicken waffles for some time. Finally decided to try it out.  I was super hungry, 2pm brunch. Ordered the ODB and chicken tenders. The ODB is waffle with fried chicken. They made it so the chicken was bbqed which made the taste awkward. It didnt amaze me. The chicken tenders were too dry but the sauce was very good.  I've had other fried chicken and waffles at other brunch restaurants which i thought were all better than this place.  I recommend trying the place but i wouldn't be a regular of the dirty bird."}
{"text":"We ordered the ODB - a Boneless Thigh, Waffle, and coleslaw. The waffle was fluffy and the chicken was delicious.  And the fact that it was boneless made it even better.  The coleslaw though was just alright.  I thought the meal was going to be sweet because of the waffle but it's actually spicy because of the hot sauce on top of the chicken.  Next time I'll be sure to get the maple syrup to get the sweet and savoury flavours.     The place is pretty small and has only a few employees working but the service is amazing and the food is served up incredibly quick.  The only negative is since it's such a small place seating is very limited and the place gets very crowded.   Loved the food.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  The bird's the word, the bird bird bird, the bird's the word.  Yeah I just felt like finally be able to write that.  Came here before an event so I wanted something to tide me over so ordered the dirty fries.  Then my friend came along and ordered some chicken so I had a piece of that as well.  The menu while limited is tight - meaning no frou frou stuff - chicken (sandwiches, waffles, dirty fries).  I hate when a menu is overwhelming - do a few things but do them well.  The fries were hot and not greasy and were enough portion size wise for the price.  The piece of chicken my friend gave me was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - exactly what you want from your neighbourhood fried chicken.  For the prices you can't go wrong - for 3 pieces and a side is about $10.    The restaurant itself is tiny - only a few small tables and one long bar like table by the side - I think maybe max 10 people can fit inside.  I'm sure it must get busy but I did see a lot of people come in for take out."}
{"text":"Appreciated the 90's hip hop related menu (Up North Trip, ODB, etc...). First impression; not overly friendly (that lame 20 something; too cool to be working here attitude). Nice piece of chicken, don't enjoy the sauce (ODB; maybe get it on the side), waffle is standard, didn't care for the slaw.  At $16.95 for a piece of chicken and waffle; equals a 'one time' experience; it's way too expensive.  Consider some specials, daily deals, etc..  Across the border (Buffalo, Detroit); you can get this done similar/better for WAY less; i guess in Toronto you are paying for the experience, i guess...."}
{"text":"Would give 2.5 if possible. Got the ODB. Doesn't taste bad. Doesn't taste good. Extremely underwhelming/bland. I thought of chucking it, but it cost me $20! Perhaps it's because I got take out, so the waffle was soggy. But it also took them 5 min to prepare so I doubt it was much fresher if I ate in. This is my second time here. First time I ate in and shared the ODB and it was forgettable, but 6 months later thought I would give it another chance. Don't think I'm coming back a third time."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was delicious, I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Dirty Bird has found the perfect balance of juicy, tender fried chicken without too much oil, and fresh, fluffy waffles that don't get too soggy from maple syrup. Their portions are huge and definitely meant to be shared between two people."}
{"text":"This meal was insanely good!! The chicken comes out so hot and the sauce is amazing! The waffle is fluffy and compliments the chicken so well. The potato salad was quite nice as well. I ordered based on what the employee recommended and really enjoyed it. The staff weren't the friendliest, especially since I was indecisive, but it was quiet so I don't really know why. This is my favourite food place in Kensington Market for sure."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, but slightly overpriced.  I've come here a couple of times and would definitely recommend it.   The waffles are fluffy and the chicken is tasty and crispy. My favourite is the sauce they add on top!"}
{"text":"Probably like a lot of you that reviewed your experiences at The Dirty Bird, shortly after I had posted my review, Josh, the Owner of this joint sent me a complimentary meal ticket for one of the Signature dishes on the menu. I finally got a chance to redeem it on Wednesday for a late lunch meal, and I picked the The Dirty Club this time around. Man, I'll take that over the ODB anytime whenever I'm in the area. The sandwich which was a made of the waffle and the boneless thigh and leg with some sandwich-style garnishes was alot bigger (almost the size of my shoe which is a 9.5) than I expected and almost filled up half of the tray that it was served on. I was not in a hurry to wolf this down and savored every bite. I just wish I could have tasted more of the maple aioli sauce.  The waffle was fluffly as the last one and the skin on the friend chicken was just as crispy. Definitely a sure winner! Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I'm so confused about the rave reviews for this place, I don't know if it was what I ordered, but I thought it was average at best. Not bad, just kind of.. well, bland. The servings are good ( I got the 3 piece and coleslaw feeling especially hungry and couldn't finish it.. or maybe it was the grease overload). I found the batter to be almost completely flavorless aside from a bit of sweet aftertaste, too thick, definitely not southern fried chicken. The coleslaw gets a firm 1.5-2 stars.. I had 2 bites and tossed it.. mushy and flavorless. It's too bad, I've been wanting to try this place for a while, maybe the chicken/waffle combos are better? Who know's I doubt I'll go back to find out."}
{"text":"After being told, 'ya gotta try this place' I finally made it.  I had a bit of time in between things for a snack. So I thought I would take the opportunity to try a little something from here.    I ordered the dirty birdger made with  1/2 Waffle, boneless chicken thigh, lettuce, tomato, pickle, red onion, dirty sauce and maple aioli. Served on a metal tray.  Now, how was it you must be wondering? Well, its not an easy thing to eat as a sandwich. I did try - but the waffle not crisp enough to have that full hold in your hand sandwich feel. Ya know what I mean? More like crumbly cookie. I tried though.  I did want to taste the chicken. Good fried chicken stands well on its on. This has potential.  On its own, deep fried properly with proper crisp and colour. My biggest disappointment is the flavour. Although cooked well and presented nicely, there was no flavour to the fried chicken. It fell flat.  I had the dirty sauce and maple aioli try to work its business - but ya know, did not help. I read about amazing seasoning if that is the case, it should be there, every time at least for the chicken. Way more forgiving if the sides were off but not on the chicken.  I've had some wonderful boneless chicken thigh sandwiches with amazing flavour like the offering at County General on Queen Street or at Streetbird in Harlem by Marcus Samuelsson (that dude creates amazing flavour profiles.)  Pros: The atmosphere of the space is comfortable and clean. They have a great concept going. Cons: But for me the star of the show just didn't show"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to check this place out for a while. Finally has an opportunity to stop by for lunch and was impressed! A little expensive for lunch but I was not disappointed. Food was delicious.  I had the big dirty and my Friend had the great white north. Good portion size for the money. Chicken was juicy and crispy.  Staff was super friendly which made the experience all the more positive. He went the extra mile explaining all the dishes to other customers that had difficulty speaking English and did not get frustrated with them.  Would come again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But my chicken was so overdone and under seasoned the waffles weren't good. On top of everything else when I got there I waited about 5 minutes for somebody to actually acknowledge that I was there (although he was standing right in front of me with his head down). Lastly I went there with my young niece and the music that they were playing was completely inappropriate.  I wouldn't say to stay away from this place because everyone will have a different experience. But personally I hated it. Sorry"}
{"text":"Visited this place place yesterday and ordered the best chicken and waffles dish that I've ever tasted - the ODB.  I liked it so much that I ordered 6pcs chicken , 2 sides and an extra waffle for takeout.  One less star because the Asian lady working the counter looked so out of it that she forgot to pack my 2 sides ( thank god I checked). Same lady also forgot to give the woman who ordered before me her 4 dirty sauces which was $1 each.  Will be back!  Pro tip: always check your takeout order before leaving the place"}
{"text":"One word: HEAVENLY  Everyone needs to try this place out, specifically the ODB. I have never tried anything that tasted like the buttered maple and the \"dirty sauce\" made the chicken melt in my mouth. The meal is a perfect portion that will keep you full for LONG hours. There's also Yogurty's on the other side if you feel like getting some dessert. The workers were also very friendly. Since I went here during the night, the lighting indoors was very dim and also, the cost of most of the items on the menu were quite expensive. Nonetheless, I am definitely coming back here with my other friends!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great portions. A bit expensive. Would recommend to EVERYONE  There are almost no words to describe how amazing the dirty bird's special, the ODB is. It's basically a boneless thigh, deep fried, laid on a freshly made waffle with butter maple syrup and their special dirty sauce. Literally, my mouth is watering just thinking about how amazing this place is. It's a bit expensive, $15 but definitely worth its price. You won't regret a single bite. It also comes with a side of your choice although I'll have to say the sides are a bit small in comparison to the main meal.   The location has a small seating area. It's pay as you come so people come and eat and go so there's always a seat waiting for me. Not so sure about the bathrooms (if there are any). Definitely no wifi but who needs wifi when you've got great food ahead of you?   Will always come back!"}
{"text":"The Dirty Bird suffers from being crazy delicious on the front end, then a bit too much once you have gorged yourself.  The prices here are not cheap. The ODB (15$) is a delicious option though- a tasty piece of fried chicken on a waffle. The sweet, savoury and tangy work well together.  Seating in this location is a bit cramped.   Staff are efficient. They do a good job of getting the food out quickly."}
{"text":"Love the fact that all the chicken were dark meat! The chicken were crispy and not overly battered - so you know that you're getting the meat! The waffles were nothing too spectacular but still great. The sides we got were the potato salad the coleslaw and definitely a huge fan of those as well! Although, our favourite item would have to be the dirty fries - The fries are covered with cheese and garnished with fried onions and they are heavenly!   The only thing that we're not a huge fan of is how tiny the seating area is - but that's definitely one that we can overlook.  This cute little joint is definitely in our top 3 for Chicken and Waffles - will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"3 to 3.5 stars for here. Came here a while back but was too in a rush to want to wait in line. This time I got here a bit earlier. Like most places in Kensington, it's a tiny place with limited seating. Ordered the O.D.B. they were out of the accompanying salad so we got fries instead.  The chicken is quite good. Nicely fried and I thought the sauce was tasty. Sweet and a little bit of spice. The chicken was a little dry in places though which combined with the waffle seemed even more dry. The fries were very average."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken and waffles. The waffle was massive and the chicken was a sure fire knock out!    Bonus: The soundtrack is usually pretty great (both times they happened to be cranking Drake albums)."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is good. Cooked right, with good moisture and crispy on the outside.  Waffle is also good.  However, I didn't think the combination added anything. At least not for me.  A very minor mistake was made with our order. They gave us potato salad instead of coleslaw.  Decent meal"}
{"text":"My first time here last week. I had the \"ODB\" which is an acronym for \"original dirty bird\". It was one of the tastiest fried chicken I ever had. The chicken I believe was marinated and so juicy and flavourful and the skin was nice and crispy. Served on a fluffy waffle and  served with there dirty sauce, a hot sauce that had a tangy mild heat with a touch of sweetness.  I also had the dirty fries which had the dirty sauce and some other stuff. It was very tasty and couldn't stop eating them.  I'm glad I found this place since it gives me another option for fried chicken other than kfc and Popeyes."}
{"text":"First time I tried the fried chicken and waffle combo. I was a little skeptical but the red and yellow sauce brings it together in a perfect way. The slaw adds the right amount of acidy taste changer. My first reaction on 3 peices of chicken on waffle was like...that's it? But when you start getting into it, its a pretty good mix. Fills you up. Fresh waffle and fresh chicken...made in front while you wait. Nice clean place and good service. Worth the price:)"}
{"text":"Had the B-Lo chicken sandwich on waffles. The flavor was all hot w/ no other discernible complementary flavors or spices. OTOH, it was a decent sized piece of thigh meat. The slaw was meh and the waffles were soft and uncrispy."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken with creative waffle combinations to try out. The chicken is crispy and well seasoned on the outside, juicy on the inside.  Inside the restaurant there is limited seating so it may be wise to get your order \"to-go\" so that you can take it with you to enjoy elsewhere. With that being said, if you do decide to wait you would not spend that much time waiting for a seat become available. It is a little on the expensive side but it is well worth it so I can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is quite expensive for just fried chicken and waffles but the taste is definitely there. I ordered the ODB and ooh ooh baby let me describe it for you.  Let me talk about the layers.  The outer shell of the chicken is a golden brown extra crispy crunch that has the perfect saltiness and texture. Underneath lies the juicy oily meat in all its glory that adds beautiful contrast to the crunch. The waffle on the bottom also shares similarities in its crunchy outer edge but the inside has a fluffy cloud like pillow just waiting to be devoured. It comes with some red sauce that resembles barbeque sauce but drizzle some maple syrup to add some sweetness to it and add in the refreshing coleslaw on the side to balance all the flavors excellently. Truly delicious."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles is a perfect combination. However, though I get the quick-bite feel with the bar stools, I wish the place was cleaner inside with more room for seating."}
{"text":"I am missing something.  The sauces are very vinegary and not hot at all - seriously no spice. Wth?"}
{"text":"I've been here twice at 12:00 and the wait was ok, 15-20 minutes. I don't think their chicken and waffles are that good, personally I prefer Cluck Clucks on the Esplanade which are much fluffier and taste very fresh. However, I will keep coming back to Dirty Bird for their Dirty fries which are seriously the best loaded fries I've had. They use their special sauce, along with fried onions, cheese and other toppings to create a dish that is super flavourful. I highly recommend getting the fries even though fried chicken is supposedly their speciality."}
{"text":"Their chicken and waffles. In fact, anything on their menu is bomb.com! Go now! Here's the ODB, Dirty Bird'ger, and the Dirty Club. You'll leave smelling like fried chicken though."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite \"halal\" chicken and waffle spot. It has a fast food joint setting however the waffles and chicken are made fresh (chicken was supper tender) with poured warm maple syrup. I would it say it's not as amazing as Insomnia as this more of a fast food joint setting vs intimate restaurant; however it does take care of any late night chicken and waffle cravings and would come back here again and again."}
{"text":"Check out the speakeasy bar across the street inside that sketchy mall (if you find the red light, you find the entrance), they serve Dirty Bird chicken with beer as a combo (Dirty Bird itself is not licensed), from 5-9PM only. BEST FRIED CHICKEN in town."}
{"text":"Loved it! Yes there was a line but it went by quickly and everyone managed to find a seat. We ordered 2 ODB and they were fantastic. The portion size was great. The chicken was well seasoned and crispy which was well complemented with the buttermilk pancakes. We are dying to go back and I've recommended it to so many people already."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place and finally had a chance to try it on a Sunday evening. Ordered the ODB, Original Dirty Bird, which consisted of a large boneless quarter leg of chicken on top of a waffle with buttered maple, dirty sauce and your choice of macaroni, coleslaw or potato salad.  The chicken was delicious, hand battered and perfectly fried. There was a good crunch to every bite and the flour blend that they used made for a consistent flavour throughout. The waffle they was a simple, regular waffle which was good but parts of it did become soggy because of the heat coming from the chicken. The coleslaw was just ok, as I prefer a creamier slaw, and the macaroni that my buddy had tasted much better.  The staff are friendly, although they did confuse my order initially with someone else's, but we had ordered the same thing so it worked out, but there weren't too many people in the restaurant at the time. The washrooms tell a different story, it is like a maze to use them and to find your way back up to the restaurant. They have signs to point you in the right direction but not to which door leads you back. It seems that the washrooms are shared amongst a few other establishments. All in all, a great place to have chicken & waffles."}
{"text":"$15.00 dollars for ONE PIECE OF CHICKEN.   I got the ODB (their special) and while it tasted good, I cannot fathom why one S I N G L E fried piece of chicken costed me a whopping $15. Okay, I come from southern United States and let me tell you, chicken and waffles are PEASANT FOOD OKAY? IT COSTS NEXT TO NOTHING TO PRODUCE. This place is nothing but a hipster gimmick, I am so disappointed.   \"but lynda, it came with waffles and a potato salad\" No. The waffles were Leggo My Eggo' quality, and the salad was mediocre. I'd rather go to Popeyes."}
{"text":"just got back from a decent meal at the dirty bird. the place was packed but seats were turned over relatively quick. was a bit of a wait but my meal (The Clucker) was cooked to order and hot and fresh. i'd definitely go back.   my only negative comment would be the high number of staff on shift. it was distracting and was the first thing i noticed when i walked up to the counter to place my order. i'd say there were probably 8 of them crammed into the prep space practically tripping over each other. it just looked very disorganized and inefficient.   but like any new place, you gotta go thru the growing pains and i'm sure the owners will figure it out soon enough (especially when they see their labour costs as a % of sales :).   after they sort that out they will probably have a winner on their hands like their neighbours to the south at Seven Lives.   wishing them luck and welcome to the market!  p.s. note to cashier....that hulk tip jar looks mighty cool and all but if i can't figure out where the hole is to toss my tip into, i'm probably not going to bother. you gotta trust me on this!"}
{"text":"The original dirty bird (ODB) chicken and waffle is tremendous! Great crispy boneless chicken, with a good waffle and tasty sauce!   Only problem is the place is a bit tight, and it isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for. A good place to eat at if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 30 right before closing. They kept the kitchen open until we ordered, ate, and hung out for a bit. 5 star for the customer service.  We ordered the  chicken & waffles, dirty fries, and wings. Everything was amazing. We came back the next day just to try out the chicken sandwich which was bomb. 5 star for the food. If you're in the area, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here on opening day and was pretty busy on a Wednesday afternoon. We got the Clucker with buffalo wings and waffle and the tato salad along with the dirty bird'ger. The sandwich was disappointing as there was more bread than anything and the bun was cold. Would come back to try the ODB Classic chicken and waffles since the chicken itself was pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"The idea of eating waffles and fried chicken combined is the only thing that makes the food here enjoyable to eat. I appreciate the waffles being light but they taste no better than paper. The chicken tastes very bland too, it seems the batter isn't spiced at all. You'd think the sauce they provide would do the magic, but it adds nothing but extra calories. I think if another store would compete against them, their quality would improve!"}
{"text":"I had the old dirty clucker which was almost 16 dollars it was good with the dirty sauce and quite big but the deal you get at stockyards is way better and I believe stocyards chciken  waffles taste alot better as well. The chciken is tender here and the sauce is good but I don't know there is still something missing"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this place. It's a small and hip space with a clever menu. I was instantly greeted and assisted with the menu. I went with the ODB which has a chicken quarter, a waffle, and a side. Everything was sooooo good! There was just enough syrup and their \"dirty sauce\" to add the right touch. They even share their space with a froyo place so dessert is right there with you! I'm so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Gluten free and delicious. Good for take out but they have a few seats too. Definitely a hole in the wall. avoid the bathroom. Food was great though."}
{"text":"It's my first time at this location, upon walking it I immediately notice its more spacious space and the staff were welcoming (probably because we were the only customers in at the time, 5pm on a Friday).  My friends both ordered the ODB while I ordered the Up North Trip along with beers (which is exclusive to this location).  The chicken are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - flavourful throughout."}
{"text":"Got the \"Dirty Bird'ger\" - fried chicken burger with waffles as the buns. Best I've had in Canada. A friend of mine got the  signature poutine and said it was amazing. Another got the 3 piece and fries and also said the same. The chicken is well seasonedand the waffles were the perfect combination of fluffy and crispy on the edges.  It is a smaller location, as it is in Kensington Market, so not too much dining space, though apart from a seating bar around the window and one against the wall, I went with a group of 7 people, and they do have a table in the middle that accommodated us well.   It is a little hipster joint, so like the best of them, not well lit, cool atmosphere, pierced & tatted staff, clever menu names and good food."}
{"text":"Well the line up was a good sign for what was to come. Who can resist chicken and waffles for a late brunch!?!  The chicken was crispy, flavorful and moist. Definitely go for the bone-in version. I found the seasoning a tad salty but this was toned down by the sweet maple syrup (the real deal of course) and the fluffy waffle.   Overall a good choice. However in the world of fried chicken wars I still say that I prefer The Stockyards because of their more interesting take on their syrup and to due for biscuits (Yes I still have room for it!).   If you're in the Kensington area this is still a great choice."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!!  We passed by three times, mostly because they were always busy or because we were looking for a restaurant with a patio. But I am sorry we didn't come sooner. We ordered the Great White North, 3 crunchy chicken tenders with a  maple buttered waffle and scotch bonnet ranch. And the Dirty Fries are wonderful! They come with a zesty bbq sauce, fried onions, cheese and taste amazing with the scotch bonnet ranch!    I hope these guys continue doing this right and eventually expand, cause the only thing that would make this better is a nice cold beer and table seating! Rock on dirty bird!!!"}
{"text":"After reading many reviews before trying Dirty Bird, I gave in and dropped by one Sunday for lunch. My two friends and I were all trying this place for the first time and so got the Original ODB, this came with a piece if chicken, waffle, and a size, after taxes and everything it was around $18. To me, this was pretty pricey so it had better be good. It smelled really good but the chicken was very very salty. Tho admittedly I eat pretty bland, but my other friends also exclaimed how salty it was. The amount of sauce for the chicken, like other reviews said, was lacking, tho anymore and it would have been even more salty. The waffle due to the sauce, was not crunchy and crisp. I got the potatoe salad as a side which was probably the best part. My friends got the coleslaw which for some reason tasted like they added yogurt, but it still wasn't bad. The portion sizes were pretty big (tho I did eat a bit beforehand) so I did pack up half of it to go but if you're a guy and hungry, this will probably just fill you.  Overall, the taste of the chicken is great, but its very salty, overpriced and the waffle is just any other waffle.  The place is small and its usually quite the wait so be wary if you want to try this place!  **UPDATE** Although my rating for this place was not high, I got a very generous message from the owner for a meal and how they appreciate the feedback to improve their restaurant. I always love places that try their best to improve based off feedback so kudos to them for doing this, especially since they are not a chain restaurant. Will definitely look forward to going back and updating this review again."}
{"text":"The food was good but I wouldn't come back again. Price was a little expensive and also the staff there are so disrespectful. I was ordering but the cashier just took out her phone and told me and my girlfriend to hold up so she can call someone. After we got the food we sat down and ate, while eating the staff was swearing at each other and talking rudely loud. Tbh I would never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Chicken was ok, was a little stringy if that makes sense (pulled off in straight strips). Not enough syrup on the waffle. Lack of description on the different sauces they have. North Trip doesn't have any sauce whatsoever unless you buy it, and when you do the sauce portion is small."}
{"text":"I only got to try the Dirty Bird'ger that cost $7 and it was really delicious! Service was amazing too. Not only did they give us (party of 4) a free dessert which was the Swalty but also a free ice cream. And did I mention, free dessert? I mean Yay! Space was small but that didnt bother me so yes I'm giving them a 5! Ahuh."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but they aren't absolutely amazing. Their waffles should be a little bit lighter and sweeter but they were very solid and didn't go extremely well with the meat. I also wish they weren't so expensive because $16 for waffle and meat is quite expensive.   The people working behind the restaurant always seem a little bit pissed off and impatient if you cannot decide on what you want to eat"}
{"text":"The ODB - $15 I have tried most of the items at Dirty Bird and the ODB will always hit the spot for me. I don't know how they do it. Even with takeout or delivery, the deep fried chicken at Dirty Bird have consistently been fried to perfection and NEVER GREASY (!!). The breading on the chicken was not too thick and the skin was super crispy with a juicy and tender meat, the seasoning was just on point! The only complain here would be the waffle which have always been too soft my liking. Though it was airy on the inside, I prefer waffles that have a bit more crisp and richness to stand up against the chicken. I didn't really care much for the coleslaw as it was just average, but I appreciated how it wasn't drenched in dressings. Overall, what really tied the whole dish together for me is their signature \"dirty sauce.\" The combination of sweetness from maple syrup with the tangy and spicy-ness of the dirty sauce created the ultimate chicken and waffle sauce."}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. tbh this place was one of the highlights of my toronto trip. bomb. so yummy. i dream shut the crispy fried chicken... the sauce they topped it with... the waffle. will definitely return if i'm ever in toronto again!"}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere and the food. The chicken waffle sandwich looks amazing! I however ordered three piece chicken with a dirty fry.  The fry was sweet and odd.  Accustomed taste in my opinion.  Chicken was finger licking good.  Will def return for more more more"}
{"text":"Fortunate for Dirty Bird, the taco place next door doesn't take Debit card. Small place with very limited seating.  We ordered two sandwiches and an order of the Dirty Fries. After paying, we asked if they would switch the 1 Dirty into 2 regular fries. The front desk guy was fine with that and advise us that because it would be $1 cheaper that he would throw in some extra sauce in the side to even it out. We didn't mind.   The sandwiches were great. I order the $15 sandwich with chicken and beef bacon piled in between some waffles. Pour on some of their maple syrup and you have something really special.  This place is awesome. People were coming in and out while we were there.    My only complaint other than the limited seating was the bees! They were everywhere and turned lunch into a warzone. The employees need to work on that.    If I ever go back to Toronto I will Definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and got delivery once. I noticed the first time that they kind of seemed to be prioritizing Foodora orders (as in delivery guys would be in and out the whole time, whereas we had to wait like 30 mins for our food). So the next time I wanted chicken + waffles (or rather, the next time my husband wanted chicken + waffles), we also just got delivery through Foodora. The third time, I took a friend who was visiting from out of town to get the dine-in experience. Again, we waited about 20 minutes but to be fair, we were told upfront how long the wait would be and it wasn't a big deal for us.   Got the ODB, the Up North Trip and the dirty fries. Same as what I got the first time. Food was excellent! The chicken is crispy but not too greasy at all. Everybody I've eaten with here has really enjoyed it.   A couple of notes: - Seating in the restaurant is kind of limited, but it clears up fast as well as the wait time for food is on the long side. The little hooks under the tables to hang your bag are nice.   - The first time we went we were served on trays. The second dine-in experience I had, we were given the chicken and waffles in a takeout box, despite the fact that we were dining in. It was a Tuesday evening close to closing time, so I don't know if that had an impact or this is just a thing now that the restaurant doesn't serve on plates. We did ask for a plate/tray and were told there weren't any. Made it less instagrammable for my friend for sure. Obviously not so environmentally conscious either.    - Nothing negative to say about the food. It is delicious! However, I know there's been some confusion about whether The Dirty Bird is actually halal or not. I know lots of fellow Muslims who want to come, but since HalalFoodie told us there's been a  supplier change and they can't confirm if the new supplier is still halal chicken, many have been confused."}
{"text":"I like to stop in to The Dirty Bird for chicken wings when I can't make my own for one reason or another. They have three flavours up on their menu, however, I believe I heard a fourth being mentioned and now see it online.. Jerk BBQ. My favourite are the Buffalo, they are not hot by my standards, but they have great flavour. The dry and dirty are also quite good. The wings are bigger than most wings you would get when you order out, and the chicken itself is juicy and good. They have kept me coming back, and not looking elsewhere so I definitely would recommend the wings if you were looking to try something else on the menu. I would also recommend the dirty fries which are incredibly yummy with all of the toppings!  Every time I have been in there I have been met with great customer service! Notably on a very busy, and hectic evening, the person taking the orders was friendly and kind.. and when I had waited for a bit a cook from the back ensured me he was taking care of my order. It was crazy busy and I was in no rush, but I really appreciated him touching base with me... Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Dirty Bird has some of the best fried chicken in Toronto! Paired with their fluffy waffles, this place hits the spot.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of sweet and savoury, but the flavour combinations here work very well.  The only thing I don't like about this place is their portion/price ratio. Basically, you either have to get a ~$7 meal that won't fill you, or a ~$15 meal that's way too much food for one person - there's no in between."}
{"text":"We pinned this place in preparation for our trip to Toronto.  It is located in Kensington Market. They usually are able to take card, but was cash only when we visited.  I got the big dirty - it is very big and was super delicious. The chicken was breaded perfectly and the chicken was nice and juicy.  I am not a fan of mac slaw - I just can't enjoy cold mac n cheese - but my boyfriend loved it and ate both of ours.  Staff was friendly and the environment was very laid back.  Glad we got to stop by and try out their food!"}
{"text":"Went in on a whim and was not disappointed. I had the ODB and my husband had the poutine. Poutine was good...had pulled chicken on it and was tasty, although not entirely unique tasting, but that's fine for this type of place. I had the ODB and it was AMAZE-BALLS! The chicken was a huge portion, on a full waffle. The waffle was the perfect blend of sweetness, with just a bit of syrup and the chicken was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart. It had a great sauce on top and the slight kick, blended with the sweetness of the waffle, was a great mix. Portion size was good, food was delicious. Came with a little cup of potato salad...liked the peas, nice touch and the potato salad was a refreshing touch for the whole dish. Still thinking about it hours later....thinking and thinking....*sigh*"}
{"text":"I had the ODB a few times. The food here is delicious and always hits the spot! I never hesitate to revisit."}
{"text":"Very delicious and something new that I haven't tried before. It's really good for people who have yet to try out the new and trendy chicken and waffles. I ordered the club which is one of the signature meals and is where two waffles enclose some fried chicken, lettuce and tomato. It was a bit plain, but once you add the maple syrup it was very tasty. Great portions for when you're hungry! The fries are also good too."}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible. We had not planned on going in. However, when we saw this place my boyfriend really wanted to try it as the Kensington location is always too busy. We were looking at the menu while a kid stood at the cash register waiting impatiently for us to decide. We felt like we were bothering him. We ordered only 1 plate to share because we felt so pressured to say something.  They made us pay upfront and told us they'd call our name once it was ready.... I was about to get up and ask for a refund after waiting over 20 minutes.There was only another couple that came in 10 minutes after us. NOT BUSY AT ALL! Not sure why the long wait.   The food was really good. Almost as good as back home but definitely not made with any love or care. I can taste it.   The STAFF was rude. Not even a \"Hello, Welcome, Have y'all been here before?\" We normally ask the staff for a suggestion but I felt VERY UNWELCOME!  Plus it was so dirty. Period! Should have known as the word DIRTY is in the name. The tables were all filthy. We had to wipe one down ourselves. The ketchup bottles had hard crusty old ketchup caked all over the lids. Plus food all over the floor. Believe me there was enough staff there to come out with a cloth and wipe things down. The place is small so it would have taken 5 minutes.  I reckon we will never go back here. I can get better service with a smile at McD"}
{"text":"Went back and the chicken & waffles are  fantastic! The chicken was moist and full of flavour. The waffle was fluffy and light. We also added the dirty fries and they amazing! A must get as the fries are cooked to perfection and the toppings make these fries like no other in the city."}
{"text":"The chicken is super crispy and tender, the waffles are light and fluffy, and the sauces are great. I've got nothing but good things to say about the food here, they just lost a couple of stars on the price point. I'm always willing to pay a little more for quality, but this is a bit of a stretch. That being said, if you opt to skip the waffle and just get a few pieces and a side, it makes things a little more palatable for your wallet."}
{"text":"Went to Dirty Bird for Sunday brunch, arrived right after opening at 11 a.m, and decided to go for the ODB - the Original Dirty Bird. The verdict after about 15 minutes was mouth watering goodness with a side of disappointment.   The chicken was crispy and tender in all the right places, the waffle was fresh and fluffy though a little too soft, and the sauce/syrup was just the right amount of sweet and salty that it complimented the meal well. Unfortunately, the potato salad I got on the side was very underwhelming, and the overall price was too steep for the type of place this is, and the offering provided. There should definitely be options there for a small and large portion. I'd have gone for the smaller one.   While it was a good enough experience that I would recommend it to others, I'm not sure I'd go back a lot. The limited seating, average waffle, sad side dish and mad price would make me rethink it. This was going to be a 3.5/5 but the chicken itself deserves an extra half star. The chicken was good. The chicken was great."}
{"text":"The Dirty Bird invited me back to give them another try, on the house! So my friend and I went back to DB Chicken & Waffles to give them another shot.   This time, I knew exactly what I was getting well before I went. The first time I went, I assumed I should really stick with something basic, so I got the wings and waffles, when I was *really* eyeing their Dirty Club. So this time, it was all about the Dirty Club.   DID. NOT. DISAPPOINT.  WOW. Should have gone with this in the first place!! Epic. Legendary. Can't even begin to describe how much my tastebuds danced around in my mouth on this one. Who would think that deep fried chicken, beef bacon (oh yes, and it actually mattered that it wasn't pork bacon - completely different flavor profiles and the beef bacon was CLUTCH in this sandwich), tomato, lettuce and maple aioli would be perfection on a waffle sandwich. It got better the more I ate and then once I drowned it in maple syrup, it was even better. I couldn't get enough of this sandwich. If you haven't had it, stop what you're doing, get off your ass and go get one. You won't regret it!  The staff were great this time, very friendly and one of the owners/manager/not-sure-who-but-he-looked-like-he-was-in-charge came by to make sure everything was okay. All in all, a great joint, great food and worth the trip!! Be careful though, you may walk right by it if you don't know where it is.  My only complaint? More seating. There's just not enough places to sit and enjoy your meal, we had to wait for someone to vacate. Or just take your grub home; the sandwich seemed like the type that would hold up well to being transported home!"}
{"text":"Gluten free fried chicken and waffles!?! Yes please! These guys are amazing with answering any food questions related to gluten. Their chicken batter is gluten free to allow a crispier coating and they have a dedicated waffle iron for gluten free.  The chicken!! Is melt in your mouth juicy with a beautiful crunch and flavour to the coating. The waffle makes a nice balance of sweet to the chicken's salty. The coleslaw is fresh and crisp and the fries are crispy on the outside and tender inside. We walked away full and happy, eager to return."}
{"text":"I was so hyped to try this place after seeing how good it looked on instagram.  Specifically went downtown just to try it!  Price Range (Not Including Tax and Tip): Chicken and Waffles are around $14-$17. It's pricey for more of a quick stop restaurant.   Food Quality (Taste, Menu, Serving Portion): 3/5 I had the Great White North which is 3 pieces of white meat chicken breast tenders. It tasted good, the chicken was crispy and the sauce complimented the chicken well. It didn't meet my expectations which might be my fault because I expected a lot. I found the meal kind of boring near the end. The portion size isn't overly big compared to other restaurants where I've had a similar dish. I would say it's not the best value because for how much I paid, I wasn't as full as I expected. It came with a very small side, I got the coleslaw. The menu isn't overly big but it's not suppose to be cause it's mainly just a chicken and waffles place.   Atmosphere: 2/5 It's pretty small and combined with a yogurt place. Theres not many seats available so if it's busy it's tough for you to get a spot. This place is better for small groups of 2-5. The restaurant is pretty basic looking which isn't a bad thing. If you're using the TTC it's about 3-5 min walk from Bathurst station. If you're driving, you will most likely need to park on a side street farther away if you don't want to pay for parking.   Service : 4/5 It's not like a dine-in restaurant, so the service is only really when you go up to order and pay for it. What I will say though is the people there were really nice, were really helpful in deciding what to go and really easy going. They would come by to check on how we liked the meal which was nice.   Would I go here again? I would maybe give the Kensington location a shot to see if it's different. I did like the food but this place feels a bit more hype than substance."}
{"text":"This was my first time having chicken and waffles and man, did we ever pick a good place to set the bar high! I had the ODB ($15) - boneless thigh and leg, waffle, buttered maple, dirty sauce with coleslaw. The chicken skin is crispy as hell and the meat is juicy and tender. Initially, the thought of chicken and waffles seemed too dry for my liking (I'm a saucy kind of gal), but this place includes a tangy, spicy chili/tomato sauce on top of the chicken (the dirty sauce) that really made the dish for me. The combination of sweet from the maple syrup with the tangy-ness from the dirty sauce created the ULTIMATE chicken and waffles sauce.    This place gets super busy during peak hours. Seating is very limited and people are always scouring for seats. We had to wait 15-20 mins just to place the order. Service is friendly, but very slow for just a chicken and waffle place - you'd think they'd be banging them out left and right."}
{"text":"HOLYYYY chicken and waffles heaven! And their poutine with pulled chicken mmm - if you leave here hungry something is seriously wrong with you ... and this location has froyo too!!! So you can have dessert if you can even manage that after :)"}
{"text":"Update: After my initial review, the owner explained that dirty bird was not operating at its best when it first opened. He sent me a free meal to give it another try, and I'm glad I took his offer.   Everything has improved greatly since it opened.   I ordered the ODB again.   The waffle looks more appealing, the batter isn't as bland. Way better than when the shop first opened.   Now let's get to the meat of the review. Chicken : batter has also improved a lot. The colour is darker, more appealing. There was just the right amount of batter for a nice crunch but not too much that I had to excavate the chicken meat. The chicken itself was very juicy and the seasoning was on point.   On the chicken was a generous serving of their dirty sauce with complemented the chicken and waffle well. I also enjoyed it with some of the syrup on the table.   Good job on  listening to customer reviews and improving things! This will become a fried chicken go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I enjoy the hot sauce they put on the chicken. I had the ODB and I could have eaten 10 more! I went on a Saturday afternoon prior to a big rainstorm so it was very empty. The service was good. I wish they recycled. The potato salad kinda sucks.  Can't wait to come back and try dessert!"}
{"text":"Heard mixed reviews about Dirty Bird, so I decided to try it out for myself.  Went on a few occasions and had different items: The ODB (Boneless Quarter Leg, Waffle, Buttered Maple, Dirty Sauce), dirty tenders (chicken tenders), and dirty fries.   The store has a contemporary appearance although there is very limited seating. The service is pretty fast and efficient, including  if you get takeout. You can place orders in advance as well. But If you decide to wait, the food is still prepared quite fast and is fresh. AND you get nice little take-away boxes and cutlery to eat on the go.   The staff are also very helpful and friendly and are happy to answer any questions and make suggestions.   However, I am not that big of a fan of the flavours. The chicken, while not oily, tastes extremely deep fried. The food is fresh but it tastes very processed. The chicken is crispy, but flavours seemed heavily masked in my opinion. I also don't really like the sauces that much, and you do not really get to choose what sauce you want (though I have not asked if I could change the sauces).   The food is also quite heavy. It is very filling and you definitely get value for the food (despite not looking like it's a lot - it is a lot). The macaroni salad was pretty good I have to say.That being said, the prices are on the more expensive side. I paid close to $20 for the ODB which is a bit much for a lunch.   In all it's not bad, but it's quite pricey. Perhaps a sit down experience opposed to takeout would be different."}
{"text":"Tried chicken and waffles for the first time here and it was good. A bit of a wait for the food but we weren't in a rush and didn't mind the 10 minutes. Server was courteous and friendly. Definitely best for take out as the seats and tables just weren't comfortable"}
{"text":"Very good! Wow.  The Dirty Bird was either a hit or miss for yelpers, as for me, it was definitely a hit.  It was my first time having fried chicken and waffles, so I got the classic ODB. The waffle was light and fluffy and had a nice crisp on the outside. The chicken was fried perfectly. What brought the two together was the syrup and the dirty sauce, they were a match made in heaven to create some really awesome sweet and savoury goodness.  We got our food within 5-10 minutes on a Sunday around noon, so service was pretty decent.  Although on the pricier side, I'd say that it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I moseyed on up to the counter and asked the nice guys behind it if the Up North Trip would travel well. One of them said it was probably the only menu item that travels. Noticing the lack of \"travels WELL\" I decided to gamble and order it to go. It took about 30 minutes to get home and while the food wasn't piping hot, a lot of the chicken skin was still crispy as ever.  Usually the flavour ends at the crispy skin but not with this bird. The chicken meat itself was so moist and flavourful - I got hints of rosemary? The seasoning was pretty unique in my opinion, relying more on herbs than black pepper. The potato salad was also very good and gave me some inspiration for my own potato salads this bbq season. I think the lowest point of the meal was the waffle. It was just a waffle and it was good but throw some sort of seasoning in there please like some chives or black pepper or something.  While I ate the entire meal myself this time, I would recommend sharing it with another person. It's a lot of food! Throw in a dessert if you're eating in and the whole things comes up to a reasonable dining-out-in-Toronto-for-2 price.  Last note - excellent music selection."}
{"text":"After Josh's assurance that The Dirty Bird would redeem themselves with better food, I decided to give it a try.  Josh didn't lie. The Dirty Bird was actually better this time. I ordered the same dish, the ODB, in order to keep my taste bud consistent. I believe that they they had a lot of improvement in the seasoning of the chicken (and dirty sauce). Instead of being overwhelmed by the grease, I could actually enjoy the flavor, and even the texture of the chicken. The dirty sauce balanced the meal really well this time, too. A bit of sourness & saltiness went really well with the waffle!!  I just have one suggestion to the restaurant - have you ever thought about creating a dish that uses chicken breast instead of legs? If you are confident of your marinade & coating, you should really give it a try.  At the end, I am really glad that I came back - and I really appreciated the fact that, Josh, the owner of the Dirty Bird, actually listened to what customers say about their food. The sincerity of improving their food & their restaurant is something worth me giving a 5 stars rating (although I think the food is still a bit overpriced)."}
{"text":"Meh, nothing special here.  The restaurant tries to be super hip through its decor and weird abbreviations on its menu (like \"tato salad\"), but I wasn't feeling it. There is a Froyo yogurt store tucked in the back of the restaurant, which is pretty unique. There's also a sign that says \"No alcohol beyond this point\", which suggests they're trying to get licensed.  I wasn't feeling like waffles, so I got three three piece meal with my choice of macaroni salad on the side. With a fountain drink, the total came to $12. The chicken itself was disappointing. I was expecting something exceptional, but it was pretty dry and about as tasteless as fried chicken can get. Tastes more like Shake 'n' Bake than Popeyes or KFC. I think they put maple syrup flavour in the batter, which is kind of unique but didn't appeal to me.  The macaroni salad had a weird taste. I'm not sure if wasn't past its due date.  Not planning on coming here again. The forced 'hip' vibe turned me off, and the chicken is more expensive and less tasty than the conventional fast food fried chicken restaurants."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS I was impressed... I never fell for the chicken and waffles hype, until I came here. The chicken was crisp and moist. The waffle, was surprisingly good. Flavour, texture, everything was actually on point. Usually with other restaurants its a hit or miss and they never get both right. I was reading some previous reviews here and was surprised with the low ratings. The only thing that would need improvement is the sides. Wasn't too impressed with the slaw, my friend said the mac and cheese side wasnt good either.  Yes, it is a little odd that they share a space with a frozen yogurt joint, but it actually is barely noticeable once you're eating that food. Customer service was fine, and staff seemed pretty knowledgeable. MmmmMMMmm cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came with my boyfriend, he got chicken and waffles with chicken tenders. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. I thought it was like The Starving Artist's chicken sandwich that is chicken in between waffles but it was just a plain sandwich. The chicken was dry and old. You could tell it was reheated. It was drenched in sauce to hide the dryness. The bread was stale. And worst of all the bathrooms are next level disguising. Like Public health needs to come in and fine them. Absolutely horrid, two of the stalls were clogged; no soap... for a restaurant that charges the prices they do at least have a bathroom someone can use. Honestly, this place is overrated and not worth the hype."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles are very tasty and moist. However, the wait is very long even after you order it.  It is a bit pricey for what it is.   Recently a new chicken and waffles place near my work opened up called Cluck Clucks which I feel is equivalent or better with a better value."}
{"text":"Holy mother of god, this is some seriously good fried chicken. So good that I ordered it twice via Hurrier in one week! Ok, so the chicken was nice and crispy and was not covered in grease, nor did the oil ooze out after taking a bite - well done! I also ordered the Buffalo Wings which were also delicious but half a pound only get's you 4 wings. As for the sides, the fries were solid but were somewhat soggy. Im sure this was due to the delivery service. The coleslaw was decent (not great) but the portion is on the smaller side that came in a tiny condiment container. Overall, the best fried chicken I have had in the city. The only negative I can think of is my future cholesterol level."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles is just such a southern notion, and seeing it all the way up here in Canada is definitely exciting. First spotted on blogTO, and this is not my usual point of recommendation. I usually rely on good ol' Yelp!   Walking in, I really appreciated the amount of seating that was set up - this contrasts a lot from next door Seven Lives. BF and I ordered the \"The Up North Trip\" (3Pc Bone-In, Waffle, Buttered Maple with Coleslaw or 'Tato Salad for $13)  and settled in for a 10 minute wait. The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. No complaints, only compliments for the chicken. The waffle, though, is where I failed to be impressed. The spots that the chicken had rested on was soggy, and it didn't hold up very well. Portion was decent for the price, and the salad was just fine.  My personal favourite was using the purse/coat hooks that was readily available all over (or I should say, under) the seating area. Made the stool-style seats a lot easier to manage!   Just be prepared for what happens 2 hours later. You'll need about 2 bottles of water to rehydrate!"}
{"text":"We got the original dirty bird, I thought it was delicious. Took awhile for them to make it but I thought it was worth it. It was a good portion size and the chicken was fried to perfection! Staff was friendly as well , would come here again."}
{"text":"Didn't take a picture of the chicken and waffle but it was delicious. The chicken was so juicy and the sauce it comes with (whatever it is) was so good, definitely a must try. I've had chicken waffle where it was too spicy and dry at other places but i really enjoyed this one. Amazing flavour. The chicken waffle burger ($7) was kinda messy to eat but delicious as well.   The place is small but the atmosphere is great. It was quite busy so finding a spot to eat was kind of difficult, but it gave off a really friendly and fun vibe. The people there were friendly, even other customers. Everyone was just trying to have a good time and enjoy good food!   Definitely coming back for more next time !"}
{"text":"This place is neat. Very near 7 lives so you can do both if you truly want a good cheat day! Fried chicken was ok and the coleslaw had a taste of vanilla in it. I'd like stockyards more for chicken and waffles though and it's a pretty penny for a piece."}
{"text":"The Dirty Bird recently opened up its second location, just east of the intersection of Bathurst & Bloor. As you approach the entrance, you'll notice the front window that opens up garage door style (a big bonus in warmer weather).  The interior is spacious and thoughtfully designed so that patrons in the lineup aren't crammed next to those enjoying their meals. Compared to the dining room at their Kensington Ave. diner, this spot is significantly more comfortable and bright.  The space is now shared with a new neighbour (Yogurty's), so if the waffles and desserts aren't enough for your sweet tooth, fro-yo is just a few steps away. Kudos to ownership for all of the new improvements.   Must-try items: The Dirty Bird'ger Dirty Fries Chicken Wings The ODB The Clucker The Dirty Club  The food is the main attraction here, and there are enough options to keep you coming back for more. I thoroughly enjoyed the Dirty Bird'ger, Dirty Fries, and chicken wings (a comfort food lovers dream). A staff member and I jokingly nicknamed my meal 'The Dirty Threesome', which fits right in with the assortment of creatively named menu items.   Prices on certain items may seem slightly steep, but the portion sizes and delicious tasting grub should be enough to keep you satisfied. With a strong visual brand and sound marketing strategy in place, The Dirty Bird looks to become a staple in the downtown core in the coming years. I don't predict that the 'Northern Fried Chicken' trend is going to disappear any time soon."}
{"text":"Wish I had gotten the ODB, but I went for the Dirty Club and can't say it was mind-blowing like everyone claims it to be.The waffle was decent, but I actually thought the fried chicken could be better. It wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it to be. Also, for the high price, the portion is a little small.   I want to come back and try the ODB before I write-off this place, but as it currently stands, it's not my favourite place for chicken and waffles. However, it'll do the job if I'm in the area and craving fried chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"This is great. Finally a popular spot in the market that doesn't disappoint!   A friend got the ODB the other day and refused to give me a bite - now I see why. Easily the best fried chicken I've ever had. So tender inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. Yummy waffles and I love love the \"dirty sauce\".  Service was very friendly and attentive.  Great experience. I will be back"}
{"text":"Dirty Bird knows how to make a mean chicken and waffles. I like this location a lot better than Kensington because of the convenience as well as the spacious seating area. Although it's a bit odd for it to share space with a frozen yogurt shop, you don't even notice it once your food is ready.  Got the usual ODB and it didn't disappoint. My friend got the Bird-ger and it's pretty small for the price you pay. Staff were very friendly and there is about a 10 minute wait time - so don't come here if you're in a rush!  They also have daily specials ending at 4pm if you want to save a bit of money!"}
{"text":"The ODB is OMG crazy good. Who knew chicken and waffles went so well together? Oh wait, they did! Everything is made to order, so everything is steaming hot when you get it. The waffle is crispy and fluffy and the perfectly seasoned chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. There was just the right amount of buttered maple drizzled onto our warm waffle and the dirty sauce on the chicken was bomb, sort of like a sweet BBQ, just wish we had more of it. We got the potato salad on the side which I found to be bland. The damage was $15 but my friend and I split it and we were quite full after, just something to note if you and your guest aren't really hungry."}
{"text":"TLDR: Fried chicken and waffles. That's all you need to know. ____  Straight from the airport I came here. First meal in Toronto and I was not disappointed. It's not a huge spot, but lucky we were here on an off time and managed to snag some seats easily.  At the recommendation of the cashier, I got the ODB. Fried Boneless Thigh & Leg, Waffle, Buttered Maple, Dirty Sauce. The sauce is an asian inspired sweet and semi spicy sauce. It's perfect.  Amazing waffle too, fluffy and a really great flavor to it.  Side of macaroni. It's a cold macaroni salad, and it's delicious.  This is a large meal - I left stuffed! On the way out the cashier remembered our names and said, \"Have a good day Blue & Kris!\" - that level of customer service is rare. Coupled with the great food, this was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"After years of living in the area, I finally ventured out and tried The Dirty Bird and the food did not disappoint. There's always a line which I never really had time for but glad I did.   The chicken was moist (ugh, I hate that word too) and succulent. Crispy on the outside. The waffle, not so sweet but a good balance with the chicken and the bag of fries were really good as well. Coleslaw wasn't memorable but it's a chicken and waffles place, what do you expect!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this location with a friend for a quick lunch, this week. We both ordered an ODB and found it to be fucking fantastic. Excellent fried chicken (boneless thigh) over a buttery waffle with kickass maple syrup on the waffle and some kind of secret magic sauce on the chicken. The textures are exactly right without being soggy or greasy in any direction. It was just a great casual meal for a reasonable price.  I'm only knocking a star because the seating in this tiny location isn't my favorite. I hate sitting on backless, metal bar stools and would rather just stand -- which can be precarious while shoveling food into your face. Seating quirks aside, their food is delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food! It was delicious-- we got a meal called \"The Great White North\" which included a waffle and chicken strips as well as a side. The only downfall with this was that I could not substitute fries as a side. Even still, I added on an order of fries and it was totally worth it- not only because they were tasty, but because it was a large portion of them for a fair price. Reviews are mentioning that the meal value is too much, but I disagree. The food was delicious and fairly portioned. Also, there are comments that space is limited- though that is true, it is to be expected in Kensington Market. The best thing to do is to claim a seat (or have a friend claim seats) as soon as you get in and then go place your order. The service was quick and friendly. All in all, it is a recommendation I would make to anyone; I will certainly be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Dines here on Saturday, March 7. Had to wait for seats but didn't seem excessively busy. Very unfriendly service as I was trying to figure out a way to order 1 dish that both had a white and dark meat. Was told that the cole slaw was sold out only to find out other behind me were getting cole slaw since our order took over 20 minutes to come out. Ended up having some but wasn't sure why we weren't told that they were making more. More importantly, fried chicken was just okay so needed the kick from the hot sauce. Waffle wasn't airy at all with a very little maple syrup on top. The best part of the order was cole slaw that uses buttermilk in the dressing. So many better chicken & waffles place in town and alternatives in Kensington."}
{"text":"After an unsuccessful attempt at brunch, at a crowded unnamed establishment in the epicenter of douchbaggery, Liberty Village, I hit the Dirty Bird.  And I'm glad I did.  I am rating this solely as a take-out, because although I ate there, I got there when it opened, and ordered and ate with no issues.  But I can see it getting crowded, and although there is seating, it is very small, with absolutely no privacy.  Another thing, I have no idea about the wait when it's packed.  My husband and I both got the ODB, the boneless chicken thigh and leg on the waffle.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, the waffle was light.  The sauce on top really balanced the sweetness well.  It came with a side of coleslaw or potato salad.  A little pricey, but extremely filling.  Two people could easily split and order, but we're pigs, so we didn't."}
{"text":"Loved combination of chicken and waffle! Wish it was a little cheaper I guess . The order is made fast and I loved sauces."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place probably has some of the best fried chicken and macaroni salad I've ever tasted in Ontario. I just can't get over the lack of cleanliness. There were trays and food container strewn all over the tables and even some of the chairs/stools and both garbages were overflowing. I know that the bathrooms are shared by other businesses but they need to do better. I've never been in a worse bathroom. For that alone, I probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Way too pricey for what you get. I had high expectations for this place but after ordering one thing and it came to over $16 I was put off    I don't see the appeal of a place like this. The chicken was okay but the waffles were way too doughy and didn't have much flavour."}
{"text":"Service: The service staff was friendly and helpful. Food was prepared in a reasonable time even when there was a crowd.  Ambiance: A causal small space for a quick bite. Therefore, seating is a bit tight, only a few seats and a long table for sit-in dinning.   Food: The chicken was made fresh. The breading and seasoning was done well, making the outside skin crispy meanwhile leaving the meat moist. On the other hand, the waffle was plain. I ordered their signature Dirty Bird sandwich, and I found it a bit too heavy for my taste. I could barely finish the second half of the sandwich."}
{"text":"We came here late right before closing. I ordered the Great White North and a side of Macaroni salad. The chicken was overly battered, however they gave a pretty large serving, probably due to the time. The waffles were nothing to write about, however the Macaroni Salad was bomb. Would try again and would recommend if in the mood for chicken and waffles. :/"}
{"text":"I do hate the fa t that their menu doesn't match their Instagram .besides that fact the experience was great .well priced , tasty good portion o was happy .my only disappointment is coming from Miami to try the oxtail dish and they didn't have not the eggs benedict :/"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I got the Sticky Icky burger and it was probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The piece of chicken was very huge and crispy and the maple garlic flavor was out of this world. I don't know how they are able to find such a big piece of dark meat but man, I would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN AND WAFFLES TO EVER ENTER MY MOUTH.   Waffles are big and fluffy (they even take the time to scrape off the crispy edges) and chicken is moist and crunchy."}
{"text":"I've never had chicken and waffles before but I can't wait to go back! You can't really go here at prime time lunch or dinner because there isn't much seating but all I can say is I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I got the 2 piece with fries. It was fantastic. The pieces were hot, juicy and crispy. The fries were hot and crispy. It was definitely a meal that was satisfying. Don't forget to try their hot sauce because it's delicious. This place is definitely better than Popeyes."}
{"text":"The ODB at The Dirty Bird is definitely a good find. As a fan of chicken and waffles the traditional way, I was a little skeptical about the fact that the chicken was being served without the gravy. However, the sauce they use adds originality, and tastes pretty good as well. The chicken was nicely done, not too greasy, and the spices were dead on. Only thing that was a bit off was the portion size, a little small for $15. Other than that, if you're craving chicken and waffles, the ODB was pretty good! Don't go in there expecting to sit and eat though, because there isn't much room."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is located in Kensington market, with seating for around 15 people total. I decided to skip the waffle, and go for the 3pc Chicken + side. The Chicken comes out quickly, and juicy.  The rice flour outside is crispy and really well seasoned, but in terms of the inside, i couldn't tell if the Chicken is marinated with anything."}
{"text":"To my surprise \"The Dirty Bird\" is not a Taiwanese sex shop, but a regal little friend chicken place in The Kenzo. You love Popeye's, and you recently got a raise? Well, \"The Dirty Bird\" is where you should splurge on your cholesterol."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend today for a quick lunch. Please note that there is limited seating (maybe about 12 seats). Since we were planning to get dinner later, we split the ODB and Dirty Fries between us to share.  First of all, the ODB is so good. The waffles were well made, and the chicken was very juicy. It came with a little salad on the side (different options available; we got mashed potatoes which I was not a fan of). The best part of the ODB though was the sauce. I don't know how they make it, but if they were to bottle it up and sell it, I would buy ten. This was my first time trying chicken and waffles, and I finally see the hype behind it. The mix of savoury and sweet (from the syrup) is just so delicious, and the Dirty Bird honestly does this well. Second, the Dirty Fries were equally as good if not better. The best way I could describe it is that it tastes a little like pizza. I think they use the same sauce that was in the ODB, and it gives a nice little kick to the fries. Third, the service here is great. The cashier was super friendly, and so were the chefs. My friend and I were waiting for our food, and after someone got his order, the chef told us that he was working on ours. It was very sweet of him to touch base with us. I appreciated it.  Overall, despite the small space and slightly overpriced menu, the atmosphere that the employees created along with the amazing food would definitely draw me in as a repeat customer. Definitely try this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying the waffle/chicken combo and it will not be the last time! Having been a vegetarian for so long, I am still getting used to eating chicken wings. Was it messy, yes...did I get it everywhere, pretty much...but holy smokes it was so worth it!!   I came here with my friend for brunch on Sunday. We came at the right time, because after we ordered a line up formed. We both ordered 'The Clucker' which is wings, waffle and coleslaw or potato salad (we both had the coleslaw). I got honey garlic and my friend had buffalo...both were amazing as was the waffle and slaw! I haven't had wings at many places, but theirs were made to perfection...and they weren't all bone with little meat.   This place will be the perfect spot in the summer, when you can order to take out and sit in a park! But for now, eating in it is! A great addition to Kensington Market!"}
{"text":"After checking in to the Kensington location, I want to say the chicken and waffles are actually pretty good! Though, I would be wearily to say to try this location. I would definitely go to the Kensington Market location better! Plus, they have waffle Ice Cream sandwiches that look delectable!"}
{"text":"What a difference this location is compared to the one at Bathrust!   We came in on a Sunday night and it was packed. There was a line of at least 5 people. The server was swamped and it looked like they needed more help at the back with the orders coming in.   The chicken was crispy and tender on the inside. We decided to try to 'Up North' this time and it didn't disappoint. The waffle was nicely glazed in the maple syrup where the other location drenched the waffle in maple syrup. The waffle was warm and fluffy. It came with 3 pieces of chicken, 2 drumsticks and one chicken thigh.   I'm really glad we decided to give this place a second try! When we are in the area again, we will definitely venture out to the Dirty Bird for its crispy Chicken and fluffy waffles!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ODB with the potato salad and a side of fries. The breading of the chicken was really good and the chicken was moist...really moist...to the point where there was some spots of blood. Some people might like their chicken on the raw side but considering I waited approx. 10 minutes, I'd expect my chicken to be fully cooked. The waffle was standard, pretty good. The fries were oily and soggy and not worth the wait. I would not go back. My experience was below average. Not worth the price tag of $20."}
{"text":"Good tasting, small portion, expensive chicken and waffles.  I went to here with a friend while we are in the Kensington Market area. Before going here, I have heard this place is famous for its Chicken + Waffles, so I was so eager to try it out. However, I found this place is a bit expensive and small portion. It came with 2 pieces of small chicken. I think I could get better value of fried chicken at Popeyes. It did taste pretty good, but not that good that I am willing to spend around $15/person."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is delicious and crispy. Maccaroni salad was good. Food is a little pricy versus other alternatives but the quality makes up for it forsure."}
{"text":"I'm a fried chicken connoisseur. I  went here during  their national chicken day when they had their $2 for 2 pieces of chicken special with order of a side. It wasn't  enough  so I ordered another 2 piece meal and the lady at the counter ask me if my friend was coming later and I was like no....... its for me I'm eating 2 meals =).  As my sista, yelper \"Lettie L.\" has mention the side are quite small if you get their coleslaw or potato salad but if you get the fries instead the portions are good. The fried chicken  was made to order, meaning it was fresh, hot and juicy. However interns of flavor it didn't blow my mind as I had hoped but none the less it was cooked well. As sista yelper Lettie L. has mentioned there was a lingering celery salt after taste which both agree.   If you like fresh chicken, but  flavor is not so important this maybe the chicken for you."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh the Dirty Bird. Located right in the heart of the Kensington Market, downtown, this little gem of a place is situated in between two other amazing eateries that are a must try as well!  Today however, on the advice of a friend, we decided to give the old chicken and waffles a go. The service here was great. The gentleman behind the counter walked me through the pretty basic menu and I and the S/O ended up ordering the UP NORTH 3 piece meal and the Chicken club sandwich. I also ordered a side of Fries to give them a whirl.   Lets start with this, the chicken, was cooked to perfection! Golden brown and crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. The seasoning on the outside of the chicken was delightful and the meat inside was mouth watering. I was glad that I got the bone in 3 piece meal over the boneless 2 piece option known as the \"OBD\".   On to the sandwich, FRIGGIN MASSIVE! I had to help my S/O finish it, which was a task in itself because of the HUGE 3 piece meal I had ordered for myself. Both serving sizes were great at their price points and I felt that my money ($38) had been very well spent.   Now, the waffles were a little dry... no biggie. But they did lack some flavour.. I have had chicken and waffles all over Atlanta, and the waffles here werent even close to the ones I had tasted south of the border. But hey!, I guess thats why they call it NORTHERN fried. Anyways, moving along.. the waffles were still good, just not OMFG, GIVE ME MORE RN, good. As for the fries, they were A-OK, again, nothing out of this world, but you come here for the CHICKEN not the french fries. They were golden brown and soft on the inside, good enough for me.  All in all, this place was amazing. seating is very, very limited, I counted like 15 chairs or so, with only a couple tables.. the place is very small, but it works. Coat hangers under the table are a nice touch and very helpful, cause you'll want to take that jacket off when you dive into your plate!  I would definitely give this place a go at least a couple more times. The food is ON POINT, especially the chicken, I was absolutely blown away by the taste and quality of the chicken alone, and thats the reason ill be back! 3/5 till next time!"}
{"text":"Having first heard about Dirty Bird's fried chicken and waffles a few months ago, I was eager to try it out with a small group of close pals.  However, due to it's very limited seating area, it was more suited to today's intimate lunch date with Julia.  (Thanks Jules)  We each ordered one of Dirty Bird's signature dishes:  1) \"The ODB\" (boneless dark meat smothered in their house Dirty sauce, one large maple-drizzled waffle, and a side of 'Tato salad) and \"The Dirty Club\" (boneless dark meat, beef bacon, lettuce, tomato on waffle).  We shared each entree, and felt appreciation for how moist the lightly-battered chicken pieces and syrup-drizzled waffles are.  My health concern took over after receiving a strong sugar rush when finishing the syrupy waffle.  The Dirty Club was much lighter and easier to eat than the (very messy) ODB - something to note when ordering.  While the flavours were interesting and plating impressive, I don't feel the $15 price point was fitting.  With a drink, each diner will likely spend at-most $20 after-tax.  After the meal, we each left our sticky-surfaced table and stools to wash our hands in the basement bathrooms.  I had no idea it sits amidst an unclean underground network of doors and hallways under the restaurant and neighbouring shops.  (Kensington sometimes amazes, disappoints, and disgusts me)  I liked the meal, found strengths in the diligent (kitchen) crew, and showed a smile when I noticed the recent integration of UberEats into their delivery model.  The food, brand character, kitchen service, and delivery integration gets a 4 rating, but my thoughts on pricing and cleanliness lends a -1 demerit rating. For a semi-unique fried chicken experience, Dirty Bird will satisfy - but you may wish you hadn't spent too much for simple fried chicken."}
{"text":"All round meh . . . coupled with crap service. Food was fine, fell far short of expectations for the place given the  hype and ratings.  Went in when place was nearly empty, ordered 2 pieces and the clucker with the tato slaw and fries. After waiting a few mins I notice the table next to us was after picking up an order the same as ours but they had more in the party and seemed a bit confused by what they got and were up and down to the til, so I was a little suspicious they had got our order, but then they started picking at the food so I moved on. So when 20 mins later they are now picking up a second round of meals and throw 75% of what is now obv our meals out, I went go up to ask. Now I get mistakes happen but do not blame the hungry, now impatient customer. Apparently it was our fault we hadn't come up that someone else got our food.  Come on, if I see you give food to someone else I am not going to go try and take it. Given you have a receipt and name system, even if customers are silly enough not to recognise their own food you should make sure you check who you are giving it to. You could also alert us that a mistake had been made so we know why the wait is so long. Also when got the food then it was wrong so disappointing, when tried to explain it was wrong got blank face until I just got frustrated and walked away.  Also a little aircon please?"}
{"text":"I picked up the special boneless chicken bites and fries.  I got the maple surup sauce.  I probably should have gotten a savoury sauce because it was really swet paired with the fries.  I was in a bit of a hurry to eat before a movie so i just inhaled it.  Good value for the money though."}
{"text":"The Dirty Bird does chicken and waffles the right way! I tried both The ODB and The Great White North options on the menu. The waffles they make here are light and fluffy, and they tasted delicious on their own with just the maple syrup. But the highlight of this place, however, was definitely the fried chicken!  I'm not sure how they do it, but the chicken they make here has an amazing crispy exterior while maintaining the delicious and moist chicken meat within it. The best part of all was that it didn't taste greasy either! It was honestly some of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten =)  Overall, The Dirty Bird is a great place to get your chicken and waffles fix on! Even the chicken alone is worth coming for if you're not a fan of waffles ;)"}
{"text":"Dirty greasy food at its finest!! The sauce that goes with the original dirty bird waffles is to die for. The chicken is fried to perfection but a little bit on the dry on the inside. The waffles themselves are nothing special. What really makes this place special is the chicken + sauce combo!  Location wise, it's on the smaller side like many places in Kensington. It was quiet on a cold Sunday with plenty of seating but most likely gets busier once the weather warms up. This place would be OK for take out but the crispiness of your chicken would likely be lost by the time you bring it home.   What keeps this from being perfect are the plain sides that I feel do not go well with the chicken waffles themselves."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night 20 minutes before closing so by the time the food was ready we grabbed our food to go. Nonetheless the Dirty Bird Burger (waffle + crispy chicken) was super delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, probably the best chicken and waffles I've ever had...like ever...  The chicken was succulent, well marinated, and fried to absolute greatness. The waffle was soft and fluffy,  yet with crispy edges.  The buttered maple syrup was the perfection of savory and sweet, and was delicately swirled with scotch bonnet ranch dressing that coated my chicken.  Now the only draw back...this place is small, so be quick with seating. And the place to put your empty tray is very limited, so it can cause an unsightly pile up of trash.   Otherwise, perfect for breakfast-brunch and late night eats, strategically placed in lovely-hippie chic district of Kensington market."}
