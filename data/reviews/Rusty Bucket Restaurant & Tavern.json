{"text":"Excellent Fried Pickles!! Double Stacked Quesadilla is an appetizer but large portion size makes plenty for dinner! My son had the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad & loved the black bean/corn salsa w/pepper jack cheese & tortilla strips HUGE SALAD and every bite was delicious. Mac & Cheese is made with a little blue moon beer Very Tasty Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was my favorite, got sweet potato fries with it. Paired together perfectly Pomegranate Sangria is made by the glass and soooo good.... a must try"}
{"text":"The was the burger I have ever tasted, with the fact the the service was out standing. My son was dazzled by the food. And our waitress was fantastic the kind joyful and happy best. You can't beat this! :)"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Gary's belly buster burger is awesome. The buffalo chicken sandwich has just the right flavor. The bread pudding is a must, so save room!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with high hopes based on the location and the press. I will not be back. Our waiter was a zero. We started with a pound of chicken wings with the Joe's sauce. Pretty good. I had a Rueben with fries my daughter had Mahi tacos. Both were okay but the giant hair in my fries threw me off a bit. No, I didn't complain, they just won't see me again"}
{"text":"I was visiting the solon area and wanted to try a different lunch spot rather than the usual places. I came across this restaurant on yelp and after reading the reviews I thought that I would give it a try. Upon entering i was pleasantly greeted by the hostess and was taken to my table.    The server soon arrived and took my drink order for which i was not offered or told about any drink specials or beers on tap so I ordered water. I ordered the fish tacos which were good but very little on the plate for $13 dollars. I sat and sat waiting for my bill and after she came and took my credit card it took 15 minutes for her to come back with it. She dropped it on the table and walked away. Needless to say nothing good for me about this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with co workers. It has a typical bar menu with burgers and wraps and big beer selection. The food was surprisingly good given I have pretty mediocre standards of this type of restaurant. I ordered a salad the first time and soup the second, both of which I was fully satisfied with. Everyone else at the table seemed to really like their more substantial meals as well.  The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere not exactly my style but good for a sports bar. My only complaint is the service which was very slow despite the restaurant being only sparsely occupied."}
{"text":"Very helpful and informative staff with good recommendations.  The food was good and so was the service.  A good selection of craft beer to choose from.  It was nice to find a casual restaurant in the Southpark area.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great.  Ordered hummus and the veggies weren't fresh.  The bartender was very pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  So-so.  The food was mediocre and the service was somewhat better.  Decor is not much."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  If you order take out, they usually do not give you silverware or ask if you want it.  If you order soup, it is usually 1/4 to 1/2 full.  Otherwise,  stadff is friendly and food is good quality"}
{"text":"I had their Lime Tilapia dish (that was the special on Friday night).  It couldn't have been better.  If you like Tilapia, then I would highly recommend this dish!  They gave our party of 12 free hors d'vors, as our wait for a table was over 45 minutes, which I thought was a wonderful gesture, especially since waits for large parties on a Friday are pretty common anywhere you go.  Thank you to the wonderful waitress and staff!"}
{"text":"This new casual eating spot has a great outdoor patio perfect for outside dining. However, the comfortable atmosphere can not make up for the poor food.  The recommended fried pickles were both greasy and had way too thick of a crust.  The Thai steak salad was fine but nothing special.  The strangest food was the tuna wrap.  The flavor of the wrap was very good however, it was underfilled and each half only contained a single small slice of tuna. The accompanying salad was a Greek salad and the flavored of feta and olive did not work as a pairing with an Asian wrap.  As much as I wanted to like this new restaurant, I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Burger and blue plate special delicious and reasonably priced.  Draft root beer great.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"After being told at Harper's that they could not accommodate a party of 11, i searched the yelp app and found Rusty Bucket. I gave them a call and without hesitation the hostess set up a table for our party. The food was great and the service was amazing. I highly recommend this place. Ambiance was very nice. In fact, as we were leaving Harper's I heard a woman on the phone who was told the same about her party of 15. I told her about Rusty Bucket and was happy to see her party was accommodated at Rusty Bucket as well. I live out of town but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mike and Gina  .....first visit, wings were excellent....both burgers were tasty and cooked properly....seasoned fries way too salty...drinks were pretty good...plenty of help....service good...are waitress could use some training and a smile would help...we will return sometime in the future"}
{"text":"The food is not great, but the small bar area is really comfortable.  After two bad food experiences, not going back to eat. I will catch a game and some beers at this place. Good location, once they get the food right it will be righteous."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Rusty Bucket for a quick bite to eat on my lunch break for the first time on 06/07/12 and I was impressed by the waitress I wish I could remember her name she was very friendly and got my order right; anyway I ordered the Raspberry Lemonade which is freshly hand made with lemon, lemon juice and raspberry puree....deelish....I loved it so much that I had 2 unfortunately that doesn't come with a refill but boy I wish it did....I would have taken some home or atleast back to work.....then I ordered the double stacked quesadilla which came with pepperjack cheese; american cheese and a black bean & corn mixture...well since I don't do pepper jack or black bean I substituted that for grilled onions and peppers and again deelish the only thing I would do when I go back is  I will get double blackened chicken so it would be enough spreaded throughout the quesadilla....so if your in the neighborhood stop by and check em out; I think you'll like it...I know I did"}
{"text":"Dined here with a group of girlfriends and had a great time! Food was great and service was excellent. I'm had the veggie pizza split appetizers with the table. The deep fried pickles were awesome and the spinach queso was tasty!"}
{"text":"not sure how I feel yet.  Will have to come back to try again - I visited on Day 2 of their opening week.  Too many IPAs.  Bar area already seems cramped with too many tables and chairs ... didn't try food.  No one offered a menu either. OH!  And don't confused by the overly tinted doors like I did (and a friend who also experienced same thing on his own separate visit).  There's no sign that tells you the exit is actually to the patio :/  Once I got through the real exit I ran into a wall of smoke as the customers AND employees were chillin smoking a few feet from the door.  Bleh"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  Wouldn't kill them to turn down the AC and get some better wifi."}
{"text":"Has become a family favorite!   Food is always good, and service is fast and attentive.   What pushed us over to the \"Fam Favorite side\" was branching out and trying different dishes...all very tasty.   The Taco salad looks simple but has so many flavors and textures...delicious....really crazy good.   Our son tried the bucket of shrimp, and I couldn't peal them fast enough!   Crisp, cold and spiced just right.   Who doesn't love Old Bay!  Also, nice that the manager has always checked how the meal was...seriously last 4 times in the past 3 months...and every single time a manager has checked in.   Now it's a game for us...\"wonder if they are still checking on tables\".   Great job Rusty Bucket for maintaining such high standards!!   Glad you're in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I was asked by the host if I would like to be sat at the bar and told him I would rather sit on the patio as the weather was nice. I was seated on the patio. For the next 10 minutes I watched as waiters served others tables and never once greeted me. After 10 minutes of being ignored I got up and asked for the manager. I told him what happened. He told me they had seats in the bar area. Clearly the they didn't want any more people on the patio. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered some beer cheese burgers from the rusty bucket through doordash and the issues I faced were definitely due to the restaurant. I know for a fact that dashers can't open containers or anything so here was my problem:  They forgot the cheese on the burgers. It is literally called a beer cheese burger and they forgot the whole point of the burger. Who was making a burger called \"the beer cheese burger\" and seriously forgot the main component? It takes a special kind of stupid, seriously. Also there was a gross charred skin on our burgers as well. Last time we order from there they burned our burgers but I didn't care as much. But come on people, common sense."}
{"text":"This was a ho-hum menu with nothing outstanding to report. Prime location with below prime expensive food. The wait staff was marginal. We thought we would try this over Harper's. That was a mistake!"}
{"text":"My first visit tonite! Wont be my last.  Food was excellent, serving size was great and priced well. The wait staff was very attentive.   I had a strip steak with asparagus and mushrooms.  Delish!  Daily specials available as well. Other members in my party had the Sunday special....hot brown roasted  turkey open face sandwich with a divine sauce/gravy.   I will definitely be having that the next time!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the service! Great place to eat! My favorite is the buffalo chicken sandwich and mac and cheese! But everything on the menu is great! Have not had a bad meal! The beer list is pretty good too, they have some good crafty selections.  I heard they are adding pizza to the menu soon as well! I cannot wait to try it! Hands down one of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwhich at the Rusty Bucket you are missing out!! Best I've ever had. Nice place, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've tried hard to like this place.  I want to.  I live within walking distance and had such high hopes when it opened.  It has so much potential considering location, decor, atmosphere, etc but the food just is not that good.  I've tried different items and every time I feel like the food is below average at its very best.  Maybe one day they'll revamp the menu but unfortunately it may be too late for me.  I've given it several chances and been disappointed each and every time.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best chili I've had in years.  One of my favorite places when I visit Solon area."}
{"text":"Good new spot in South Park to hang out and watch a game. I have been a few times since it is less than a mile from my house and have had good experiences so far. Will continue to go back due to good food and a great beer selection."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a few bites before going out and it was about as good as a strip mall bar can be expected to be. The burger I ordered was actually awesome; it was their signature sandwich and they not only properly cooked it to order, but they brought out way more options for toppings than most places like this. Their fries were okay but they did offer vinegar at the table, which I personally enjoy. Their fried pickles weren't that hot, but they came free because of the deal this bar had with our hotel, so no harm there.  In the end, it was a perfectly acceptable sports bar with some yummy, totally unhealthy food. I didn't love the atmosphere and the service was friendly but slow, but I preferred this to a place like Applebee's (where your burger isn't even gonna be any good on top of it all). If you're in the neighborhood, it's an alright place to have a beer and a burger for an hour."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the South Park area of Charlotte and to Rusty Bucket Restaurant and Tavern. What a unique name for a restaurant. This casual neighborhood restaurant offers all of the normal tavern type foods, like burgers, sandwiches and wings, but also some not so typical, like sirloin, pasta, and chicken parmesan.  Dora here. With their robust menu, Rusty Bucket has a little something for everyone. In case you're like us and not a huge fan of brunch, they also offer their regular menu on the weekends, one aspect we really appreciated! I really liked the cozy, casual vibes of this place, and no fretting over parking, either. There's a free parking garage practically right next door. Bonus!   For our appetizer, we chose the Warm Cinnamon Sugar Donut Holes with a caramel dipping sauce. These donut holes were great, light and had great favor although not particularly sweet. I was not a fan of the dipping sauce, but if you rolled them around in a plate of sugar, the sweetness level was perfect. Dora here. Cinnamon heaven! The doughnut holes were light and airy, and I was a bit relieved that Ernie didn't care for the buttery warm sauce because that left more for me! lol. Oh. My. Yum!   I chose the Breakfast Burrito from the Brunch menu. Scrambled eggs, sausage, peppers and onions, pepper jack and cheddar cheese wrapped in a tortilla then topped with ranchero sauce and sour cream and served with red skin breakfast potatoes. Now I have had breakfast burritos all over the world but I have to say this one was in the top three of the best I have ever had. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage not spicy, the shell soft, and the ranchero sauce added just enough heat to finish off this dish. I would definitely order this burrito again.  Dora here. What can I say about the Codwich? Oh my word, y'all! The picture doesn't even do it justice. I could hardly get that giant chunk of cod in my mouth. lol. Huge. Meaty. Delicious! Oh yeah, I would order this again. My iced tea glass never ran dry, always a plus, and service was attentive and friendly. Rusty Bucket definitely made it on our repeat list!  What about you? Do you get all excited about brunch? What's your favorite brunch dish? Stop by Fiction Faith & Foodies, we'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies http://bit.ly/2nHzEV9"}
{"text":"We go probably every weekend! To my kids this is the best place on earth!  Food is consistently good and the wait for a table is never that long!"}
{"text":"The food is traditional comfort food, very good.  I had meatloaf with bbq sauce, green beans, carrots and mashed potatoes.  All were very good. My wife had a burger which was very good.  The waitress was very good and kept us informed about the progress of our meal preparation.  It did take a little longer than average to get our food.  The restaurant was lively and busy, especially considering the time (prior to 6 PM).    The amount of room at the front of the restaurant for checking in should be increased, it was difficult getting in the door to check in."}
{"text":"I was encouraged by a dear friend to come here for lunch one day as she raved over the french onion soup which she  knows is a fav of mine. So,we met there one afternoon for lunch and it's not easy finding a parking spot---I wound up parking in the Whole Foods lot which I'm sure they don't appreciate.    I did order the soup but was so disappointed as there was just a half dollar size amount of cheese in the soup---my friend even said to me that is not what I got the last time I ate here---she said her soup was loaded with cheese, the kind that drapes over the side and you happily pull off or wind around your spoon. I ordered as my meal the chicken quesadilla's with corn and black beans ---they were tasty enough but could you spare the salsa and the tiny amount of sour cream?  My friend ordered the bucket of shrimp was certainly enough to feed two as an appetizer or one person ---she had really more than enough to eat .I may try the place once again because I believe in second chances but won't order the french onion soup. Way overpriced for the money and so disappointing."}
{"text":"I had a buy one get one free entree coupon so we tried it out for the first time. Food was absolutely wonderful & so was the service! I had a pizza & my boyfriend had meatloaf... we both raved about the food for the rest of the night. We moved to the bar after dinner to watch football; the bartender was very nice & the drink prices were reasonable. Great location too!"}
{"text":"Horrible service experience.  Drinks took a ridiculous amount of time to come out.  Finished our meals, our water, our drinks before we even got a chance to ask for another drink.  Manager more interested in the TV then working.  It wasn't like they were busy. I can excuse this if you were brand new, but at this point these things are easy. No energy, zombies walking around.   Pro: They didn't switch off the audio after the sporting event and got to listen to the opening story on 60 minutes.  Always a hit in a Sports Bar. I submitted a complaint via their online form and after 4 days zero response.  Not really surprised after the experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunate. We were looking for burgers and took Yelp's advice. Almost everything was wrong. Wife's food was inedible (beer cheese sauce didn't taste like cheese, burger was undercooked, sweet potato fries were cold, ketchup was incredibly watery, had leaked all over the bottle), waitress rolled her eyes when we asked for a clean plate to get the burger out of the ketchup-and-cold-fries soup. Wife tried to wash the sticky mess from the ketchup bottle off of her hands, but the restroom was dirty and had no soap.   I ordered the Rusty Bucket Pilsner, and got a hard cider (which was tasty, but tough to confuse with what I ordered).   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant for lunch or dinner. By far the best chicken fingers you will ever have! Whatever batter they use is amazing! The deep fried pickles are phenomenal as well. We also had The salmon which was delicious as well. Great family Friendly sports bar with a large local Beer draft list. Would definitely  recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just had an excellent dinner at Rusty Bucket. We sat at the bar and got excellent service and recommendations from our server, Parker. They had a great beer selection and also make extremely fresh drinks. Great place to watch a game and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I mean... Like a reimagined Applebee's or TGI Fridays, no? I'd put it above them. But, in the same instant, if you want a Winking Lizard with less TVs and less people believing it's more of a bar atmosphere- i would take them here. It's like an Irish pub that serves American food.  One star off because I almost bit it on a super slippery, slimy floor on the way out. Even after warning other party members to watch their step, my future mother-in-law almost bit it, and my future father-in-law slipped. No wet floor signs, no attention to being given to such things.  And the other star came off because of the business itself. Not this location. I have this thing- this annoyance, and I realize it's my opinion, and I hope you read reviews and not just stars to realize this is my own hang-up, but- I don't like when places re-invent the wheel just to be fancy.    Take- \"The double stacked quesadilla\" for instance. This might sound fancy. Might sound like something you've never had before. In reality- it's a quesadilla folded one more time. This takes me back to a kitchen (no names, please) I worked in where we served a \"fancy quesadilla\" where I rolled up the tortilla, cut it on the bias, stood it up on a flat end and served it like a J.R.R. Tolkien, to the point of no one.   Dear Executive Chef, your quesadillas have great flavor. You don't need to fold them again."}
{"text":"Jeff the manager was really nice the food isn't good at all in my opinion. We were so excited to check it out upon opening and would look at the pictures on window in anticipation of having a different option for a quick bite or a nite out to dine.   We were in the area and actually heading to WholeFood to grab a bite and noticed that this place was now open so we strolled in. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty busy. We tried various items including the pasta seafood dish, the burger and fries and the fish & chips. Everything was \"Meh\". Our teenager stated that she wish we went to Whole Food for her burger. My husband and I wish we went to Dogwood Tavern across the street as they have much better food.   A BIG plus is the ladies room as they have a clean changing table and also lady personal needs in a nice vase in case one runs out or had a visitor while out (hint hint).  This place could be much better as we had high hopes, in big on giving places a second try so I'll watch the reviews and if I see things are looking up I'll head back for a 2nd chance and see how it goes and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"The fried pickles are great. In our instance, the service was actually terrible, bottom of the barrel. But the manager recognized the problems and took care of us."}
{"text":"We've visited the Rusty Bucket twice so far.  The first time was in December for a date night.  The food was fantastic.  I debated between a sandwich or the mac and cheese made with beer cheese.  Then I found a burger (actually two!) that had beer cheese on top of them.  I went with the Green Chili burger, which actually has a beer cheese on it, along with spicy jalapenos.  It was delicious, as were the accompanying seasoned fries.  It was a Friday night, which was martini night, so I tried the grapefruity one that our server recommended that had fruit-infused vodka.  Yum at a great deal.  The only downside about that visit was that it was the first real cold spell of the season (like 20-something degrees out), and we were seated underneath a vent that every 10 minutes or so would blast freezing cold air on us.  We kept our jackets on the entire night, which you really shouldn't have to do.  Plus, it just cooled down our hot food.  Dear restaurants: turn off the A/C in the winter.  Thank you.  Our 2nd visit was a couple weeks ago.  My parents were in town visiting, so six of us went to the Rusty Bucket on a Saturday night.  When we arrived, we were informed it would be a 20-35 minute wait.  Ok.  That wasn't too bad, considering it was a Saturday night and the fact that they don't take reservations.  That 20-35 minute wait turned into a 60 minute wait.  Granted, it's not the restaurant's fault if people were watching sports on the big TVs around the restaurant and wouldn't leave their tables.  Well, maybe it partially is.  Around the 30-minute mark and beyond, we were told intermittently that our table would be ready very soon.  At around the 45 minute mark, they told us it would be just one more minute, and even had menus in hand.  I'm not sure what happened, but that dragged out until 60 minutes from the time we arrived, we were finally seated.  Everyone else who had been waiting for a table had long been seated, even parties bigger than us.  The manager told us that we'd be well taken care of and he'd buy us apps.  That was nice, of course, and the action that he should have done (although drinks may have been appropriate as well in this case).  Unfortunately, once we were finally seated, the follow up on those promises wasn't that great.  After our initial contact with our server who was all bright and bubbly, we rarely saw her again.  She never came by for drink refills, she never came by to check on our meals, and it took forever to get our check.  When we finally DID get the check, it had the price of the \"free\" apps on it!  Worse, the manager NEVER came by to check on us.  Seriously?  If I was the MOD on duty that night, I would have been kissing our asses to make sure we had a fantastic time.  I don't think a little attention after that fiasco is asking too much.  IT'S YOUR JOB.  I guess we were too nice and should have been total assholes instead.  Anyway, the food was good again and at least we weren't seated in the A/C zone on another brisk night, but the service and follow through was quite shitty.  Owning a dining establishment isn't just about the food and atmosphere, it's about providing quality customer service if you want repeat visitors.  I think some people need a refresher course or to find another field of work."}
{"text":"The place is always clean, servers attentive.  I guess the drawback is that there is no great \"home-cooked\" concept.  We go there because we refuse to support the local chains in the area.  Food too mundane.  But then Rusty Bucket is always fine, but mundane.  Need to have some house favorite to grab you!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here twice now and in short, if I don't like a place the first time, I rarely go back. Both of my visits yielded excellent service and really good food. On my first visit we sat inside in one of the comfortable booths. I had the open faced Philly Cheesesteak with fries. It was so darn good I was going to order it again yesterday (3 weeks after my first visit) but decided to change it up at the last minute and got the rueben with fries instead. We got a table outside this time. The rueben was excellent! The fries were good, but they were a little wilted this time. I still ate them all. Fresh cut fries are the rage now it seems and I don't think these are fresh cut, but they are still good. The prices are very reasonable too. Both our meals (we only had water this time) came to $21. I feel thats good for a restaurant of this caliber. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This is a weird review to write. i may have to go back again sometime and try it again because i wasn't happy while i was here. menu item costs seemed a bit steep. the beer (Rusty Bucket Pilsner) was definitely steep. I ordered a tall which cost $6.75 (WHOA) and wasn't tall at all - like a glorified pint. the beer itself was good but c'mon. for that price i expected an actual 22oz tall glass or better.  Danielle ordered a turkey burger and actually really liked it. I ordered a Codwich sandwich that was marked as a signature item. it was good but nothing out of the ordinary. in fact, we need to do away with shredded lettuce entirely. i tried to put the \"lid\" bun of my sandwich on the other half and lost half a head of lettuce on the table. the fish was good though and had a nice panko crunch. the fries that came with it were fine - nothing special. and i'd ordered a side of coleslaw that came out in a tiny container the size of a little condiment dish. that was $3.45 (ridiculous) and wasn't to my liking at all.  luckily, my server forgot to charge me for the coleslaw or saw i hated it and didn't charge me. either way, she saved this from a lower rating by doing so.  like i said, i might have had an off day. others seem to like it. I won't hurry back but i may try again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"My family decided to go here to try their beer menu which we heard a lot about. We were all happy with the selection but what we really loved was the food! Everything we ate was fantastic. You can't go wrong with the menu."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and I always have had quality food. The service has also been excellent. My favorite food on the menu is the mac and cheese, I also love the habanero wings. I was skeptical at first because many restaurants say that their wings have habanero sauce, but it is a muted flavor and heat. The Rusty Bucket actually had a great sauce and they are one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Instantly surprised by the look of the restaurant. Very nice decor and a nice layout to give the appeal of a more upscale restaurant. Workers are very friendly and happy to serve. The buffalo chicken sandwich that I got that was recommended by my server was very good and would get it again. However, I was somewhat unhappy with the menu selection. Not sure if this was due to different expectations or it was because nothing just caught my attention. Overall a good restaurant that is worth going to, somewhat upscale dining at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Solid bar/grill option. You just have to recognize that there are certain things you should go for (bar food) and certain things it might be wise to leave to a fine dining restaurant (mussels, bisque).   Also, if you're a hefeweizen fan, they have Erdinger on tap. We've never seen Erdinger at a restaurant that's not German. Yum!"}
{"text":"Rusty Bucket is a gem of a watering hold found in the heart of uppity SouthPark. The Dude and I frequent here because it's the best of what it is. A sports bar with tasty bevs, comfort pub food and tvs out the wazoo. If you want upscale dining don't expect it to come from here because that isn't what it is. It's a place to have fun! We always go for the fish n chips or the philly, and the fried pickles are the best I've had anywhere. It's cozy, welcoming and there is always great service."}
{"text":"We come here in the day time, we come here in the night.  Be it lunch time or happy hour, when visiting our office in Solon... we seem to always at least once end up here.    It is a pretty good gathering place.  Parking sucks during the lunch out, but later when the other stores are closing it gets a bit easier.  And since it IS OHIO.. parking DOES Matter from Nov thru April ( brrrrrrr SNOW...)   Food:   *Deep Fried Pickels - always a favorite  *BBQ Chicken salad - LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!  my personal favorite  *Mac and Cheese -   I think its swiss and american - Friends liked it :)  * Rusty Bucket Buger and Blue Cheese burgers are a group favorite as well.  We love coming here after work to unwind as well.  Good Drinks, good beer.... and good times.....   Thought this was a little local joint, didn't realize they were a chain... but still pretty good :)     Nothing's Rusty at the Rusty Bucket :)"}
{"text":"Took my husband here for the first time, he liked it a lot.  The ambience, large TV, comfortable seating.  Only one opportunity to improve - the meatloaf was way too sweet, maybe a tangier less Sweet BBQ sauce?  We both felt the same on that by the portion size and presentation were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The beer cheese burger with bacon and onion straws are is one of the best burgers in the city.    The bucket of shrimp is a big winner also my kids love it and pretty healthy - balances out the burger! Finish it off with one of their home made milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Thursday special of spaghetti with veal and beef meatballs.  I love their chilli and their Nickel salad is pretty tasty. The wings with habanero sauce is what we typically order, and although the sauce used to be delicious with real habanero seeds (and very spicy), the wing sauce is still pretty tasty (just mild).  Very good service late at night.  Looks small and dark from the outside but spacious on the inside."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, convenient location! We come here pretty often and never were disappointed."}
{"text":"Place used to be decent but service has gone downhill to the point of unbearable.  The third time we've been there in 6 weeks and the service has continued to be slow.  Staff is nice, but inattentive due to regularly being understaffed.  Tonight, had a reservation for 13, arrived on time to a half empty restuarant...took 20 min to get a drink.  Spoke to manager who apologized/said situation would be addressed.  Took order and food didn't come out for over an hour.  On top of that , forgot two of the orders.    Manager never came over.  When the bill came, they didn't credit / take off a dime.  From a customer service / business standpoint, just a total whiff.  Will never go back.  I'm actually just embarrassed for them more than actually upset."}
{"text":"Average at best. The Baja fish tacos were not good. The stacked quesadilla was pretty good though. Kids chicken tenders were CAKED with batter and were NOT good, either. Service was good, but place was dead. Don't think I'll be back..."}
{"text":"The food was great I ordered the pizza and my bf ordered the Elvis burger. I would say it's a great place to eat. The only complaint we had was that the food took long to come out and service was slow. The staff were helpful with the menu and nice. Just slow on refilling drinks and getting food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was very pleased. The wings and sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious! I can't wait to come back and try some other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"This place has a good location. amazing mac and chesse. it's my birthday so I ordered the Sunday it was amazing but they do not have that much desserts. it's a good  place for kids"}
{"text":"Food is OK at best, have been there twice, and service was good the first time, second time was after they expanded and the service was poor, one person in our party needed gluten free food and the server was very rude about it, and made the person very uncomfortable about it. Rest of staff maybe excellent, but would not return because of this server. Place is very loud."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!! Like, woah!! Decent beer selection, lots of different flavors. They do need to update their beer list from time to time.  So many good looking items in the menu, I can hardly choose what I want. Had good service here the three times we've eaten."}
{"text":"Came to this locals place with co workers for a beer and appetizer. We asked the server what were good local beers and she said she didn't know?!!! As a tavern your servers should at least know good local beers. Maybe it is me being from a good beer country in Denver that I expect this but it was ver difficult for me to understand for a server at a tavern not know a good beer to recommend. The fried pickles were absolutely amazon would definitely order their food (if it was like that) again!!! Chefs and price (happy hour) save this place while service hurts it!"}
{"text":"Your average bar. Lots of hid-def TVs. Food was average nothing wowed me. Waitress was slow and very rude. And the name.... o my gosh the name"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place but it is close by and food is average bar food. I wish they had a little more on their menu but theres pretty much soemthing for everyone.   They have a decent beer selection which is nice and the service has always been pretty good"}
{"text":"This is a very comfortable restaurant with lots of comfort food specials. Prices reasonable and wait staff enthusiastic"}
{"text":"Service and food are second to none. Great atmosphere and even better service. Sit at the bar and ask for Jennifer!! She definitely sells the experience!!"}
{"text":"One of the best taco salads I've ever had but the biggest reason for the 4 stars is the bartender's service.  Excellent service all the way around.  Nice atmosphere albeit a little \"commercialized\" and not a \"real\" independent bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, moo cows. Seriously, shut up & listen up! The Buffalo Chicken sand which here is uncluckingly cookadoodoloo cluk cluk feee nominal. Don't mess with any other menu items, got it? Be wild and order it with their haven er ho sauce  so you can mildly cry as you indulge in the best chicken sammy this side of flaming Frisco. You don't get it? Get it. Now. Drive out of your way if you must. Thank me, thumbs up! Thumbs up?"}
{"text":"In town on business; Sunday night and staying nearby. Great atmosphere, lots of tv's and good variety on menu. Service was very good. Anthony was server. Couldn't decide what to eat based on reviews. Really wanted wings but no reviews on them so was leery to order them. Started with spinach dip due to good reviews. Thumbs down. Didn't like. I think it was the cheese sauce. Just wasn't working for me.   Ordered wings \"crispy and plain\", with a side of sweet chili. Delicious!!! Loved them! Just the right amount of sweet with a little kick. Asked to try sriracha sauce for a little more heat but didn't love it. Didn't seem any hotter than sweet chili.   Anthony asked if I liked spin dip and since I didn't, he removed it from my bill. I said he didn't have to, but he insisted. That was very cool of him.   Wanted to give this place a 3 star so bad due to the OBNOXIOUS child sitting at the table next to me, but that's not the restaurant's fault. It nearly ruined my dinner. Luckily had earbuds (dined alone) to help drown the kid out. May have left if I had been dining with other people. Pretty confident you'd hear that kid anywhere you were sitting.   Overall, a good experience and certainly worth the 4 stars I gave it.  Would have been much better without the whiny child. I sat in bar area so the family with young children was not expected. Wish they'd invested in a babysitter instead of the Ralph Lauren Polo shirts the children were wearing. Will come back again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Ordered the chicken blt and the Italian torpedo for lunch. Both sandwiches were warm and the bread was toasty... The two seater booth was uncomfortable though, as we both sank to an awkward level. I thought about asking for a boaster chair to comfortably eat...I dont think my fries were fresh, althought warm and tasty, I kept getting those cold stale ones here and there."}
{"text":"WOW. I can honestly say I was impressed. Maybe I was assuming its a local bar/restaurant and that is my fault. I went in the evening during the week. The atmosphere was good, clean and the help greeted us all with smiles.   I got the tuna wrap which was Delicious!!!! I can't say how well I liked it. And the server made sure to let me know the tuna was on the raw side, similar to what sushi would taste like which is great in my book.  I will be back, and I will bring friends to experience this diamond in the ruff!!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean with friendly service. Lots of local beer however rather limited in IPAs. Massive chicken sandwich. No way you can eat it all. Went in in early afternoon so it was nice and quiet."}
{"text":"This is one of our fav restaurant chains! Their food is always great and so is the service. Personally my fav is the buffalo chicken sandwich but make it in a wrap! Delilah! Hands down the best buffalo chicken wrap I have ever had. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The patio is also a really cute one in South Park area. Definitely one of our frequent spots to eat!"}
{"text":"Rusty bucket is your typical American, pub-type fare with an atmosphere that matches. Prices might be a tad higher than usual for things like a burger or chicken sandwich (maybe $1 above), but it's always good food. Drink prices are average and fair with some notable specials throughout the week. Can't go wrong with a burger or any of the sandwiches really.   I almost hate letting the secret out, but this is my new go-to brunch spot if other places like Tupelo or Toast are too crowded. Surprisingly, Rusty Bucket has a good brunch menu. Try the short rib hash, it's really good. Chicken and waffles are really tasty as well. There's not a huge selection, but the dishes available are done well. REALLY wish they had a better mimosa deal during the weekend for brunch.  I was on the fence about 3 or 4 stars, but the service is ALWAYS exceptional and friendly, so taking that into consideration pushes it up to 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and they have the best veggie burger I have ever had! I give it 4 stars because it's always a long wait, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent bar food, but great for families!  Kids eat free with their reading bookmark program and the kids meals are excellent!  The kids are happy and my husband and get whatever and are happy enough.  I got the ribs once and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"Come on people! Only 3 1/2 stars? I have never had a bad meal or bad service here....ever! The selection of beers is awesome. Very diverse menu. Got to admit I'm not that fond of the name of the place, but once you get past that, it's really a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere is not as cool as Burntwood, but the food and service is way better"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place. Walked in and it was dead. Asked to be seated in bar area. Server came over and told us about the drink specials. We settled on the Grapefruit margarita since that is what he said. He forgot to mention it was grapefruit and elderflower. Asked the manager to remake the drinks as regular margaritas. Since it was so dead you know they all were staring at us about sending the drinks back. Settled on the spinach dip appetizer and wings. The wings were good. The spinach cheese appetizer was strange. It looked like they melted velveeta cheese and threw in some Flakes of spinach. I was disappointed in this place especially since it is in a prominent area however it was over $40 for 2 drinks and 2 appetizers. A margarita on special shouldn't be $9. That's regular price to me. Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Friday night Cosmo martinis are great, but the Saturday grapefruit margaritas are my absolute favorite! Food is always tasty as well. Great laid back restaurant in Sharon Square!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! favorite American restaurant ever! Their Mac n cheese with some ranch on top( delicious)  everyone there is so friendly and I'm probably there like every week!  Definitely gonna keep going back!"}
{"text":"Sat at bar and service was terrible.  Do not order the fish tacos.  There might be 5oz of fish total on the three tacos.  Talked to manager and she brought out another plate of tacos.  If not for her, only would've given 2 stars for review."}
{"text":"Meh food overpriced and not worthy of your time. With all the options just a few miles away or even across the street I would pass on this place! All 4 meals were meh not a decent one in the bunch."}
{"text":"legumes are basically vegetables. they're bb veggies. the bartenders here are so good and treat you real nice."}
{"text":"This is a corner bar that lacks feel. The menu was average, and the boring atmosphere didn't help. The food was good, but the experience wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food"}
{"text":"Just got back. The food is excellent, but it seemed like they were short-staffed. We had to wait awhile before someone took our order. They did what they could with what they had, and I appreciate it. The Management probably needs to hire more though. The bartenders were fast and friendly while we waited for a table."}
{"text":"Great place! Everything is made fresh! Not your typical sports bar for sure. I was surprised by the quality and the price point. A new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"WOW oh WOW! One of the best buffalo chicken wraps I've had in Charlotte yet! And buffalo wraps hold a special place in my heart!   At first, you will miss it on the menu as it's listed as a buffalo chicken sandwich, but they will accommodate and make it into a wrap for you. The chicken was super (sorry I hate this word) moist and delicious! I believe it was breast meat so it was very tender. It was lightly breaded,  but didn't take away from the overall taste. I hate when all you can taste is the deep fried breading on the outside. The Rusty Bucket did it right!   The size of the wrap was enormous and I didn't think I would finish it- but of course I did. You can also substitute ranch instead of blue cheese if that's not your cup of tea.  Lastly, you can also substitute your side for a salad for slight up-charge. I got the wedge salad instead of fries and it was just as delicious as my wrap. You can't really mess up a wedge salad, but the cilantro dressing I got with it was awesome!   Geez, writing this review is making me crave a buff wrap right now!   Do yourself a favor, and get the Buff wrap!"}
{"text":"Helllo Rusty Bucket.  My boyfriend is originally from Solon and him and his friends always talked about this place called The Rusty Bucket and I always wondered about it.  Last night (Tuesday) we made a trip out to Solon and we stopped at The Rusty Bucket to grab some dinner.  First impressions when walking in  \"wow this is not what i pictured at all\" The bar is right there when you walk in, I would say  medium size bar, lots of tables and TONS of big TVs which is always nice specially for the sports fans!  I wanted to get everything off that menu, HELLO DEEP FRIED PICKLES!!!!!!!!!! I settled with the Rusty Bucket burger and fries and my boyfriend got some kind of Italian sausage sandwich.  I know it was just a burger and fries, but let me tell you i Loved it! I am a big fan of \"bar food\" and this was yummy in my tummy! I couldn't get over how good the fries were, even their ranch for dipping my fries in was delicious.....SCORE! The waitress was very nice, took alittle long for our food to come out (the place was not busy at all) but I wasn't mad at all because it tasted great.  the bathrooms.........how nice are they!? they smell so good when you walk in, yes yes the bathroom smells yummy! They have a nice little patio for when the weather is nice too and the prices are very good as well.  I will definitely come back to the rusty bucket!  OH! The boy pointed out to me this HUGE glass jug type thing filled with huge pineapples swimming in vodka! I def want to try one of those next time we are out that way............TAXI PLEASE! :o)"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is the best thing on the menu....when they finally get it right. My most recent visit will probably be my last. My chicken sandwich came out VERY undercooked in the center. My waitress fixed it immediately, however I was disappointed that the manager didn't come out to address or apologize for something as serious as undercooked meat. That makes 3 out of 5 of my visits unpleasant, so i think it's time to give up!  So my advice would be give it a try but don't go in with the highest expectations!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, most recently on Sunday early afternoon for brunch and a Panthers game. We sat at the bar and there was definitely a \"usual crowd\" with the staff and patrons knowing each other, which was nice.   Brunch includes donut holes and those were on fluffy and warm and yummy. I had the breakfast burrito that came with potatoes and it was good and huge!   My friend got the breakfast sandwich was good-- it looked real good!   They have local cider on tap, gluten free menu available and daily drink specials too, so that's always a win in my book."}
{"text":"Really good beer selection. I was pleased to see many Oregon microbrews from my home state of Oregon. I had the grilled tuna wrap, very tasty and healthy."}
{"text":"I love the Rusty Bucket! I always order the same thing, the chicken buffalo sandwich without the buffalo sauce. It is to die for!!! The breading on the chicken is out of this world! It is a simple yet an amazing chicken sandwich! I get fries with it also. I have never had bad service here. The servers are fast and friendly and I've never waited an extended period of time for my meal. There aren't many restaurants in Solon...this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Positives - ambiance and sports bar setting. Great place to watch the games Sunday's!  Staff is nice but very slow, even when it's not busy.   Not so great - back of the menu - drink menu is not accurate. They drop the menus and don't say anything about modifications or seasonal options. After deciding, and waiting, we found out that an entire sections of beer was \"out.\" So it's kind of misleading to list a type of beer and list of options under that type, that you don't actually sell. Waitress was great at sharing about the special (what they are pushing, and want you to buy), but failed to mention much else. After failing at any beer options in the type we like, I asked about seasonals. She then took ~5-7 mins to bring that menu. After us taking our time and picking, she took the order and came back another 5 later to say that was \"out.\" She then checked and said she could sub a NoDa beer instead. Ok, what? We wanted to get something different-your menu seems diverse for regions and options. I then found out it was $7 for a NoDa beer. Ya, no thanks, I can go there and pay $5. I didn't appreciate a sub option for a very unique, awesome beer as a NoDa option. I love them, but can get them all over-including their brewery-in Charlotte!   My recommendation - go across the street to Dogwood or Corkbuzz. They are both fantastic.   The food is all bar food, I didn't try it, it may be delicious, but the drink thing was just very off putting."}
{"text":"Here's a place that I frequent often, whenever I'm in Solon on business.  I consider myself a bit of a foodie and this doesn't go in 'foodie territory' but there are also days that you just want a nice pub/tavern/bar-kinda grub rather than the pretentiousness or complications of something more palatable.  This fits the bill.  It truly is one of those types of places that has the \"Hey Norm\" regulars.  I kid you not!  I've easily been here 8 times in the past year and there's this guy that's there almost every time.  The ambiance is fine, even for a strip-mall cookie cutter joint and the servers at the bar ALWAYS shake your hand, offer their name, and ask yours in return.  Brand identity, I guess.  The food is fine.  The beer is good.  The girls at the bar here will be totally straight with you and tell you what NOT to have today -- I do like that.    Be aware that it is a regional chain but it doesn't show too badly.  Have the Great Lakes if you're from out of town as it's the local brew.  Dortmunder, being my favorite.  Food:  The meatloaf really is decent...not awesome, but rather decent.  And the salmon, oddly enough is quite edible.    It's pub-grub folks, so there it is.  But for what it is, they do it up okay."}
{"text":"Super delicious food, good beer selection, cozy decor, affordable prices. Highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to give this a 2 because of the service. Our waitress was very nice, but very inattentive and it wasn't even busy!   It took at least 10 minutes to get a beer or glass of wine and we had to have multiple because it took 45 minutes for our food to come out.   Once the food did come out my chicken was great! But the fries were cold. We ordered the sticky bun for dessert which was very mediocre and a little dried out.   I have friends that do love this restaurant so I am willing to give it another try and hope this night was just a fluke.. I'll keep you posted!"}
{"text":"THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL HAPPENING AT THE RUSTY BUCKET! We have been here maybe 20 times over the past six years and have mixed reviews ranging from eh to just ok. Well, today something in the kitchen has changed. We noticed an updated menu since our last visit and it's really good. Our server Jack was great and so was Lu the bartender. Bloody Mary's were great! The Earl Grey Palmer was also Kick ass! We had the Buffalo Chicken sami with sweet potato fries, Beer Cheeseburger and Fish and Chips. Simple bar fare but this time it seems it was done with great care. WELL DONE RB! Super good! If they stay on track like this we'll be regulars. Looking forward to trying the new brunch menu. Chicken and waffles? Hell yeah!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!!! SO good !! Asian Tuna Wrap to die for. Also Sticky Bun Bread Pudding delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area car shopping and got hungry. Stopped by this place reluctantly and LOVED IT. I had the Asian wrap and my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich. The food was delicious. The server was the one that recommended the food. They have a decent selection of beer. Could have had more drafts to choose from. Overall, I recommend."}
{"text":"Great new spot. I've tried just about everything on the menu without any disappointments.  The Thai Steak  Salad is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"So far I've only been here twice w/ the husband and I wanted to give it 3.5 stars for good location, ambiance, cleanliness, and great service.  It's just like any other sports bar.  The food to us was just average, nothing spectacular.  The first time we went I had fish and chips and my husband had the barbeque chicken salad.  The fish and chips were good, but I had to use extra napkins to dab off the extra grease from the fish.  My husband said his was salad was pretty good, it had a nice presentation with the tortilla chips sitting on top.  This time around, I ordered the blackened chicken salad and my husband ordered the patty melt.  The salad was ok for me.  Normally, it comes with mixed greens, strawberries, red onions, candied pecans, bleu cheese crumbles, honey vinegarette dressing  and blackened salmon cooked to your liking.  Now, because of food allergies I asked for the pecans on the side for my husband to eat and because of gastric reflux I didn't get the onions and cheese.  They did add apple slices like I asked, but I could tell that the lettuce was just the prewashed bag mix of spinach leaves, chopped romaine and that purple lettuce.  I think they could do a little better with the lettuce.  The dressing was really good. My husband simply stated that his sandwich was \"just OK, it was bland with no seasoning\". By the looks of the drink menu and drink specials the Rusty Bucket would be a good place to go after work with some co-workers or meet up with your girlfriends or guy friends for drinks, appetizers, friendly conversation, great ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Buffalo chicken sandwich was amazing. The kids also loved their food and my husband enjoyed watching the game."}
{"text":"Location is what keeps bringing us back to Rusty Bucket. My brother-in-law lives in apartments upstairs, so it's seems fitting to just walk downstairs to the \"neighborhood\" bar.    I am always underwhelmed when ordering food here. Bar food should be rather easy to execute, but somehow the mark is always missed.   This time, I ordered a philly cheese steak...YUCK! I've never met a philly cheese steak I didn't like until I came here. The meat (prime rib) was way too tender. A philly should have a bite to it. The sandwich was served open-faced with an obnoxious amount of cheese. It was way too much to close and eat as a sandwich.  Last time I ordered the meat loaf and it, too, was disappointing.   If you're going to eat here, I would recommend just ordering a burger. Everyone always seems to be happy with the burgers, and there are plenty of options on tap for beer."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The Buffalo Chicken sandwich is the best around. Their burgers, and salads are great too. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved in the past year. Plus, they have my favorite raspberry beer, so that kicks it up a notch. Friendly service too and surprisingly not all that crowded, even while watching the playoffs."}
{"text":"Great beer listOn a recent trip back to Ohio I needed a good place to meet my mom for a quick lunch.  This place did the trick and they were surprisingly busy.  They have an extensive beer list that is very reasonably priced.  They menu is your standard pub-fare with a few 'down home' favorite mixed in.  We opted for the double-double nickel chicken salad and the hummus appetizer.  Both were tasty but be warned that the hummus comes with pita only - no veggies.  I asked my server for some vegetables and she was happy to oblige.  My only complaint on this place is that we were seated in the very back of the restaurant and I had to keep swatting away fruit flies.  Pretty disgusting when you are trying to enjoy your salad.  I would back here for the beer list alone, but next time I'll request a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"I think The Rusty Bucket is still getting its footing, but it's pretty good right now. A girlfriend and I went on a Tuesday after work, and when we got there at 5:45, the bar area was already half full. (As another reviewer noted, I almost went in the wrong door. Oops.) It took awhile for the bartender to acknowledge me even though there seemed to be a few staff people hanging out at the bar not doing anything, but that was the only blip in good service.  The bar was pretty cozy and had multiple TVs (there was even a TV in the bathroom!) so you could watch the game. I think there may have even been USB outlets for phone charging at each bar seat, but we didn't bend over far enough to completely confirm.  The wine, draft, and tap lists were solid, and there is a different drink special every night. For dinner, I got a salad and my girlfriend got chicken fingers and fries; hers came wayyyy before mine, which was odd, and the bartender finally offered to check on it. My salad was fine, and my friend's chicken fingers looked like real chicken fingers.  Overall, this appears to be a solid addition to the neighborhood, and I'm looking forward to trying it again after they've gotten into a groove."}
{"text":"Bar tender was amazing - nice location - nice bar selection of brews! Prices were fair for the quality! We also had their queso spinach dip and I highly recommend it! Nice spot"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite to eat before heading to an event and I must say I dig this place! For being located in a plaza you'd think it wouldn't be much, but it's nice inside with competent staff and tasty food. I sat at the bar, but throughout the restaurant you can enjoy half off appetizers for happy hour and I think drink specials as well from 3p-6p.   I munched on some fried pickle spears ($4.50) and later got the Green Chili Burger ($11.49). The burger patty tasted so good! You could tell it was freshly made and seasoned perfectly. It was supposed to have serrano and jalapeno relish, but there were just sliced peppers on the burger. That is not relish and I was disappointed. A nice thing though was that I was able to get lettuce instead of buns and coleslaw instead of fries with my burger. I like options.   As for leftovers, the pickles were not as crispy of course, but everything still tasted good to me after being reheated.   If in the neighborhood again I would make another stop to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"We drove here after a day out with Thomas the Tank Engine 30 minutes south of here. I was hungry 2 hours ago & this place didn't let me down. We had 2 small children with us & I was a little concerned when we entered, but it turned out to be very kid friendly. We were seated without a wait. Waitress was friendly and competent about the menu. Appetizers came out fast. Meals came out in 30-35 minutes. Everyone's food was good to excellent. No complaints around our table & we ordered a wide variety. Pizza, Burger, Wings, Salad, Salmon, Ribs. The BBQ sauce was top of the line & the fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly... We recommend this place to others. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good food with a nice gluten free menu that includes drinks. My hubby loves the beer selection.  Staff have always been great."}
{"text":"The best wings in Cleveland. Nice neighborhood bar and grill.  Service is always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"My Star Rating Scale:   1- I will never ever return! 2- Okay, Meh. 3- Good, but my mom's is better. (lol) 4- Amazing Experience, will be back! 5- I am blown away, Bravo!   Atmosphere: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 5/5 Menu: 4/5 Location: 4/5  Overall: 4!  Breakdown: We had a bit of a wait until we finally got a greeter to seat us. The place was very nice inside. It has a nice modern chic rustic feel. Our server was super sweet and attentive. I did not have to ask for anything! She was very helpful and friendly. We did not wait long for our food and had refills before we had to ask. I had the Habanero Wings w/ Blue Cheese which was very good. For my main course I got the Philly which was good. I would have preferred if the peppers and onion were cooked more, but overall I enjoyed myself!   Final Thoughts: I really enjoyed this place. The service was great, the food was good and I will be back again!! Will update!"}
{"text":"I came here after being recommended by hotel staff. It was a good experience.  I had the salmon salad. It was AMAZING!!   The only complaint was I got seated outside but got no service. Had to go inside to the bar to get food. Was very disappointed. The bartender Kati was so awesome!! I will return when back in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We had the Rusty Bucket for the first time last night and it was very good. I had the fried pickles and the Codwhich. It was cooked very well. The cod was not overly greasy like most places and the pickles were fried perfectly. He had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. He said it was amazing. Not the best he has ever had but close. The chicken was fried perfectly. Usually you get over cooked or even under cooked. My son had chicken fingers and fries and to my surprise, he ate it all. Usually, he will only eat the fries and then nibble on the chicken but he said it was good so that really gives it plus. His daughter had the Rusty Bucket Cheeseburger and she enjoyed it. All in all, we wondered why we never tried it before! If you are ever in the area, try it. We actually ordered in but will go in next time."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat while in Charlotte. We are moving here soon so the last three times we've come down house hunting we had dinner here. We refuse to go elsewhere. Best beer selection. The fried pickles are HUGE. And did I mention to die for? The pesto chicken pasta is also what I order every single time. The dish is huge and so yummy. Every waitress is super friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.   One of the best philly steak & cheese I've had in a long time.    Wife's veggie burger was excellent."}
{"text":"Very nice food good service good and Parker the bar tender was also very good Explained menu very well but told us about special drink options  Will go back"}
{"text":"I made reservations a week in advance for 18 people on Sunday at 3:00 pm to celebrate my sons birthday. On arrival it was quite obvious they either lost my reservation or totally forgot, because they were surprised and not ready at all. Only one gentleman alone was trying to arrange tables to accommodate us, but he was having a difficult time doing so. I was told that they had a party of 24 in their private room, which I anticipated is where we would have been seated. The large group supposedly checked in at noon and was still there at 3:00. They also claim that they had another large party stay longer then anticipated in the dining room and that's why things weren't ready. I never saw a large party in the dining area nor did I see anyone preparing for our arrival, not until I came in and reminded them of my reservation. I decided to just have my party sit in the bar area amongst a few tables which worked out fine. They gentleman was apologetic and the service from the waitress was good. I was just disappointed  and would definitely recommend following up on any reservations made before arrival."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Definitely want to stick to the burgers, fries and true pub food. I've tried different things on the menu and they were just okay. The down fall here, which I've seen others post in their reviews, is the pricing. Seems to be a little steep. Not a place I'm going to take the whole family of 4 and stay under $100.00, espec if you're having a cocktail or two.  With that being said it is a fun, clean place with a great staff. Cool hang out if you wanna watch the game at the bar. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Start with my favorite: their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I've been to multiple locations and ordered many of buffalo chickens - never disappointed. Not even close. Possibly my favorite buffalo chicken sandwich. Panko breading, blue cheese crumbles, lettuce, tomato, and a [delicious] toasted sesame seed bun.  People have complained about the service but there's so much more that overshadows it. Although I'd agree the service doesn't match the best in town, it's certainly still adequate.  Other reasons this place gets 5 stars, 1) good prices, especially for the neighborhood, 2) great tv sizes/placement, etc. which you would hope for at a tavern, 3) awesome patio with a good amount of people watching (I'm a fan), 4) friendly staff and 5) very nicely built, laid out and maintained. Bonus - you get a Dum*Dum on the way out"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant for dinner around 5pm to ensure the place wouldn't be busy. We were sat outside by the hostess and were never greeted by a server. I had to get up and go to the host stand to ask for a server after TEN minutes of just sitting there. A server came to greet us and get our drink order and said he was sorry for the wait but was not our server for the night. We waited another ten minutes to get our beers from our ACTUAL server who then dropped off our drinks and started walking away without asking to take our order so I waived him down to place our order. I ordered the beer cheese burger cooked medium and my girl got a double stack quesadilla. It took TWENTY minutes to get  our food and guess what, it wasn't our server who brought it out to us. At this point we got up, I went to the bartender and got two boxes and we paid our bill. DONT GO HERE."}
{"text":"When food is just ok, at least you should play the local games on the TV. UNC on one TV in corner while WVU on big screen because staff wants to watch. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I will give it a 4 for now cause we only stopped in for a few drinks to see how it was. We did order the shrimp it says its served cold but they can serve them hot and they are delicious, peel and eat.  Jennifer the bartender short red hair is very fun and awesoke at what she does. We will be back to try the food. Glad to have another neighborhood go too."}
{"text":"The Rusty Bucket was a last minute find that ended up being a real winner. The service from the host stand, servers and managers was excellent. There are not many places that you see staff working together but the Rusty Bucket is a clear example of teamwork. Lisa, our server, did an amazing job and made the experience even more memorable. She was also assisting with a large party and we never felt like we were left out because of that. Lisa was personable and very helpful with making selections for our table. We had a variety of items including pizza, fish and chips, the Italian torpedo(oh my), salmon, buffalo chicken and a cheesesteak. All of the food was amazing!!!! Great job to your team and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice pub atmosphere. Great surprise that it is not your average bar food. We had the Mahi tacos. Great service on a Saturday afternoon. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sooo the name may not seem too appealing. Is their signature drink called a \"Tetanus Shot\"? No, not quite - I actually don't know if they have one or not. But they do make their own Sour Mix, Bloody Mary Mix and simple syrup. Maybe the Pine Fin???  Once inside though, any preconceived notions of this Tavern/Sports Bar will be gone. The décor is really nice - lots of dark burly, manly wood and a copper footrest at the bar. A couple of enormous flat screen TVs. Tons of seating indoors and out.  We came here for a little day drinking (it's a real hobby - look it up).  There's plenty on tap and in bottle, including seasonal brews from Birdsong and Triple C.  My friends ordered a bottle of Piper Sonoma knowing that it wasn't cold yet. The bartender worked her magic, with a huge tub of ice, some salt and about 10-15 minutes.  So a short visit - didn't get to try their food yet (blame it on Cripsy Bahn Mi-hehe) - even though appetizers and pizzas are are half price weekday afternoons (3-6 PM). There's always next time.  Good place to get a drink by Southpark!"}
{"text":"Poor, slow service with 2/3 of the place empty.  Food poor to average but Cheap.  manager on duty totally disinterested in our table...no social graces.  4th try with same results will be our last."}
{"text":"Average -   There's not going to be anything wrong with the food you order - it's just going to be average an similar to any other brewery/modern pub/brew house.  From gyoza to pasta. Burgers to wings   Good beer selection, friendly service, nice patio and lots of TVs"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and have never had a bad time.  We are fans of the Peel & Eat Shrimp and the Double Nickel Salad.  Also, if you go on a Sunday, the Hot Brown is delicious!!!  The Bloody Mary is also a must try.  Very nice beer selection as well.  All in all it's a go to spot when we are in Solon!"}
{"text":"After 2 Visits here i come away unimpressed. Food is mediocre at best albeit well priced for the area. Our waiter Anthony was exceptional but the rest on the staff seemed disengaged."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the service was fast. I think he business is used to people coming on their lunch break and having limited time so they have a system to get people in and out quick. The food was good- I thought the portion was a little small- or I was extra hungry not sure. Would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"We came here for a Panthers game on Sunday to have lunch and the experience was great. Most new restaurants go through growing pains, but this place was on point. Excellent service, food was wonderful and came out quick. Upscale sports bar, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here after work to celebrate my co-workers MBA graduation, & found what's becoming normal: an average place to go & have a beer.  The good news about the rusty bucket is that there's a nice outside patio to enjoy a cold one.  They offered a variety of the classic appetizer comfort foods: Fries, chili-fries, chips & dip, fried pickles, etc.  I forgot to ask about the specials, so I can't offer any insight on the happy hour deals.  Service was pretty good, nothing to complain about.  Basically you're getting a very dependable, average place to eat."}
{"text":"Very good. I had the mahi mahi tacos. The spice is just right - little kick but not overpowering.   My friend built his own pizza. I'm not a huge fan of pizza in general but this was good."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for a quick dinner on a Sunday night and the bartender was very funny and personable. Beer selection was good and reasonably priced. As a vegetarian, I'm always on the hunt for a good black bean burger, so that's what I ordered. The patty stays together well, which is a major win, but the flavor was a little bland... could've used some salt to bring out the flavor. Also, the regular fries were pretty great!   I'd definitely be willing to come back and try other menu items. The lady down one end of the bar was eating pizza that looked awesome! And the guy down the other end ordered an apple Betty dessert that looked amazing.   Oh and there's tons of free parking in the deck right there!"}
{"text":"Good for casual eating out with or without kids.  The atmosphere is good for four stars.  Food has gone downhill a bit from out last visit here sometime last year but still decent. We had wraps, chicken fingers and fries."}
{"text":"Food was good service was slow and there was only two other tables of people on a Saturday night.  I had the philly cheese and it was really good and got a huge amount.  Wife got the fish tacos and said they wasn't bad either.  Service was just slow."}
{"text":"Food has no taste. Server was friendly but not enoughto  return.  Surprised by the good reviews."}
{"text":"A great beer selection, good grub and lots of TVs are the ingredients for a great sports bar, and Rusty Bucket delivers on all counts. My family dropped in on a recent Sunday afternoon after a trip to SouthPark Mall, and devoured their delicious Double Stacked Quesadilla and some burgers while keeping an eye on the afternoon ballgames.   My massive Beer Cheese Burger was outstanding, especially when washed down with a delicious local brew (they have a couple of dozen North Carolina crafts on tap). Service was friendly and efficient, and the cozy, family friendly setting was the perfect escape from a cold and rainy November day. We were unimpressed with our first visit to Rusty Bucket last December, but management seems to have turned things around in the past year. Not sure it's quite worth four stars, but it easily earns three and a half."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about this place abs son was looking for a place with wings. We started off with the special grapefruit margaritas - very good. Margaritas were fresh and they make their own simple syrup. Ordered the half pound BBQ wings - very good. We ordered the tuna wrap and the green burger (jalopeno relish)! Both were very good. Son had the pepperoni pizza with thin crust - was nervous about pizza from a chain, but they make their own crust...came away very satisfied and will be back. P.S ordered the mac& Cheese but son didn't like the bread crumbs and they replaced it with the pizza ..good service and good food ."}
{"text":"So the food was just ok. The waitress is why it gets 2 stars. I ate half my sandwich and fries and she offered to pack up my leftovers.  She did so and I went home to only realize she packed up my sandwich and not my fries. SHE THREW MY FRIES AWAY. if this doesn't seem outrageous to you then we think fundamentally different. Also draft beers were like $6.50. I mean,  come on man I'm not ordering drinks at the Ritz here."}
{"text":"Normal chain restaurant look. Service is great and they are friendly. The food however is below average. I got the Gorgonzola steak which had barely any of the butter. The onion straws are cooked in the morning more as a garnish. If that's the case then you shouldn't get a pile of them. They wee room temperature and tasted like plastic. They substituted mashed potatoes after I complained. The potatoes tasted like instant potatoes not so good. My gf got the Mac and cheese with some chicken. She said the chicken also tasted like it was microwaved. All in all this place gets a few points for service but what good is that when they are slinging poo?"}
{"text":"My second visit to the RB.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and fun, resembling a British Public house where friends come together to socialize.  Great drink selections and the food is pretty strong.  I had the Steak French Dip and it was delicious!  The midweek night my wife and I visited the place was moderately busy and the wait staff was highly attentive.  If your looking for a casual, vibrant relaxing stop for you and your partner look no further than the Rusty B! Drinks and food will no disappoint!"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a good friend to have a party of 25-30 here I made a reservation for my son's graduation dinner.  Food was really great and reasonably priced. Very good service, zero complains. Glasses were filed on time and nothing awkward about serving such a large party all at once.  Will go again with a large or small party."}
{"text":"A 5 star for service.  Great waiter (he should be in fine dining really.). A nice time in the patio with drinks and wings.  Good prices too and a nice sized pour.  5 stars for the excellent service and honest staff who found my husband's sunglasses and didn't take them home.  Will def return, great patio and overall experience."}
{"text":"First off that Miss fear is beautiful here in the heart of SouthPark all brand new apartments brand new restaurant so there's no reason to complain about cleanliness.. service is very friendly very jokey bartender was very cool and knowledgeable of the drinks the food is average maybe a little below average chicken wings are a little rubbery and was still pink and the hamburger was dry.. of the some reason I keep going because I like the atmosphere and the service I recommend this place because it's safe and it's beautiful and clean and the beers are good there too"}
{"text":"This place was very unimpressive. What's worse is that I went on a Friday night. Man, was it over ridden by high school critters. It must have been after a basketball game, because everyone was wearing spirit gear, were all hyped up, and running all over. Plus, so many drunk parents. Overall the crowd was really unenjoyable for a childless, 25 year old. One redeeming factor was that the few drinks I had were good. Fairly certain they lacked very much alcohol though, which is a bit of a bummer for me. But for my lightweight friend, she loved it.   Essentially... Don't go here on nights when it will be full of drunk parents and their awkward pubescent children."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside /strip mall appearance fool you into thinking this is your average run of the mill tavern. They have a GREAT atmosphere and the bacon cheeseburger and fries are the BEST in Ohio! The service is also so friendly."}
{"text":"It was edible. The mixed drink -Daiquiri was incredibly sweet. The wings were substandard. Too fatty and not enough flavor. My salad was not great. I got the BBQ chicken salad. It was pretty boring. I don't know how they expect to grow as a chain. They make Taco Mac look like fine dining."}
{"text":"Went for drinks before Corkbuzz. It was quite busy in the bar but they found us a nice table in the corner. A server didn't come by for a bit but the bartender stepped in to get us started and  after that we had great service. Just had the chips and spinach con queso. The queso was pretty good and one batch of chips was super salty but the chips were fresh. I look forward to going back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Last night I braved the Charlotte cold and decided to try the Rusty Bucket. It had friendly service and very good food. I had the meatloaf that compares to Wolfgang Puck at a better price."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a wedding ceremony with a group of guests prior to the evening's reception. The restaurant was not especially busy and we were seated outside, and it often felt that we were forgotten.  Our server did not visit us for quite a while upon arrival, and that wait became the theme of the whole visit. We were seated around 1:30 and didn't leave until close to 3:30 - mostly because the wait between getting our drink orders, our food orders, and receiving our checks was extremely long.  The food itself wasn't bad at all. We got fried pickles as an appetizer, which I love, though I've had better than these. These fried pickles are whole pickles in breading, and I definitely prefer my fried pickles to be fried pickle chips. But the sauce they give you to dip them in was pretty good!  For a meal, I got the California Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries - which was pretty good! The burger was cooked well, which isn't always the case with a turkey burger, and it had a good flavor. The sweet potato fries were nothing special, but were nothing bad, either. I enjoyed the meal.  The wait for the check took so long that many in our group just threw down cash so they wouldn't have to wait for a credit card to be run.  I think I'd like this place if I wasn't running a time crunch and if the server didn't seem to forget about us. The food was worth a second trip to see if the service can redeem itself."}
{"text":"Ok, so here is the skinny....in a quick review.  I've been twice.  This place is my back up when all the other Southpark restaurants are on 1.5 and 2 hour wait times.   It's a step up from a sports bar as far as the decor goes.  Plenty of TVs to entertain you while your friends are on their phones doing the FB and Instagram thing.    Food is hit or miss.  The 2 times I've been:  Meatloaf was decent and the dinner salad was decent.  The Spinach Queso was really really good. The Bacon Cheeseburger was just alright.  I wasn't crazy about having relish on my burger....but I tolerated it.  My friend got the Macaroni and Cheese Entree.....it was more like Macaroni Soup.  He said it wasn't all that great but he could deal with it.  Service has always been nice, friendly, and prompt.  I question if this place will be here very long.   It's not that great but it's not awful either.    Give it a whirl.  It's either hit or miss really.  Hope you hit it."}
{"text":"I just love the name Rusty Bucket.  Its not a bad bar / restaurant either.  I've eaten there a few times and just hit it for drinks on other occasions.  I prefer to go here over the chains that line 91 just cause its something different.  Not that the food or drinks are crazy, out of touch, but its a place that people ask 'What the heck is the Rusty Bucket'?  Each time I went there I had great service and their food was really good.  I went with the burger last time while friends had salads and other sandwiches which too were above par.   I'd recommend the Bucket to anyone with friends and/or families looking for a sporty type restaurant that wants a decent variety in menu options at a price that won't hurt your wallet.  I had no wait, but only been there for lunch so for dinner you are on your own or you can always read other reviews.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love the salmon salad.  There are not a lot of great places to eat in the Twinsburg or Solon area.  That being said, this place is really very good.  My husband and I go here a few times a month.  My daughter loves the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend for dinner. Polite staff and everything came on time. Fried pickles were awesome, the bucket of seasoned shrimp was crazy good, and the beer cheese cheeseburger outstanding. Beer selection was really good with a good selection of local drafts. For bar food , this was really good and a nice sports bar atmosphere. The burger was the best I've had in Charlotte so far.."}
{"text":"Nicely done American pub look, overall friendly environment.  Based upon multiple visits:  Staff is a total hit or miss, while it felt like, if my bar attendant J. can do any less for me I was sure she would & I was 1 out 4 ppl in the entire area!!- her bar mate on the other hand was very attentive, offered refills, mentioned happy hr specials to patron. I, on the other hand, got my mechanically performed service- get them in & out style. Bar mate eventually took over. Typical American bar menu, but If you suffer from blood pressure, not the place for you! Near everything is overly salted. Not yet impressed with a particular dish."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars, mainly for the service!! The food was good, but the service was impeccable! If you go and happen to have Reggie as your server, plan on seriously enjoying your visit.  He was so accommodating, attentive, funny, kind and just all around enjoyable.  Someone in my group had an issue with their chicken wings and he handled it so well.  I visited the Rusty Bucket once before and was not super impressed, but this visit changed by mind.  The food was much better and the service was first class. Some co workers and I got there in time for happy hour which lasts until 6.  This meant that appetizers where half off and so were pizzas.  Drinks were $1 off. Our table ordered an array of apps from the wings, quesadilla, french fries and fried pickles.  The pickles were hands down my favorite.  I love fried pickles, but usually do not like them unless they are in chip form but these were in spears and were great!  I ordered the veggie pizza and it was chock full of fresh veggies and fresh mozzarella.  The crust was thin but tasty.  It could have used a bit more sauce, but that's about it.  Overall, I enjoyed my dinner and had a great experience."}
{"text":"To be honest I kind of thought the rusty nail would be a bit \"rustler\" but rusty is in name only. I came here for lunch and our sever was super awesome and very attentive. Never once did I have to go with out water (and usually that is a problem because I tend to down water like I just ran a marathon). The food was pretty good. They cooked my medium rare burger just they way I like it (aka they didn't over cook it). Also they have a good list of sides that you can do instead of fries. Try the tomato cucumber salad it's delish.   Nice atmosphere, good food and fantastic service. Good job!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and welcoming atmosphere. Food is good. Pretty much what you'd expect as far as pub food goes. Bar prices reasonable (especially for the area) with drink specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"I went to the Rusty Bucket during lunch with three co-workers.  We got there early to beat the lunch rush and were seated promptly.  Our beverages came quickly and our orders were taken promptly.  Then we waited for our food, and waited, and waited and waited.  Our food finally arrived giving us a mere 8 minutes to speed eat, taking half back to work in a doggie bag.  One co-worker ate IN THE CAR ON THE WAY BACK from the restaurant.  As soon as our food arrived we asked for our check.  It was brought quickly but then our payment wasnt picked up for ten more minutes.  The restaurant was not even that busy.  I did complain on the restaurant website and was sent a $30 gift card to give them another shot.  We agreed to CALL IN our order ahead of time and go pick it up thinking this way we would actually get to eat our lunch during our LUNCH HOUR.  Nope.  They screwed up the order.  NEVER AGAIN!  morons."}
{"text":"I have only been here later in the evening for drinks.  The drinks are just ok, nothing special.  They do however, have a half off bottle of wine special on Mondays!  That's a huge plus.   The bartender was nice.  She talked to us and interacted with everyone despite being pretty busy.  I have never tried their food, but heard some of the things are must try's.    The only thing I hated was the music.  It was super depressing.  I requested they change it, but maybe they weren't allowed.  I'd come back for sure.  I like the area."}
{"text":"Here on a Saturday eve around 6:00. Food good, as always. Server WONDERFUL. Thanks Vinnie!!!!!  Problem being seated at table by the window in front of the restaurant.  Very cold.  We're from cle, we can handle that, but area surrounding our table used as a waiting area.   Kids reaching over back of bench waving suckers over my hubby's head.  Not cool."}
{"text":"This place was very cool. The server was knowledgable and friendly and gave us great drink suggestions. I had a grapefruit Martini and Baldie had the Bloody Mary and he loved it. He's picky about bloody Marys, trust me. They come in three options for spiciness. My drink was citrusy and just enough sweet. We had the bucket of shrimp and they were firm and fresh and crisp. I find that a lot of shrimp are iodiny, not these. They came with cocktail sauce and a remoulade. So good. I ordered the taco salad and it can feed three people. That bitch was huge! It had shredded lettuce with a creamy cilantro dressing and it came on a flat fried tortilla with ground beef, melted cheddar and tomatoes and jalapeños. It was so good and I was mad I couldn't finish it. Overall, we really liked it. We will be back for a burger next time and some cinnamon dessert thing that looked so good. My Bucket was full when I left, fill yours here!!"}
{"text":"Good for what it is. Nothing that blew me away but nothing negative to say about the experience. My order was done to my liking and so was my husband's. Very welcoming crew. Waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable. It's a pub - not a place we'd go for a date but good for the casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The service was awesome! Thank you Parker! I had the nightly special which was shrimp scampi,  and it did not disappoint. It was great! I will return next time I'm in South Park!"}
{"text":"The Bucket is good food, and pretty good service at a not so great price - I could go to the Lizard for less and they even have some happy hour specials."}
{"text":"With the exception of the bartenders, the staff tonight was confused, apathetic, and generally incompetent."}
{"text":"The food was good but not good enough to overshadow the rudest waitress we have ever encountered. We felt as if our very presence was a total inconvenience to her. She made no attempt to hide her irritation that we asked for extra lemon for the waters we had just waited nearly 20 minutes for. She never did bring them. Our entire interaction with her was unpleasant from beginning to end.  The reason I am giving this place 3 stars rather than 1 is because after completing a comment card voicing our discontent a manager did attempt to contact us. They left a voicemail and seemed very concerned we had had such a bad experience. I still need to return their call but the fact that they reached out to us at all is admirable and appreciated."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for lunch if you're in the Solon area.     I ordered a bowl of the French onion soup to start. The soup was salty and delicious with a healthy portion of thick cheese on top.   My brother used to work in the area and told us that the only sandwich worth getting was the buffalo chicken sandwich. The meal itself was huge so me and my mom ordered one and split it - half of the sandwich was more than enough!   The breading on the chicken breast was great and had a nice crunch while the sauce had a perfect balance of flavor and heat. There was an appropriate amount of blue cheese - enough to taste but not overpower. We were pointed in the right direction! I would order this again.   The service was a tad slow for there not being many people in the restaurant at the time, but our waitress was kind and they split the sandwich for us so we didn't have to do it ourselves, this was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Great food with a relaxed pub environment.  Not a quiet place for a romantic dinner, but a fun family friendly place to unwind with friends.    Great appetizers and food choices.  I was expecting bar food, and was pleasantly surprised with the full menu options.  The food was delicious and fresh.   Service was outstanding.  Friendly and engaging, and very attentive."}
{"text":"The tuna wrap is awesome...tuna tastes fresh and the dipping sauce is delicious.  It's almost like a sushi burrito.  The sweet potato fries are also a great choice.  The mixed drinks are a little pricey.  You can't taste much of the alcohol in the mixed drinks which can be good or bad depending on what you like.  My favorite is the nonalcoholic root beer on tap.  It's a solid choice for both adults and kids."}
{"text":"So yummy   Great staff  great drinks  love the feel in the outdoor seating area. Feels like New York!"}
{"text":"Coming from a girl who's dating a man from Ohio, he was extremely excited and looking forward to the day that Rusty Bucket finally opened here so he can have a good \"go to\" place down here. We came into this location for the first time tonight and have no complaints. We were promptly greeted and seated at our table and our waitress was just the sweetest young lady. She is already knowledgable about the menu and drinks and remained extremely attentive during the entire meal. I ordered the gluten free mahi mahi tacos (absolutely a + that they have a  gluten free menu to choose from) and my boyfriend had the rusty bucket burger which he enjoyed and he's a picky burger guy. We even splurged on the fried pickles (I know, I know, not gluten free) Which were.... Amazing. \"You don't get fried pickles like this down here\" : these are the words that I have heard from my boyfriend every time he's talked about this place. And he's right! They are chunky spears fried in a crunchy and delicious breading that leaves the pickle still crisp after being fried, not soggy. Definitely will remain my guilty pleasure for a long time to come. All of the food was fresh, well cooked, and presented acceptably. Of course you have a ton of beer selections but with an unfortunate lack of lagers or lighter beers, but they do have creative cocktails. I had the gin drink on special tonight (they have cocktail specials daily) and it was tasty. All of the waiters took turns walking the dining room refilling waters, etc. at all tables, not just theirs. Everyone had a smile on their face, never rushed you, and were very respectful but still have that look of \"this is all new\" in their eyes, but that's okay, it is new! Overall enjoyed it.  Good place to have in town and it will be our regular go to. It is a tavern, so expect people and TV's and crowds, but it is far better than any other chain tavern around. This isn't a top of the line $$$$ dining experience so it shouldn't be judged as one. Plus, well, I support all things Ohio these days and I'm happy it's brought a piece of home to my boyfriend! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times in the span of 6 years and have enjoyed everything I've ordered. Selection is pretty good and they are generous with their fries! They gave us a free dessert for my hubby's bday 2 years ago and that's getting super rare these days. Pittsburgh restaurants don't give out any bday or anniversary freebies or even bread at all.   Service is peppy; no complaints. Parking and location are great because it's in the Solon shopping center. Prices are average. Try to go here on non-weekend dates as other reviewers mentioned as it gets pretty crowded."}
{"text":"The kids' meals were good and a good value. The Italian torpedo sandwich rste 5 stars and the taco salad is tasty abbodanza"}
{"text":"It was better than I expected. The vibe was pretty cool, location was cool, food was ok, staff was great, price was reasonable and drinks were amazing. Overall good experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"Three words- Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  I've had other food here and it never disappoints, but the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is the best Buff Chix Sand I've ever had. They do some sort of voodoo on the chicken to give is a perfect, crispy batter and the chicken inside is moist and delicious. (Sorry for the use of the word 'moist'. ) The sandwich has lettuce, tomato, a little mayonnaise and bleu cheese crumbles. It is not drowned in Ranch or Creamy Bleu Cheese dressing, as many restaurant sandwiches are.  The tabasco sauce has an excellent buffalo zing to it, but it's not too greasy or spicy. The other thing that impressed me- my bun is never soggy. How do they pack all that flavor into a sandwich and not risk a soggy bun???  The Bucket is not an inexpensive place; this is not your local watering hole as the name would suggest. The atmosphere is friendly, clean, and aesthetically pleasing. But back to the price thing... $6.50 for a small vodka cocktail certainly isn't crazy, but this isn't where I'd go to drink.  I do think Rusty Bucket misses the mark on Happy Hour. Solon is a mecca for 9 to 5'ers who would rather grab a few brews than deal with the rush hour traffic.  They didn't have any good deals or pleasing specials or special menu. I think they can do better here."}
{"text":"Love it!  I frequent this Rusty Bucket often.  The food quality and experience is always appreciated!"}
{"text":"My coworker loves going to the Rusty Bucket. He orders the French onion soup and Buffalo Chicken sandwich everytime. I have dabbled with other things here and nothing comes close to the Buffalo chicken sandwich. It is not the other options are not good. They are all good. The salads are good. The burgers are also satisfying. The panko crusted Buffalo chicken breast is just my favorite version of the sandwich that I have tried anywhere. The piece of meat is usually huge, and you can eat it with a fork and knife and be content. They allow you to sub out veggies or other sides for the fries too. I don't know if there is an upcharge. If so, it is only a dollar. I don't think they do though. That sandwich is so good!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Nice beer. Has a patio. Could be bigger however with better chairs. Also have a good fried pickles."}
{"text":"This is a great new place! Food and tap beer are good and reasonably priced. Bartender Stacy was attentive and friendly. We sat in the bar area. Nice tv's and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.   Surprising because I went in expecting basic tavern food, and some of the menu choices (cottage cheese, roasted carrots, apple sauce as sides, for example) had me worried I'd stumbled into an old-folks restaurant in disguise.  However, I made my choices, including a Reuben, and was delighted to find freshness, quality and attention to detail.   What I remember most, though, is that my waitress was amazing. Friendly but efficient, she made great recommendations and had a terrific, happy attitude. Even talked me into a dessert (sticky bun bread pudding) which was awesome. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Was a big fan of the double bacon cheeseburger. They had forgotten our wings and drink refills were tough to come by, which dropped the review. I'll prob go back to see if the wings make it to the table as I have heard good things overall from my peers in the office."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. It has a typical bar food menu and everything we had was great. The establishment is clean and has a nice atmosphere. The staff was all friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way to run some errands in Solon  and this cozy bar never disappoints. I ordered the chicken fingers, as usual. The appetizer portion is huge! I switched out the fries for a tomato and cucumber salad. Very good!   Husband ordered the ahi tuna wrap (no wrap) and loved it! Always surprised when ahi tastes so fresh at a bar, but this was great.   Will always be a neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times. I was hoping to enjoy more due to the convenient location and cool atmosphere.  The food is average and service is lackluster and sometimes with an attitude. They have a good selection of beer, but basic bar food with no originality."}
{"text":"It was an awesome atmosphere. They had amazing craft beers on tap such as purple haze, which I wasn't expecting. Our waitress Torri was awesome as well very knowledgeable about helping us pick out options. The burger I chose was the Beer Cheese burger, which was so juicy. Our service was awesome so I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is great, had a hamburger ...it was juicy, meatloaf...was on top of mashed potatoes, had fried onions on top, on the side was green beans and carrots, chili beans...great taste with cheese in it, turkey burger..was juicy too. I was with my grown sons and tried all of these ...they were all great! I'll be going back again!  Great service...looks nice inside..will be going back soooon!"}
{"text":"Second time:  Looking forward to coming here again. We walked in late and sat at the bar. Watched the Cavs play. Had a good veggie burger, the yummy quesadilla and Guinness Stouts.   First time: I totally enjoyed it all. Went for Happy Hour with my girl friends. Our waitress, Jennifer, was great. Very professional and pleasant. Fast service, as we got there at 4 pm. Prices were some of the best I've seen. Apps, wings and pizzas are half price!  Drinks less one dollar. The Quesadilla was recommended, and it was delicious!  Thin and crisp. Potstickers were equally as good. Nice place for families, tho it's a tavern atmosphere.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Rusty Bucket for several years now. The food is always consistent as we as the service. Good place to bring kids. The French onion soup is some of the best in Cleveland. My go to is usually the chicken pasta. 3 stars because it's good, not great."}
{"text":"Reasonable food and a reasonable price.   Local pub feeling with much better than typical bar food.   It's not a Dante Bocuzzi venue, but it is a great place for casual food & brew.  Servers tend to be foodies, which is very helpful when asking about the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great place, and better yet it knows it's a bar and they don't try to be something they are not.  Great atmosphere for coming and having a drink or two or three or, well you understand.  Friendly staff and able to strike up friendly conversation as well at bar."}
{"text":"A pretty nice atmosphere. The service was quick and not once did we have to ask for refills. I thought that was a major plus.  Their fish and chips meal was delicious. One of the best actually. We ate outside on the \"patio\" which was a little too cramped for me."}
{"text":"Spinach con queso, salmon salad and fish & chips. All were quite good. A place to which one should return."}
{"text":"Recently went with a large group from work. We had multiple appetizers  (Shrimp bucket, Sliders, Fried Pickles and Quesadillia) all were very good. Our waiter did an excellent job and the atmosphere was also good.  I had salmon with sticky rice and mixed vegetables. The salmon was good, but not best I have had.  Rice and vegetables were good.  Overall, I thought this was a very good restaurant and I would recommend it for a mid range dinner."}
{"text":"This place was on the borderline of sub-par and just OK. We didn't see any staff for 15 minutes and seated ourselves. Took about 15 more to get drinks. Our food came out wrong. The server was friendly but absent mostly. This place needs some help."}
{"text":"I'm pretty bummed they took the Greek Salad off the menu because that was my all-time favorite here.  Otherwise, the Taco Salad is yummy and unique.  Their sandwiches are also pretty good.  All in all, a decent place for lunch...but a tad pricey."}
{"text":"This is always our go-to dinner date location because it never disappoints! Great food, prices and service. Make sure to sign up for their emails because you receive tips and discounts on the regular. Also, be sure to try the pizza - it has a crispy thin crust and the best sauce in CLE."}
