{"text":"This has become my new favorite haunt in Charlotte. I tried it for the first time while a friend was visiting from out of town. We went for pre-dinner cocktails and liked it so much (we had considered just cancelling our dinner reservations) we returned immediately after dinner for more. I have gone back since then, and enjoyed it every bit as much.  The small plates, cocktails, ambiance, and service are all excellent. But if you're one of those people who assumes the rules shouldn't apply to you because (insert lame excuse here) then you probably shouldn't go. They take their house rules seriously, including the dress code. As we were leaving someone was turned away for wearing shorts.   However if you like a relaxed, grownup atmosphere and can act accordingly you will love this place. So read the house rules on the website before you sign up for membership and realize yes, they do apply to you too. The rules, which basically spell out \"act like a grownup\", are part of what make this place so enjoyable. You don't have to worry about some blowhard ruining your night because he thinks it's Hooters. Put away your phone, or put it on vibrate and know you'll need to go outside to make or take that call, put on your big boy/girl clothing and manners, then enjoy the evening. The cocktails and the food are worth the effort.  The food and drink menu changes so understand if you see a cocktail or dish on Yelp or elsewhere it may or may not be on the menu when you go. Just know that what is on the menu when you do go is going to be REALLY good."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything and Dot Dot Dot fell WAY short of making a good one. To begin, this is far from a speakeasy. It's a restaurant; a very loud, overpriced restaurant, with \"house rules\" that are not being followed. I used to live in DC and this was nothing like my experiences with speakeasies up there. I would say The Cellar in uptown is a far better option for the price and quality of drinks. Plus, The Cellar actually has real history.   Dot Dot Dot served decent drinks (they were inventive but mine seemed water downed lowering its rating). Ordered the charcuterie which was far from creative. It was an underwhelming few bits of crostini and cheese, not worth the price. Ambiance wasn't there at all, as it was just as loud as a sports bar. The waitress could barely hear our orders and having a conversation with the couple we were with required a great deal of repeating ourselves.  Nothing about this place spoke class and eloquence of a speakeasy other than the \"leather\" books on the book shelves.  Finally, this is petty, but two unisex bathrooms, one toilet in each? Come on. Just makes for a terrible experience as well. Such a pet peeve of mine, particularly when there's a booth right next to the bathrooms.  If you haven't paid for the membership yet, don't! You're wasting $10 to eat and drink mediocrity."}
{"text":"I'm member since they opened and when I tried to get in they let someone else before me (they let them buy a membership before us) why would buy a membership for? Awefull service outside, got told 20 min wait and was more like 50 min"}
{"text":"This place .. beautiful interior, excellent service but the knowledge of alcohol is pathetic. I switched out Elijah Craig for red breast.. equivalent liquors and my drink was $27 dollars before tax. An entire bottle of red breast is $71 so I've paid for over 1/3 the bottle. Cocktail bars are suppose to know about cocktail and liquors not over charge for Ignorance. Won't be back. The drink was an old fashion so nothing that takes specialized knowledge per the owners rude comment below regarding a \"cocktail\" with 1.5 ounces per drink = $432 ($675 with 1oz pours) in his pocket off of one $71 bottle of liquor. Do the math big guy - you're arrogant and rip people off. You can get the same drink at Seoul food meat company for $18 and workman's friend for about $20. I suggest going to these places! Better food and better service without a steep price.  He even admits below Elijah Craig is only $29 - cheap liquor are the go to's on the menu. Pathetic for such an \"upscale\" place."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. I had a Manhattan and an Old Fashion. Perfect. To say my wife and I shared the Creole BBQ Shrimp and the Charcuterie. The house also have is an incredible shrimp dish they are thinking of for the menu. Everything was superb. And the service was devine."}
{"text":"Okay Ive been to speak easy numerous ti.es before and this place is the total opposite. 1st off the check in person upfront said they were at capacity and said were on a list for a 20/30 min wait.  So we went across the street to get a drink in.  Literally 3 mins in we get a call/text saying there ready for us.  REALLY? You told us 20/30 mins.  We texted we be there in 15 mins.  A woman called literally after we texted l, (rudely) asking were we are at and that theres people waiting for a a table.  1st of all dont tell us its a 20/30 min wait when its 5 min.  And dont get mad when we arrive  20/30 min at expected time we were told.  Server was great thats all.  This place is so loud you might as well go to a regular bar.  We didnt order food because thatz not the main focus of a  speakeasy. \" we  shouldnt be asked or given a food menu before their beloved cocktail menu.  That right there told us this was a restaurant more than a cocktail bar.  Long story short.  No secrecy, Bad Customer Service/customer service, WAY TOO LOUD,  Dress code not enforced.  You basically pay a membership to eat there and not to enter a EXCLUSIVE CLUB to drink their unique cocktails they have to offer from a speak easy mindfield.  Not returning at all.  Good Luck"}
{"text":"Bouncer yelled at us from 100 yards away that we cannot get in.   Polo's, hats, shorts, typical dilworth/Myers park folk stay away. Money doesn't matter."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It is Charlotte's modern speak easy. Now before you go it is a private club even though they serve food. $10 membership fee, I believe you can register online before you come. Staff is great and very hospitable. Space is small, but love the environment. They have a great craft cocktail list. They do serve beer and wine.... but this is a place to enjoy the hand made cocktails. There are plenty to chose from... I know there is at least 1 on the list that will fit what you like. If your not sure, tell the server or bartender what you like and they will make one to suit you.  Here is a BIG hint... you walk into a small quaint bar/club and there are multiple shelves of liquor... craft  cocktails are their specialty.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I don't often write a review after a single visit but I was so charmed by Dot Dot Dot and there is such a curious mix of reviews that I had to throw my five stars into the mix.  We got there a bit after 8 on a Saturday night and had to wait about 45 minutes to get in. No problem, I anticipated this based on other reviews so we went to a nearby bar (when you're in Park Road it's easy to have multiple stops) until we got a text that they were ready for us. The hostess recommended we sit at the bar for our first visit so that we could watch them create the cocktails and be part of the action. I'm so glad we did because everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and welcoming. You can tell they really want to create an atmosphere where you want to become a regular. Everyone introduces themselves and asks for your name and asks about your experience. Multiple different people will check on you, including the owner who works behind the bar himself. I really cannot commend them enough on establishing such great rapport with their patrons.  Now, onto the drinks. DAMN. You can get a good cocktail at a few different places in Queen City but this was really remarkable. I started with a bourbon drink with some honey and citrus which was delicious. My second drink was the kicker, though. Rum with grilled pineapple blended in and freshly shaved nutmeg on top. My jaw legitimately dropped after the first sip and the owner cracked up because he watched me lose my mind over it. It was simply delectable.   As for atmosphere - it's refreshing not to have any screens or distractions. It's decorated simply with class. It does get loud but only because everyone is chatting; the music is kept pretty low. I definitely saw a few men in blue jeans that I'm not positive fit the dress code, so it's hard to say how that plays out when someone doesn't fully \"comply.\" It is definitely a place to kick back and enjoy yourself - not to get plastered and rowdy.   I hope they stick around for a long time and develop a strong identity within the Charlotte cocktail/bar community. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to taking my out of town friends. To put it lightly, we were disappointed. It was awkward walking past garden manure to the door. We were greeted by a less than friendly door man who said we needed to buy a $10 membership online.   Unsurprisingly, the website performs like the Panthers at the Superbowl...it doesn't.    Good luck getting into this place."}
{"text":"Phenomenal drinks and quality service but it's so loud you have to speak loudly. I love the drinks and the no screens atmosphere. Service is great! I would give four and a half stars for the loud atmosphere because it's a bit hard to hear your friends over the noise, and they need to work on acoustics. I had the Truffle New York sour drink and it was excellent and the flavor was amazing!! The other people in my group tried the No Last Call, Thai Basil Smash and Old Fashioned drinks. We liked all of them. The Truffle NY sour was the favorite. The reservation process was a bit long, loud atmosphere and wait time was a factor but you cannot give half stars on yelp. Overall I would visit again and try more drinks! Love the library decorations too!  Prices average about 13-14 dollars per drink. Parking is behind park road shopping center and look for the black sign with three ellipses."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Calling ahead to get a table is meaningless. Reserving your place in line on the app is meaningless. Putting your name on the list at the door is meaningless. We waited over an hour and a half to get in while the door man let group after group in before us. Skip this place and go to a normal bar. It's not special. It's not quiet. It's small and loud and not worth your time or effort."}
{"text":"Fantastic venue. Would give it 4 or 5 stars for ambience, and beverage menu. However am giving it 2 stars for repeated poor service on an administrative level. Visited for the first time in early Jan 2018 with friends. Loved it. Went online the next day and purchased the $10 membership. Never received an email confirm. Never received the card in the mail. Called and left 2 messages (that were never returned) asking when it would be mailed. The $10 was indeed charged to my AMEX on 1/14/18.  Went back with several friends on Thurs May 17th. We arrived at 8pm. Explained the situation to the guy working the front door. He said I was \"not in the system\" but he would have a manager talk with me to resolve after I explained the charge date and the never returned calls. When we arrived - the place was at most 20% filled. After an hour I asked the waitress about the manager and she rolled her eyes and said said, \"sorry, we are so unorganized here\". Can anyone who works there and reads this - please tell me who to call to resolve. Seems ridiculous that this is hard to resolve as we are only talking about $10. But evidently it is. I am posting this as i find it hard to believe I am the sole customer to experience this issue."}
{"text":"I had my friends birthday party at Dot Dot Dot on Friday. I purchased a membership a few weeks before my visit. When you arrive, they scan your ID and provide you with your membership card. You walk down a long brick corridor which gives you more of a secret speakeasy feel. They serve the best drinks I've had in charlotte so far. For a good drink I used to only go to the punch room at the ritz Carlton but Dot Dot Dot is definitely strong competition. The drinks taste amazing but be careful, they are very strong. You will want to pace yourself for sure.   The food taste good but don't come hungry. The portions are small so if you're expecting to fill up, you'll need to order many items before feeling satisfied. Their small plates are full of flavor so if you just need a snack it's a nice treat.  The only area I hope improves soon is the noise level. It was next level loud. I'm not sure if it was the other guest or the music but if you're looking for quiet and intimate, make sure you go during a time/day the place is empty. Otherwise the noise level is at a 10.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been telling me to go here for a few months as he has become a \"regular.\" And despite the $12-18 cocktails, I now I know why.   First of all, it's not the easiest place to find, even if you ARE familiar with Park Road's Backlot (as a native Charlottean, and never having had a reason to go to the Backlot, I adore this. See also: Amelie's, Midwood Smokehouse). Anyway, it's tucked away without the name advertising it's whereabouts, just their logo. I say this all as a good thing. It has this \"well known secret speakeasy\" feel to it. If this is what they were intending, they nailed it. The second I walked in, my thought was \"wow I feel like we are in Manhattan!\" Mostly dim lit, smallish and intimate tables, spanning to larger tables with better lighting. A beautiful bar. A bookcase spanning a wall, and lots of exposed brick. They nailed it.  Second of all, I was very under dressed. I joined above friend and another guy as a last minute decision and I was wearing running shoes, leggings, and a fleece jacket. Fortunately on a Thursday night at 11pm it went unnoticed as it was not super crowded. The website does make it quite clear that this is not a sports bar, and there are certain expectations (wearing my bright pink Brooks and blue fleece not on their list) of the guests to ensure a classy AF environment. I'm fine with that. We need places like that.   Third of all, their cocktail menu is on point. The owner/mixologist takes a lot of pride in this, and it's obvious. Between the three of us, we had two rounds and 4 different cocktails and they were each delicious. We had a total of 3 Old Fashions (round 2 pour was much stronger than round 1), a Penicillin, a Hildago and a Strawberry Fizz. Like I said- all delicious. We did wait a bit for the drinks, but they are handcrafted and they don't cut corners. Worth it.   I will be back again soon for another cocktail, a gander at their extensive bourbon menu, and possibly even some food. This is a phenomenal place and it should be on your bucket list soon."}
{"text":"Well, I was excited to hear that Dot Dot Dot was opening, so I had to go check it out asap. Since they don't take reservations, our group decided to head there early on this past Friday. Oh, by the way if you didn't know, this place is a private club with a membership needed to get in. I signed up online before it opened, but you can pay your $10 membership at the door before going in. Overall it was a pretty easy process to get in. The entrance is very unassuming as well, and it's in the backlot of the Park road shopping center, just look for a loading dock type area.  Once inside, we are led down a long dark corridor and the host greets us to take us through  another door and finally our table. The interior atmosphere is very classy and dark, kind of like someone's large fancy study or library that just so happens to have a bar in it. As others have mentioned, it can be a fairly boisterous space, and we noted that the volume definitely increased as more people filled in. While we needed to speak loudly, I never really felt like I was yelling or screaming. If anything, the dim lighting was more of a challenge to deal with initially, but the eyes adjusted. Now onto the menu, the drink list is extensive and I'm sure that they can make you pretty much anything with all the bottles that I saw. As a group, we tried the vesper, the hot box, negroni, the bi-plane, a Moscow mule, the final countdown and the front porch punch. All the drinks were well made, and my favorites were the negroni and Moscow mule. Some of the prices seemed marginally high, but nothing crazy and premium drinks demand a premium price. As for the food, this is the part of the experience that fell flat for me. We tried the gravlax, oysters, octopus, charcuterie, chicken skewers and beef tartar. Overall the concept seems to be small plate style. The gravlax and tartar were my favorites by far, but nothing really stood out. We received our oysters already dressed with horseradish and mignonette, as opposed to those being put on the side. The oysters were also a little warm, which may have been from the warm mignonette, I'm not sure. Either way, they were fine. Having all said that, the service is the last matter to cover. Overall, service was very good with some hiccups, such as twice food presented to us that was for another table and once when our food was presented to another table but ultimately made it to us. Also, they need a whisky/spirit list, as they apparently have an extensive list. And one last thing would be to explain the components of the charcuterie plate, which cheeses and meats are on the plate. I don't think that they were noted on the menu or by the server when the plate was put on the table.   I know that this is a long review, but I really like the concept of Dot Dot Dot, so I want them to do well. At this point, I would be more inclined to stop in for drinks and maybe a snack as opposed to a full meal. I will definitely return and look forward to sitting at the bar and seeing the bartenders work."}
{"text":"It sounds like a great concept but a poor execution. We waited outside talking with the person outside before you could get into the restaurant. He check our ID's but never put our name on the list. Once we saw people who came and put our name in after we got there We said something. He was just like my fault you will get the next available table. It still took 10 mins to get a table and when we went in there were a few empty and even space at the bar. It says you have to pay $10 to become a member however no one ever check if you were a member. it also stats that you can bring only 3 guest. We say parties of 6 or more go in with only one person claiming to be a member. It seems like they don't follow their own rules and they are just out to make extra money.  Once we got in the atmosphere was a speakeasy feel. The drinks were pricey. I expected for it to be above average however it was above expectations. We ordered a drink each and our bill came to $34 excluding tax. I can by a full meal for that. The only saving grace for this place was that while we were waiting the bartender came out and offered a drink to some of the people waiting in line."}
{"text":"What can I say.......where is it???? hidden in the corner behind the dumpster on the back side of Park Road shopping center.   This obscure place is interesting......the membership is 10$......I'm not sure why but I guess they demand exclusivity, class, proper etiquette. When we got there a lit woman at the door was quizzing everyone about the Black Panthers....and I don't mean the movie recently released.   The place had a strong odor of smoked salmon.... must be those \"hot boxes.\"  Drinks were good, the vibe was good. We didn't get appetizers but they looked decent. Best cherries in my drink.   I looked up the definition of mixologist as I wanted to understand why my drinks were exceptionally expensive.  Basically you don't need a degree but you apparently learn to mix drinks, talk to customers and smile. Right.....nothing like Tom Cruise/Cocktail...... I'm sure the millenials will like that enough to justify their self esteem boosting baller lifestyle.   So, based on other reviews about  the magical effect this place has on relationships, oddly enough,  I broke up with my boyfriend after an hour and 4 years......   ok. just kidding about the relationship..... we will go back. We did buy the membership."}
{"text":"Neat new addition to the back lot at Park Road Shopping Center. My wife and I stopped in for a pre-dinner drink to celebrate our anniversary. First off, I recommend checking out the website and purchasing a membership in advance of your visit. It is $10 and allows you to bring up to 3 guests. When you show up, they scan your driver's licence and in you go. Overall entry ambiance is pretty neat - you walk down a narrow brick corridor, which opens up to the actual room at the end. I will say this place was larger than I expected and was fairly busy and loud (to be expected on a Friday night). I will say the noise is what cost them my 5th star as I'm used to the Cellar or the Punch Room where it is a bit quieter and feels a bit more exclusive. However, I was impressed with the service. When we told our waitress that it was our anniversary, she brought out 2 glasses of champagne on the house. As for the drinks, I ended up ordering the Hot Box - a mix of bourbon, scotch, and bitters smoked with pecan wood. The drink was perfectly mixed and the presentation was fun as it is brought out in a box with smoke from the wood embers. Overall I will consider returning to check out more of their drink menu and perhaps part of their food menu."}
{"text":"I'll say it again, I'm a wannabe scotch connoisseur and farrrrr from it. But it doesn't mean I don't enjoy trying out some nice cocktail bars and Dot Dot Dot is a winner! It has a super speakeasy vibe to it, I never knew it even existed behind such plain industrial doors but once you're inside, you feel like you're in some James Bond movie about to crash the villains secret deal. The couches and chairs are all in the classic Chesterfield deign, there is a great dim lit ambiance and nice woodwork. A+ on the atmosphere here. As for the drinks, spectacular and well crafted with an extensive selection. The bartenders are great people as well. Really enjoyed my time here and will definitely be back!  PS. There is a membership fee of I think $5/10 for the year but you get 2/3 free guests each time so it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the drinks and the plates were amazing. My friends ha stage front porch rum, strawberry fizz, and the final countdown. I ordered the hot box and it did not disappoint.  There is only one other place who makes this drink in comparison and that is Dogwood. The food is quality and fantastic. The cheese and charcuterie is good with quality choices but was not my favorite tonight. By far my favorite was the drunken chicken and portabella skewer and the pork spiedie skewer.  Oh and I liked the gravlax too. Dot Dot Dot is a dark and intimate. The atmosphere is louder than I expected but isn't every place loud. I liked the diverse ages coming in, and it leans more to the 35+ age group.  The service was superb."}
{"text":"PSA: this is a membership only establishment. Membership is $10 a year which allows you to bring three guests throughout the year. The overall vibe of this restaurant is very prohibition and secretive. You have to walk down a longish brick hallways before a second hostess shows you to your seat. The decorations and atmosphere is lovely. We went on a Friday night, and I will admit it was much louder than I was expecting it to be. Overall, we had a wonder night. Courtney was our waitress and she was great. We tried the octopus, burrata, ahi tuna, and risotto fritters. All were phenomenal! As for cocktails (the real reason we are all here), I had the truffle New York Sour and my boyfriend had their hot box. The hot box was served in a Bookers Bourbon cedar box covered in smoke. It was literally being hotboxed. Absolutely recommend it!!   I'm sure we will be back again!   Follow me @jodieats_ for recipes and tasty treats"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks or light dinner. The small plates are unique and delicious. We got there around 7 and waited until 730pm for our table. We were seated at the bar and had great service. There is a nice selection of cocktails. What we really enjoyed is the atmosphere. This is a place nestled into the back of a strip mall reminiscent of speakeasies in NYC or my hometown of Miami. Inside, there are small tables and the bar is illuminated from behind the bartenders and there is soft lighting throughout. It wasn't too loud and it just felt like a place to linger."}
{"text":"Great classic cocktails, and terrific top quality small plates, this place is a gem. Love it."}
{"text":"Apparently \"Southern Hospitality\" doesn't apply here. What a disappointment and a waste of a great concept..."}
{"text":"I love this establishment! I makes me fill all Great Gatsby every time I go. I love the hostess Ingrid!!! She always remembers me when I come to town and she always has a joke to put a smile on my face. This is my secret place to bring all my friends to when I'm in the city! I'm even looking to have my bridal party here for drinks soon. Keep up the good work you guys! Im throughly impressed"}
{"text":"No sign with restaurant name, front door on a shipping dock next to two dumpsters. We show up 10 minutes before \"the members\" that invited us.  We were denied entry until \"the members\" arrived. Door opens and we have to walk down a very long and very dark hallway, taking baby steps walking super slow so as not to break an ankle. Drinks were good, food was marginal.  The \"exclusive club\" BS doesn't work for me, when the experience can't back it up.  I don't plan on returning, and certainly wouldn't pay a dime for a membership to a wanna-be exclusive club that just is not that good."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to see Stefan (most recently over at Heist) behind his new speakeasy bar for a while now and I'm so glad my husband and I got to go on their second official night.  We previously signed up for the 10.00 membership since it's considered a private club. You can do it online but then must receive a confirmation email that your payment went through. We got to the door, gave them our name and bam...card in hand. You are greeted at the end of a dimly lot hallway and seated inside at a table or the bar but there can be a wait for the bar. That is where we would have preferred to sit but it was already busy at 6:30 when we ended up arriving. We could have waited at a small stand up area but didn't see that until we had already been seated at a table.  We ordered these drinks in no particular order; The hot box, the truffle New York sour, modern royalty and the biplane. The hot box is a cocktail that comes in a Bookers box with woodchips that are smoking so it makes the whole place smelled really good. My favorite was the truffle New York sour where the eggs are infused with truffle so you really get that nice earthy note to the drink. We did end up getting a snack which was the octopus and sometimes that can be tough but they did a great job keeping it tender. The menu looked delicious from top to bottom.  The inside is beautiful, it looks like an old school library/lounge and the copper punched tin tiles on the ceiling are great touch. This was a great date night and we look forward to coming back and sitting at the bar"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I paid for my membership online a month ago and was handed my card when I arrived.  I was very happy with everything about the experience.  Drinks were well-balanced and tasty, food was delicious, service was attentive and friendly.  The décor is swanky and I love the lack of TVs.  I also love that the barstools are comfortable for hours!!  My other favorite bar in Charlotte is perfect in every way except that the barstools cut off your circulation after about 20 minutes, the ones at Dot Dot Dot don't do that.  The music here is also perfect for the intended atmosphere and isn't so loud that you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  The only con for me is that it's not closer to my office or home, but I still expect to go there a couple times a month."}
{"text":"This place has become a welcome staple for my husband and me - which is saying a lot considering the first time I went there I vowed to NEVER GO BACK.  I read the reviews, I did my homework, I bought the membership... My husband and I first went on a hot summer day last year.  He was wearing a button up and shorts (the same old story).  We got in, sat down, ordered our drinks, and only then did a very nice man come over and tell my husband his attire wasn't up to snuff.  Objectively, he did ask if we lived close and if he was willing to go home and change he would buy our first round of drinks (which was fortunate as they were $18/each and we weren't crazy about them).  Me, being a hot-headed woman and fiercesome defender of my loved ones was as white hot mad as if someone slapped my husband in the face.  I was ready to walk out.  My husband, on the other hand, is logical, cool-headed and just plain nice.  He wasn't put off at all.  He asked me to stay while he went home.  Blah blah blah... So, you may be thinking... where's the climax?  Why did you go back?  Well, the truth is I was angry for a while after that.  But we ordered drinks we liked and because you're not supposed to have your phone out - we ended up talking.  I mean really talking.  Because we had nothing to distract ourselves we had one of the best conversations we've had in months.  Listen, I'm not promising this is going to happen to you - but I left feeling really... good.  I felt like I had an awesome date night with my husband where we only focused on listening to each other.  It was kind of like a time warp - no phones, no television, great drinks and even better food. It was really, really nice to be forced to slow down and enjoy it.  We've been back maybe once a week since then.  The food is SUPERB.  I mean, A+++, 5 Star good.  And when we go, we are mindful of what we wear.  The \"staff\" (why does that word feel condescending?) is pretty freaking wonderful.  We've gotten to know the bartenders and the hosts - everyone is authentic and seems to genuinely like what they do.  And we've seen them deal with a lot of shit.  I get it - I was there too.  Rules are annoying... but I pulled my foot out of my ass and now I love it.  I mean, I really love it.  So . here's my advice:  Get over yourself so you can enjoy yourself.  Warning: it gets loud as hell on the weekends.  I prefer weeknights, but that's more my style.  The smokebox is their most popular. I LOVE old-fashions, but this was a bit much for me.  The NY Truffle Sour is extraordinary.  Also - the Vieux Carré (equal parts bourbon and N'awlins magic) - you're welcome."}
{"text":"This is an awesome bar. It is very relaxing and dark. It has a great vibe. The cocktails are stellar. The mixology is on point. The small plates are yummy. The charcuterie is the best in town. You should try everything on the menu. I came here with my best friends and we all had a blast. You must experience this speakeasy!"}
{"text":"Terrible guest service.  If you want to be put down, this is the place for you. If you want to be belittled, here's you're spot!  Don't bother. There are plenty of places that would actually appreciate your business.  Go there instead."}
{"text":"My first experience as a member at Dot Dot Dot was a swing and a miss. I thought this was a great concept and the other 7,100 people who became members before me must have thought the same thing. The main issue was the noise inside which was ridiculous at 6:00pm on a Thursday with half of the establishment empty. By the time my girlfriend and I left (6:30) we were yelling across the table at each other. Also the drinks weren't amazing for the prices. I got the Hot Box and my girlfriend got the Mia Tai and they were decent. You can get better drinks in South Park for the price."}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the deal. This place is special... for Charlotte. I say that because the craft cocktail lounge has been perfected in other geos and this place still has farther to go. Good news is, their mistakes are common ones, bad news is those mistakes have more to do with the culture and mindset of management and, thus, may be hard to overcome.    There seems to be a serious disconnect between the ideology of the place set forth by the owners and talent (I.e. bar manger, mixologists) and the group the customers interface with (hosts and servers). The drinks are fancy and interesting and crafted with an aesthetic that makes you think there are experts behind the the recipes. Yet, ask the server a simple question and they know very little about what they are delivering. Ours was confused about gin versus vodka and I'm fairly certain she's never had a decent drink in her life. She was also cavalier about the swapping out of tequilas in a particular mixed drink as if they are all the same. An experienced or well trained server, even one that doesn't know bev, could have at least faked it.   Lastly, when the drinks/ food was delivered it was placed on top of my handbag which happened to be a vintage Ferragamo clutch. The bottom of the tartar plate left behind a pickled red onion which I didn't notice until it was time to go. By then, the oil and vinegar had seeped into the delicate magenta silk, leaving behind a stain. The server noticed it when I did and her reaction to it was one of, 'oh well, at least it wasn't something valuable'.   Besides the bag being very expensive ($1000+), it has sentimental value (I bought it for my engagement dinner and used it very few times since then). Look, I know s@&t happens. Lovely things get messed up when you take them out. I didn't expect anyone to fix it but, again, this shows the staffs lack of understanding of, not only what they are serving, but who they are serving it to. Most people willing to pay seventeen dollars for a cocktail are willing to pay a high price for craftsmanship.  A characteristic which likely extends beyond their glass and, if they are a woman, to their handbag.   A little training on what they are serving and who they are serving to, could go a long way here to ensure the Dot .. vision does not fall apart during execution."}
{"text":"The wife and I tried to get in Saturday evening around 11:00 PM but the wait was 45 minutes so I picked up my membership card and went home. Not a negative experience.  We were just tired and decided to try again later.  We live about 200 paces from the front door so no big deal.  We tried again early Sunday evening and got right in.  Although they give you a membership card what you really need to get in is your driver's license.  My wife didn't have hers but they let us in but told us to make sure and have proper ID next time.  Once the doorman lets you in you walk down a long hallway to the hostess.  She escorts you through another door and seats you.  The décor is beautiful.  No TVs which is nice.  Noise level was low but not many people were there.  We sat at a table near the exit.  Waitress was immediately there to take our order.   My wife ordered a Thai Basil Smash and I ordered a Manhattan.  We had already had dinner but wanted to try a food item on the menu so we ordered the GIARDINIERE.  As we received our appetizer the waitress brought us a gin amuse-bouche (on the house appetizer) drink.  It was a little sweet but enjoyable.  The appetizer was really good.  It included some warm almonds, olives, and pickled vegetables.  You could tell by the quality of the vegetables that an experienced chef is in the kitchen.  It tasted very fresh and tangy.  We enjoyed the cocktails as well.    Their House Rules are posted on their website and the 3rd rule is proper dress is required but doesn't go into detail.  It says to refer to rule 2 which says don't be a jerk.  I discussed the dress code with the waitress and she told me its business casual.  No t-shirts, shorts or flip flops.  Apparently the no flip-flop rules is for men only (sexist?). However, I noticed the guy sitting two tables over was wearing shorts and flip flops.  Obviously, they aren't enforcing that rule yet.    Overall it was a pleasant experience and it met my expectations.  It is definitely a pricey experience so be prepared to spend some money.  I will visit occasionally as it is a little expensive for my entertainment budget."}
{"text":"Very cool place.  Hostess and waitress were very friendly and the food and drinks were outstanding."}
{"text":"Showed up on a 95 degree summer evening wearing a nice button down, shorts, and loafers. Turned away for wearing shorts as that evidently doesn't meet this place's dress code. Also, the guy at the door was a real jerk.   Sorry, a \"no shorts\" policy in Charlotte, NC during the dead of summer doesn't work for me. Anywhere. Reminds me of the crappy \"clubs\" Uptown like Bubble. Not classy and doesn't fit into this neighborhood vibe at all. Especially since it's right next door to the back lot of a hardware store and loading dock of a grocery store..."}
{"text":"We went to Dot Dot Dot tonight for dinner. This was our second time going but the first time eating a meal.   I was not impressed. We signed up for a table using the No Wait app. We went to check in when it told us we had 10 minutes left to wait but it actually ended up being 30 more minutes before our table was ready. They really shouldn't use the app if it's going to be that far off.   Our table didn't have enough place settings for our entire party. We had to ask our waitress twice to bring another setting. We were also a table of 6 seated at their round booth on top of each other when there was an option to put a chair at the end of the table that no one offered us. I got the Winter Warmer to drink. It was mediocre IMO. I got the beef cheeks and fried veggies for dinner.   The food was amazing but the overall experience was not."}
{"text":"A little hard to find, but once you're inside it's a great new spot for cocktails in Charlotte."}
{"text":"In the back of the shopping center. Look for their logo. Cute spot! Their presentation from the doorman to their cocktails were very detailed."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place for overpriced cocktails and pretentious servers, then this is the place for you. It's a cool atmosphere but I wish I had read the reviews and condescending responses from co-owner Conrad Hunter before we decided to check out Dot Dot Dot. Those kinds of responses do nothing to help your ratings(remember Amy's Baking Company is Scottsdale?). Take the criticism and learn from the,."}
{"text":"I went again last week and had as good of a time as I did the first time I went opening weekend.  The cocktails are stellar, the service is great, and I really enjoyed the ambiance.  I personally love the fact that there is a dress code and limited standing room, it makes it different than the hundreds of other places in town - I also didn't notice it being overly loud when I was there.  I got to sit at the bar and chat with Stefan the first time I came and he really is a personable guy.  My friend was going to Chicago on a work trip and he gave her excellent recommendations of bars to try.  The Negroni was excellent and I think I will get the Steak Tar Tar every time I go! It's different than other places in Charlotte but that is NOT a bad thing."}
{"text":"Overrated, overpriced, absurd. The three words that come to mind after last night's experience at Dot Dot Dot. After waiting 45 minutes for a bar that we paid a membership to, my husband and I were finally seated by Ingrid but not without snobby remarks about being a small party and the weather. We were waiting in the cold and rain. [We waited while several parties were seated before us including parties of 4-5 that were seated at double tables slid-together which could've easily been separated.] Apparently that man at the door didn't put us on the life after checking us in and checking our IDs so everyone who left was officially put on a list and seated before us. Bull shit.   I didn't like any menu options so I asked for a simple margarita. The waitress asked if I wanted well tequila and I said Jose Cuervo or a similar level would be fine. My husband ordered \"good to be king.\"  My drink was ok, very sweet and nothing special. It wasn't chilled well so I had to mix it up a lot to make it cold. My husband said he liked his and commented that it was basically all alcohol. When we asked for our bill I was appalled to see that I was charged $20 for my margarita. It wasn't even that good! They used Avion tequila which was more than I asked for and way over priced! This place is absolutely absurd and I don't plan to come back. I didn't want typical well tequila, but I also didn't ask for nor did I receive liquid gold. $20 for a 6-8oz (10oz max) margarita is ridiculous! Not to mention our waitress, who was very sweet, spilled our $12-14 and $20 drinks as she served them. You have got to be kidding me. We will [hopefully] never come back here. I wish I never spent $10 on a membership that wasn't even verified at the door."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Love the feel- almost like you are in NYC or somewhere super posh.  The drinks are incredible and very thoughtful.  Get the foie gras!!!  Probably one of the best dishes I've ever had.  Very complex flavors and clean presentation.  So glad Charlotte has this option for a date night or girls night out!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Drinks were okay not something very crafty or different. Priced okay... good hospitality and service. Maybe I will go again if they carry pappy wan winkle.,,"}
{"text":"I am glad that they have attempted to bring an authentic speakeasy to Charlotte. I enjoy the fact that they have a membership process (which is very reasonable), the house rules seemed adequate, and everything up to the door service and location seemed to fit what comes to my mind when I envision \"speakeasy.\"  Inside of Dot dot dot, was where I had a slight disappointment however. There was a speakeasy aesthetic, but not a speakeasy ambience. People for one certainly were not speaking easy, it was loud and a tad obnoxious. Usually this would be controlled, especially given the house rules, but I will say that it is still early in their tenure and they probably did not want to upset anyone by asking them to be quiet.   The drinks were redeeming, their bar staff are great and have a good array of drinks with simple elegant twists.  For me a speakeasy is more about the ambience, and in this regard I think there is still more to work on at dot dot dot. I will definitely be returning, and if nothing else look forward to another good drink."}
{"text":"The service is bar none and the cocktails are out of this world. I specifically love the Strawberry Fizz. Oh, and the cheese board is perfection!"}
{"text":"This is THE most refreshing addition to Charlotte.   A friend and I visited Dot Dot Dot and from the time we were greeted by the doorman to the closing of our tab, it was a phenomenal experience. We casually sat at the bar with Ashley and Pete (superb bar-keeps) who know their craft. I drank a true Manhattan and it was divine. This is a true Speak-Easy. The small plate short ribs are delicious; the best I've had in Charlotte.  If you want to escape the urban factor and have a world-class experience, then this is your place to go.   What you won't find at Dot Dot Dot is FUBU, flip-flops and club wear. What you WILL find is an enchanting experience to remember.   Meir"}
{"text":"Just sayin'... I use the \"...\" quite often. I like it. But, Saturday night we finally visited the new Park Rd. Shpg. Ctr. (Charlotte) located business,  ... (Dot, dot, dot.)  We had paid our membership months ago (only $10!) and had patiently awaited the opening of this private establishment that billed itself as a sort of \"Speakeasy\" atmosphere specializing in classic mixed drinks and tapa-like dishes. Our excitement was extinguished as we were first told that we would have a 20-30 minute wait (outside), but were then escorted inside immediately to find an extremely LOUD atmosphere. There were 4 of us, so we tried different \"Classic\" drinks. Overpriced for the quality, some were good, but a couple were really bad! (That is their specialty?) We ordered almost every item on the food menu: Arrancini, Tempura veggies, Pork skewers, Charcuterie and Shrimp. Quantities were very small (and we KNOW tapas) and just average flavors. I WILL say that they did a good job with the decor; rich colors, nice lamps, pretty bar and attractive ceiling and wall designs, but our corner booth was too warm and the noise overwhelming. I was expecting white tablecloths, candles, \"Crooner\" music and good food/drinks. ...Been there, done that, won't be back! P.S. Dessert at nearby Amelie's...Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Best $10 I've spent in a long time! Your membership fee at Costco saves you money in the long term, but a mere $10 at Dot Dot Dot gets you instant gratification with a civil, serene experience for drinks and/or food any night that fits your schedule.   There are plenty of places to get a serious cocktail in Charlotte, but many of them are Uptown, NoDa/Plaza Midwood, or SouthPark. Enter this speakeasy style establishment to meet the tastes of neighboring Myers Park residents or the young couples in Sedgefield or Madison Park. Drinks here could cap off a full day at Park Road Shopping Center.   We happened to stop in at 8pm on New Years Eve, so enjoyed seeing everyone dressed up for a long night out before we went back home to don out athleisure and get to bed well before midnight. The service was attentive and the cocktails beautiful, but we ended up trading them with each other, as the actual drinks surprised us, in a good way! We will definitely be back to try some more of the house cocktails and food, either on our own or to share the elevated experience with friends.   If your dress and act like and adult, you'll love feeling tucked away after waking down the long entryway. Yes please."}
{"text":"Best drinks in Charlotte. Great, lively environment. Use Nowait app so you can skip the line."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday, paid the membership fee in advance, checked in and was told to about an hour for two of us. No big deal, went to Midwood and had drinks until we got a notification text. Upon entering we were led to a table...a two top that happened to be right next to where the bathrooms were behind the two large booths. This is such a pet peeve of mine, why do I want to wait an hour to be seated next to the bathroom entrance?!  At one point, we literally had random people standing/hovering around our table in line for the bathroom. Our waitress was either checked out or just exhausted from who knows what, she forgot she took our drink and food orders and then came back to retake them. Our food items came out waaaaaaaay before our drinks, even though we ordered the drinks about 10-15 min before the food. The arancini were good, as well as the skewers. 4 pieces of tiny crostini for a large meat and cheese board is NEVER ENOUGH. The first drink I got was filled to the brim and the waitress spilled about a third of it when setting it down, muttered \"sorry\" and walked away. I got the hot box as my second drink and the waitress opened it like 0.5 inches from my face. I have a thick beard, now my beard smells like burning wood chips and has for a few days even after washing it. At the end of the day this place is a glorified restaurant that is underground and has a hidden entrance, it's super loud, and didn't remind me a speak easy at all"}
{"text":"Arrived with membership (bought on opening week) and 10 minutes and two couples who had no memberships admitted ahead of our group, giving up. Terrible customer service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Dot Dot Dot on a week night around 8 o'clock. She had a membership card. I did not. The door guy flirted with her shamelessly while I dug for my ID. I did not have to pay the $10 membership fee because I was her \"guest\". (Have to say, I don't really get the membership fee.) I loved the atmosphere....even in the restroom. Great decor. We ordered the Beef Tartar and the Salmon. Both were extremely delicious and had a great presentation. I ordered an Old Fashion and was impressed with their logo branding on the orange twist. The place has a sexy vibe. Thirty minutes in, two other friends joined us. The hostess easily accommodated us moving to a 4 top. Overall a good experience. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and was a huge fan! Definitely worth the $10 membership. Great atmosphere at the bar area and incredibly friendly and personable staff. Excellent drinks!!! Upscale so proper attire is required. It will definitely be a place I go back to."}
{"text":"A members only club (apply online, $10), but members can bring guests. I was lucky enough to meet a member and was invited past the bouncer, down a dark hallway, to a traditional speakeasy. The bar is packed with bottles of every sort of spirit, the back lighting providing most of the illumination for the bar area. Drinks are about $15 each, but they are hand-crafted and interesting. Don't just get a rail drink here, order something whimsical. My drink was bourbon, house-made vermouth, and truffle egg white, shaken, poured into a martini glass, then sprayed with port wine through a filter so that the bar's logo hovered on my glass. Even their lemon peels are branded with the logo.   Considering the price and exclusivity, this bar is not for everyone, but if you are looking for a unique cocktail experience, you will be hard pressed to find any place better."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I never made it in the front door. I, in fact, was turned away from the front door by the \"bouncer\" or doorman or whoever he was. This individual walked towards me and suggested that I \"run home to change into pants and come back\" as their dress code would not allow my shorts to enter. It is really a shame. I was excited to check this place out. I paid for the $10 membership online and had planned to meetup with 5 other of my associates/coworkers there for a good time. It was actually fun because we struggled a bit to find the the door to get in the place ... just as a speak-easy should be! But folks ... let's face it! This is CHARLOTTE! We live in the south. We dress casual! Especially during the summer. The funny thing to me is I would have been perfectly acceptably dressed for Kiawah Island where we are truly \"private members.\"  My outfit was a polo shirt tucked and belted navy shorts. So, I'm going to call it right here. If they don't change their overly obnoxious list of rules on their website, they simply will not last in Charlotte. That is my prediction. Butter tried this ... dress code ... and well, they didn't exactly hang around long. As a new business, they lost out on 6 customers last night. Our tab at Packhouse was well over $200 ... and we were graciously invited in and ended up enjoying the cool weather out on their front porch."}
{"text":"Dot dot dot has gone from decent to worse. I've been here several times and each one has been progressively worse. I recently showed up with a group of 5 and was told that I could use the NoWait App to register my party to enter later after eating at Sir Edmund Halley's. The app did not let you register 5 people for the wait list and we instead registered for 4. When we showed up, we were told we were in the wrong for showing up with one more person and were forced to go back on the wait list which was another 40 minutes (there was no line outside and people were pouring out of the bar). You guys need to do some work with your seating methods. How does one person cause you to have to wait another 40 minutes to be seated? I would like to understand before I come back. I will also be urging others to avoid until this is figured out."}
{"text":"Oh, Dot Dot Dot, how I wanted to love you. I had extremely high hopes for this joint considering the ownership, but it unfortunately didn't live up to the hype. For example, it is billed as a speakeasy/classy cocktail parlor, but the noise level inside is more comparable to a college bar during power hour. Additionally, the ownership and the staff apparently don't like to follow, nor enforce their own rules. Not only did the ownership and staff coddle the wannabe \"big shots\" to the left and right of me and my wife, but they also allowed them to scream the entire time. Classy...I think not.   Now, there were a few positives during our visit. My wife and I both enjoyed the cocktails and food that we chose. For instance, I had the Truffle Sour and it was spot on! We loved the Octopus with the Chorizo and Chimichurri! Also, the decor was beautifully done, and it definitely gave off an upscale vibe.   All in all, I give this establishment 2.5 stars out of 5. I do plan on giving them another chance in the future, so hopefully they are able to turn things around before then. In the meantime, I'm going to have to reminisce about my heavenly experience at both Bourbon & Branch and Wilson & Wilson out in SF."}
{"text":"OK, so this time i wore pants and was able to get in. You wont let men in in shorts and flip flops but we saw a few ladies with shorts and flip flops and they were allowed in.  DOUBLE STANDARD.  Our son called while we were sitting at the bar and my wife answered to make sure everything was ok it took all of about 45 seconds and the owner of the place Stefan who bartends as well told her the next time take the call outside. When I think of a speakeasy i think of lounge couches over stuffed chairs in seating areas, a person playing a sax, intimate tables for 4 to 6 and a food & beverage menu that is very unique.  Well let me just say the only unique item is their cocktail menu everything else is just ordinary items that you can get at other restaurants in Charlotte.  So here is where i get a little perturbed, you had us pay for a membership for a speakeasy and all in all its a restaurant and nothing more. So we had to pay $10 to eat in your restaurant, ahhhhhh you got us but just that once. I had a drink that was smoked in a box that was outstanding, my wife had a few Moscow mules that she loved and that was the highlight of night. We had the meat and cheese board and it was good, we also had the risotto fritter and it was good.  The menu like i said is not very creative and unique. Also, you do not have desserts and you really should, most all restaurants even fast food chains have desserts.    You really need to quit calling yourself a speakeasy, just because you go in the back door and walk down a hall way that does not make you a speakeasy.  You are a restaurant."}
{"text":"Move over, Uptown!  The coolest, new speakeasy is in (drum roll please) Park Road Shopping Center!?!?  No need to rub your eyes and read it again.  You saw it right the first time.  Dilworth has just gotten cooler.  Dot Dot Dot can be easy to miss.  There's no real sign except the logo above an unmarked brown door in the back of the shopping center.  It's first come, first serve, so get your membership and put your name in on the No Wait app.  I got there around 7:15, but only had to wait about 20 minutes (not bad for a Friday night).  They don't let you inside unless you're being seated, so if you're not prepared to stand around, head over to one of the nearby restaurants to have a drink while you wait.  Once you finally get in, you have a very cozy atmosphere with hints of art deco decor as a nod to the 1920s.  Really cool space.  The food was fantastic.  All shareable plates, so don't expect to walk in and order a stead with potatoes.  Instead, take your time and order a plate or two at a time.  We had the Giardiniere and the Cheese & Charcuterie plates that had a beautifully plated selection.  Next we moved onto the Steak Tartare, which was a lot of fun with all the additional toppings to mix in!  Also, I recommend the chicken skewer.  It's much bigger than you expect, so between all of these snacks, you'll definitely leave satisfied. [ Overall, supper cool ambiance, amazing cocktails and great food.  If I was single, I would suggest this to a date that I want to impress."}
{"text":"Paid 10 dollars for the membership fee and was told at the door to pay again... all I can say is... I guess I should over pay for cocktails because it's exclusive... I'll make lacroix and vodka at home"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is one of the best places to come in Charlotte. My wife and I went on a Friday evening, and we enjoyed it immensely. My experience was the absolute best. I especially love that a membership is required, it provides a sense of exclusivity while garnering safety and security. Honestly I can appreciate that your website provides information on what to expect. It should be viewed as being proactive. But then you experience some patrons who think that they are the exception to all the worlds rules. I think the dress code idea is necessary, it sort of puts everyone on the same playing field and creating some inclusiveness within the establishment. Now my issue is that my wife wants her own membership to bring her friends.   Also, I've used Yelp for years and never considered creating a profile until after my visit at Dot Dot Dot.  BRAVO, job well done my friend!!!!!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the Park Road area. They have a good selection of light bites and I loved the Front Porch Punch! The atmosphere is very cozy, although it can get a bit loud, but i am sure this is something they will work out as the venue matures. Overall this is definitely a place you can go and enjoy a laid back atmosphere, good eats and a nice variety of drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place. Atmosphere is fantastic. Drink selection is very good. Staff is excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I were vacationing in Charlotte for only 2 days and decided to make Dot Dot Dot one of our stops. We purchased the membership prior to our trip since we had read it's best to have it ahead of time.   It was a Sunday night so we expected it wouldn't be crowded. We arrived around 8:30 for dinner and were told we had the choice between the bar or a table. The hostess recommended the bar, so we took that option. The bar is beautiful and the bartenders are mixing up some very fancy drinks, which can be fun to watch, so I could tell immediately why she had made this recommendation.   Here are the highs and lows of my experience:  Highs:  -Loved the cocktails.  It's their specialty. They put a lot of thought and effort into it and it shows. Our bartenders \"Andrew\" & \"Andrew\" haha...were both great. They were personable and made some great recommendations for our short stay in Charlotte. Please note we did not come here looking for happy hour specials or cheap drinks, we knew going in the price on these drinks was a bit higher and were OK with that for the quality.  -We shared the crab cake, poke, pate', wagyu steak and pasta w/ peas.  The food was incredible. The only dish that didn't wow me was the crab cake. It was a bit dry. I wanted to order seconds on everything else though. I was incredibly impressed with the food overall.  Lows:  -The crowd was not what I expected. It was a Sunday night in a members only cocktail lounge that prides itself on being \"classy\" but this crowd was, not that. To my right was a group of 4 incredibly loud and drunk people with no regard for the people around them. They were making so much noise we couldn't even hold a conversation. Once they left, the entire experience improved dramatically.  -I'm a dessert person and was disappointed to find out there are no dessert options. Even if they offered one dessert option and made it liquor infused and stuck to their theme, I think that could make a good addition to the menu.  -We were ready to order another food item around 9:45 and were told the kitchen might be closed. We had thought the restaurant was open until 2AM (didn't realize there was a change to their hours recently) and while they accommodated and put the food order in for us, it would be nice to get a \"last call\" type of offer at some point so we would've known we were cutting it close on ordering.   Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and plan to return even if only while vacationing. :)"}
{"text":"Dot Dot Dot is a members only club with limited space. Membership is $10 and it's best to apply online. House Rules are also listed on the website. The dress code is smart casual (no shorts, t-shirts, flip flops). You can bring up to 3 guests.   The entrance is pretty discreet. It's in the corner past Amelie's. Look for the lighted dot sign. The bouncer will scan your ID at the door. When you go inside, you walk down a longgg dimmed hallway to the hostess stand. My friend & I decided to sit at the bar. We both enjoyed our drinks. I ordered the Lily Wants a Pony & she had an Old Fashioned. We decided not to order food. This place is great if you want a chill upscale atmosphere. It's very lowkey."}
{"text":"This private club (join on their website) is fantastic.  Recently opened, the drinks, service, and food would make you believe that the place had been there for years.  The cocktails are well made and the selection of liquors is quite broad - something for every palate.  The food is made for nibbling as you sip and is quite good.  We were extremely pleased with both the Cheese & Charcuterie as well as the Bone Marrow.  The atmosphere is really nice.  Low lighting, soft background music, the low hum of conversation all combine to enhance the experience.  The service (gigantic kudos to Ashley for taking such good care of us) was excellent in all respects.  We were made to feel as if we were regulars who had been stopping by for years.  Classy, classy, classy, all the way..."}
{"text":"Great service, innovative drinks, lovely old-school atmosphere. What's not to like?  We didn't have our membership yet when we went, but signing up wasn't too much of a hassle. There were some hiccups in the online order processing that were resolved quickly enough. We were able to get seated right away (we went around 6pm on a Saturday).   It's beautifully decorated, with a tin roof and a lot of charming retro details. The music was era-appropriate and not too loud. It's really nice to go into a bar and not have blaring TVs everywhere around you. As for the noise itself, yes, it's a bit loud, as other posters have mentioned. I'm not sure how avoidable this is in a crowded bar, though.   Our waitress was extremely helpful. She came by frequently to check on us and always made sure our waters were filled. She even brought us a complimentary cocktail when our order was taking a little longer than normal.   The drinks themselves are quite good. They are creative and blended well. Yes, they take a little bit of time because of being hand-crafted and all, but it's worth it. This is a nice bar experience, not a party place to get drunk.   All in all, I loved it here. I wish that I were a rich Charlotte banker so I could afford to come here much more frequently than I can on my editor's salary, but this will still be one of my favorite places for a classy drink. I can't wait to try the food next time!"}
{"text":"Had such an amazing experience here. The short rib small plate was one of the best things I've ever tasted. The drinks are great and the service was outstanding. I would 100% recommend to anyone and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Tonight was absolutely fabulous and it's mainly due to the amazing crew at Dot Dot Dot!!   When we arrived it was close to 1am and they close at 2am. The service was still amazing. We were quickly greeted and taken to seats at the bar. There weren't many patrons inside and they quickly cleared out. It was so cool having the whole place to ourselves.   We got to really talk to Andrew our bartender and Steven. We discussed the new hours, the new menu and the very diverse array of liquors they have available. Andrew was so knowledgeable and entertaining.   Andrew is an amazing bartender. We had a Bumbu Rum daiquiri, the Penicillin and after much conversation about it we tried the \"Boulevardier\" of Broken Dreams. Amazing!!! I was so impressed by all of the drinks. The daiquiri was so simple with only 3 ingredients but so tasty. Both the Penicillin and the Boulevardier were very refreshing. The Boulevardier has the signature lemon wedge with the burned Dot Dot Dot emblem on it and the Penicillin had a huge square ice cube that provided a fun optical illusion. I would definitely recommend trying any of these drinks.   I have to get back in soon to try the new food menu and try to conquer the complete drink menu!!!    All in all I'm in love with Dot Dot Dot. I'm sooo glad they are located in such a great location, support the local distilleries and have an amazing staff!!!

{"text":"Amazing flavor, both food and drinks.  Had 3 cocktails from bourbon to light rum based. Awesome flavor.  Waite staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  Had the scallops with an amazing lemon sauce, turnips & jalapenos!  Awesome flavor!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I only went for cocktails, so this is only a review for the drinks and experience we had. We sat at the bar and tried a couple different craft cocktails. They were all delicious and unique and the same price as any nice cocktails in Charlotte. They atmosphere was great, and you can tell they didn't skimp on quality materials. All of the bartenders were very friendly and made it a great experience for us! We will definitely be back to try the food. They also allow you to go elsewhere while you are waiting for a table, and text/call you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"A little pricey but you're paying for a pretty awesome atmosphere and great service.  Drinks and appetizers were good and its a very well designed establishment."}
{"text":"Overall a good addition to Charlotte, since I've been waiting for a speakeasy to arrive here for a while, I've been to a few bars similar to this in other big cities and it is fairly comparable. The membership aspect was different but an interesting way to keep it elite. I enjoyed their dot dot dot symbols on the drinks and thought the fancy hot box drink was a fun experience! The bartenders were awesome and knew their stuff so we're able to recommend great drinks for us!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhhh Dot Dot Dot.  I am in love.  I'm SO in love.  My experience was truly amazing.  I signed up for their membership (which is ten dollars) with the plan to go that same night.  I made sure I saved my email confirmation as I wasn't sure if it took a while to get approved or what.  So I was prepared......  My Hubs and I showed up around 9:00 and there was a small gathering outside.  When we walked up, the gentleman checking people in simply asked me if I had a membership and I said yes.  He asked me what my last and first name was and I told him.  I told him that I just signed up this morning so I have my confirmation if you can't find my name.  He cut me off when I was saying this and said \"well you're in luck because I already found you\" and slipped me my little black membership card.  They were having issues with those who signed up that day and couldn't find names BUT THEY HAD MINE!  wahoo! score! They would have let you in as long as you had your email confirmation...so don't delete that until you get a card the first time. The couple in front of me kept swearing they signed up but she didn't have her email confirmation in her inbox or couldn't find the charge in her bank account...so she left (not happy).  But not their fault....so keep the email.  (and don't forget to push \"submit\" when purchasing a membership..lol.  That's what I think happened...  Anyway (that was a long intro ...sorry).  They put our name down, and said it would be about an hour wait.  No problem.  I didn't care! I was just excited to be going in!  So they said that they would text me as soon as my table was ready.  We walked over to Amelie's (so perfect) for a glass of wine and as soon as we sat down and I had like literally two sips...I got a text saying my table was ready.  HAHAHA! We slammed back the wine and trotted over to Dot Dot Dot.  The cool part and what made me feel taken care of was as soon as I got to a few steps away from the bottom of the steps, the gentleman he came down to meet us half way and escorted us to the door.  So nice of him!    Once inside, you walk down this long narrow, cool brick hallway to the Hostess stand.  sooooooo dark and creepy and cool.  lol! It's got lights lining either side of the walls so you can see.  Such a cool vibe.  You really do feel like you're entering into a true \"speak easy\" and it's extremely private.  Hard to explain into words.  but I think they captured the essences of what a Speakeasy was back in the day.  The host confirmed if I was Meyer, and opened the door and I walked into a vibrant room full of people.  big tables....small tables, people chatting away.  The décor was awesome!  Host took us to our table and I was just in aww.  We didn't try the food as we already ate, but had two of their cocktails. Delicious.   A couple of tips: If you're a dude...don't wear shorts and sneakers.  I heard that they are strict with dress code.  No that doesn't mean you can wear DRESS shorts or Khaki shorts.  C'mon dudes...if you have a lady on your arm or WANT a lady on your arm...I'm sure she's wearing heels and has an outfit on that will stop anyone in their tracks.  So shorts and flip flops and socks ain't gonna cut it.  So go dressed like the Mr. GQ you are (or hope to be).  Don't be in a hurry and be patient with getting inside.  Go grab a drink elsewhere if the wait is long and just come back when they text.  No biggie!   I can't WAIT to go back.  The Back Lot at the park road shopping center is becoming a really cool place to be!!"}
{"text":"I had a better experience at the garden center next door, and they were closed!  Terrible experience for a back alley bar. Such a hassle to even get in....to find an empty bar with over priced drinks. I'm certain Blackhawk Hardware will use this as a storage pace for mulch in a few months."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype. Service is sub-par. Some of the cocktails are good, some are average, not worth the price. To wait 20 minutes to gain entry and then deal with rude staff/average drinks is not the best use of time. Management thrives on exclusivity and not the product."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the area. I loved Stefan's cocktails at Heist, and I like them even more here. I've been working my way through the menu and my favorites are a tie between the Sidecar and the Hotbox...which could not be more different from each other. The oysters on the half shell come with the toppings already on them, making them the easiest to eat I've ever been served. I would not recommend that you come starving as it's really not a restaurant, but the small plates are great to munch on.   I personally love the concept of one-in-one-out; I'd rather wait than be jostled around in a crowd and have to elbow through people to get a drink. The dress code requires a bit of advance planning, but overall is not difficult to meet. I know I can't wait to go back - I'll be here whenever we have the funds for a nicer date night or have a friend in town I want to impress. Cheers to the owners for doing something different in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wow! I was so impressed by Dot Dot Dot! 6 of us went for a drink on a Friday night. We waited about 5 minutes outside (under heaters so it wasn't too cold) and then we were taken inside to our table. We were seated in a large company circular booth.  We all ordered cocktails (no food) and we all enjoyed our drinks. Most of the cocktails are around $15.00, so it is pricey, but we felt it was worth it. The vibe of Dot Dot Dot is awesome - you won't feel like you're in Charlotte! It's swanky, moody, and dimly lit. The perfect spot for a date night or fun evening out with friends. Go here for dinner or an after dinner drink. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Decided to go out for some cocktails, and we were so glad we did!  Get a $10 membership online. It's an easy process and makes things easy at the door. You can have up to 3 guests.   We sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by the co-owner/head mixologist. He was friendly and introduced himself.   We started with the truffle New York sour and the weekend lover. Both were good. The truffle New York sour was unlike anything I've ever tasted.   Second round was even better. We had the hit the wall and the hot box. The Hot Box may be one of the most delicious drinks I've ever had. Spirit forward and so smoky! Tasted like drinking a whiskey around a campfire. The Hit the Wall was also delicious with tequila and spice.   Expensive but good. We will be back for 1-2 drinks at a time or whatever we can afford."}
{"text":"Went to this spot for a drink after dinner at CO with a friend.   I will easily state this establishment is overrated. Entering at the door that says \"members only\", which is also the place to BECOME a member, can be confusing. This is where you are treated less than until you pay them the membership fee. That is fine, I understand the attempt to be \"members only\" and \"upscale\", but again, no need to act like you are holier than thou at the entrance. Especially when it wasn't worth it. 3/4 of the people that roll through here are not anything you desired to enter your facility anyway.  The only nice individual I came in contact with was our server. She was polite and helpful, though the promiscuous attire of the waitresses at this  establishment was not really necessary. No one wants, or at least I do not want, to pay $14 for a subpar cocktail and then have to see far too much when a waitress leans over a table clean up glasses. This is not a sports bar.  They boast on being a place where people can come and have like-minded behaviors: responsible, put-together, classy. However, telling someone they have to pay $10 to do so will never work or magically create that environment. It was loud and just basically obnoxious inside. One group was excruciatingly intoxicated and literally made it impossible to hear my friend talk. Not the environment one would imagine when researching this facility.  The interior is nice, a speakeasy attempt at decor done moderately well. But the service was slow. The only reason why I give this a two star and not one, was because the drink was decent. Not worth the price, but decent. I have had better at a nice restaurant.  I will never return. This is an overly rude and obnoxious environment with no need to be. You can be \"exclusive\" or \"high end\" without making your patrons regret coming here. A desperately failed attempt at a speakeasy. I will go to Broken Spoke any day over this location."}
{"text":"Came for an after work happy hour drink. The ambiance is unique and like nothing else in Charlotte. You have to be let in by a guest which is pretty cool. Once you get in the decor is very intimate. The service was great. We had three drinks all very unique which were recommended by the waitress. I was hesitant of mine at first because it had liquor and red wine in it but it turned out to be very good. We ordered the small plate beef tartare and it was also great. I would recommend this place and definitely would come back."}
{"text":"The cocktails are delicious but the marketing approach is obviously into making people wait. We were told there would be a 40 minute wait so went nearby to have a drink, they texted us 10 minutes later. We were called 2 more times. We returned, were taken down the long hallway and were asked to wait again. The cocktails are good ($12-18), the place is loud (?consider replacing the tin ceiling with red velvet) Not sure I feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"Dot Dot Dot is a really great addition to the Charlotte restaurant/bar scene.   This was my first time visiting, we struggled to find the door at first--which I actually appreciated. It really is a speakeasy. There was a $10 membership fee, but only one of us had to pay that and brought the other as a guest. It's a one-time fee and wasn't at all a problem.   Upon entering you go down dimly-lit, brick hallway where a hostess greets you and directs you into the actual bar area...very cool. Loved the atmosphere and ambience of the establishment. Bright red, bookcases, dark lighting--it all fit the bill!  We ordered the following drinks:  Strawberry fizz: Gorgeous presentation, tart/sweet flavor and really enjoyable Old Fashioned: Ordered this on our waitresses recommendation and loved it.  Hot Box: How cool is this?! A bourbon based drink served in an actual box of smoke--the visual was appealing enough, but the drink was delicious.  We also ordered a charcuterie plate which was presented nicely and had a great selection of items. I cannot wait to go back and try more food off the menu!"}
{"text":"Over priced drinks, mediocre food. If they tell you the wait is an hour, stay put. It's probably a 10 minute wait...just to make it seem like they're busy and that it's \"the hottest, most exclusive bar in town\". Yes, they have thousands of members right now, but just wait until memberships expire- most will not renew."}
{"text":"A beautiful, stylish and sophisticated establishment. Superior cocktails meticulously crafted. Each one, sexy and elegant with unexpected touches that delighted the senses. The cuisine will astound and amaze the most refined palates. Dress your best and have an experience that will not soon be forgotten."}
{"text":"I signed up and became a meme we for $10 bucks in under 10 mins. You do the application online and when you get to this hidden gem the host will just ask to see ID.   It is 21 and up.   Once you get in a cute long dark a hall way awaits you. At the end of the hall way are some more host. I arrived alone and I requested a bar seat.   The bartenders were all so kind! My bartender was Andrew. Which I even took a pic with.   They make you feel welcome and this place is very relaxing. Inside I didn't see any type of windows. So it's very private and romantic.   All the cocktails range from About $11 and up. My first two drinks did get me Tipsy and worth my money. I also had some veggie plate. It was almost like fried coated veggies. It came with some reddish spicy salsa which did give it much more taste.    Over all this is a place for a date or if you have someone visiting the Charlotte area.   Almost everybody was there with somebody. Since this is a members only lounge I can see why people were paired up.   A member can bring up to 3 guest I believe."}
