{"text":"Went to grab a quick breakfast before visiting the ROM. Delicious gluten-free bagel, excellent coffee, and super friendly people as well!! Such a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I had to wait to try a few more things before I updated, and I did, so here we go. 

Of course I went back for another date square, and it was wonderful.  
But now it has a serious rival in the flaxseed muffin.
 Topped with pepitas, the muffin was moist, soft, with that bit of crunch that balances the texture. 
It could go with a dash of butter or Earth Balance but that is not necessary.  
I had it with an apple and called it lunch. 

My iced Americano kept its integrity even as the ice melted while I strolled.  
That's a good test of a proper iced coffee, and I enjoyed this one to the very end.

On other visits I've tried the Paleo-friendly moelleux au chocolate which was deliciously dense, rich and filling.  It makes the thought of 'chocolate as food' believable.

The brownies, with or without the caramel / pecan topping, were light and packed with flavour.
  Considering all the sampling I've been doing, I decided to break up the brownie into little squares. They have lasted a couple of days, offering that hit of dark chocolate when I want one.   
The caramel topping - like everything else -  is made in-house: thick, not too sweet, with an undertone that enhances the chocolate and pecans. 

Blueberry muffins, pecan cookies, banana walnut bread - everything I've tried has its own distinct texture and taste that does not try and mimic its 'gluten' counterparts. Rather, each stands out as its own delightful treat.

Up next:  the carrot cake cupcake.  I can't wait !"}
{"text":"I don't care if my food is gluten free or vegan. I just want it to taste good and Almond Butterfly is incredibly delicious and just happens to be gluten free (and in some cases vegan), which is a great bonus. 

There's no way anyone would even tell that it was gluten free or vegan. All they'll know is that they are eating delicious desserts. End of story. 

We've ordered everything from brownies, to date squares to cupcakes and cookies and everything has been absolutely incredible - moist, flavourful and just the perfect size. 

We've been there twice and will certainly be back again and again. You should absolutely check this out. It's going to be our go-to for baked goods in the city."}
{"text":"I came here because my friend Elena works here.

I got the Vegetarian Eggtastic which was delicious. Like the best bagel I have ever had. I couldn't resist dessert on the way out and grabbed a chocolate chunk cookie. I thought it would be a hard, brittle cookie (because that is usually the case with gluten-free, etc). But no, it was delicious and moist and warm. Made my day!

I think I might be back here every single week. Maybe every day."}
{"text":"I actually just happened to come across this place after an appointment -knowing nothing about it and needing an americano. 

I asked if they had anything gluten free -and to my surprise I was in a gluten free bakery!! 

I tried the banana loaf - and it was pretty amazing. I loved that is was not too sweet - as some gluten free treats are laden with sugar to compensate. 

I also tried a pecan, chocolate cookie, which was pretty good. 

They also had muffins, cupcakes and whole cakes. 

The service was very friendly and he was willing to answer all my questions. 

This is a tiny cafe with minimal seating. It's clean and modern and has just enough selection - they also have soy free, vegan, dairy free and paleo options that are also gluten free. 

Also enjoyed the americano. 

I noticed a GF bagel option as well that I may try next time. 

Great new addition to the gluten free bakeries in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!! I walked by here on a number of occasions and decided to pop in one afternoon after a particularly stressful morning (yes, I went in to eat my feelings). I ordered an iced latte with almond milk and a dairy free chocolate espresso cupcake. The iced latte really hit the spot and the cupcake was rich, creamy and moist. Both made for the perfect treat. I can't wait to come back and try more goodies, but my only qualm about this place is their hours - they're basically only open during the work day, and weekends they don't open until 11am."}
{"text":"Finding a place that serves gluten free breakfast (that is not just crepes) is almost impossible... but almond butterfly has answered my prayers!!! Breakfast sandwiches are my one true love. And these sandwiches are amazing. The location is cute and cozy, and the staff was extremely kind. Wait times were absolutely fine, no complaints. This isn't fast food... I know my treats were handcrafted with love, cos they tasted so heavenly. For a warm, hearty ham + egg breakfast bagel it's about $8. Visit if you ever get the chance!"}
{"text":"Let me start my review by saying that today (sept 11) is my birthday. And what a fine birthday it has been since the discovery of the wonder that is the Almond Butterfly. I eat according to the paleo diet, as I have many digestive sensitivities. I decided to stop in to enjoy a paleo treat before class since it was, after all, my birthday and because I had never tried one before. Albeit there were only two paleo choices, there were many gluten and soy free options. I didn't mind so much as the atmosphere and (later sampled) food was wonderful. Explaining my reason for ordering not one but both treats, the barista treated me to an Americano. I thought that extremely kind of him since Americanos are espresso. Taking my coffee and two sweet treats to class, I deigned to save my lava cake for some time later. Delighted to find my Americano quite good (I am a bit of a coffee connoisseur) and my loaf delicious, I happily ate and sipped during class. Only on my way home did I try some of the molten lava cake. I savoured it, revelled in it and decided it absolutely necessary to save some for my mom to try as well. It was probably the best chocolate desert I've ever had. That is no exaggeration. I am a chocoholic so I can say I've got a lot to compare it to. Best lava cake. Great coffee. Amazing service. Definitely a go-to."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this little spot one afternoon recently and were really so glad we did. Delicious sandwich on a GF bagel and scrumptious and fresh tasting cupcakes (that are not sickeningly sweet). What a gem :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by for the first time today and enjoyed a delicious strawberry vanilla cupcake (dairy free). This place has a lovely ambiance that you can feel as soon as you walk through the door. But what made me want to post this comment was their awesome customer service. It really made my day and because of this (and the cupcakes) I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! it's tucked away from the main street so it's nice and quiet. The baked goods are great, and the American is just to my liking. Service was nice and friendly. It's perfect."}
{"text":"Not only is everything overpriced for its quality but it is their terrible service that will never make me go back again. 

I wasnt given forks for my cake, how do they expect me to ea? The cream, and milk were all empty and the barista took such a long time to refill them. During that time she too, my coffee was knocked over. No one working there asked i got coffee spilled on me, nor offered to refill the drink. Worst experience ever at a coffee shop"}
{"text":"Oh man. I love this place so much. I can barely remember the time before Almond Butterfly opened.  Their bagels...their bagels. OMG. I never liked bagels in my gluten-eating days but these bagels are so delicious. Never gummy, like gluten-y bagels. Otherwise, I've really loved their chocolate-caramel cupcakes, their paleo cookies, and the ham and cheese panini. I go there every time I forget my lunch, and sometimes I forget it on purpose, just to have a sandwich."}
{"text":"I stopped by after my hair appointment, the place looked nice and inviting, I ordered a cupcake and I asked if there was nuts in it and I was told no. Unfortunately I ended up having a very bad allergic reaction, I approached a man working there and inquired about the ingredients, stating that I think I was having an allergic reaction, I asked again if there was nuts and he said only in the white cupcakes, and I said I was told there was no nuts, he then said \"Really someone told you there are no nuts\" He then said\"Its only in the white ones, did you even get a white one\" I said no, he then proceeded to tell me that the cupcakes are made with coconut flour, and widely gestured to the board, saying almost everything has it and that coconut isn't considered a nut allergen, I agreed he then proceeded to dismiss me in a clipped tone, If someone is having a medical emergency that isn't the way to treat them, I only wanted to know why my throat was closing up, thats all I wasn't accusing anyone. I'm an adult and I know I'm responsible for what I eat. It would be great if you guys displayed that your desserts have allergens."}
{"text":"Love this gluten-free bakery! Cupcakes, date squares, breakfast bar, cookies...yum! Sometimes gluten-free can be overly dense or sickly sweet, and make me feel sick, but not here! I've always felt great after eating food from here...sometimes three items in a row! They also made my wedding dessert (got cupcakes instead of a cake because it was the day after the long weekend), and everyone loved them! My only complaint is the store hours...I seem to get cravings when they aren't open, specifically on Sundays after I've had brunch in the area. If you are gluten-free, and even if you're not, this place will surely satisfy your sweets craving. They also make sandwiches and such too!"}
{"text":"This is a cute and trendy spot for GF baked goods. It's a quick walk from my place so I go here at least every week.
They've got the right idea but currently it's poorly executed.  Maybe not poorly, but definitely not great.
Most items are way over priced. Like bagels... $2 for a gf bagel and almost $4 for a TINY gf muffin. I can go to any coffee shop and get a fresh gf muffin twice the size with the same or better quality for roughly $3 or less before tax. I don't even know if they use organic ingredients or not. Considering they bake in house their prices are premium however the product doesn't feel premium. There isn't a decent deal either for purchasing a dozen bagels. That would definitely get me buying bagels there more often.
I don't know. I think the owners need to learn something from other gf bakeries... they should think about distributing their baked goods to local coffee shops and think about making gf bread - I'm certain that would sell well. I feel like the owners are thinking too small and not being creative enough. It's the same stuff every week, why not introduce somrthing new each week and test the results? It's spring now,  what kind of spring specials are you getting me excited about? Nothing right now. If there is something then I'm obviously not aware of it, and that's not my fault as a consumer.
To note, the service is at best ok. I feel like the staff is insecure of their products somehow.
I'll keep going here for a treat until a better alternative pops up."}
{"text":"Super nice couple who have integrity!
Finally decent gluten free stuff. I've tried the other ones that have been cited as the best and they're nasty. I do special orders and she'll work with you to create something that suits your needs."}
{"text":"I found the bakery through searching hashtags on Insagram (regarding Toronto and GF) Just shows how far Social Media can travel!
Every Friday my brother and I drive from Bowmanville (no matter how bad the traffic) to grab their chocolate chip cookies, pies, brownies, everything.....
1 hour drive just for this bakery I think says it all.
The espresso is great, the apple pie was amazing.
Its so nice to find a place that caters to allergies and taste amazing! We used to go to Forno Cultura as they had a couple gluten free options (nut flour base, honey as sweetener) but I can say we haven't been back since we found Almond Butterfly Bakery. 
The gentleman who has been working each time we visit is always happy to answer any questions on ingredients and always recommends new snacks/sandwiches to try.
Can't wait to go back there tonight!"}
{"text":"An excellent small bakery just near my residence! The cafe is filled with sunlight, and the baked goods are fresh and delicious. Its warm atmosphere is great if you want to sit around and just chat with a friend, while enjoying a brownie or a cookie."}
{"text":"The food and coffee are great, and this place was totally full of babes. 

I guess pretty girls like vegan food, because this place was stacked. 

There is a weird painting on the wall though selling for $200. Not bad enough to warrant a point loss, but almost!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Whenever I'm in the area, I make sure to stop by and get some of their delicious cupcakes or their cheese scones or anything else. By far the best gluten-free cupcakes I've tasted -- better than Bunners or Prairie Girl."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place!  

I keep coming back for the cinnamon bun, which is the best I've had in a very long time.  It is small in size, but definitely packs a tasty punch. I pay almost $5 for it each time, but it is worth the $ every once in a while.

Note:  the place is very small so seating can be limited in peak hours, such as lunch time.

A great neighborhood bake shop that is worth a try. Don't be afraid of the 'gluten free' label... It is still really good."}
{"text":"I was in the area, so I just tried Almond Butterfly because Almond Butterfly is friendly looking and inviting looking. The decoration is trendy and cool. The customers looked organic vegan type single women. I was not a vegan and I tried their apple pie. The apple pie was old and it was just average. Coffee was also just average."}
{"text":"Customer service is always awesome here. Waited a few minutes to get my sandwich (the dairy-free GFT - delicious, btw) and when I mentioned I hadn't yet gotten the cookie I ordered (which was not a big deal in the slightest) they gave me an extra - just because! Vanilla latte with almond milk is amazing. Also...the bagels are delicious. Who needs gluten when you have bagels THAT good?? :) I buy them in bulk now so I can have them at home whenever I want!"}
{"text":"Searching for a tasty vegan gluten free Pumpkin pie?  They have one.  It's $30.  Same pie is $10 at Kensington Natural Bakery on Bloor West.  Their cupcakes are more reasonably priced and they are better tasting than Kellys in Burlington."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The shop was very clean and organized. I believe the cupcake was overpriced, I got the Oreo cupcake which was $4 and the texture was dry."}
{"text":"Almond Butterfly is my one of my new favorite bakeries for vegan treats!

Get the double chocolate vegan cupcake.
They taste as good as they look!
The cupcake was super moist and chocolatey and the icing was creamy and rich.

The cookie sandwich was also delightful and not too sweet.

I grabbed an amerciano here, but you can have other espresso drinks made with almond milk as well.

There were so many items that I wanted to try!
Vegan chocolate chip cookies, date squares, this list goes on!

The service here was friendly and even though the goodie selection is small, all the items looked awesome.  

Sorry Bunner's, I probably won't be heading that far west for my vegan treats anymore!"}
{"text":"Cupcakes were one of the best i have tried so far! Rasberry jam on the cupcake was so fresh and not too sweet. Cupcake itself was not dry but moist enough to make you feel you are eating just a homemade cupcake."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore the decor of this place, super chic and cozy. Ordered a mocha with almond milk, it was pretty good, wish it had a stronger coffee taste. 
Also ordered vegan chocolate espresso cupcake. The cake is extremely moist and fluffy, couldn't tell it was vegan or gluten free at all! 
The date square was incredible, actually not overwhelmingly sweet, unlike what j expected. I had a taste of my friends chocolate chunk cookie, always been obsessed with bunners CCC, but this might be better! Will come back :)"}
{"text":"I just was walking by and craving a cup of coffee.  Very welcoming storefront.  I decided to have a chocolate chunk cookie that was out of this world.  I would never had guessed it was gluten free.  Yum Yum Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The best bakery I've ever eaten at, regardless of the gluten-free. I am not usually a cinnamon bun enthusiast but these are absolutely worth it every time- something special. The bagels are delicious and every sandwich I've tried has been exceptional; my favorite is the salami and sun dried tomato."}
{"text":"Only had their espresso here and it was very nice. Place is small and cozy. I can see myself just sipping coffee and people watching on a sunny summer day. Would come back to try their pastries."}
{"text":"Great gluten free cupcake.  I had a raspberry lime cupcake and the cream on top is a bit too sweet for me, but the cake part is very well balanced. 
Excellent coffee here!  I'd a soy-cappuccino and absolutely love it!  The milk is frothed perfectly to give a good separation of the foam and the coffee.  Very fluffy!  Great work!"}
{"text":"I thought everything here was extremely tasty. I'm not even gluten-free and felt that everything was so great here that I would come here over a regular bakery. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We came to this cafe due to its vegan ways and we loved it! It was our first time in Toronto, so stopping by this cafe for a little break was just exactly what we needed. The cafe was a bit tight but luckily we were able to find some seats and relax! 

I definitely recommend this place if you want something sweet but healthy! We will definitely be back once we came back to Toronto :)"}
{"text":"I've been gluten free for 4 years and this is the first place that serves baked goods that don't taste gluten free. Everything tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is perfect for enjoying a novel with a cup of coffee on a rainy or sunny afternoon. It's in a nice location, so you can actually enjoy looking out the window. The service is so cheery that you'll want to become a regular. The meals are perfect for a lunch or brunch, and they serve delicious desserts that you won't forget. All in all if you haven't visited this bakery at least once, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Insanely good.  I haven't stopped thinking about the AB Egg'r.  I want to eat one every day for the rest of my life.  And the peanut butter chocolate cupcake.  And the chocolate chunk cookie.  I want to eat everything from this bakery.  And I may have already eaten half in one day with zero regrets.  The shop itself if beautiful and cheery.  The staff was friendly and polite.  There was convenient street parking.  My only complaint about this bakery is that there isn't one in Buffalo."}
{"text":"Vegan espresso cupcake. Yum! Very moist and not too sweet.
Chocolate cookie has big chunks of chocolate in it. 
Price, reasonable with student discount(10%)
Overall, cute little cafe, will visit again."}
{"text":"I've only had one item from this shop, the Pumpkin Pie.  Says it serves eight, but seriously I think you could serve 10.

I usually HATE pie.  I know, right?? Crazy.  I like pie FILLING, I just usually hate the crust.  Maybe the reason was gluten all along? haha either way, I don't keep gluten free, but the person who brought the pie does.  Thank god for that!  This was a buttery, flaky crust that was so light and airy, not rock hard or heavy.  The filling of the pie was subtle, not nutmeg-or-cinnamon overpowering, and a good creamy consistency.

Definitely would recommend for GF and GL (gluten lovers...) alike!"}
{"text":"TLDR; 95% sure this place gave me food poisoning and the owner seems to have complained and had my review removed by finding a loophole in Yelp guidelines when I mentioned it. Not cool.

UPDATE: The 5% uncertainty is a courtesy I have given by acknowledging that it is true that I may not have gotten food poisoning from your establishment. A courtesy which you have afforded neither me nor your other customers. Your complete denial of any inkling of possibility that someone could possibly have gotten food poisoning from your establishment is quite frankly concerning, irresponsible and a disservice to your customers and that is my main issue here. That and the fact that the management of Almond Butterfly seem to attempt to skirt any culpability by having unflattering reviews removed from your page by finding loopholes in the system. Makes me wonder if this establishment has done this before. 

Besides these issues, I did not eat at any other establishments and I cook very carefully. While you may not be inclined to believe that since your response to this situation has shown you to not believe things your customers say, your establishment served the only suspicious thing I ate in many weeks prior. Also, repeatedly asking a customer to discuss the personal details of their health in an attempt to force them to tell you their symptoms and discredit them is very invasive and insulting. I am quite certain I had food poisoning because I had no flu like symptoms that would suggest I had any other illness. And you are correct, in saying that I did not go to the doctor because like the vast majority of people, I don't think it is wise to go to a physician for trivial illnesses like food poisoning. It is a waste of everyone's time and resources. I am not going to do that simply because a food establishment refuses to believe that someone could have slipped up. Mistakes do happen. Massive corporations have entire teams dedicated solely to food safety and sanitation and they still have issues occasionally so it is certainly possible that your establishment faltered. 

Lastly, I question the actual knowledge of food safety at Almond Butterfly since the information provided about food poisoning (the qualification that it can only be food poisoning if it happens 24-48 after consumption of bad food) in our emails and in your reply is false and easily verifiable via google. Or perhaps that was simply another attempt to evade culpability by discrediting someone with a legitimate concern. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pretty disappointed with Almond Butterfly because this was a place that I definitely enjoyed and would recommend my clients go to as I work in the area, unfortunately probably not anymore.

I was here about 1.5-2 weeks ago where I ordered a bagel with sundried tomato cream cheese. The staff were very friendly and the bagel came out quickly and I took it to go. As I ate the bagel, I realized that it seemed a bit under baked but I was in a rush and I know that vegan/GF food can have a different texture so I assumed that's what it was and ate it. Four hours later I was very sick. I had had little else to eat that day so I'm fairly certain the food from Almond Butterfly is what did it. Wish that was the end of it.

I posted a review (an update to a previous review) here a day or two later about this and the business reached out asking me to email them about the incident which I actually thought was very nice of them as they could have just let this go without doing anything about it. So after sending an email or two in which the owner, although pretty nice, was pretty adamant in telling me I didn't get food poisoning here and that it must have been something else, I received an email from Yelp telling me that my review had been removed due to not complying with site guidelines of \"not containing a new, firsthand experience\". I have never had an issue with any of my reviews being removed before and it certainly was a new experience with the business. I haven't heard anything from the owner of the business in about a week (since the update was removed) so it seems pretty obvious that they complained and having the review removed was their main concern. The original update was lacking in detail since I didn't see the point of commenting on things I had already commented on in my original review when my main issue was sanitation and food safety but since the lack of detail seems to have been misconstrued as \"not a new first hand experience\", I am posting in full detail now about my new, frustrating experience with Almond Butterfly.

Maybe don't spend so much time trying to get reviews you find unflattering removed and instead spend a little more time making sure your food is safe to eat, yeah?"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Almond Butterfly but wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. I ordered two cupcakes and one breakfast cookie to-go and they weren't as good as my favourite gluten and dairy free bakery in the beaches. I've heard so many good things about Almond Butterfly, that the hype did not meet my expectations. 

I tried a chocolate cupcake with a fake Oreo on top and the chocolate cupcake portion (the most important part of the cupcake) was not that good. It didn't have the rich flavourful flavour and texture I anticipated it would have. With that being said, I also tried a lemon vanilla cupcake and this one was done much better. It was more moist and tasted the way I expected a delicious cupcake to be. 

I also tried the breakfast cookie and this was by far the yummiest item I tried. The cookie was baked perfectly and it featured whole seeds, cranberries and chocolate chunks, creating an exquisite flavour combination. The cookie was also chewy and delicious!

Of all the treats I tried at this bakery, the vegan breakfast cookie was my favourite treat. For donuts and cupcakes, my favourite bakery is still Tori's Bakeshop in the beaches. 

I would definitely return to Almond butterfly to pick up some cookies and maybe even to try the chocolate chip cookie, which the server said was his favourite."}
{"text":"It is pretty hard to find a gluten free bakery but I've finally found one! Instead of dairy products, many of the treats here are made with nutty substitutes such as almond flour or coconut cream etc. As for the baked goods, i can't speak for all of them and there aren't much to choose from however their chocolate chunk cookies were absolutely delicious! A little more on the pricier end however it tasted great. If I'm back in the area, I hope to get more of the cookies and also try other goodies or maybe even a sandwich :) There are very few seating area with friendly staff members."}
{"text":"I got the almond butterfly cupcake and mom had the chocolate chunk cookie. Irresistibly good!  Great bright buzz in the small space; started chatting with Brits at a communal table with a girl reading beside us, seemingly unbothered by our boisterous tone. 

Whether you have dietary restrictions or not, I cannot recommend this tiny Harbord Village cafe & bakery enough! Nice way to spend a bit of time mingling with community dwellers on a lazy day."}
{"text":"I love the coffee here! I found it to be better than Jimmy's when I visited. I also ordered \"Dave's Fave\" and it was so delicious. I would recommend some hot sauce on it but enjoyed the bagel and serving size. I would recommend this shop for anyone looking for a tasty, healthy brunch in Toronto (even for people without dietary considerations)."}
{"text":"This place....this place!  I do not care about anything being gluten-free because I don't have celiac disease.  I came here because it looked nice and the food looked great AND IT IS.  First time I just had an iced tea and a muffin.  That iced tea was the best one I've had in forever with fresh lemon.  And the banana chocolate chip muffin was to die for: moist, flavourful and absolutely delicious.  The owner said we should come for lunch.

Today we did!  Again, so tasty.  I had the turkey pesto on a bagel and my friend had the veggie apples and cheese.  Both were great!  And we had treats: a brownie with caramel and a strawberry cupcake.  Fabulous.  They are AMAZING.

Also, the owner is so nice and friendly.  This will be my new place for lunch and iced tea.  I am so happy to have found it!"}
{"text":"This place almost makes me want to go dairy-free. Despite the $ review, it is not cheap. $5 for a medium almond milk latte."}
{"text":"I went to Almond Butterfly on a Monday morning and there were a few people inside eating their breakfast meals. I got two cupcakes for my friend and I: lemon vanilla and the carrot cake. The yelp reviews tell me that their cupcakes have a lot of promise but their carrot cake cupcake is actually UNBELIEVABLE. With a moist carrot cake base with a creamy but not too sweet frosting, the balance and combination blEW ME AWAY. My friend also enjoyed her cupcake. I'm already so excited to try their other cupcakes. Also I wanted to get their regular chocolate chip cookie but the customer in front got to it before I did. Service was good but the cupcake was phenomenal!

In addition, I also really appreciate how Almond Butterfly takes the care and time to package the cupcakes properly, unlike other cupcake places where I went to where box packaging would result in a damaged cupcake.

Update: I returned to get a chocolate CHUNK cookie and the cashier gave me a chocolate CHIP cookie, which was vegan. I wanted a sweet chewy cookie but instead I got a jaw workout with the tough and dry cookie. Their cookie is a 2/5, I really expected better even if it's vegan. It might be better if you pair it with a drink."}
{"text":"Excellent and helpful service and delicious fresh goodies to boot! Definitely a must for anyone who's vegan, gluten free, paelo or wants good baked treats or breakfast/lunch! The coffee also looked amazing and smelt wonderful too!

I was only popping in to pick up a few items but would definitely stick around next time for a full meal. Finding a good gluten free bread can be hard. As for what I picked up, I wanted the whole case lol everything looked so scrumptious and well presented. I opted for the almond butter cookie, breakfast cookie and two cupcakes to bring to share with friends. The two cupcakes were right out of the oven - still warm and this was the early afternoon. Thumbs up for that! The two cupcakes were chocolate chip cookie dough and carrot cake. There were no complaints from the friends who gobbled up those. As for the cookies, both were good. The breakfast cookie was my fav though. Not too sweet or dry really made it stand out. 

If you're in the area or even if you're not. Make it a point to swing by! Friendly service and great food? What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"The coffee is really really good. But other than that (I guess because i don't have these dietary restrictions) the actual food isn't worth it. But, if you are dairy-free, gluten-free or vegan this place has probably every accommodation to it that you can think of."}
{"text":"Almond Butterfly makes some of the best gluten-free baked goods around. And for such a small bakery, the taste, texture and flavor of their pastries is just incredible.

The staff was pleasant and helpful, answering all of my questions. I went with a variety to go: one each of their almond butterfly, peanut butter banana and chocolate cupcakes with an additional pumpkin pie tart thrown in for good measure.

The cupcakes were a bit sweet for my taste, but great none the less. Not too starchy, rich and moist with a perfect balance of cake to frosting. As for the tart, delicious with its creamy center and flakey crust.

I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"This place has selections of fresh cup cakes. Also they serve brunch style food. They have variety of coffee and tea. Different cookies as s well. Date squares and raising tea bisscuit are awesome. Lots of vegan and gluten free options available.
Friendly and cool staff.
Nice local business.
They don't accept American Express, not a problem for me."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened up so close to me. I don't need to eat gluten-free, I just enjoy experimental baking. That being said, these cupcakes (and everything else I've had) are so delicious. Some of the best baked goods I've had, never mind being in a gluten-free category. My favourite is probably still the espresso chocolate cupcake, with icing that comes close to my mom's (though the pecan chocolate chip cookie and maple spiced cupcake make worthy rivals!). Everything is made that very day, so it's all soft, moist and fresh. Even the gluten-free bagel toasted with cream cheese was still soft/regular bagel-like. I'm really impressed with the food and everyone who works there is more than happy to answer the billion questions you have when you ask how it is so delicious."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp as it was an eight minute walk from where I was (BMV Bookstore near Spadina Station) because my friend and I wanted to find a cafe to do some individual reading and have some caffeine intake. Located very near University of Toronto St. George's campus, Almond Butterfly is an adorable and quaint looking gluten-free, vegan friendly (and also, with laactose free options) bakery and cafe. I would tell my lactose-intolerant or vegan friends to come here without a doubt. The aesthetic appeal is so inviting (to me, at least) with a bright Tiffany blue, hanging lights and posters. My friend ordered the pumpkin spice latte and I ordered an iced Americano coffee (my summer cafe staple) - both were delicious. Prices bode well for my student budget and the barista was very kind. Unfortunately, the place seems to be understaffed - it must've been hard for the barista to take orders, make them and take calls (that kept coming in) on his own. For this reason, service today wasn't extremely efficient - but he was very genuinely apologetic about it, and my friend and I didn't mind as we were enjoying the free WiFi...haha, to be honest. The password by the way: glutenfree. 

I would come here again if I find myself in the area."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Almond Butterfly Cafe while waiting for a friend for dinner. What distinguishes the cafe from others is its decor.  Adorning wooden panels, naturalistic knick knacks as well as bear and butterfly themed drawings, you will be transported to cottage country once you enter. To top it all off, country pop music plays in the background and it perfectly lulls you to relaxation.  The volume is a little high, so if you're visiting to study, you will want to bring your headset. 

Also, the cafe serves vegan and gluten-free baked goods.  You'll get the full gamut from cupcakes to muffins to brownies to cookies and so forth.  Unlike other shops that serve a similar style of desserts, this cafe actually has decent seating and table space. I would assume that  you could fit up to 8-10 diners at once.  As such, it's a great choice when you want to grab a bite over coffee and chit chat without having to take the extra step of finding your own space. I've been to many shops with vegan/gluten-free fare where it was impossible to dine in, which made it difficult if I wanted seconds or didn't want to ruin the pastries on my way home.  Here, you won't have to worry about these unfortunate scenarios. 

The cupcakes seem to be HGs of the cafe. Most of the flavours seem to be chocolate or vanilla based, but I did spot one lemon variety.  Perhaps I came during a time when there were limited flavours, so you may want to call in beforehand to ask about the varieties they're serving that day.  I ordered the Almond Butterfly, a vanilla cupcake topped with almond frosting and a sprinkle of what seemed to be crushed berries. Contrary to its looks, the frosting is purely almond flavoured even though it's pastel pink, the iconical colour for strawberry.  Upon my first few bites, I quickly realized that the cupcake was bomb! The sponge was moist and the frosting was soft and sweet with a good almond kick to it. I do have a few gripes, however.  Firstly, the cupcakes are on the smaller side and are priced about 50 cents to 1 dollar higher than other cupcakes you can find in downtown.  The price to portion ratio is unbalanced with the cupcakes being on the pricier end, but hey, they're vegan and gluten-free, so there's some merit to it.  Secondly, the sponge was on the oilier side. I was surprised at how much oil was left on my fingers while I feasted.  It's expected to get a little oil on your fingers when eating pastries, but I was shocked at how much oil came off of this cupcake. All I can say is to watch the number of servings you're having if you're going for a dozen cupcakes (which is actually very likely to happen because these cupcakes are just so dang flavourful!).

Would I come back? Perhaps. I'm not much of a cupcake gal, but I do like how the cafe's located near some cheap eats joints like River Tai and Magic Noodle.  It's also within a reasonable walking distance of UofT, so it's a convenient alternative to Starbucks and Tim Horton's."}
{"text":"I go here on a weekly basis for lunch. I can't believe everything is gluten free and tastes amazing! I love the eggtastic and walnut apple cheddar bagel. The strawberry milkshake cupcake is off the chainz. And the peanut butter brownie is so freakin' good. I think I've had everything off the menu but these had the best impression on me. Oh and the spicy tea latte with vanilla syrup or hot chocolate is also super delish (all syrups are made in house. Yay!). 

The location is great - a few mins from UofT's central buildings. The staff is super nice :). I hope they can open up other shops around town so we can get more gf goodies."}
{"text":"Almond Butterfly has the most amazing selection of gluten free and vegan baked goods and treats I have ever had! The bagels are so fluffy, and are AMAZING made into a vegan pizza bagel, and their cupcakes are moist and flavourful too (carrot is my fav)! I have probably sampled pretty much everything they offer from muffins to cookies to squares, and everything has been delish! It's hard to believe it's all gluten free!"}
{"text":"Best bagel ever! Got one with egg, a delicious cheese, tomato and added turkey and hubby got bacon and cheese. Just delicious! Place is very little but worthy for the goodies. 
Plus the coffee was very good!!! 
And Love the kind service."}
{"text":"Tried a cupcake from here and it was very delicious! Personally I felt there was a but too much icing but that's what cupcakes are I suppose! Very good looking cupcakes too!!"}
{"text":"Made a long distance visit to the Almond Butterfly with high expectations for a speciality bakery. Unfortunately this visit fell short, perhaps it was too good to be true. There weren't many options for treats (chocolate only cupcakes, ginger cookies, and another cookie priced at over $2.00) but I couldn't care for them. I was hoping to see a nice variety of treats like the caramel bars, different delectable cupcakes, cakes etc. as featured on their website. That's what drew me here in the first place. Didn't have those available therefore we couldn't try them. They did however have a \"Paleo\" lava cake. We went for lunch and ordered the GFT (gluten-free turkey sandwich on a \"bagel\" with cheese, lettuce and tomato). Sadly it was a flop. I was expecting a substantial bagel like the ones at Primal Cravings (that are also Paleo) but these were not well executed. Skinny, dry bagels with massive holes so it cannot hold any of the sandwich filling. Gluten-free (and Paleo!) baking has come a long way, it seemed like they just gave up on this one. The three stars is all thanks to the Paleo lava cake. It saved our otherwise disappointing visit. 

I'm sad to rate this bake shoppe as only three stars but for now it's justified. I think over time they'll find ways to improve their offerings. I might swing by on another day to see if there's anything different but for now, I'll continue with baking my own Paleo friendly treats at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Stepped in right before an important exam--a risky move given my tummy--and I made the best decision ever.

I ordered the \"G F T\" Grilled Turkey Cheddar Pesto Sandwich on a cheddar biscuit (a little extra) and it was divine, sumptuous, crispy, crunchy bliss. I have never had such an amazing GF biscuit. Then came not two but three sugar cookies (chewy perfection), coffee (really good quality) and seltzer water.

Instead of falling into a food coma, I was satiated pre-exam and will return again soon.

Thank you Almond Butterfly:) Love the food, atmosphere and sweet, friendly staff."}
{"text":"FOR YOUR VEGAN LOVERS. The cupcakes were quite sweet, Lok but it was really sweet. But a lot of options they had were vegan so that good for me. This place is not cheap for someone looking for somewhere quick to have a snack. I would only recommend you if you are vegan.
xd"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed my favourite place in the city. When i was diagnosed Celiac I was so sad to give up all the sweets I grew up eating (plus bagels.) A family friend told me about Almond Butterfly and it's been a blessing and a curse ever since....blessing because it's delicious, a curse because it's not cheap and I want to eat there all the time.

David and Melanie have built a warm, friendly place with delicious food...both sweet and savory. Some of my favourites include the chocolate chunk cookies, the almond pecan cookies and the GFT sandwiches.

You can't go wrong, easily the best GF spot in the city"}
{"text":"Their gluten free cupcake was the best cupcake I've ever had in my life.  Better than any non-gluten free cupcake I've had, even. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good lattes and more friendly than Sam James down the street. 
We over-ate a bit due the the gluten-free choices. The banana bread was really good, moist and chewy. Cupcake was also excellent. I think a bit better than Bunners, which is our go to. The chewy, gooey bar was also great, perhaps a little sweet though. (That is not a complain on my part!)
We will definitely be back. I have never eaten such good gluten-free baking.
(Only two seats and a tiny table out front but the seating inside is nice, if limited.)"}
{"text":"Hubby and I passed by this cute little gluten-free bakery en route to dinner, and the black and white facade and attractive signage called my attention and I was persuaded to go inside. By 5 pm there were only a handful of vegan and dairy-free cupcakes left in the display. Some of the flavours available included Vegan chocolate raspberry, dairy free vanilla lemon, and dairy free maple cupcakes. 

There were also a selection of almond flour chocolate chip and pecan cookies, orange muffins made with almond flour, vegan chocolate chip/chunk and breakfast cookies, peanut butter lava cakes, vegan date squares, and brownies. Everything looked yummy. I was offered a sample of the vegan date square which was deliciously crispy from the oats, coconut and almonds, and buttery tasting without being overly sweet. I think the tapioca flour created a bit of a slightly grainy \"aftertexture\". Despite this, it was still very good and had I been given this date square in a blind taste test, I would not have guessed it was vegan and gluten free.

Definitely worth visiting this bakery if you are vegan or going gluten free or want tasty treats with less processed forms of sugar.

(50/100)"}
{"text":"I have no gluten sensitivity and I still think they make the best desserts in Toronto. Their chocolate vegan espresso cake is pretty much the best cake I've ever had. Just amazing.

Staff is very friendly. It's really easy to order stuff or just pick something up. I'm a little annoyed that the rating of this place on Yelp is just 4.5 stars. It should definitely be 5/5."}
{"text":"I love it! We've gone twice and stocked up. If you spend $50 or $60 or more (I forget which one it is, lol) your order is tax free. Their almond & chocolate cupcakes are soooooo good. And their paleo cookies. I WISH we had a place like this back home."}
{"text":"When asked what the shopkeeper would recommend, they mentioned the cookies--specifically the pecan one. This fell short of my expectations.

However, I did not want to abandon Almond Butterfly because there MUST be a reason that this is a long-standing institution. Today, under utterly abysmal conditions of slush, rampant hail, and unforgiving winds... I swung by and decided on the

DATE SQUARE.

This will now be my chosen destination for Date Squares. Slightly sweet (naturally so!) but also savoury (!!) with enough heft thanks to the oatmeal folded into this treat. Yelp Friends: this was truly wonderful--give 'er a try!"}
{"text":"I had a vegan cupcake here that was to die for!

it's small and crowded however,  wasn't a great place to relax with a coffee and get some work done. 

vegan options other than the cupcakes seemed limited."}
{"text":"Sandwich tastes good. I got the turkey sandwich with pesto, tomato, greens and cheddar cheese. 

Ice chai latte is okay. I think it's too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I visited on a Monday morning at around 9am. Originally, I was planning on picking up some sweets for a friend's birthday, but since they didn't have fresh cupcakes yet, I picked out two cookies, which were delicious! The hot chocolate I ordered was also wonderfully made! 

I know it was a Monday morning, but since the store itself is open, it would have been nice to have cupcakes (not leftover ones from over the weekend, as explained by one of the store-owners) ready for sale too.

Will definitely be back to try out other drinks and sweets though!"}
{"text":"Almond Butterfly has an amazing assortment of gluten free and vegan baked goods. I've had some of their breakfast bagels - all yummy and filling - as well as the pepperoni pizza bagel - a bit oily (it is reminiscent of pizza after all) but also tasty. I've also had their chocolate chunk cookie (a go-to fave), the pecan chocolate chip cookie (crumbly but tasty) and a raspberry muffin (a bit dry, but still good). 

A downside for me is their drinks are pretty subpar, but the main draw is the food. Given that everything is gluten free and many things are vegan, the food is really good. If you're gluten free for any reason you'll be thrilled by the selection and close to comparable taste of their baked goods!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a tea one morning and couldn't resist the smell. Didn't even know it was gluten free... I got the rosemary & cheese biscut which was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Fantastic gluten free baked goods. Worth the drive for the gluten free bagels alone!"}
{"text":"AMAZING EVERYTHING HERE!  Muffin was unbelievably moist and tasty - everything I have had here has been a huge hit! I highly recommend this place and everything they offer!"}
{"text":"I was early for my breakfast date across the street and decided to grab a coffee. It's a cute spot, and the desserts looked delicious and they are all vegan. 

I just ordered a cold brew and it wasn't very good, I wasn't a fan. I don't think I would go out of my way to go back and try the pastries. 

Keep Eating,
Angela"}
{"text":"Came here today to grab lunch and get some studying done; the location is super convenient, a five minute walk from Robarts Library at UofT St. George!

I got the apple cheddar walnut melt (on an open-face bagel), a latte, and a paleo molten chocolate lava cake. The bagel melt was a great meatless alternative and I thought the way they brought it out on a wooden cutting board was really cute. Latte was good as well but not particularly noteworthy, something you would find at any small coffee shop in Toronto.

What really stands out at this place is their wide selection of various dairy-free/vegan baked goods. I only tried the paleo lava cake - which was great, couldn't even tell that it was paleo from the taste and texture - but I was eyeing the vegan cupcakes the whole time I was there. Definitely worth a second visit. Added bonus: staff was super friendly and accommodating, especially the woman behind the cash register!"}
{"text":"Had an Americano due to an absence of drip coffee (hipster whaaat). Wasn't anything special. Tasty, but I'd rather drink a timmies dark roast for the price. Friend got an iced tea, which took 5 mins to make. Came out and it wasn't an iced tea - more of a lukewarm tea. Not the most satisfying thirst quencher on a hot summer day. Servers are friendly and helpful. Wifi is good. Decor is nice. All seating is high top, so it's especially good if you like a standing desk to work at while you sip your java"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop.  They have gluten free baked items.  Ordered hot chocolate, not too sweet and had enough chocolate taste. And the art on the drinks are super cute!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Almond Butterfly at lunch when I worked in the area. The staff are helpful and their cupcakes became a staple for birthdays and other celebrations around the office. 

Unfortunately there are only ~10 spots inside and a small table for two on the patio, but most people come in to grab and go. They have a stellar selection of baked goods on display - breakfast cookies, warm cinnamon buns and paleo bites.  Everything's gluten-free and they also have some dairy-free sweet treats. I've tried their cupcakes and paleo molten lava cake, but the real star is the show is the GFT (home-made bagel with turkey, spinach, pesto and white cheddar). Their bagels are the best I've ever had - Montreal-style, very soft and not too bread-y.

The cupcake flavours change up daily so I often check their Instagram account before going. When you get a cupcake to go, they put it in an upside down plastic cup so you can easily bring it around."}
{"text":"I am all about the mint chocolate and the vegan mint chocolate cupcake did not disappoint. My partner's lava cake was so good she almost didn't want to share. Puppy dog eyes won me a taste in the end. The server was kind enough to warm it up for her too. We came right before closing so we were lucky to score a free vegan chocolate chip cookie before we left. We'll definitely be back and if you're looking for vegan/gluten free options it doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"If you're missing bagels (I know l was when I went gluten free!) you'll be thrilled by the amazing chewy soft bagel at Almond Butterfly. The cookies are heavenly, the cupcakes are dreamy! Birthdays now come with an amazing cake (oh was I missing good birthday cakes but not any more!) And pie!! Such amazing pie!! Gluten free lemon meringue pie to die for! If you're gluten free or dairy free you can get all of your cravings filled here, with good coffee and such lovely service to boot!  I can't wait to work from home again so I can hang out here for a bit and try more than one muffin! What a lovely discovery!"}
{"text":"Oh man!! What can I say? This place is the bomb!! We went here on our way out from visiting Toronto, and I wish that had been our first stop! I think we might have literally rolled out of Toronto a few pounds heavier, so I'm almost glad we didn't find it earlier... Almost glad! It would have been worth it :) the cookies were so perfect that even my boyfriend, who is a cookie fiend, loved them! And they're gluten free!! He hates almost all gf stuff, but you can't deny how perfect these cookies are. They're crunchy on the outside but soft & gooey in the middle. Never had anything like it (I have to eat gf) and I can't wait to go back & eat some more! They had wifi you can use & a bathroom, and the area it's in is so cute! The atmosphere is very cozy & I wish there was one closer to us."}
{"text":"I came here with the sole purpose of buying the amazing vegan chocolate cupcakes and the paleo lava cake! I was speed walking to ensure that the items I wanted weren't sold out and luck was on my side!

It's a tiny little place which can accommodate under ten people at a time if they wanted to devour their treats inside but I took them home instead as they were near capacity! 

I ordered the Vegan Chocolate Espresso Cupcake, Vegan Chocolate Vanilla Cupcake, Vegan Chocolate Peanut Butter & Paleo Lava Cake to go! The staff was kind enough to inform me that I should put the Paleo Lava Cake inside the microwave for about 15-20 seconds before enjoying it! Boy was it Ah-May-Zing! It literally was like lava coming out of the cake! I shared it with my Two year old nephew and he gave me a thumbs up!! The Vegan Chocolate Peanut Butter Cupcake was heavenly!!! The peanut butter icing was so smooth and peanut-ty!! The other two cupcakes will be enjoyed by my friends! They'll give me their feedback!  Definitely coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"I visited Almond Butterfly this weekend on my search for a great cupcake place and was pleasantly surprised at how cozy and warm this small cafe was. There is a huge selection of baked goods that they seem to bring fresh from their ovens? I had a cinnamon chai cupcake and a cup of earl gray. 

The cinnamon chai cupcake was kind of strange, on first bite it's quite pleasant though you definitely taste more cinnamon than chai. The cake itself is quite dense and not as light as I would prefer my cupcakes to be but it was still good. The strangest part of the cupcake was that it seemed to get saltier with every bite, the icing is really salty! I found it a little unpleasant and kind of regretted not getting  a chocolate one or a vanilla one. Overall a 3.5/5 star cupcake, though I will definitely try more of their cupcakes and probably their other baked goods to give a better/more accurate review. 

Their tea was fine, though my main problem with it is the fact that their insulating sleeves on their take away cups dont seem to insulate against the heat at all. I found myself shifting my grip from finger to finger as they would start burning. 

Definitely okay as far as everything goes, I'm excited to go back to try their savory baked goods and other cupcakes as well as their coffee but until then only 3 stars can be given based on what was sampled."}
{"text":"I had their cappuccino which tastes really good and a chocolate cup cake.. also tasted great! Overall it was an amazing experience - definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Cute and quaint  coffee house. VERY SWEET AND FRIENDLY STAFF. House made syrups and lots of gluten and dairy free options."}
{"text":"Every time we get to Toronto we try our best to go to Almond Butterfly just for the coffee alone. It's the best coffee by far, especially their Pumpkin Spice Latte. Of course we always buy cupcakes, bagels and cookies when we're there as well. I am a very sensitive celiac and I have never had a bad experience there. A wrong order one time, but they still get 5 stars because they care about celiac, food allergies and everything they do is safe and delicious."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is as good as it gets around U of T and even further afoot. NICE execution (great ambiance, nice people, excellent food and drinks) of a rather medicinal concept; avoidance of gluten and dairy has been a bitter pill to swallow for many, but Almond Butterfly elevates abstinence to decadence. Keep up the good work! Love your cupcakes, cookies, lattes, bagels, etc. etc. Nice touch to provide samples too;-)"}
{"text":"My sister introduced me here since it's in here hood.  They're gluten-free, helpful and very friendly!  I tried several of their pastries and they were all tasty and excellent.  I couldn't tell they were gluten-free either and trust me, I've eaten tons of gluten-free sweets over the years.  Unfortunately for me, I wish it wasn't out of the way for me, but I'd definitely go back!  Cute ambience too."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Gluten free can be a tricky thing to nail but these folks have it down. Lovely staff and a big, sunny window to sit in as well."}
{"text":"I'll admit it: I'm a baked-goods addict. And Almond Butterfly does them right! I've tried most of the gluten-free offerings from the bakeries around the city (doughnuts, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, etc.), and these are hands down the best. 

Most gluten-free baked goods crumble too easily, are hard and unpleasant to bite into, or are gluey and starchy. None of the goods on offer at Almond Butterfly are any of those unpleasant things. The cupcakes are light with a nice crumb and flavour, and the icing is light and delicious. 

I tried their chocolate chip cookies, the moelleux au chocolat, a chai spice cupcake and their banana bread muffin. Everything was amazing. The moelleux au chocolat was rich and decadent, the cupcake well-spiced and topped with the perfect amount of delicious icing, and the banana bread muffin was moist and brimming with banana flavour. 

Skip the new rest of the gluten-free bakeries out there (I'm talking to you Bunners - your stodgy treats are gross!) and go to Almond Butterfly!!

(Edit: I also had the opportunity to try their bagel last night, and man was it delicious. I challenged it to hold up to a large, messy sandwich and the bagel stayed together and continued to deliver on its commitment to deliciousness from start to finish! I definitely recommend them to any gluten avoiders out there.)"}
{"text":"Saw this on a BlogTo list for gluten free places in Toronto. 
The staff was friendly, which is always important for me when I go to a place I've never been before. 
Their menu was not overwhelming, simple, and something for everyone. 
 
The sandwich was good, but the cupcake wasn't anything too special, the icing was a little gritty. 

Will definitely be coming back to fulfill my bakery and sweet gluten-free/dairy free cravings though!"}
{"text":"Great service. A bit of a wait because it is very popular. It has a wide variety of options for both food and drinks. I had a latte with almond milk which tasted good, a little weak for me but I find most lattes too weak. The vegan cookie I had was delicious! I can't remember but it may have also been gluten free."}
{"text":"This cafe is so cute with great service and nice coffees. Don't miss the chocolate chip pecan cookies- I'm not gluten-free but it doesn't matter, they're really good! If you're lucky you'll get a seat inside the tiny cafe or on the lovely bench outside- complete with a fresh dog bowl of water and flowers. It's very hard to get a seat as they are very limited but it's lovely if you do. 

I also tried one of their bagel sandwiches (GFT)  and their chocolate espresso cupcake and for me I didn't enjoy either of them, just my personal taste. I'll be back for coffee & cookies though!"}
{"text":"Just bought 24 for a cupcakes for a party and they were $80. The icing melted when we put them out on the buffet and the strawberry ones were not very good. They may not have gluten but there is plenty of sugar or sweetening agent as we found the icing  way too sweet. Compared to Lolly Cakes on Mt Pleasant...No comparison."}
{"text":"This place was alright, although great for one that needs a gluten-free diet but still love baked goods. The cookies were different then cookies that had gluten, they were crumblier. The taste was good though. I went to this establishment because of how good the picture on yelp looked. I wasn't too disappointed! The baked goods were sweet, as any are, but the texture was alittle different. The coffee on the other hand was great! The only downside I can think of was the space. It is small and during their busy times, it is hard to get in and move around. There were barely any seats free and the counter to add sugar and milk were always crowded."}
{"text":"O-M-Gee-zus kweyest this place is incredible. Sweets, sammies, teas, and amazing music and ambiance. So cozy place to read or work and hang for a while and eat everything. Love you, almond butterfly!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here is so good. Breakfast cookie, bagel, coffee, cupcake and brownies stand out. I have recommended Almond Butterfly to many friends who have found it good too. Tori's in the beach, AB downtown for excellent baked goods and coffee has me covered."}
{"text":"I have found my local gluten free bakery (as I dance a snoopy dance)! I read about the bakery as a newly opened cafe that came up in my Twitter feed and made it my weekend mission to try it out. I had given their competition's new shop in Kensington market a second chance last week to great disappointment (again) so went into the Almond Butterfly this morning feeling skeptical. My skepticism was unfounded!

I tried the sample of the date square as I perused the case full of goodies and had a \"wow! This is incredible\" moment. Based on that mouthful, I ordered an orange almond muffin and a raspberry muffin to have with my tea right there in the shop. I then added chocolate chunk cookies, a carrot cupcake with cream cheese frosting, a vanilla coconut cupcake and date bars to take home with me. I've managed to sample everything throughout the day and have to say AMAZING. 

The cookies were soft and chewy inside with plenty of chocolate and a nice crisp exterior. The cupcakes are fluffy and moist cake. None of the dense, heaviness of other gluten free cupcakes and the frostings sweet and creamy. The date bars are the best tasting I've ever had. My favourite muffin was the raspberry. Sweetened with maple syrup and with added flax seed and sweet fresh raspberries, it was a perfect summer second breakfast. 

I'm pretty sure I said it at the beginning but I am THRILLED to have a gluten free bakery in town that has products that taste like baked goods should."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow Yelpers, I stopped in to try the gluten free sandwich... WOW!  A warm toasted gluten free bagel with pesto, turkey, cheese, tomato and greens... delicious!  The bagel isn't chewy like a gluten bagel, but it certainly didn't have the fall apart texture of so many gluten free breads.  You will not miss the gluten!

The ginger spice cookie was good, the walnut brownie was better, but the Espresso Chocolate Cupcake... incredible!  I would never have guessed it was gluten free!  The best part was the icing was not too sweet...  

I will be back soon for one of their Paleo Moelleux au Chocolat (molten chocolate cake) which they were out of when I was there.

Even if you don't care about eating gluten free you will enjoy the treats here, but if you don't eat gluten and miss delicious baked items, Almond Butterfly is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I popped into here on a early Sunday morning and saw quite the packed place enjoying vegan brunches.  I was just curious to see what was offered and pleasantly surprised they had much more than GF and vegan cupcakes.  

With a small but freshly baked area, I had a good selection of muffins, scones, bars, large cookies, and the usual cupcakes.  They also offer some great looking espresso drinks.  Since I already had 2 cups of coffee that morning... I passed but the gentlemen behind the counter was wonderful and convinced me their cookies were better than the regular wheat flour cookies.  I bought 1 of the PB and one of the double chocolate chip... each about $2.75.

So a few hours later... how were they?  they definitely had that great crispy outer edge and softer middle.  That surprised me so from a texture point of view... huge points as some GF are just heavy.  The double chocolate chip was very rich in cocoa and not overly sweet.  I liked how their chocolate chunk was more dark chocolate.  The PB was actually one of the better PB cookies I've had... even competing against wheat ones.  They werent wrong!  It is a bit expensive but considering you're getting partially organic ingredients and special ingredients ... it's well worth it!  

I'll be back to try a bar and perhaps a coffee next time!"}
{"text":"Petit (très petit café) a Toronto avec peu de place assise, c'est donc plutôt un endroit de passage plus qu'un endroit ou l'on peut véritablement s'installer. 
Le café y est bon et on peut y trouver des patisseries vegan, j'ai testé une part de gateau aux céréales et aux amandes qui était délicieux et trés nourissant. 
Si j'ai bien aimé l'endroit, je ne m'y précipiterais toutefois pas une seconde fois, c'était 'sans plus'."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a treat and a latte on my way home.

The service was really good. I love chatting with baristas in general and they're not aloof or shy here.

I got the almond butterfly cupcake. I thought it was very good but my husband didn't enjoy it. I think I should've withheld that it was a gluten and dairy free cupcake. The icing was quite lovely and the cake part was PERFECT! 

I liked the way my single cupcake was packaged in an upside down plastic cup with a lid. The whole contraption fit snuggly under my coffee cup so I could hold both in one hand as I tried to board a streetcar and pay my fare."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It was my first time going today and it was such a great experience. The staff are so friendly, knowledgable and accommodating (shout out to Sarah!). Food is delicious. I will definitely be returning regularly!"}
{"text":"Hello uhm why did I only find out about this place yesterday?

Oooookay. Okay. Let's do this.

I apologize in advance for the comparisons to other vegan gluten free goodies, but I really have no other route to take. Bunner's has always been my number one go-to place for vegan GF goodies, because come on, vegan cupcakes? Hell yes. But I discovered Almond Butterfly through a facebook friend who swore this place has Bunner's beat. I was stunned; I needed to check this out.

First of all: very central location. Steps away from Spadina's subway station, and a very walkable distance for UofT students. 

The space is quite small, in all honesty, but that didn't bother me too much. When I walked in, I saw a wide assortment of sweet and savoury delicacies, but the cupcakes were what caught my eye. Well...that's what always catches my eye. I was told that only the cupcakes with chocolate bases were vegan, so I settled for a chocolate-chocolate cupcake, with the incredibly swirly and groovy frosting alongside an espresso.

Again, seating was very limited: one communal table with about 4 seats, and about 4-5 window seats. Everyone in the cafe had laptops open, which may have taken up more table space. I don't know. But the food. Oh the cupcake, sweet darling:

MOIST, NOT OVERPOWERINGLY BUT PERFECTLY SWEET. My goodness. 

Here's the comparison: Bunner's, I do love you. However, like most GF cupcakes, your cake tends to crumble a bit which reminds me of your lack of gluten, and you sometimes get dry. Just a little. While eating Almond Butterfly's cupcake, I almost completely forgot that this was a GLUTEN FREE cupcake. It was moist, decadent, and light, all at the same time. The makings of a perfect cupcake. 

Will definitely be back to try all of the cupcakes. ALL OF THE CUPCAKES.
And drinks, too. The espresso was top notch."}
{"text":"I walked long and far to get here to try these vegan cupcakes. I was especially excited to try the espresso cupcakes, but when i got here the woman behind the counter explained that the icing had no espresso in it, but the cake batter had more than enough to satisfy my craving. Already i was disappointed, and with reason. The cupcake lacked the espresso flavor that I was looking for, and the buttercream icing added nothing to it. The two didn't compliment each other. I couldn't make out the taste of the cake, but it really wasn't a good cupcake for whatever flavor it was. Too bland, nothing special, nothing memorable. Same with the lemon cupcake. I really didn't get a lemon taste at all. The one thing i did love were their cheese biscuits!! I would go back just for the biscuits, but I had to dock 3 points because of the disappointing cupcakes."}
{"text":"Love this spot!! So cute and cozy. Everything is really good - my go to's are definitely the paleo bites and vegan chocolate chip cookies. The besttttt. Not that pricey, in line with other bake shoppes in the city."}
{"text":"Just devoured 2 muffins with my hubs: orange almond & pumpkin millet. Holy moly tasty good! There's a pretty small space to eat in. We took our stuff home with us. Staff is friendly but a bit too laid back IMO -- took a little while to get our order & pay even though there were 3-4 people working. Then again, I was in a rush... So maybe it was me... 

Anyhow, back to the muffins. They were tasty, soft, moist & we couldn't believe they were gluten free!"}
{"text":"The best gluten free bagels and treats in the city. The chocolate chunk cookie and cupcakes are delicious. 
I always buy 6 bagels on every visit then cut them and freeze them - they are amazing to have on hand."}
{"text":"This is about a delivery order. I ordered a Vegetarian Eggtastic, and it really was fantastic. I picked the dairy free option and they made sure there was no dairy in it. The bagel was one of the best I have eaten in my life (on the website, it says they are NY style bagels, but I haven't had a bagel that was this delicious in New York). They put lots of ingredients in it, and my order was on time. I simply fell in love with this place, and would highly highly recommend. Next time, I will definitely try their desserts!"}
{"text":"Some people in my family are vegan and I was put in charge of getting the cake for my dads birthday. Of course, I completely forgot until the day prior. I had walked by almond butterfly many, many times but never thought of trying it out. The cupcakes I ordered were ready the next morning, and they were fantastic. I can probably say they were the best cupcakes I've tried (including non-vegan). They were moist and full of fantastic flavour, and the service I received was stellar. Thanks guys - fam loved it too! Will return"}
{"text":"If you knew me, you will know I love all things carbs, especially wheat-based carbohydrates. I can pinpoint the exact moment when my stomach had a gassy reaction to bread. It was the moment where my heart dropped to the ground and I weep, silently inside. Has the wheat god forsaken me? What will I do if I need a heavy carby pick-me-upper? Is this Karma for all the times I targeted cookies on a dessert tray at an event and had more than my fair share? What will fill this empty void of carby goodness? 

Then comes Almond Butterfly, with their gluten free homemade fresh baked goods and delicious treats - muffins, biscuits, bagels, cookie, cupcakes. You name it, they've got it. 

Almond Butterfly's muffins ($3.75 ea) somehow miraculously kept me full for almost a good half day. Probably the best bang for the buck if you look at the number of hours it kept me sated. 

Yesterday, I purchased the last lonely-looking breakfast cookie ($2.95) in the display case. The cookie split in half (not that the form of a cookie will ever deter me from inhaling it). The staff had kindly offered 30% off as compensation. It was an extremely sweet gesture for a cookie that will be devoured within seconds of it reaching the palm of my hand. 

These are the acts of kindness and acts of deliciousness that keep me coming back to Almond Butterfly!"}
{"text":"I was craving some cookies, and I found this place on yelp. I purchased their vegan chocolate chip cookies, organic sugar cookies, and pecan chocolate chip cookies. They were all extremely good. I thought that I would like the vegan chocolate chip cookie the least, but in fact, it is my favourite. The staff was really friendly as well. I wish I lived in Toronto because all of their other baked goods looked really good as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and bagels. Very fresh ingredients, unique flavours, and they deliver! Go for the turkey pesto sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazinggggg bakery spot!! I can't believe I haven't discovered this place before. 

Food: fantastic array of cupcakes, banana bread and muffins. Pure deliciousness!!

Very cute decor as well. Very convenient spot, great place to catch up with a friend!"}
{"text":"The BEST cupcakes I've had that are gluten and dairy free! The espresso chocolate is the best one I've tried so far. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They have the absolute best coffee I've had in Toronto thus far and their GFT sandwich is amazing. Their pecan chocolate chip cookies are also one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to go if you want some light fare or a guilty indulgence. They have a lot of vegan options too which is great, not to mention their coffee is good. I've had almost all of their sandwiches and all of them are great, and their vegan desserts are bomb. Only thing is that it's a little bit pricey, but it's real good!"}
{"text":"Plenty of bike parking. Excellent Cappuccio. Great pastries. They don't have a lot of seating but it's arranged in a smart way. You can look outside while sitting. There are also two chair and a bench outside. All in all a perfect experience."}
{"text":"Had their Cream Cheese Veggie Sandwich (with fresh dill and garlic cream cheese)...and it was everything I hoped it would be."}
{"text":"For anyone looking for a new place to take a coffee break while in the Annex/College/U of T neck of the woods, I humbly recommend giving Almond Butterfly a whirl. The coffee's awesome (lovingly brewed Social Coffee), and theirs may be the tastiest sweets I've ever had, in spite of being free of gluten, soy and dairy. The sandwiches are pretty delicious, too; simple and straightforward. Go! Just sayin'."}
{"text":"I dropped by Almond Butterfly on a Friday to pick up some cupcakes and definitely had a hard time choosing which ones to get! This bake shop located near Harbord and Spadina is a busy cafe and bakery with many vegan, gluten free, and diary free options. The place was bustling with customers as I walked in and the stream of customers kept coming.

As for the cupcakes, I ordered the dairy free carrot cake, lemon confetti, vegan peanut butter chocolate, and the diary free vanilla latte flavours. Each one was delicious when eaten! Not too sweet yet satisfying.

Service of the staff was super friendly and attentive! Will be back for more in the future."}
{"text":"I try and eat pretty healthy but I'm not strict paleo/gluten-intolerant, so I'm not particularly drawn to gluten-free bread and other pseudo gluten items. But, MAN this place is awesome!

I've been twice now and plan to go back many more times. The price is great for \"gluten-free\" items that usually get marked up huge. Service is also great, everyone is super friendly. It's a bit small and I have seen it quite busy and crowded so choose wisely about when you go if you plan to eat there. I have had the chocolate chip cookie, the brownie, and bagel with pesto, apple, and cheese; all were to die for! Highly recommend, even if you're not \"normally\" into gluten-free places/eating."}
