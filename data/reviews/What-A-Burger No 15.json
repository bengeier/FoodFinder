{"text":"If you have not been to a What-a-Burger, you don't know what you're missing! VERY rustic... Low on atmosphere (unless you think the colorful locals who practically live in these restaurants add to the \"atmosphere\")... Low-to-no frills eats. But boy, are these burgers the BEST! Get the \"what-a-burger\" with a side of onion rings. The local favorite drink is Cherry-lemon Sundrop soda. If you really want to go \"local\", try a Witch Doctor drink. You'll just have to
 go to a W-A-B to find out what's in one... If they will tell, that is"}
{"text":"I'm a big (literally) fan of greasy burgers.  Gimme some medium rare beef of any sort and I'm rejoicing.  What-a-burger gives a decent burger for the price ..only problem is they won't cook it medium rare the way I like it.  I drive by them several times a day and didn't even know they were there until recently. Strange location and they could use some cleaning up, but not bad."}
{"text":"I have had Whataburger, the best fast food burgers in the country. Open 24 hours. Spicy ketchup. Monterrey Melt. Green Chile Cheeseburger. Breakfast sandwiches that will kick your b-hole in the face. 

This place ain't it. This is What-A-Burger. It is a knock off. Might as well be Mac-Don-al-ds. What a J-oke."}
{"text":"Ok, I am a native to this area so I grew up on What-A-Burger. Trust me I am not bragging....the restaurants in this chain are run down, not so great looking hole in the walls. The food is as far from heart healthy as you can get, and the staff.....well let's just say they are \"special\" and leave it at that. But, if you need your gut filled at a low price, served by someone who is glad you came in then What-A-Burger fits the bill just fine. Whenever I have guest come in from \"up north\" I make sure that they get to visit one. They have been known to flinch when their order is yelled back to the fry cook. I let them pull the newbie move of trying to pay with a card....not happening. But they usually do enjoy the food, especially the burgers. One thing you have to get is a large Cherry Lemon Sundrop.....best kept secret of the south! Bottom line....not for the uppity types, or for those on a diet, but just right for those looking for a quick good ol greasy burger."}
{"text":"So so burgers. Just average. Burger King is a bit better I think. So so fries. Outstanding hush puppies tho. They only accept cash which makes you think.... um... okay. But they have atm machine in the store so it is not that bad. 

I would visit there again for hush puppies only. Price is just about the same as five guys burger place."}
{"text":"I have been  a few times and truly will NEVER understand why people like this. Oh well! The employees have only and always been nice!"}
{"text":"Of all the WAB's, this is the best one!! 
It's always good and hot. 
This one is very clean and bug free. Unlike the ones in downtown Concord or Kannapolis."}
{"text":"Eh.  Ok.  Seemed kind of run-down.  Burger was alright.  Fries had almost no salt.  You place your order and the cashier screams it into the kitchen.  Fairly busy, but also pretty quick."}
{"text":"I love this place. I grew up around the corner, and have since moved to another state, but EVERY TIME I visit home my first stop is here to get my witch doctor (extra pickles!) and a what a double with cheese (one BIG) Not only is the food great, but the staff is too. It could be a year between visits and they still remember me and my family. This place to me is what I think of when I think of home."}
{"text":"I've driven by the what-a-burger  for several years now and I have always wanted to stop in. Now I can say I've had it along with the apple pie and have no desire to ever go back! The floors were greasy the doors were filthy and the food bland and took over 10 minutes for a burger and apple pie and fries to come out."}
{"text":"The place itself is nothing to look at, and it even kinda stinks inside,but the people and their kindness to go along with one of greatest burgers made absolutely makes up for the downfalls. The boats of onion rings and fries are to die for! American hasn't seen boats this good since Christopher Columbus landed! Cash only place, that does things the ok fashion way, I like that."}
{"text":"Went here today with my boyfriend and we haven't been in a while. The staff is so sweet and he food is delicious. Will defiantly be back for more food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I got the fish sandwich, I know it's a burger place but I'm trying to eat better. The fish was a fries block, probably worse than the burgers. The kids got a cheeseburger which was good and the hubby also liked his. The place was packed so it was difficult to get a refill on a drink. Bathroom (singular) were dingy but clean for the most part."}
{"text":"I like the no-frills, no-filter, authentically-homegrown spirit of this burger place. Everyone seemed to know one another. I got the cheeseburger with a side of onion rings. My partner-in-dine got the same burger but with a side of fries. We both got cherry lemon sun-drop to drink. The burgers were delicious and juicy. The staff were all friendly.  The interior wasn't all sparkly and immaculate but that didn't bother us at all. It actually gave the place character. I hope to be back and try their hotdog and witch's brew."}
