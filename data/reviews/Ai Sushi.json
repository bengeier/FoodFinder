{"text":"Hip decor, reasonable prices and most importantly FRESH ingredients! What more can one ask for? 

This place has more of a casual fare. You order at the cashier next to the sushi chefs; sit at a table on a stool, and they'll bring you your order along with wooden chopsticks, paper plates and paper cups of water. 

The place seems pretty small and has about 4 communal tables. However, We (group of 6) went at around 2pm on a Saturday and had no trouble finding seats at all. 

Though casual, presentation of the food was pretty!

If you don't live around the area, this place wouldn't catch your eyes and thus harder to find (in the papa chang's plaza). 

I would definitely come back! Next time for their rice bowls! (All under $15!!). Would be a nice choice for a casual date night!"}
{"text":"Superb sushi for a great price. This sit down environment is much more comfortable than some of the other reviews suggests it is."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small, but very clean.  You pay up front and can save on tips.  I tried the chirashi deluxe (which includes Uni) and a set of assorted hand rolls in house.  A few days later, I went back and ordered a take out platter of 80 pieces (under $50) for a friend's dinner.  They loved it too!  Prices are great for what it is."}
{"text":"Great food, great value and awesome services! They prepare everything fresh in the store, nice to have such quality sushi place in the Markham neighbourhood. 

Went on Sunday evening without placing the order in advance, we were told the waiting period would be at least 45 mins. So we decided to come back some other time. Miles sincerely apologized and offered to give extra discount next time.

Came back again tonight, Miles immediately recognized us. He apologized again for Sunday, and gave us an additional 5% off on top of the 10% cash payment discount for our order. Not only that, he treated us with the seaweed salad on the house! :) 

The fish are very fresh, sweet shrimp and squid are fantastic!!! Worth to mention, they also serve hot roasted rice green tea when you dine in, with tea bags for each tea!!! 

The place is clean and nicely decorated with a sweet cozy tone, even the washrooms are super clean, and well designed.

Love the store, love the food, love the price, love the service... I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great prices for great quality. It's definitely not the freshest fish, but it's still really good for what you pay. I kind of wish the seating was a little more comfortable but it's no big deal. It's close by my house which makes it easy for takeout! I also appreciate how they replace fish I don't like! Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer at the restaurant. It's great value for the food, and the quality is decent. However,I returned the other day, my girlfriend orders a $13 item and is able to pay debit, I order a tray for over 3x the price and it is cash only, I have always been able to pay debit (note they don't take credit). Why have a debit option then for select items, just make it completely cash only if that is the case and clearly advertise it as such."}
{"text":"The photos and prior positive reviews were spot on. I ordered takeout yesterday and was impressed with the food quality, portions, and price.  

I ordered the 40-piece maki tray along with the honey mustard roll and AI roll. They were all delicious.

Too much food for my wife and I, there were leftovers. The next morning, I finished off the rolls and I'm happy to report that it was still edible. I've purchased sushi from other restaurants and supermarkets (T&T), and the next morning, you bite into a roll of pasty-stale, rock-hard rice. Disgusting taste and you feel like throwing them into the garbage.

My only complaint is that this restaurant location is waaaaay to far for me (being a resident of downtown Toronto). I will be back for more of your delicious sushi next time I'm in the Markham area though!

**For those of you who were a bit confused as me with their sushi/maki tray menu (aka not knowing what specific rolls were included) check out my photos. They should help you with ordering. Now go enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Great value! Hope they can maintain the quality and size/quantity.

Some items are unbelievably cost effective, and yet the taste and quality are both worth a lot more. Oh I'm just repeating myself about the value being great. 

Nice decor, something new, and definitely very nice for Markham, considering this is a rather quiet area of Markham.

Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Came here 2 times and did 2 take outs, the first time it was to try and we had it in the restaurant and it was about a 20 minute wait for our 40 piece tray. It is pretty good quality for the price. The second time I came in store to eat, I had a massive stomach ache. Cannot for sure say that it was their ingredient but that night I only had their sushi. The second time we did take out, we called before to confirm the order and to notify that we were coming. When we got there they said they missed our order and we had to wait for them to make it there on the spot."}
{"text":"Ai Sushi is really a great place to get higher end quality donburi for take-out.  I have tried both the Deluxe Kaisendon and Deluxe Chirashidon.  Both the variety and the portion of sashimi are quite generous for the donburi.  The deluxe donburi may be a bit pricier but does worth the extra considered it included some premium grade sashimi.   I have ordered few times and both the presentation and taste are consistently great.    

Also, their house rolls are half size roll (4 pieces in each order).  It is a great way to enjoy multiple rolls at the same for smaller order.   I do recommend both their Honey Mustard Roll and Ai Roll.  

I usually order on weekdays and call ahead at least 20 to 30 minutes before pickup to avoid wait time."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out here twice. Great portions for its price. It's a small physical store, with some seatings. So it's a better idea to call for take out. Their Ai maki is tasty!"}
{"text":"Ai Sushi is my go to sushi spot. I mainly go for takeout however they do have sit in as well. The staffs are incredibly nice and there's also a cute photo machine for you to take pictures while you wait. 

Their honey mustard roll is probably my favourite. I've recently visited Hibiki on Highway 7 and realized that the same Botan Ebi that Ai Sushi has is smaller and double the price over there!  

They do get a bit busy so it's always better to order beforehand."}
{"text":"Came here during down time (2:00 pm) so there was no wait. We ordered the deluxe kaisendon, tekkadon, spicy tuna roll and the house honey mustard roll.

Pros:
Price is ridiculously cheap
fish is fresh (certain pieces were slightly lacking)
Good portions, ratio of rice to fish
The sushi rice is very tasty
Service was friendly, maybe because it was during a slow period, but they served us, instead of the intended counter service

Cons:
Ran out of uni on the kaisendon, substituted with scallop (we were allowed to choose)
The food is served in cheap containers (im really nitpicking here)
The big sweet shrimp is slightly not fresh

Overall this place is pretty damn good, especially for the price and I will be back to try a platter and to test them during a busier time."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place. Best sushi I've had in a while. It much better then any sushi restaurant or buffets I've been to I think the flavour is great. The price is good too. The presentation is amazing."}
{"text":"Price is great! However, the sushi rice is tasteless. The taste of rice vinegar is missing!"}
{"text":"The quality of the rolls are pretty good. What's terrible about this place is their customer service. They have inconsistent policies about cash discounts. They said that they only accept cash for platters, apparently that started two weeks ago, which is no true because I ordered a platter just last week and got it. The mid-aged lady handling cash today saw I had cash in my wallet and conveniently said that they only accept cash. 

There have been times they said the wait is two hours.  Seems long. 

These guys need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Great sushi takeout place. Came here for a few times since it opened. Quality is consistent. Its more of a takeout place than done in. However, if you wanted to, there are a few self serve tables for you to use. The fish is very fresh and great variety. If you want, you can customize and order indibidually. However, their platters are ain my opinion, the highlight. They are a great deal. I like how they have platters for just sushi, sashimi or mix of both."}
{"text":"We love coming here for their sushi trays! It's considered cheap and the quality is good. Quick and easy dinner option for when you don't know what to eat."}
{"text":"When you first get to this joint, it's not in the snazziest plaza so you don't expect a whole lot. But this place exceeds first impression. 

First and foremost, it's not the best sit down place but you could comfortably up to a group of 6. There are high tables and bar chairs. 

The food is better than most sushi-to-go places. I got the salmon roe, uni, and shrimp ride bowl and it was a great deal $12.99! Portions are not tiny for that price but don't expect to walk away stuffed."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends to chill and have lunch. The first thing I noticed is the seating. All they have are elevated tables with tall stools; so if you have large jackets, you're either going to have to sit on it or put it on if extra chairs are not an option. Their food is served on plastic containers and a plastic platter if you eat in, which does generate quite a bit of trash and has a cheap kind of feel. However, the flavour of the sushi and the food are no joke. It's definitely very tasty and satisfying for the price you pay. Overall, I would come back.... But perhaps during the summer when I have less to lug around with me."}
{"text":"I literally just finished placing my order and I am so appalled at their service that I am writing this review immediately. 

We are frequent customers at this place for takeout of party trays, we order at least once a week since they opened. I am absolutely disappointed with their customer services. Their service has gotten quite arrogant and snobby (at least over the phone). I don't know if this has to do with their increase popularity that they don't care any more cause they know they have the constant sales. However, this is not how you should treat your loyal customers as this is what helps you to maintain a business. 

Long story short:
1. Cut me off before I could finish my order 
2. Lady that picks up the phone doesn't understand English and made the situation very frustrating 
3. Called back to finish up placing my order and all of the sudden they decided to charge me extra $ for the previous changes after I made a complaint about the lady. 

Honestly I don't mind the extra charge but a) ordered many times and there wasn't a $1 charge/ change \"protocol\" and b) not a smart move to charge your customer extra when the customer is already angry at the fact you cut her off the phone. 

This one star is for their service solely. For their sushi's I probably give it a 2.5 star, not spectacular but it does the sushi fix. However their quality and freshness has been decreasing since last year."}
{"text":"Not the greatest quality, not the worst, but definitely reasonable for the price. Had the 60 pcs assorted sashimi/sushi/maki roll combo for $38, which was mostly maki rolls and sushi, salmon carpaccio ($6) and beef tataki ($6). The rolls aren't overly stuffed with rice, which is nice. I'd say the quality is a bit above typical AYCE, and I'd be willing to drop on a random day for a quick and cheap sushi meal. Next time, I'll have to try the Hokkaidon with salmon roe, uni, and sweet shrimp ($12.99) or Deluxe Chirashidon ($13)!
Tip: There are about 4-5 tables with bar seats that can seat about four people per table. Be prepared to either wait for a seat, cafeteria-style, or take your sushi home. Ai closes at 10pm, with last call at 9:30pm."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place for pickup. Have never had a problem with freshness here. So far have only gotten the 60 piece sushi platter and have no complaints! I always order with plenty of time, I just tell them what time I am picking up and have never had to wait. Next time I will try a smaller platter with some specialty rolls to see how they are!"}
{"text":"I've pick up some sushi at Ai sushi twice now and I'm pretty impressed. The fish was pretty fresh and beautifully presented. I loved the variety of sushi on the platter and it was super easy ordering through phone and picking up. I didn't need to wait super long and it was packed and ready to go each time. 
Yes. Fast. Bless."}
{"text":"Ordered a few times from this place and it's always 2 large party trays and always paid cash to receive the discount. I received a discount card through one of the owners which was 10% off. I placed an order today and asked them the offer, the guy on the phone said if you paid cash will receive 10% off, I then asked if the discount card is applicable and it's not asked if I can use visa with discount card guy said no only debit or cash. Went to pick up the food and the guy said I can't use debit with discount card and that I have to pay cash. What is the point for this discount card??? I understand Visa or MC the store pays terminal fees but I'm paying with debit. Spent 40min looking for a bank and driving through traffic. If you receive a discount card just throw it in the garbage! Horrible communication with very little understanding of customer service. Will be going to different place from now on."}
{"text":"Seat yourself, pretty small restaurant, packed plaza so can be difficult to find parking. Not mandatory to tip, there's a jar if you want. Can order ahead to pickup and go. 

100 pieces for $65 (after tax) - average quality, doesn't taste too fresh but it's still good. Comes with sashimi and sushi pieces. Fed the 5 of us well, decent food for decent prices.

Keeping things simple, using plastic lids as plates to cut cost. 

**don't look like a fool, their washroom doors are push and not slide**"}
{"text":"Decent quality of sushi but that is reflected in the lower prices. Wait time was about 1/2 hour for a medium sushi tray despite it being late peak hour (around 7:30-8 PM or so on a Friday evening). Limited seating indoors, highly recommend calling ahead to place an order and expect to do take out."}
{"text":"This is definitely more of a takeout place than a sit in place for sushi. Everything you order comes in take out containers. If you want to sit in, they will serve you hot water, wasabi, soya sauce, and give you paper plates for your food. They will also serve the food to your table. Place is very small and when arrive, you pretty much have to order first then seat yourself. Limited tables, I believe there was only 5 tables all together. The chairs are stools style so no where to put your belongings especially during the winter days with your chunky jackets. This place is also cash/debit only. They stated on their menu that it's only cash for party tray/platter orders.

We ordered the 60 pieces combination of sushi and sashimi platter ($40) and Ai Sushi roll ($5.99) for 4 chunky pieces. Comparing the price and it's quality, I thought it was pretty decent. 

Overall, I feel very neutral about this place. It is not bad but it isn't amazing to me either. Plaza is also very small so limited parking spots. I highly recommend to go early so you can find a spot and a seat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I have bought sushi trays from Ai Sushi for a few times.  I've finally decided to come by and eat in.  I was pleasantly surprised even though it's entirely a take out place with a few tables on the side.  As the staff explains, it's like a sushi equivalent of a Subway where you take your order and sit down. As a result, the prices are quite a bit cheaper. 

Ai Sushi is in a small plaza which offers more than enough parking. The decor is pretty bright and clean with wooden walls and tables. The front section has a fridge for drinks and seaweed salad and other miscellaneous things. They also have a free photobooth here, which is a new thing for any restaurant I've been to. 

The menu has your standard rolls and sushi platters. There are no bento boxes but they do have some donburi options. On average their prices are quite cheap ($5.99 for a roll that could be $10 bucks elsewhere). Quality is surprisingly good for the price you pay. In a big platter there are even shrimp and scallop sashimi! On a side note, on one occasion we ordered a platter as well as shrimp sashimi on the side, and the side order or shrimp sashimi was noticeably larger (at least 1.5x) than the ones in the platter. 

Other than that, the staff are mostly young and very friendly. Overall very pleased with this find in Markham. It's definitely now become my go-to place for take outs."}
{"text":"At first I didn't know that it is a pick up place and not the kind of restaurant that I can sit down for a meal and have a waiter or waitress to serve me. As seen in the picture, I ordered a tray of sea urchins, a Hokkaido don, 2 orders of salmon sushi and an order of scallop sushi. 

I love the salmon sushi . They look attractive and fresh. Indeed, they are fresh and tasty. Scallop sushi is not bad neither. The sea urchins are kind of small in size. I believe they are another type of sushi. A tray of sea urchins cost $39.99 and they came from Boston. To my personal taste, the flavour is not as strong as the big one. I like the big one better. These small ones do not have much flavour and the colour looks a bit dull. 

The Hakkaido Don which has rice at the bottom and 3 pieces of sweet shrimp and some fish roes and sea urchins on top of the rice. When you open the lid of the container, you can smell a bit fishy. The shrimps taste good and so as the fish roes and the sea urchins (if you are ok with the mild flavour) if you don't mind the fishy smell, it's not a strong smell though. 

I guess I will come back for salmon sushi ......just my personal choice"}
{"text":"Decent place, nice decor, nice ambiance and looks clean. Food decent nothing out of the ordinary. Ordered Hokkaidon cause noticed in their cooler stacks of uni in trays so i figured should be fresh. Wrong, its boarderline of being bad to rotten. Also ordered maki and delux Chirashidin they're fine. Its really hard to find places that have really fresh uni and this place is not one of them. Better go further southwest on 16th if you are craving for one. Other than that food is decent just keep away from uni."}
{"text":"Ai Sushi is officially my favourite japanese takeout place now.

Been here a few times for platters and was craving a chirashi today so decided to give it a try.

They have improved a lot since my first review.  The order was prompt, variety of fish served was great (uni, hamachi, huge sweet shrimp, scallop, etc.) and the price is better than other restaurants because they focus more on take out than sit in. 

I plan to visit a lot more often as I love their deluxe kaisedon (12 pcs sashimi on rice).  The honey mustard roll tasted great as well and was only $5 (4pcs)."}
{"text":"Although they are far from me, I am happy to make the trek up for their sushi because they are fresh, delicious and very well priced. I've been here probably a dozen times or so and they have never failed me. Their sushi is always consistent but the only down side is you always have to call way ahead or else it'll be eons before you get your order. Yes, they can get that busy.

Their sit down can be tricky because it's like food court style. If you plan on dining in, getting a table can take a while especially if you're coming with a bigger group so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely affordable and has all sorts of items you would not expect from a mainly take out sushi place. Sea Urchin, Salmon Roe, and deliciously sweet scallops are all on the menu at bargain prices. I honestly have no idea how they put the prices so low. 

I recommend the deluxe Kaisendon if you're dining alone, and if in a group you can order their large platters. For best results, call ahead of time and get it preordered so you don't have to wait when you pick up. If I lived closer, I would definitely go all the time! For more pics, visit my blog on my profile page."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times over the last 1.5 yr and it has progressively gotten worse every time. The quality was always just average but today was borderline fresh. Today's order will be the last time we order from them. The sashimi wasn't even cut properly to the point where there were five pieces of fish still attached to each other. The scallop sashimi were not fresh. The avocado used to top the roll was brown. The rolls were cut very unevenly. It was just very sloppy."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of AI Sushi, and get take out here usually twice a week.

Top 3 things I love about AI:
- Premium and fresh cuts of fish (Hamachi, Toro, Scallop, big Shrimp, Uni, etc.) in their Deluxe Kaisedon, and the AI Roll/Torched Salmon Roll
- Fast and efficient takeout when you order ahead
- Very convenient location
- Good price for the quality

I like the new location even better because it's more spacious inside and picking up takeout was super fast and seamless. 

Great job so far with the soft opening!"}
{"text":"Quick fix around the neighborhood. Don't expect to be able to wow you.

Sushi and sashimi wasn't the best tasting. Like salmon has no salmon fatty omega 3 taste, albacore tuna doenst taste like tuna. Anyway.. For the price and for my laziness for not wanted to drive too far... I Can't complain. 

I would get sashimi over sushi. Fish is fresh. Just not the highest grade but not like bad tasting stuff. I can make rice or sushi rice at home and make my own sushi or chirashi. 

Worth trying.. I got take out like 3 times already. 

*Open till 10 pm. Only accepts cash or debit!! *"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good sushi! Very fresh and I love the spicy salmon rolls! For sushi platters, they have Variety of choices to choose from with affordable price!"}
{"text":"Purely All You Can Eat sushi grade, some piece even below par.  No idea why some people gave this place 3 stars or above!! The rice are hot, and actually self cooking the fish inside the take out box. There should be an option for zero or negative, this place definitely belongs there !!"}
{"text":"I'm always down to try a good bowl of rice and fresh sashimi. I was so excited to see pictures of different donburi (or rice bowl) with different sorts of sashimi combinations from this restaurant! Saw so many good reviews on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try. On Yelp it says it's a small place, with only a couple tables to sit at. So we decided to go there right at lunch time (it opens at 11am!). There were already people sitting but we got a spot right away. It was a snowy day, so I guess that's why there was still seats. They have this kawaii chalk board drawing, you will see it the moment you enter. So cute I loved it!! Everything is made to order (obviouslyyy) so there is a bit of a wait. I got the Hokkaidon because it has EVERYTHING I LOVE. Botan ebi (giant sweet shrimp), ikura (salmon roe), and uni (sea urchin). How could I NOT order that right?!  Everything was very fresh, I was pretty impressed. The rice was just lightly seasoned, although I prefer more of the \"vinegary\" taste to my rice when eating with sashimi. One thing that bothered me was the botan ebi (giant sweet shrimp) the veins were still completely intact.  I've never actually had shrimp sashimi with the colon/vein still intact. I was really disappointed. We had to remove all the veins ourselves before eating it. 
My fiancé ordered the regular Chirashi-don. It was beautifully plated, with all the different colours of the sashimi!! So pretty  He was the opposite of me, and loved the lightly seasoned rice, and also agreed that the sashimi was very fresh!!  His only problem, was the same as mine; shrimp sashimi with the intestinal tract still intact.  Other than that, he really enjoyed it and also would like to try their rolls!! 

Everything else tasted amazing. But I just really hope this restaurant learns to devein shrimp, because I don't think people want to eat shrimp colon... but I definitely would still like to try their rolls!! They look really good (I was creeping on the other tables with my hungry eyes as I waited for my food )"}
{"text":"I ordered a party tray of sashimi and sushi for my daughters birthday party. The price was great and the quality of amazing. I thought the sashimi is very fresh. I'm so glad it's close by us and this will be our go to sushi joint. Forgot to mention that there's limited seating inside, 4 bar tables that seat 4 and a long table. It's mostly for take out orders but the atmosphere is still very welcoming and warm. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've almost given up on any amazing sushi on the north east corner of Markham ... And this new place might give me some hope.  Right off the bat, this place doesn't want you to sit down. It's a small place designed mostly for take out. You order, you pay, you leave or sit and eat on one of their few tables. Don't expect any complimentary green tea ($1?!) or anything and I was bemused when the credit card machine prompted me for a tip. That's really my only big beef against this place. The sushi is above average compared to other sushi places in the area and their prices (especially on platters) are very competitive. I had one of their chirashi meals and it was prepared more expertly than average. They also offer a 10% cash discount (which they should really advertise more) that will keep me coming back.  This place is really more of a 3 or 3.5 star place, but the standards of sushi in this corner of Markham are pretty low. If they keep up the quality and competitive prices, I can see this place doing well."}
{"text":"Terrible services,I ordered a party tray for my kid and ask for non raw Assorted Roll, when I back home I figured out most of them are raw roll. When I call them back and reflect my opinion to them and ask for exchange . They attitude are extremely bad. 
WON'T order anymore in future even another store where located Markham Rd & 16th"}
{"text":"This place has great potential to bring its restaurant to a higher review for me. One of the biggest areas for improvement is sustainability.

Having ordered in with no intention of takeout, I was surprised to see that our miso soups were served in large styrofoam containers. In addition to that our sushi was all served in plastic trays, including the soya sauce. Having such a nice interior I was disappointed that the full ambience was not there. This restaurant is currently generating a lot of waste, so I would think that economically and aesthetically they should consider changing. 

The Kaisendon was actually delicious with great quality fish including shrimp and ikuri, which is usually reserved for more expensive chirashi don dishes. I was very impressed with this dish. 

The honey mustard roll and orange dragon roll were okay, but did not go above and beyond. They just seemed like they were trying to be too different with their maki roll ingredients, but it did not work for me.

I hope next time I return they will have real dishes... Here's hoping!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for lunch on a weekday here, so my experience may be a bit different from those who ordered during dinner hours. 

I called when they opened at 11am to place an order for a Kaisendon and told them I'd be by at 12 to pick it up. The food was ready when I got there. When I got home, I was happy with how good the food looked. The fish seemed like to be quality as well. Also, for $10.99, I'd say that the Kaisendon was a great deal. 12 pieces of sashimi on a bed of rice, but they included shrimp sashimi as well! Very nice. 

I'm excited to try their rolls next time."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and the priceses are very reasonable!! Amazing place for take out or just quick food. Very clean and the staff are very friendly. You should definitely check this place out specially if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Really loving store. Have sweet shrimp sushi and tuna sashimi, the price is inexpensive."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. Poor sashimi quality, fatty, lots of tendons, get what you pay for. Maki rolls were good. This visit was meh, my last visit the quality was better. 

For dine in everything is disposable and they give you plastic container lids to eat from as plates. I Called ahead 30 mins on Thursday evening, still had to wait for our order, lots of people were calling for takeout. Customer service is fair. I had the sashimi-sushi-maki platter 40pcs for $28.

This is the Sushi Bing of the North but quality is not as good."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for Ai Sushi. Their takeout sushi and sashimi platters are definitely good value for your money, and the quality of the fish is on point! If you are getting takeout make sure you call to place an order in advance - their phone was pretty much ringing the whole time when I was there! Busy busy.

We were feeling hungry so for the two of us we got the $30 platter with 40 pieces of sushi and sashimi as well as the Hokkaidon for $15 which is a donburi (rice bowl) with shrimp, uni, and salmon roe. Everything tasted delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Our friends introduced us to this little gem (Markham location) We ate here on Good Friday and for takeout sushi it was amazingly fresh and better value compared to ACYE. Quality and quantity. We ordered 702 and 708. Would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"Ordered take out on Monday for the sushi, sashimi and roll combo (704) it was very disappointed.  The sashimi was not fresh nor the rolls. I had to trash some of the sushi away because it's tasted off."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

Newly opened Japanese quick serve restaurant owned by Chinese folks. Seating is limited as it is more of a takeout joint. You essentially order at the counter and they will bring you a tray with your food. 

The Good:
- Extensive menu with very reasonable prices.
- Chirashidon has a decent selection of sashimi. 
- Dragon roll was well prepared with clean knife work.

The Bad:
- According to their definition of a quick serve concept, it meant that there would not be any hot tea or water served. Water and soft drinks are available at additional cost. I would recommend them to at least have a self serve hot tea / water station for a better customer experience.
- Sushi rice lacked vinegar flavour across the board and also came out a bit dry for the Chirashidon.
- Skip the uni if you're used to eating the good stuff as the ones here are quite fishy and pungent.

Feel free to give this place a try if you are in the area and looking to grab a quick bite or takeout to satisfy your cravings without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Nice take out sushi place! glad to have such a new spot in Markham.

Lots of fish roe on the California roll."}
{"text":"It's like Markham's version of Sushi Bong in terms of price point, except a bigger interior and smaller roll sizes.  But you get affordable sushi to satisfy that craving without breaking the wallet.  I frequented places like Gal's Sushi and Mine Sushi when in Markham, but this place will be my new go-to when it comes to getting some sushi without breaking the bank.  

As others have said, the platters are recommended; a good portion and price if you're looking to bring something for a potluck.  

No credit cards accepted here."}
{"text":"Purchased a 60 Roll Assorted combo for 38$ for a Christmas potluck. Excellent value and tasted great, it was a hit! It's cash only though so be prepared."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 
Service: 4/5
Note: Cash Only For Platter

This is a new place for Delicious, Fresh and Affordable sushi in Richmond Hill On Leslie St & Elgin Mills.  It is definitely a take out or quick lunch/dinner because the place is quite small, cool design with different wood pattern on the wall. 
We ordered $30 platter and it took around 15 min for preparing 40pcs of assorted sashimi/ sushi and rolls, good portion for 2 people.  We liked all pieces except Tuna sushi (probably, i am not big fan of red Tuna), everything else tastes delicious and decent sushi rolls, Can`t complain much for the price."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this place a few times now. Unfortunately, other than the price, there is not much to write home about. 

Here are the few incidents I had
- ordered a 30 piece assorted sashimi and got 26 pieces (normally don't count the pieces, but it was easy to see some missing as the sashimi were grouped together). Called them and they did corrected the issue by providing more piece, even more the missing 4 pieces. Good job.

- ordered for 6:45pm pick up, arrived at 6:40pm and did not get the platter until closer to 7pm. What's more annoying is that I saw the customers before me got offered VIP discount card and we were offered nothing in compensation for the extra wait time

- related to previous one, ordered for 5:15pm, arrived 5:45pm (my fault for being late). However, I was told that my platter was given to another customer as I was late. What's the point of have a pick up time if you have to wait regardless being early, on-time or late? I am not sure how they can just give my order out another customer.

Maybe for the price, I should not expecting any service.
Again, food is ok. Price is good. Service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Compared to the other Ai sushi on 16th, the fish slices are thinner and less generous.  I was originally attracted to Ai Sushi because their portions were very generous and fresh for a great price (at least for the Markham location).  I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"I heard good things a about this place so I wanted to try it  out. We ordered the 100 piece for $60 + hst party tray. 

This place is busy and does a lot of take out orders so I recommend calling ahead of time. 

I would say the sushi is pretty good and decent quality. The fish was fresh and the rolls tasted good. You get what you pay for. There really isn't a variety of fish but the staples like salmon, white tuna, shrimp, surf clam etc. 

There wasn't a lot of variety in the rolls either. Most tasted like California roll with different sauces inside.

I would say if you want cheap good sushi to feed a lot of people this place is great! If you want more variety in fish like herring, shrimp sashimi in the trays you should probably order elsewhere.
 
Downside - they don't give you ginger with the sushi."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, but left feeling disappointed. The place itself is small and cute and it seems to be more of a take out spot.  The quality of sushi is terrible, but I should have expected that considering the price. I ordered the hakkaidon and my husband ordered the deluxe chirashi. My bowl came with salmon roe, uni and botan ebi and looked deceivingly delicious. Everything had an old fishy and bitter taste to it that I couldn't finish it. I absolutely LOVE uni and ebi, but these were of the worst quality I've ever had. This bowl was $12.99 and I should have known that it was too good to be true. My husband's chirashi was just as bad. I tried some of his salmon and scallop and I had to give it back to him. This is a place if you want cheap sushi that tastes cheap. Thinking about my experience makes me nauseous that I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"2nd time to Ai sushi, 1st experienced was pretty good service wise only, as for food was average. Ordered the sushi sashimi tray #707 80pcs for $48 plus tax, sushi was alright but sashimi wasn't as fresh. But giving benefit of a doubt maybe it's due to new business opening so we decided to give it a 2nd try a month after today with the same sushi sashimi tray. Boy are we disappointed!! Maki roll were all falling apart, cuts were uneven some were overly big and some small. But that's not the bad part. Snapper sashimi were bad and inedible, color was on a dull brown. Had to throw it all out. Salmon wasn't as fresh either but it's edible only having to spit few scales out as  you go through only 6 pieces.  I can say it's our last time to this sushi joint."}
{"text":"Can I rate it lower than a 1 star pleaseeee? 

I ordered ahead for pick up they said 15 minutes and when I got there it was as if they just then remembered they had to make an order. They started making everything when I got there. What was the point of calling in..

My main issue with this place is their Salmon. I've tried a spicy Salmon Roll as well as a Philadelphia Roll. And out of the 4 times I've ordered from here every. single. time. I had fat in my Salmon :/ 

I'm attaching a gruesome picture of this horrid fat/blubber I had to see in my rolls.

I gave them so many chances because they're so close, but I can't do it anymore I'm never eating here again. This is the only place of all the 10's of sushi joints I've been to, where I had to experience this. I'm scarred."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering and I'm really taking a chance by ordering a large quantity. I placed an order for the 100 piece assorted sushi, sashimi and rolls platter.  To my surprise I did not get 100 pieces.  There was only 97 pieces.  Do they skim a few pieces from every large platter order hoping their customers won't notice?  The sashimi is sliced too thinly and very small.  I'm disappointed that I did not get exactly what I ordered.  I'll go back to my tried and true sushi joints as Ai Sushi has left me with ill feelings of being ripped off, even if it is 3 missing pieces."}
{"text":"Grabbed take out from here for lunch today.

The food here is quite good.   Ordered a few platters and rolls for take out.   Called in the order but wait time was quite long (waited 45 minutes).   Shipment i think was running late cause they did try to call back saying they would be late but i was already on route.   The fish is definatetly really fresh, as when i got there the chef just pulled a fresh fish from their cooler and was breaking it down.

Price is really good for what you get.   The attached pictures will show what i got for under $100.  Staff was very apologetic about the weight.   Dont think this would happen normally but not a good time to happen at noon during lunch service.   Staff through in a complimentary seaweed salad for the wait and kept checking on me and apologizing.   

Would definately give them another shot, still lots to try on their menu."}
{"text":"Tried ai sushi as a friend recommended it. The sushi was surprisingly fresh and delicious. The rice was made just the way I liked it . My gf and I got the 40 piece sashimi, sushi, and roll platter for $25. The sushi was made much better than most ayce. Fantastic value. Will definately go back."}
{"text":"Great place & price point for takeout sushi/sashimi! Good party trays for family & large groups of people to please all. Clean minimalist modern decor with high top tables available for sit in as well. Overall good choice for a quick Japanese fix anytime any day!"}
{"text":"Wow, Ai Sushi has officially succeeded other Jap restaurants as my new favourite sushi takeout place! 

I came here after work last week and ordered the hokkaidon as well as 2 a la carte orders of hotategai (scallop) sushi. Portion sizes were fair, prices were fair, and both orders were yummy! The quality of the seafood was fresh and I had no complaints.

Side note: I also went to the Markham location (16th Ave/Markham Rd) a few days later to get the 60pc assorted platter and it effectively satisfied and filled me and my boyfriend up for $40 plus tax. The variety of the platter was relatively \"basic\" - you get your typical spicy salmon roll, cucumber roll, one of the dragon rolls, tuna/salmon/snapper/sashimi, artificial crab meat/shrimp sushi - but the quality was great and if you're not looking for any \"wow factor\", it was definitely well worth it!"}
{"text":"**Pick Up** 

Called in to pick up a platter in a hour when I arrived they had it ready

Quality was above average but wasn't anything special
Fish was fresh though, salmon was my favourite cut. 

Rolls were very generic again nothing special. I'll try their specialty rolls ones day.

Price is cheap, platters are priced below average price in the city. Perfect for bringing to parties and pot lucks. 

Will be back since the value is so good here"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi especially considering the price point. Ordered a 60 pc sashimi/roll platter ($40), enough to satisfy the cravings of my brother and myself. Definitely did not skimp on the fish and sushi as the cuts were thick and sushi rolls were not just filled with rice. Favs were the special rolls (red & green dragon) for me. 

Make sure to call in advance because they do get busy - it was a 1.5 hr wait for me on a Saturday night. Did still have to wait a bit after and it was clear I wasn't the only one. There was a family seated but as others have said, mainly a take out location. Will be back for more platters!"}
{"text":"Saw couple of reviews online about this place and want to give it a try. Ordered the 100 pieces of sushi and sashimi trey. The sashimi is ok, but the sushi rice felt like lack of vinegar. Not bad for the price around $66 tax in. Ordered thru phone and able to pickup in 15 mins. If you need a quick fixed on sushi craving, this place should help. Will return for more"}
{"text":"Nice take out place for this area, a breathe of fresh air! Great customer service, charged me incorrectly so that was a hassle but offered free drinks to make it up. Got 3 rolls to try out and were all made with extremely fresh fish. Be careful of the wait time, even though I only ordered just three rolls, it still took 20+ minutes even with no orders in front of me. Has potential in the future to be an amazing place with great food, but still need to work out their logistics more."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi take out. I have been there 3 times so far, first 2 times are awesome. Quick, good quality and good price. However, my 3rd time wasn't that great. The presentation is totally a mess and quality has dropped significantly."}
{"text":"Picked up a small platter, cucumber maki and Botan shrimp.  The platter was superb, as always but the other 2 items were dissapointing.  The cucumber maki were falling apart(see pic) and looked bad.  The botan shrimp, we ordered because they were out of sweet shrimp.  It was $8 for 3 pieces, they looked large but they weren't fresh.  They had a really bad fishy smell and we couldn't eat them.  I didn't want to waste them, so I cooked them in some garlic butter, but my son still wouldn't touch them.  

I went back today because we'd ordered a large sushi and sashimi platter for today.  I still think the platters  are delicious and value for money(even though prices have increased), but I'd be hesitant to order other items."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

This is an interesting place. It's mainly a take out looking restaurant, however there are 5 rows of seats for eat in. 
I ordered the Hokkaidon. Which is made up of Uni, Salmon roe and, Botan ebi (large sweet shrimp) on top of rice topped with Japanese marinaded dashi (yellow radish). The quality of the fish is very good. The Uni was very fresh and my husband who does not like salmon roe scarfed it all down. The shrimp was a bit of a hit and miss. Of the 3 pieces you may get one that's not so great. For the price and location you really can't ask for much more. It's Chinese run, which bumps my stars up a bit as usually the fish isn't as great as the traditional Japanese run restaurants. This little place sticks out on price and freshness. My don was only 12.99!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an off day. But found the quality rather disappointing, but the presentation was nice. Ordered a sushi/sashimi platter. Other than the salmon many of the other fishes included in the platter was rather chewy and some even fishy."}
{"text":"Best take out in North Markham. Sashimi is very fresh.. high quality sushi. Platter gas lots of choices. Price is fair."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a friend and decided to give it a try. It's a small shop with a few long tables and bar stool chairs. It was a Saturday night and there were 5 people making the sushi and one person at cash. The place is very clean. They don't do delivery and it's cash only. No debit. They've been opened for 4 to 5 months. We ordered the salmon sushi roll 6 pieces for $3.00 a that was a really good deal so we got two rolls. 
We also ordered the 503 honey mustard roll (shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, avocado and topped with torch salmon) and 507 orange dragon roll (shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber and avocado). Both rolls were really good. The platter was the best deal i've seen anywhere for $48.00 you get 80 pieces with a mixture of sushi and sashimi. I was really impressed with the quality and the portion sizes. They are generous with their rolls. I'd definitely return to this place and maybe dine in instead next time."}
{"text":"Deceiving prices. Sure their items are about half the price of most sushi places, but their portion sizes are also only half as big! I ended up paying $16 for two minuscule rolls and a can of iced tea. Literally looked like two little side dishes...For that price I could've gotten great lunch deals at other restaurants, or an AYCE lunch buffet for a few more bucks."}
{"text":"Platters are great for take out. Great quality! Please note sometimes on weekends it can take 1-1.5hrs for pick up. They're super busy!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but this time this place got me a little ticked off. I went in today at around 3pm ordering 100 pieces of assorted. When it's time to pay I was told cash only. I usually don't have a problem paying with cash but nothing was posted in the store saying cash only. Another thing was I clearly see a debit or credit card machine right at the cashier. Good thing I had cash on hand ,othwrwise I'd have to drive out to get cash. 
When it was time to pick up, I went in at 7 and guess what? Sushi is not ready. I literally waited 20 mins in the store waiting for them to finish up.
So I read some people counted the pieces to make sure there's the actual amount. Long and behold there's only 94 pieces and not 100. 
Food is just soso. Tasted kind of like the ayce places. Price is pretty cheap and that's all it's really good about. I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"3.5 Interesting find this weekend. Small joint on 16 and main st, best for takeout. Their sushi is super fresh and the price is very affordable compared to the other sushi joints in Markham. I ordered the mixed sashimi and sushi platter (60 piece) for $38!! And the hokkaidon donburi $13 (sweet shrimp with uni and roe on rice) the uni was very fresh however the roe was very salty.. not sure  What happened there. I also tried the mustard roll, was delicious served with torched salmon and drizzled with mustard sauce, definitely a must try. As far as the platter goes, the sashimi was well worth it however I find the rolls kind of basic (cucumber avocado rolls, California rolls). I would love to try just the sashimi only platter next, seems like more variety and better cuts. Will be back again for take out."}
{"text":"I was hungry and in the area on a Tuesday night around 9pm before a soccer game.  I saw this place on Yelp beforehand and was enticed by the cheap pricing.

I decided to order a dynamite and red dragon roll which worked out to be ~$12.  The rolls were small and smothered with sauce (Refer to pics). I think I counted 9 small rolls in total.  I was not impressed.

I will, however, give this place another chance for its nigiri sushi/chirashi.

This place has made me a lot more grateful for places like Sushi Bong and VIPS.  Furthermore, I propose that \"Ai Sushi\" be renamed to \"Alright Sushi\"."}
{"text":"Ai Sushi is an excellent place to go to for sushi platters if you're around Richmond Hill/Markham! I was on Yelp on a Saturday night looking for some quality places to get sushi takeout and stumbled upon this gem. They currently have a \"Platter Series\" deal going on and it's pretty worth it in my opinion. You can either get assorted sashimi, assorted rolls, or an assorted sashimi/sushi/roll mix. You can also get these if you choose to dine in as well - there are a few tables inside with a very casual atmosphere. 

I opted for the assorted sashimi/sushi/roll mix because I enjoy the variety. Everything I got in my platter was just delicious! There were two of us, and we ordered the 60pcs for $40. While we were able to finish everything, we had to kind of force ourselves near the end, so I'd recommend getting only 40pcs ($30) for two people unless you're SUPER hungry. There was a fair share of sashimi, sushi, and rolls - all items were fresh and great quality so no complaints there. 

I would definitely come back for another platter! This place has some of the deals I've seen in the area."}
{"text":"For the price of the sushi, it would be four stars. Ai Sushi has the option of take out or sit in. Sitting in, they would give you some hot tea or water. 

AI sushi is always busy with a lot of people ordering take out, it's recommended that you call in advance so you won't have to wait there for a long time. Their wait time is fairly fast though, you can probably pick it up after fifteen minutes of ordering unless they have an unusually large order.

I recommend ordering their large platters as you will get the best value for these items. 16 pieces of assorted sashimi is $15, but if you order 30 pieces, it's $28, they also have options for 50 or 80 pieces.

The best value in my opinion, is the assorted sushi and sashimi rolls (100 pieces for $60). It's a great option if you can share this with friends and family members, and they give you a large assortment of the sushi. The quality of the sushi isn't AMAZING, but it's definitely better than AYCE sushi restaurants, and it's one of the cheaper options to go to in the area!"}
{"text":"Good price quality ratio. Deluxe kaisendon and hokkaidon were very good. Great place to satisfy a need for sashimi"}
{"text":"So glad there's a good sushi place in the neighborhood! Came here as a recommendation from a family member. Came for a quick lunch..but was surprised! Definitely not a dine-in restaurant (yet!). No tea or water  is served with your meal (extra $).  Seems like it might be a take-out concept. They're still on their soft opening, so I'm sure lots will change :)

Ordered 2 rolls and a sashimi bowl. Was happy with the quality and pricing! Will definitely be back!

Tip - 10% off when paying cash."}
{"text":"I must reiterate what some others have already commented. Looks good but in person freshness is just not up to par. Tried to eat the chirashi bowl and had to pick out 4 pcs of fish that smelled off. There's a lack of finesse and care in the dish throughout. Just never again for me. Quantity over quality though if that's what you like then give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for both affordable and quality sushi in Markham any day of the week.

The deluxe kaizendon is my all-time favorite, as it includes fresh uni. My fiancé usually dislikes uni as it has the fishy smell and taste, but he actually comes here for the uni!

Order takeout (fast food style) or eat-in, the quality is top notch every time. Try it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"This place is really popular.  Do I really mean that, yes, because there was a wait to order, as well as a wait for food. Located at Leslie & Elgin Mills (same plaza as the CIBC drive thru), this is the second branch of Ai Sushi. It's spacious, and brand spanking new with high ceilings. We got there around 7:30 after failing to attend J'adore Hotpot's grand opening special.. We ordered the 40 pc assorted sushi-sashimi platter, along with the 60 pc platter. Our friend had the VIP card, which entitled us to 10% off. They don't accept card for the platters so make sure you bring some ahead of time, or use the ATM outside. 

Their 40 pcs platter came with: salmon, tuna, sweet shrimp, octopus, surf clam, and one or two more fish that my friends devoured before I could do a mental note. 

The 60 piece platter came with assorted rolls which I would say are comparable to Sushi Bong's massive size, but definitely better in terms of quality. The ingredients didn't fall out nor was the rice mushy. Most of the rolls had avocado in them, which for me is a solid statement of higher quality. 

Drinks are self serve once you pay for them. They had an assortment of pop, San Pellegrino, aloe..There was a nice server who brought our pitcher of water to the table while we were dining, and the cutlery. He also gave us a seaweed salad on the house because our wait was so long. There is enough dining space for about 25 people. They also have a display window of uni by the cash register, very tempting if you're feeling fancier that day.

For $100 between 6 of us, we all left feeling stuffed. The sashimi quality was fabulous and definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Got the chirashidon and it was delicious - fresh fish and great value. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for takeout sushi in East Markham without breaking the bank, then come no further, Ai Sushi is the place. Essentially this place can be summed up as good sushi for a great price. There is a great pleasure eating sushi at home (doing whatever you want) and not having to worry about service and tips.

After hearing about the problems with some of the wait times, I proceeded to place a lunch order and there were no hiccups at all. I specified what platter I wanted to be picked up at 12:30, arrived there and promptly got my order. Simple enough!  

I ordered the 60 pieces assorted platter and was quite satisfied. It was $43 with taxes. Now that's a pretty good deal around these parts! There were no real problems with the sushi, you get what you pay for afterall. This is decent, average sushi. You're not going to be wow'ed (maybe except with the price!). The rice is good, the fish is relatively fresh (and not spoiled), and the selection was okay. You get your standard salmon (better than I expected), your albacore tuna, and red snappers for your sashimi and sushi, which is decent. You also get your standard special rolls that always seem to have the California roll inside them. 

Combined with my own sushi green tea at home, this was quite the enjoyable meal. I'll definitely be back at Ai Sushi in the future for some simple takeout sushi."}
{"text":"This company does not seek improvement. 
First time I ordered takeout from the Richmond Hill location a while back and it was bad enough. Fish dried out, rice too soft. We literally threw the order away after a few bites.
 But a couple of my friends recommended the 16th/markham road location so thought we would give it a second try. We ordered the 100pieces sashimi/sushi/roll combo plus 2 side orders or Hamachi sashimi. Hamachi as a side ordered was like below average the all-you-can eat quality. Again rice was still too soft and mushy (though not like babyfood rice like the first time ordered, I guess that is an improvement). Note that upon ordering I had mentioned to the lady on the phone that please make sure the rice is not too soft as that was what happened before. 
I am guessing if you know the owners you would get better food but as a random customer no need to bother with this place."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place really fresh more of a take out place bit has seating decor is nice except for the big ugly fridges up front.  Good is also rolls come in 4pc so can try more kinds.  Will try again for sure."}
{"text":"Their sushi isn't bad actually. We got the rolls platter and it had 40 pcs for $22. I mean, that's the cheapest it gets. We ordered on the spot and it was made around 10 mins. Some reviews says their salmon is fatty. I guess it is a little but I honestly didn't realize it while eating. Their ingredients are pretty fresh and their rolls were pretty big. I think they put a lot of mayonnaise on their rolls but that can always be asked not to put on. Will be back for their platters for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I was impressed! The sashimi was super fresh and the price was reasonable. We got a 30 piece sashimi set for $28, a tofu salad for $5 (the tofu salad dressing was so good), a mango tango roll ($8 for 4 pieces), uni (half tray for $20), and a 16 piece sushi roll set for $12. Overall, I think this place is reasonably priced as al the fish was top quality. 

This place is somewhat like a food court. You order your stuff at the cashier and you find a seat by yourself. But the staff there delivers the food to your table if you tell them where you sit, which was nice.  I find that the fish might be even better quality than a lot of the more traditional restaurants! 

The decor there was super cute too. Only a couple of tables but I think people come and go pretty quick. Would return again!! 

Oh yeah, and it was cash only so make sure you have cash on you!!"}
{"text":"Do not dine in.  Their focus is takeout and does not care about dine in customers. Sat around for 30 minutes on a stool waiting for a chirashi."}
{"text":"This isn't the best sushi out there, but the price you pay for is very fair for the location. The sashimi bowls are put together nicely and the rice isn't too dry and just the right temperature to go with the fish. In terms of how \"fresh\" the sushi was, I would say it was average for Markham standards."}
{"text":"I remembered discovering this place last year on Yelp when they first opened their first location in Markham. This new location in Richmond Hill may be missed if you driving down without a gps as it is tucked far inside the CIBC plaza. This new location happens to be very close-by to Costco, Home Depot.

Just like their first location, this place sells sushi and sashimi at good and affordable price . If you are looking for a Japanese fix at a decent price that won't break your bank, then this place is it!!!! They aren't offering high end sushi but what they offer is enough to satisfy my fish craving. 

Their 2nd location is slightly smaller than the Markham branch, with fewer high tables.  There is only 3 high tables and one lower communal table. If my memory serves me correct, the Markham location gives u miso soup with your sit in order but I am not sure they still do that as I haven't been for a while. No soup is provided with your order at the Richmond Hill location. The water tea station was also non existent but they sell pop drinks.

I thought the manager/owner? was attentive at the beginning checking with patrons that were at Ai Sushi, making sure that everyone has been taken care. I was hanging around waiting for my friend to come when the owner came up to check up on me. However, this level of attention and service went out of the door quickly when it got super busy at 6pm, where a massive hoard of people just walk in right after another and just rite after my friend and I just placed the order.  The staff was overwhelmed and busy. They are short staffed and definitely need more people to cover the 6 pm to 8 pm dinner rush. How busy u said? The phone was ringing off the hook as no one was able to go answer the call.

My friend and I were waiting for our order for the longest time ever. People kept coming in to pickup. At first, we thought they called in ahead to place their order first so ok but as another 15 mins went by, I went to check up on the order cuz no way it would take 30 mins for sushi and sashimi!!! The guy remembered me placing some order but didn't remembered what I ordered. I had to remind him what we ordered. So finally he found the order - it was left sitting there and was ready for ages but because he didn't take neither my name or my friend's, the food was just left there on the counter. He apologised for the delay and offered us free pop  but our sushi got soggy. So note to everyone, remember to give your name if they forget to ask for your name at the time you place your order!

For the sushi and sashimi, I would suggest going with the individual deluxe (escape my name) or Chirashi as there are better quality sushi and sashimi in those. The sushi sashimi platters are better for bigger groups for sharing. I ended up with a big sushi / sashimi platter($30 for 40 pieces) as my friend couldn't eat Uni, raw shrimps etc.

For this week only, this location is giving away a 10% discount vip card that is good for life. Ends Sunday Jan 21! 


Update: VIP giveaway card has been extended for another week at the Richmond Hill location, good until Jan 28th."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef tataki (which happens to be my favourite thing to order at any sushi place) and they served it to me frozen...."}
{"text":"Second time at Ai, the first was at their Markham location. Both places were great. We ordered a variety of items off the menu. Service was friendly, quick and efficient. The fish was extremely fresh, the sushi rice was fluffy but not soggy with a hint of sweetness. The octopus carpaccio was flavourful and tender. Would definitely recommend! I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"PLEASE NOTE this place is not a dine-in restaurant, but has some seating available. 

Checking what's HOT & NEW for sushi, Ai Sushi came up on my radar.
Upon entering the place, it's hard to consider the venue your typical dine in as It seemed to be more of take out place which was discouraging.
Rather than paying after our meals we had to pay for it PRIOR which was a bit weird, however the meals were brought to our table.
Their prices are very reasonable for what you get! 

The ambiance is quite interesting, wooded panel walls, Japanese characters painted on the doors at the back complimented with comfy wooden bar stools and tables. 
We started off with their soup, served in a big Styrofoam bowl.......yes I said Styrofoam, overall soup was not salted.

sushi breakdown: 
**Kaisendon: assorted sashimi on rice was well worth it, $10, quality which included premium red sushi was a surprise. The presentation was bang on. 4.5/5
**Ai Sushi Roll: topped with spicy crab on top 3/5. beautifully presented. 
**Honey mustard roll: taste was okay, presentation was a bit sloppy 2/5
**Orange Dragon: topped off with salmon sashimi, this roll was the best out of the 3 we ordered. 4/5

Ambiance 3/5

Price 4/5"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend becuz of the deals they offered. I would have to say the prices are at least 20-25% under the market price for what it is. 

We ordered the infamous $30 for 40 pieces of sushi and sashimi, which was decent for what it is, tbh...the sashimi and sushi were both average in taste, freshness was not bad,  prices is what drives the business I believe. It's better quality than T&T for a similar price point...so why not... Lol... 

Variety ain't bad, I ordered the 100pieces to bring over to a friends place and it looked not bad as well...the colour of the salmon was pink, I had a feeling the rice isn't 100% sushi rice, cuz it's more sticky than other places.. they have 2 locations... One in Richmond Hill and other in Markham...

Word of mouth for this place goes very quickly...and of course social media...

Did I also mention they were giving out 10% off VIP cards when the RH location opened? Saw it on fb...

A place I would return as long as the taste and freshness stays the same..."}
{"text":"It's okay. But the service is inconsistent. I  ordered the 801 Sashmi, which is reasonably priced at $12.00. Sometimes it's really nicely done, other times it's chunks of fish that looked as though it was put together by a 12 year old. I tried to order takeout at 5:30pm but was told pickup time was going to be at the earliest 7pm! A 1.5hr wait, uh, no thanks, it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great for takeout and prices are good- I always call ahead and it takes around 15 min. The 40pc sushi/sashimi/roll is good for 2 people. 

Their tuna is spectacular for a takeout place- it's not the regular red frozen tasting kind, but closer to the pink toro texture/flavour that you would get at a nice Japanese restaurant. It's confusing. 

I've also ordered the 80pc roll- the rolls were all very good and literally the \"cheapest\" roll was an avocado cucumber roll, which is great for vegans."}
{"text":"If you want cheap sushi that tastes good you should come here.

Tip: ordering for lunch time is definately easier and wait times are not bad.

Presentation of sushi is to be expected by any sushi restaurant. Hard to screw it up unless you try really hard. 

Taste of sushi is good. Average cuts of fish for cheap prices.

Restaurant can be dine in also. Decor and interior is nice. 

They offer a variety of types of sushi.

Downside is that they give you the cucumber roll as one of their rolls. 

I already came 2 times to try their rolls and sashimi. Decent and a go to place in Markham."}
{"text":"So disappointed, half my order put in the garbage.  Cheap price but not good taste. My mom make better than them."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 

I decided to order take-out for a lazy quick dinner. I got two orders of the deluxe Kaisendon. I had no problems with ordering over the phone and my food was ready as promised (on a weekday, they didn't seem busy). 

The deluxe Kaisendon came with a good variety of fish. Some highlighted items are the raw scallop, botan ebi, uni, and squid. The level of freshness is above average for Markham quality. You can taste the seawater from the ebi and the uni was creamy; but overall, the sashimi was lacking that sweetness. 

I will likely return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Fresh, cheap and always busy. My family often calls in for takeout which is their niche. No other place can beat their price along with the quality. It's a Chinese owned restaurant that's nothing spectacular but I often believe, with Sushi restaurants, the busier they are, the less chance their fish can sit.
Keep in mind, they are often very busy so call a day ahead if you can. We have called in a few times around noon and could only get an order at 7pm. Crazy"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap sushi in Markham.  I usually order a sushi/sashimi platter for my family.  I really like how you can order online and pick a time to pick up the order. It says they will have delivery option available soon, which will make it even easier to get sushi!  Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Very casual place. You just order at the counter and find a seat. It's a good take out place. The sushi is really good. We were able to try the honey mustard roll which was really good. They torch the salmon on top. It was delicious. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for take out and dine in and have been satisified with their value and quality. This is my go to for platters.

Unfortunately I had chirachidon last night for dinner and got mild food poisoning. I had to play game of thrones all night. Didn't sleep.

I noticed while I was dining in that one of the chefs would go outside for a smoke and come back behind the counter without washing their hands and make sushi. I was wondering why their radish always smelt like weed.

From 5 stars to 1 stars. Ruined my night.

Good luck if you eat here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for almost a year and nothing's changed about its quality or prices. I normally get either the 30 or 50 piece sashimi/sushi platter, which is either $28 or $48 dollars which is still a great deal compared to other places (50 piece would probably be around $60 at other places). However, their quality of sashimi is still amazing and the sushi is made well (not overstuffed with rice like some other places). Overall, great quality for decent prices."}
{"text":"2018 new Sushi hang out in Richmond Hill.  The layout is the same as the one in Markham by 16th and Markham Road.  This location is hidden behind Esso and CIBC.  It is unit 1 of the new plaza.  Shouldn't be hard to find.  I do see the same staff from Markham Location working here.  Quality wise, it should be the same."}
{"text":"The best about this place is the price is good and the fish is fresh. You get a large piece of fish on a sushi. Not like other sushi place where it so small and don't even know how to cut a piece of fish. The service is good . Not a big place to seat but I always find a seat there."}
{"text":"Had two orders of the deluxe kaisendon for take out. For the price, it seems like a good deal. The salmon and shrimp are pretty much the only thing fresh, the other seafood were average, the uni was not fresh and tasted funny. I think other reviewers had similar experience with the uni as well. But I want to try it anyway because the price was attractive. I would have given three to four stars, but me and my wife got stomach ache after eating it. Thats why only 2 stars. If they can use fresher ingredients and have better reviews in the future, I will try again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.. simply because this is good value. I am quite picky when it comes to sushi, but for this price I can't complain.  ~$30 for 40 pieces platter of rolls, sushi and sashimi.  Decent quality & variety. I prefer the platter over the chirashi. 

The décor is pretty nice for a quick service/takeout place.  Manager was nice and offered us water as we were dining in. My only pet peeve is when they clean while patrons are still dining - the strong smell of bleach is very irritating. 

Cash/Debit only."}
{"text":"Love this place. Price is great, quality is top notch for the price! Only wish they served edamame."}
{"text":"This takeout sushi place in Markham is the best in the area in terms of price, variety and quality. Don't come expecting top notch quality that you get at Omakase restaurants or Japanese owned sushi places for twice the price. It's all about coming with the right expectation and Ai Sushi fits the bill when you're craving for sushi and don't want to break the bank.

This place is so popular that they opened up a second location and you have to call ahead your orders well in advance. I've called in at 4:30 before and been told they have too many orders for the night. I appreciate the honesty in telling me upfront it's too busy instead of trying to jam another order in.

We usually get 20 pieces per person and it's more than enough. The sushi, sashimi and roll party tray offers a great variety. They don't serve white tuna (escolar) which is bad for you and the red snapper (tilapia) can be substituted for salmon.

If you want I spice it up, they have a variety of Chirashi Dons (including ones with Uni and Giant Sweet Shrimp) and Carpaccio's.

The 100 assorted tray for $60 is really great value. If you visit often, they will give you a 10% off VIP card when paying with cash."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Neat little place if you like a quick sushi fix. Geared more for takeout but have bar style table seating if you prefer to eat in. No table service but they do bring you water with your order. Maki rolls were quite tastey and quality is pretty good for the price. Our order came very quick as they had 4 guys making they orders. We had Honey Mustard Roll, Alaska Roll, Black Dragon and Spicy Scallop Roll. Will definitely go back to try their other sushi. Note they only take cash or debit. They get busy at peak hour, so when ordering takeout, order at least an hour ahead. Last few times I ordered ahead 15mins, still had to wait there another 20-30mins."}
{"text":"calling out this is a 3.5 rounded down to a 3.0.

since this place opened the hype has been much about the value you get when you order take out whether it's a platter or a combo of things. apparently it's great value.

So looked at their menu online and saw a a tree that essentially was all maki. now unlike a few other places I've been to this place had quite a limited selection with no substitutions. also average platter is $30 or more.

second thing I noticed was that this place was cash only. I said fine cash only means no tax. sadly was wrong as they charged me tax anyways and demanded cash. kinda silly but I get it debit and credit fees are high probably.

The actual sushi in their all maki platter for $32 was actually quite nice. well put together and great taste. really happy with how they tasted but a lot of basic rolls with little fish.

for a local joint though without having to travel westward for a while or into downtown this is fine for guests or having as an option."}
{"text":"We order take out a few times, A 60 piece sashimi-sushi-roll $40. Another time we order the 80 piece $50. For the amount of food you getting I think this place is the best bang for your buck. The quality good can't complain for the price your paying. They have seats, if you want to dine in it's a order and sit kinda place. On weekends we call a few hours in advance to order, yeah they are that busy."}
{"text":"Cozy takeout joint located in the same plaza as Papa Chang on 16 and Markham Rd. Ample parking for takeout, especially for dinner rush when other shops have closed. Dine-in is available, but there are few tables and you'll be surrounded by guests waiting for their takeout orders. 

I ordered their 100 pc Sushi-Sashimi-Roll platter for $60, which comes in two takeout platters. Plenty of food for 4-5 people. Sashimi tasted fresh and sushi was well constructed. I like that they give a variety of rolls with different fish in it. (Seriously cheesed when sushi restaurants cheat you with cucumber rolls and crab rolls.)

Do order ahead as they get pretty overwhelmed during peak hours. For the price, Ai Sushi offers exceptional value. Also helps they're located super close to home for me!"}
{"text":"I can only speak about their take out. 
You can place an order online through their website or just give them a call.
Each time, the order was ready on time.  The sushi and rolls were fresh and delicious.
No credit, cash and debit only."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It's mainly a take-out place, limited seating...

Price is very good.  Love their sushi / roll / sashimi platter, 100pcs, and the price is $58 + tax.

Sashimi is quite fresh, not the top grade sashimi, but it's NOT BAD at all.

Not too many decent sushi places in this area, so many people order take-out here.  Highly recommend placing your order in advance.  Your order won't be ready at their suggested pick-up time, usually need to wait for another 10-15 mins."}
{"text":"Horrible experience coming here yesterday. I received a 10% discount coupon, ordered 2 large platters, worth over $100. I timed my day accordingly so i am back home in time before my guests arrives. I had to go pick up other hot food trays from other restaurants first. Went to Ai to pick up my order last before heading home. I presented the 10% discount coupon i had, the cashier tells me it is only 10% discount if paid by cash. I emphasized that nowhere on the 10% discount card does it say 'cash only'. The cashier then tells me i can pay by credit card and not have 10% discount applied, or go to the bank and get the discount.  I didn't want to have hot foods in my car get cold so i paid by credit card and not get the discount.
The 10% discount coupon is very misleading. Can't believe they let me leave with a horrible experience like that. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have had this on my list for some time, so glad to finally try it. It was really good and you definitely get a great deal here. We ordered a couple of platters including the 100 pieces of sushi, sashimi, and rolls (which was only $58) along with the 80 pieces of assorted rolls (which was only $42). They are always busy and it took about 1.5 hours for our large order. It is more of a take out restaurant than a sit down place. We found the sashimi fresh and it was a nice variety from the usuals like salmon, tuna, octopus along with scallop, squid, and few other fish. The rolls were good, the rice was seasoned nicely and there was not too much rice on the rolls."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and affordable sushi!!! So happy they opened a 2nd location in Richmond Hill (Leslie and Elgin Mills). We have tried their premium chirashi don, rolls, and party trays (with sushi, sashimi, and rolls)...never a disappointment. The Ai Roll is one of my favourite rolls with salmon, cuttlefish, avocado, and spicy crab. Also, the chirashi don is totally worth it since you get fresh and premium sashimi including fatty salmon, uni, botan ebi, scallop, roe, and so much more. This is our new go to place for affordable take out sushi. You can dine in but space is limited."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ala carte sushi place. The place is very cozy and modern. Staff is very friendly and service was quick.  The sushi trays come in a variety of assorted sashimi/sushi/roll. The sushi was very fresh and the rolls were all intact. I love that they give you seperate containers for soya sauce, wasabi, and ginger - so nothing gets 'contaminated' in the tray. Definitely recommend this place for anyone who loves to order sushi to eat at home."}
{"text":"Very good service! Owners are very nice and the sushi is good as well! Pricing is good, keeping in mind platters are pre-discounted (they only accept cash for platters)."}
{"text":"I picked up lunch here and I loved it! The portion was filling and the food was freshly made. I would definitely recommend. It's a pretty casual place just for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Was excited to see a new sushi restaurant in the area.. a note of caution, this is more like a take out place with limited seating. I love the decor and the openess of the kitchen. The prices also looked really good! I ordered a few rolls for around $5-6 each. Unfortunately the taste was just mediocre - the shrimp in the dynamite roll didn't quite taste fresh, the rice was a bit hard and the unagi was not really the best.. I'd still come here but more for convenience than anything..."}
{"text":"I was recommended by my friend to check this place out because he mentioned their deluxe chirashi was bomb. This place is set up as a take out restaurant where you order at the front of the cash first. There are a few tall tables and stools to sit on. 

Deluxe Kaisendon - $16.99 - I must say this was worth the 16.99. They included salmon, white tuna, amberjack, octopus, sea urchin, scallops, salmon roe, squid, and the BOTAN EBI (insert emoji with heart eyes). Unfortunately, the rice was not well seasoned and was a bit too rough. The sea urchin and fish were not too fresh either. Overall, I would say this was worth the money for the types of seafood they put on but it was not the best quality charashi out there. Although, you'd probably won't be able to find a chirashi in Toronto with all the seafood listed above for less than or equivalent to $17.  

Staff: Overall friendly. Did not really interact with them because of the take out styled restaurant.

Price: $$

Environment: Clean. High top tables and stools. Take out restaurant. Not for large parties.  

I'd still go back for the botan ebi!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem with fresh sashimi and decent party trays! Definitely worth giving a shot, staffs are friendly and helpful. :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place from now on for sushi in this area!
Came here twice this month and ordered the sashimi/sushi platter and was definitely not disappointed with the selection of sashimi, sushi and rolls in it.
The sushi and rolls are well made and the fish is fresh. There are a few tables where you can sit down and eat but everything will be served in takeout containers/utensils, which imo is more hygenic than the usual plates/utensils used in other restaurants that smell faintly of beach."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, we immediately knew it is not a typical sit in restaurant.  It is more cater for take out.  However they have a few tables to accommodate some customers who want to eat there.  We pickup our VIP card which can be use for 10% off for our next purchase.  We ordered a party tray of 40 pieces of sushi/sushimi while the restaurant was not busy and no line up.  However we noticed our food came later than the  people who order after us.  It took 30+ minutes for our party tray sushi to be ready which we weren't too happy about it.      We notice the pieces are smaller compare to other sushi restaurant. However we also understand that the price is cheaper to begin with.  The sushimi was very cold like just came out from freezer.  This need to be improve.  We will come again for take out, however, I hope they can improve on the order delivery of the food."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time yesterday and it was so nice! It is like a fancy take out restaurant. (they use take out trays and disposable cutlery). The sushi and sashimi was so fresh and portions to price ratio is very good!!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood, fast service for take out and great value! Very rare to have a sushi place provide sweet shrimp as part of the Sashimi platter. The platters provide such great variety of fresh fish and seafood that you wouldn't see in other Sushi places in Markham."}
{"text":"Love the sushi and sashimi here! Everything is fresh and at affordable price! This has become my go to for Sushi take out!"}
{"text":"Great take out sushi place. On busy nights like holidays make sure you call ahead to place order. Platter are affordable and tasty."}
{"text":"Special order a roll for someone who doesn't like fish. They made a tempura sweet potato and cucumber roll which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came to try Ai Sushi with a friend of mine.

I love the decor, don't really agree with some whom have deducted stars due to the fact that there is no table service. It is pretty self explanatory and the staff would tell you as well.  There are comfortable seating for you on a first come-first serve basis...the staff there never rushed us leave or anything.

The price is right, sushi/sashimi are fresh and yummy.

I have already recommended this place to a few of my friends who live in the area."}
{"text":"Decent sushi for a great price. Ordered takeout from here and found the prices phenomenal. Seating is limited as it is set up largely for takeout.

I called in around 3PM and the earliest they could was 7:30PM pickup. We had to wait an extra 15 minutes when we got to their restaurant. I think they need to increase their throughput because that was a bit disappointing.

The sashimi was fresh, and the portions were great. The rice on each piece of sushi was kept at a minimum which is how I like it. The rolls however were quite disappointing, coming in various sizes and some rolls were filled with very cheap ingredients (given you can't select in the platters). 

Some positives and negatives but overall, I'll definitely order from Ai Sushi again - especially for any potluck / parties because of the awesome prices however they need to improve efficiency or it'll start turning people away."}
{"text":"Ai Sushi is best for takeout! What I love the most about this place is the availability for botan ebi (big shrimp sashimi) which is pretty rare in normal sushi places. They sell 3 shrimps for $8. It's a big shrimp sashimi (refer to my photo) packed with freshness and sweetness. 

I also enjoy ordering uni from this place - full pack for $50 or half for $50. Their uni is fresh, creamy and has the strong uni taste. If you love your uni, this place could be your quick fix! 

We usually get their sashimi platter. There's a good variety in the sashimi with my favourites being the small shrimp sashimi, scallop and the mackerel with the yellow roe. All in all, they are affordable, provide quick service and offer freshness - definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, place is busy so better call and order ahead, or you will be waiting for a long time"}
{"text":"The wait is too long. Even you were promised for 30 mins, the order was never on time. The quality was good last year, but has become worse since then. The portion became smaller, but the price went up. Fast food with sit down price."}
{"text":"I order the ???Don.....Salmon roe very fresh 5/5  .. uni yummy 4/5 .  I agree the shirmp should take out the intestine 4/5. And rice can add more vinegar. Overall i like Miso soup very hot n lots of tofu and seaweed 5/5.. and they serve  hot green tea and tea bags. Thats good. Party tray looks fantastic. I will definitely  come try again next time!"}
{"text":"Take out is good !!
Busy busy busy!!
I ordered early for Father's day 2 days before.
Day of pickup, had to wait and line up for the pickup.

Food portion is good!

Wasabi is strong.

4.5 stars for my first takeout."}
{"text":"Affordable prices, fresh fish, ample parking, sufficient seating - i love this sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place if you wanted a good selection for take out. Not much of a feel for dining in their restaurant since it's a smaller location but if I'd ever want to order sushi for take out this is the place to go! Quality check, presentation check, reasonable price check. :)"}
{"text":"I came with my wife after many of our friends recommended it highly. We ordered a platter, a couple of rolls, sea urchin sushi, and octopus carpaccio. Even though they were obviously Chinese-run, I thought we'd give them a chance.

I don't understand how this place got 4 stars. Yes, you do get a lot of value in terms of quantity, as their portions are generous and their slices of fish are thick. 

Unfortunately the positives end there. Their fish is not the freshest, and taste as if they have been frozen for a little too long. The fish is bland compared to other sushi restaurants in Markham, and don't taste fresh. They mask this with their sauces and tempura flakes as much as possible. Unfortunately we couldn't finish what we ordered due to a loss of appetite. 

If you're looking for quality sushi of any sort, please avoid. If you only care about how much sushi you can get for the least amount of money, by all means."}
{"text":"Ai Sushi is a place you should choose if you want some good quality sushi without spending too much like going to Zen or too cheap like ayce (bad quality, but for sure can make you feel so full).
Their sashimi is fresh and the price is very affordable compared to other sushi joints in Markham. I ordered the Deluxe Kaisendon, which comes with 12 different kinds of sashimi!! While others will just give you 2-4 pcs (the basic like salmon and tuna). The variety of sashimi it gives is super rare to find in uptown!!

They sell uni too .. yummmm"}
{"text":"Went to Ai Sushi and it was a pleasant experience overall. The environment is welcoming and staff were very friendly. While eating our food on one of their beautiful wooden tables, the staff offered us warm water without asking. We ordered a 40 pieces tray and they tasted very fresh. I would recommend this sushi restaurant that does mainly mainly take out to everyone who love sushi"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly better than I thought! We got two take out platters with sushi, rolls and sashimi and split it among 9 people and it was pretty affordable coming out to around $9 each. And we were all decently full after that. The sashimi tasted quite fresh and really tasty. The rolls and sushi were solid as well. I think this is my new favourite place for affordable, decent sushi.

The place itself is pretty small with not a lot of seating. So I can imagine it getting pretty busy during lunch or dinner hours."}
{"text":"I was a bit worried because of the negative reviews but this place is amazing, everything was fresh and delicious and best of all, it was for a cheap price too! If this place was closer I would go there on a weekly basis but it's worth to travel for good, cheap and delicious sushi! 

It was also shocking to see such a big line of people ordering and picking up their sushi. They had one of those cool photo booth things in their store but too bad it was turned off.

Also! Idk why people keep complaining about seatings, there is a decent amount imo"}
{"text":"Came here for a different platter this time. We ordered the 60 pieces of sushi rolls. Everything is still delicious and up to par!"}
{"text":"AIEEE! I love this place! Noticed it was pretty close to me and we were craving sushi, so convenience definitely played a factor. It was also pretty highly reviewed here, so I figured I'd trust my fellow yelpers and give it a shot.
I was not disappointed!! I'm more of a maki roll type person, and they had the perfect platter for us... 40pc tray for $24 and change (tax included). The sushi we had was made fresh, and tasted GREAT! Given the excellent price, we were worried that they'd all be cucumber rolls, but it was actually a great assortment of california rolls, cucumber and avocado, crab, spicy ...something..salmon maybe? (sorry lol), and I might be forgetting a couple of other types...but my point is that it was a great variety, and plentiful. 
The decor was beautiful...all wood and a line up of sushi chefs creating delicious food. I'll definitely be coming back!

NB: For the platters, I was told it was cash only...I didn't get a discount and was charged tax. Just FYI."}
{"text":"Take out sashimi platter - not your average platter! Good combination of fresh fish, including sweet shrimp, scallops and toro.

The location is neatly tucked behind the esso gas station in the small plaza with CIBC.  Parking is tough when busy but late night weekends are a breeze, it's so empty.  

Staff is courteous and provide good service.  Finally a above average sushi place in north Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this place because the quality of this place is getting lower and lower. Recently ordered the Hokkaido don for dinner and I can clearly see the quality and care has dropped dramatically. The raw shrimps had so much sand packed into the veins, you can see it clearly through the meat...needless to say it was an unpleasant crunchy meal."}
{"text":"Been eyeing this place for a while now and finally got take out tonight! 
We decided to get the 100 pc platter pretty last minute and placed the order around 4:30pm, for pick up at 6pm. I was able to change the ika sashimi to salmon, and the crab meat sushis to salmon as well, which was nice. 

PROS: 
- The sashimi and sushi were surprisingly really fresh and delicious! 
- Order was already packed up and ready when we arrived around 5:50pm 
- Very affordable! It came to $67.80 after tax (cash only) for 100 pcs 
- 100 pc platter was able to fill 4 hungry tummies! And we had a little bit of leftovers 

CONS: 
- The rolls were just mediocre. I wish we could just order a sashimi-sushi platter next time, but there's no option for just that. The rolls definitely don't compare to Gals sushi (my all time fav), but they're decent for the price. 
- They had a cute photo booth set up at their location, but when we tried printing our photos, the picture never came out. It worked for my friend when she was there a few weeks before, but it was just a little disappointing that it didn't work out for us. 

Overall, I enjoyed the food and would most likely come back because of how cheap it is compared to other sushi places. :)"}
{"text":"their sushi, sashimi are okay, but better that what I expected for such reasonable price.

HOWEVER, whenever you call them to order take out, they will ALWAYS tell you the pick up at 8:00PM! the earliest 7:30!
Yes I understand many people around there, like their sushi for such price, but even called at 3ish, the answer will be the same. pick up at 8 and never apologized for it, the only answer is we have too many orders!

one tricky tip, go there and order instead of calling, they can make it without 20minutes!

I wish they will shorten the waiting time. and that will definitely another star for it!"}
{"text":"We came here to dine in after craving for sushi for so many days and decided to order 80 pieces platter for two person. I know it's a lot but come on it's sushi, there's no such thing called too much in my sushi dictionary! 

Anyways!! We love how freshly their sushi were made and not icy cold sashimi, it's like the perfect temperature, it's really good compare to other sushi take out places. They increased their price for two dollars recently but still good deal with such quality!

The other location was always full and long line up for sushi pick up, even though you call few days beforehand, they don't always take your order because everyone is ordering. But before this location starting to get busy, I'd definitely keep coming here for sushi just because it's less busy and less crowded!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
Located in the plaza with CIBC on Leslie St & Elgin Mills Rd E.

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Staff at the cash register were efficient. I picked up a take-out order on a quiet Sunday afternoon, so the staff were very attentive. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Modern twist with classic Japanese-style art on the walls. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5
Relatively high-quality sushi and sashimi for an à la carte sushi place. I could actually taste the prominent natural and fresh flavours of the fish from this place in comparison with watered-down and tasteless fish at AYCE restaurants. 

[ORDER]
Assorted Sashimi- Sushi Roll Platter (60 Pieces) - $38.00: sashimi-to-sushi ratio was great because there was not an abundant amount of rice, sashimi was fresh, sushi rolls had various textures and ingredients went well with one another. The only con was the lack of authentic rice vinegar flavour in the sushi rice.

[OVERALL] - 4/5
I would come back to either this location and/or the one in Markham for the sushi platters. They would be a great addition to any party because this relatively high-quality sashimi & sushi is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Ordered the 40 piece assorted sushi and sashimi for $28 + tax. It was presented nicely in a platter with clear lid, vs a piece of foam I've had at other places. The pieces were decent in size, and variety was excellent. I particularly enjoyed the flavour of the lightly seared pieces. Great value. Would order again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for decent sushi with a bang for your buck, then Ai Sushi is the place for you, especially if you're in the neighborhood.

Located in the same plaza as Papa Chang, this small but popular restaurant might get overlooked on the other side of this plaza.

Compared with the general sushi/sashimi menus (especially platters) out there, Ai has a significantly lower price point, which might make a lot of sushi lovers happy. Although their prices are friendlier, the quality of their food is on par with most common ayce's out there. The guys here also take the care to make sure their food is presentable (sauce is evenly put on every roll and not thrown on).

The restaurant might not be the best place for dine-in though; space is limited and from what I remember there were (maybe) 5 tables, high tables for that matter. And from the flow of customers, most people come here for takeouts, which is probably a better option anyway if you don't want to sit hunched back for an hour on those backless high chairs.

Staff are friendly and efficient; they know it does get busy there so they don't waste their time.

A little something extra: the wall on the right when you enter is uber cute, a popular IG post at this restaurant. Pictures of 'asian' sushi and fish drawings are drawn. posing a colourful and cute addition to the restaurant. They've also set up a mini photo booth/shelf with things like glasses and hats that customers can put on and take a picture in front of that wall (younger children will be more attracted to it than adults).

All in all, a good place in the neighborhood if you're craving sushi/sashimi but want to enjoy it in the comfort of your home!"}
{"text":"4.5

Ai Sushi was amazing! Called on a weekend night for takeout and was surprised that there would be an hour wait for my order to be ready. Despite the wait I was eager to try due to the Yelp reviews and price point. 

The restaurant is very aesthetic - contemporary design, clean and bright! There is seating in the restaurant, but it was practically all full. Not to mention there were a handful of people waiting for their takeout order. 

The staff were friendly and cashed me out right away, and then my order was ready a few minutes later. 

The food was incredibly fresh and very tasty. I ordered a bunch of salmon dishes to try - carpaccio, sushi, spicy and avocado salmon roll and spicy tuna roll. 

All of the food was really fresh and tasty! You can definitely tell when it's good quality fish, and Ai uses good quality ingredients. And the spicy mayo was delish. The portion sizes are decent, but honestly at this price point you can't go wrong! Paid about $26 after tax for 3 rolls, 1 app, and 1 sushi set (2 pieces). 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So happy to find such fresh sushi at good prices. It's hidden in a small plaza behind Esso and CIBC.

I ordered the 40 pc sashimi-sushi-roll platter for take-out lunch on a Sunday. On Wednesday, I dined-in for lunch with some friends and ordered the 80pc sashimi-sushi-roll platter which included some scallop sashimi - yay (secretly though, I was eyeing the sashimi platters, but majority ruled)!

Both times, the platters were very fresh, quick, and chilled at the right temperature. I love their cut of salmon, the octapus sashimi was tender not chewy, and I usually forego shrimp sushi but theirs is good, not rubbery at all! Best of all, their fish is crisp and didn't have any strong fishy smell or after-taste (score!!!!). Every bite oozed with fresh raw goodness!

Inside is nicely decorated with lots of raw-wood elements and clean washrooms. Seating is very limited, so definitely more of a take out joint. I might have been lucky because both times that I've gone in they weren't busy and tables were open. I can definitely see it getting crowded very easily. 

For dine-in: the server was very tentative and brought us a pot of tea which she replenished often. They gave us ceramic plates and tea cups to use. :) 

Highly recommended and I'll definitely return to check out their sashimi platters and other dishes! :D

Ps. Platters are cash only!"}
{"text":"I have never been so conflicted on giving 5-stars as I've been thinking about giving it 1.  

Ai Sushi is mostly a take-out restaurant.  It is ran by Chinese owners and workers.  
The space is nice and you can see the chefs making your sushi right behind the counter.

The portions of the sushi/sashimi are generous and the rice is minimal.  
They don't overload you with cheap sashimi like crab meat and offer shrimp too!

The prices are very impressive and definitely affordable.

HOWEVER, they are so freaking unrealistic with times.  When I ordered at 5:30 they told me 20-40 minutes (wtf? why such a big gap in-between?) 
Then I came an hour later just to be safe ... my sister and I ended up waiting an hour and a half!!!!!!!!!
There were like 10 other people waiting as well and mostly all the seats were of hungry, angry people.  They kept on turning people away as they were waaay too overbooked.  

But, I do have to admit if you order way ahead of time and you have to let them know that if they're not ready within the time you assured you ... that you'll leave - there food is actually pretty good (especially in comparison to Sushi Sushi)."}
{"text":"We ordered take out sushi tray.  The quality and quantity were both great.  The only thing to keep in mind is they get very busy during dinner time.  My parent and I were there once for take out but we left since the wait is 45 minus."}
{"text":"When my family told me to meet them here for lunch, I wasn't so excited seeing the low ratings some were giving. But I now realize people have mistaken this grab-and-go, extremely affordable, and exceptional sushi quality take-out joint as \"a restaurant that is supposed to provide service/luxury\". No, this sushi joint is not that. 

I walked in and found the interior to be VERY cool; high wooden tables (about 5 of these) with high chairs, walls are decorated with wood and one wall has cute chalk drawings. Yes it is a small \"restaurant\", but it's completely understandable because they're making themselves as a \"I'm craving sushi lemme just come here, grab some and go\".

I did end up dining in anyways, and although I wasn't expecting much or any service, the cashier brought our sushi platter to our table anyways. We ordered the 100 piece sashimi+sushi combo, and then individual orders of sweet shrimp, mackerel, scallop, and white tuna. ALL were VERY good and VERY fresh (and the pictures show it). The platters didn't have any crazy \"diamond black dragon mega roll\" or \"super dream avocado salmon supreme\", but the price makes the selection quite decent and again, everything was fresh. 

One small thing is it does take them awhile to make the sushi (though not to the point of frustration) but the quality and presentation makes up for it. Another improvement is if they had some lunch combos/special combos, but otherwise the sushi at this little joint is affordable, and quality is surprisingly great! Will be visiting and recommending to everyone!"}
{"text":"Saw this place new on yelp and came here for a try on the weekend. 
The place seems to be more of a take-out spot, but has a few tables if you do want to dine in. The atmosphere is nice though, nicely renovated and has a very modern look.

Seaweed Salad ($2.99) - served in the container.
They have a good variety of fish selection, nigiris price ranges from $3-4 for 2 pieces depending on the type of fish. I ordered their Ameabi (sweet shrimp) sashimi - 3 pieces for $5 which was an amazing deal considering their shrimps were quite large. For nigiri I had Hamachi (yellow tail) $4, Saba (mackerel) $3.5, Hotategai (scallop) $4, and Unagi (bbq eel) $4. All the fish were fresh. The Ameabi, Hamachi, and Hotategai were the best.  The Saba and Unagi sushi was the typical kind served at AYCE sushi places.  Too bad they don't have toro sushi.

Ai Roll ($5.99)
Their maki rolls come with 4 pieces. In a way I like that idea because rolls general cost $10+ for 6-8 pieces and you are committed to finishing the same roll. The fact that they serve 4 pieces gives you the option to try other rolls for the same price. The Ai roll comes with salmon and cutter fish, cucumbers, avocado, topped with spicy crab and fish eggs. I liked how they added cutter fish as it adds a nice chewy-ness to the roll  - this is something different compared with other standard rolls. 

Hokkaidon ($12.99)
2 pieces of Uni, 3 pieces of Ameabi (sweet shrimp) sashimi, and salmon roe topped on rice. Getting this don is a better deal than ordering each of the ingredients individually. Ingredients were fresh, and the flavors of each went well with each other. The Ameabi sashimi were big, soft and sweet. If you place a bit of Uni, salmon roe, and rice all in one bite - amazingness!!

A good place if you want some decent quality sushi for takeout at a reasonable price. That night we ordered 10 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of shimp sashimi, a seaweed salad, the Ai roll, and a Hokkaidon, and the bill was less than $50!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. Clean, quick, quality service and food. This location only seats approximately 25 and is more of a takeout restaurant. The rolls are prepared with just the right amount of rice. Will return."}
{"text":"I came in at 6:30 and was told that I would have to come back an hour later to pick up my order. I was told they were preparing a lot of platter orders. There was only a group of 4 sitting down so I'm assuming they were over-the-phone. 

When I returned an hour later it was noticeably busier. The cashier told me my order was almost done, but it took another 25 minutes before it was ready.

The quality is definitely above average, and for the price you won't be disappointed. However, make sure you phone in your order ahead of time so you don't have to wait too long. 3 stars because of the wait time and unpreparedness, but that's a little expected for new businesses."}
{"text":"This place is mostly for take out.  But there are several tables for you to dine in if you wish to.  I usually come here if i am craving for sushi but don't want to pay the premium price.  

It's not the best you can get, but it will be enough to satisfy you."}
{"text":"Small little place, looks like it's more of a take out spot, but there are 4 tables I think for those that really wanna dine in. pretty good sushi the wasabi is more potent than regular."}
{"text":"My friends told me to come here since I like variety and it definitely met that expectation!

Management: It's not something you would see when you're driving on 16th Ave unless you're really looking for it. When you walk in, there's no menu on the walls, so you are just given a paper take-out menu.

Cleanliness: Tables were wiped and the fish is out on display so no real complaints there. However, I found it really gross that when I went to order and wait for my take-out at a table, one of the prep cooks was cutting his nails on a table in the back. I just find it very unsanitary and also just unpleasant to hear someone clipping his/her nails while you wait for food; thus, the one star deduction.

Service: The one who served me was very knowledgeable of the menu and explained which ones were the top sellers and what the rolls had specifically in response to my kiwi allergy. Not sure if they're still doing it, but they were selling fidget spinners when I ordered sushi xD

I had the following rolls:
Alaska Roll ($5.99)
The thing I like about this place is that they prepare half rolls for a reasonable price. I can get more variety for about the same price as a whole roll. This roll had smoked salmon, imitation crab, asparagus, avocado, topped with spicy crab and fish egg. I can't stand asparagus but I could barely taste it in this roll. I also can't take too spicy, so this was a perfect amount. Nothing special about this roll.

Honey Mustard Roll ($4.99)
This was the roll that they suggested and I was hesitant at first because I don't like honey mustard, but I decided to give it a try anyways. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! This comes with shrimp tempura, imitation crab, cucumber, avocado and it's topped with torched salmon. When they were torching it, the smell already got my attention and the aroma paired with the honey mustard was a perfect combination of smoky and sweet! I would definitely recommend this roll!

Overall, if you like variety like me and would like to find more #markhameats, then check this place out and write a review!"}
{"text":"I've gotten Ai Sushi at least once a week using doordash and I am a happy customer. 

Since it is International Sushi Day, I obviously had to get sushi for dinner. 

Honestly, I think Ai Sushi has the best quality for sushi in the area. Way better than Daisuki sushi (just across the street from Ai Sushi) and Markham sushi (past bur oak). 

I always get the assorted 40 pc sashimi-sushi-roll platter. I would post a picture but I got too excited and started eating it haha. 

I usually request they change it to all salmon sashimi and nigiri. There is an extra charge for changing it to all salmon but it's super worth it. I've never had an issue and I am super happy with the quality I receive.

Definitely going to get it again next week!"}
{"text":"Although very cheap and affordable, the quality of their sushi is not the best. This is more of a take out restaurant, there aren't many tables for you to sit and dine. But if you do, expect to wait a while for your order. They are always jammed packed with take out orders. If you plan on ordering take out from them, make sure to let them know an earlier pick up time. They usually are very late on that."}
{"text":"I would stick to the takeout trays, and for those I give 4 stars. The quality of the takeout trays surpasses most other places I have tried. The sashimi and sushi are pretty fresh and tasty. I think what really sets them apart is the botan ebi (sweet shrimp) which isn't readily offered at many sushi places, much less a takeout place. I ate in once and tried their Deluxe Chirashidon, which was a bit disappointing in terms of quality. I find their fish sashimi isn't the best but the other seafood sashimi are quite good. I really love their botan ebi and the ika (cuttlefish). The octopus and scallop were also good, so maybe stick to the non-fish options if you are dining in. Keep in mind that if you dine in it operates like a food court style, though the staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Finally giving Ai Sushi a try after 1 year.

Ordered the $30 Sushi, Sashimi and Roll Platter which was decent for the price. 

Place was extremely busy on a Saturday around noon, To avoid waiting, please call well ahead to place your order to avoid long wait time."}
{"text":"The sushi here is tasty and fresh. We had a large sushi platter and there was a good selection to choose from. The price was also very affordable. The only thing that I didn't like was that the sushi size is smaller than other sushi restaurants I've been to. However, the portion they give for the sashimi was good. The decorations for the restaurant was also very modern. The service was overall good and quick."}
{"text":"Great sushi place with nice environment. Good for pick up or simple meal. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I can upfront says that 1) I love having Ai Sushi in the neighbourhood, and 2) I disagree with the $$$ rating.  We spent $40 all in to feed 2 people.

One thing you should know upfront to set your expectation right: the venue is pretty, contemporary with a nod to traditions. BUT it is set up for take out.  The dine in seating are high chairs and communal long tables.  Services is minimum (or non existent).  It feels a lot like eating in food court or cafeteria, with fancier furniture.

The good: 
1) amazingly fresh fish, hence amazingly fresh sushi and sashimi. The quality is approaching that of Hibiki on Hwy 7
2) amazing fish selections in the a la carte section  
3) per quality of ingredients, it is completely inexpensive.  True, this is not Sushi Bong pricing, but this level of quality can't get much cheaper
4) the Ai Maki roll was delicious
5) Other than delivering food to you, it is mostly self served. Save on tips money!

The bad:
1) Other than miso soup and white rice, it is mainly a cold food joint.  Detour somewhere else if you feel like eating hot food
2) the Ai Maki roll was big but a little \"short\"
3) There were a few sushi chefs working at time of our visit. The sushi chef who tended to us also worked as a cashier, waiter and bus boy.  He didn't smile (closer to stone cold) when we said we wanted to dine in.

I toyed between 4 and 5 stars because the person who took our order didn't smile at all.  But then, if I were him, who were trained to be a sushi chef and to supervise a few juniors, I too would be upset that I had to bus tables.  

Ai Sushi provides outstanding value proposition in this neighbourhood.  It will be MY loss if it ceases operation.  I decide that 1) I will order take out here often, and 2) I will refer and recommend Ai to people to order take out.  Just skip the dine in, and everyone will have a good time.  Everyone."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite local sushi joints. Ai Sushi never fails to disappoint. I usually go in store to place my order and it is always packed! Sushi is fresh and made to order and the wait is never too long. I normally order the 100 piece sushi-sashimi combo (#708 for $60). This order comes in 2 separate trays with the sashimi in one tray and the sushi rolls in another. The sushi rolls contain just enough rice and not an overwhelming amount like at some places. The best sushi rolls has to be the spicy salmon which has a nice kick to it with tender salmon morsels. The sashimi tastes super fresh and melts in your mouth. Before you know it the entire tray is gone and it leaves you longing for more.  

Overall great consistent place for takeout sushi great for parties. They have a new location at Leslie and Elgin mills which has the same great taste and quality as this location. Definitely bring cash as they only seem to accept cash for the orders."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in Markham! I always stop there after my workouts. Salmon Hosomaki is a must order for me. Its $3 and they are very generous with the fish portion! Ai Sushi rolls is delicious and a chef's special there, it's unlike other! However, depending on what you order, it can get very pricey."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5 but since I can't, I'll give it a 4.  Overall a decent sushi takeout place. The fish is really fresh! But I agree with other posts that the fish AND the rolls are sliced really, really thin. The octopus was sliced paper thin! My 80 pcs combination was a lot smaller than I expected.  The rice is a bit sticky. The service could be more friendlier. I'd give it another shot, hopefully they improve some of their kinks."}
{"text":"This is a good place for some sushi take out. The party trays are reasonably priced, good variety of sushi and above average in term of quality and freshness. One major downsize is that party tray is cash only, so make sure you remember to bring cash. Sushi rolls are good; sashimi is just okay (could be fresher ) but not bad for the price. 

Will return for more take out next time I'm craving sushi"}
{"text":"SLOW SLOW SLOW and you get what you paid for. Not sure if this is really worth 2 stars or closer to 1.5 stars. I place the order (phone after all the reviews) at 6:07pm for the $35 for assorted 60 pieces, they said pickup was at 7:20pm. Knowing they will most likely will be late, I got there for 7:30pm and they told me another 20min, after 20min have past they said another 5min... in the end I left at 8:33pm. Really? it take almost 2.5hrs to make 60 pieces? From what it looks like they started my platter around 8:15pm or 8:20pm.

During the wait time they even had to turn down 2 walk in customer, what kind of business is this? 

They had 3 people at the front making the food, one in the back prepping? And 2 on cash...not sure why there are 2 when they are not pumping fast enough.

The price is cheap and that is for a reason, the quality of food is also cheap and the question of freshness. They even ran out of salmon and had to substitute for red tuna.  

Cheap is one thing but they should be accountable for the timeliness of the food. Time is also money, the cheap price and mediocre food is probably not worth going back compared to a place that cost more and do it much quicker."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Excellent price!  Love the renovation! Very friendly people!  Will definitely going back again! 

I think they are the only one stock up with Uni!"}
{"text":"I bought take-out from here a few days ago. Let's just say, the food and service here is garbage. 

Initially when I called to place my order, I had to repeat everything like 5 times. Annoying as that was, it wasn't  half as rude as me being in the middle of asking a question and the person on the other line just hanging up on me. 

When I got there to pick it up, it was no better. The guy at cash didn't even greet me with a hello and just shouted \"WHAT IS YOUR PHONE NUMBER?\" No thank you was said after I paid too. 

I thought this could've been excusable if the food was great. But when I got home to devour the party tray, the fish was not fresh at all and they didn't even give us miso soup. 

Yu Sushi is WAY better than this awful joint."}
{"text":"Wow, my new favourite sushi restaurant in Markham. This place is amazing. I love that their specialty rolls come in half sizes (and at $4.99 too) which gives me more chances to order other rolls that I never get to try due to the size. The food to rice ratio is also very generous which makes it an extra bonus for my taste buds. Their sashimi is so nice and fresh. 

I got to try their deluxe kaisendon, and it was packed with fresh and large pieces of yummy sashimi. None of that cooked shrimp, there was a huge piece of sweet shrimp in mine, along with uni, octopus, salmon roe, scallop, and much more! 

Since I got take out, I'm not sure about their service but they were friendly for the short duration that I was there for. I'd definitely come back, definitely my new favourite!"}
{"text":"Ai Sushi is my favourite place to get takeout sushi. However, the wait can be long if you're walking in and ordering. On a Saturday afternoon, I was told that it would be 20 minutes (as everything was prepared fresh) but it was more like 35-40 minutes. This was kind of irritating as I was in a rush to bring this to someone's house for dinner.

More about the food - the maki rolls are great and the sushi rice is flavoured well. We don't eat tuna so we were able to substitute that with salmon. The colour of the salmon was a little off, but it tasted fine. Perhaps it wasn't as fresh that time? The presentation is nice; great if you're bringing this to a gathering. The sushi platters are also very reasonably priced, but note that it's cash only. This kind of annoyed me as I'm someone that never carries cash. 

There are a couple of tables but everyone that's sitting down is waiting for their take out order.

I noticed that one of the sushi chefs was sleeping with his head down on the table in the back corner. I thought that was funny :)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I dropped by hoping to have a quick lunch and I wasn't disappointed at all. The restaurant is quite tiny but nicely decorated on the inside with only four tall tables with bar stools and one round lower table for dining in. This means most of their business is for take-out.

They serve drinks in styrofoam cups and use plastic trays for the food. That might bother people who are concerned about the environment, but I honestly think they do it like this because they do not have the room or staff to wash hundreds of plates, silverware and cups on a regular basis.

I found the prices to be reasonable except for the beef tataki. It clearly just came out from the freezer and the pieces were so small. They did not have any more of the expensive fish (e.g. hamachi, uni) in stock, so we opted for a combination platter which the owner recommended. I thought the freshness of the fish and ingredients was adequate at this price point. I would just highly recommend sticking with basic and simple food/fish because that's what they specialize in.

I see that there are more negative reviews popping up because there are too many orders for them to handle. The owner takes all the phone calls and does the cashiering job all by himself. There was only 1 guy making the sushi the time I went. That just spells disaster for a business in the long run because they will lose too many clients due to long wait times. I do hope they stay in business for awhile because there are barely any Japanese places in this area."}
{"text":"I've only experienced one time where they were slow with executing their food, but that was because they had one sushi chef hurt and in the hospital. It did take an hour... or two, but other times they were quite good.  Fish is fresh, and pricing is really reasonable! We usually order their hokkaidon, which comes with a generous portion of sweet shrimp, salmon roe and uni... or kaisendon. I know they're new, which may explain why their prices are reasonable. Really hoping they don't go up later like other places once they get busier."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you're on a budget for sushi, so you can get great value for the sushi here. We got a platter to share. The wait was too long - we waited for 20 minutes for our platter. Each sushi we had also fell apart when we picked it up with chopsticks, which was really disappointing. The taste was pretty decent but I would prefer to pay a little extra for better quality sushi."}
{"text":"Sashimi was fresh, like the taste of the Honey mustard rolls. Price is good comparing to what you get. However, we ordered a Sashimi and sushi small party tray and waited for an hour. The sashimi worths the wait but not a fan of the servers attitude. Pretty much like giving out \"I-don't-really-care\" look all the time, and gave me a cup of boiling hot water when I asked for more water once during the whole time. I'd recommend to order takeout to avoid dealing with the servers."}
{"text":"Decently priced yummy sushi so close to where I live! It's best to order the assorted platter with the sashimi, sushi, and rolls to get the best variety. 60 pc is $40 plus tax which I think is really good compared to other sushi restaurants. This size platter is good for two really hungry people but we still had some leftovers with ours (and I was really hungry). This place looks like it's intended for take out, but I usually dine in since it's not busy when I go (usually in the morning when it opens or weekend nights). I like coming here when I'm craving some sushi but don't want to go too far to get it. There's always at least four or five guys making the orders so the food doesn't take too long if you're ordering take out. Overall, would definitely keep coming here for their decent sushi to satisfy those frequent cravings!"}
