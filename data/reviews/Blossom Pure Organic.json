{"text":"I am excited about this place. Halal, locally and sustainably sourced. I'm not as particular about the organic aspect since I believe if the animals are fed right and treated well, \"organic\" is really secondary. They are the only place that carries marrow bones to my delight! The servicing was excellent and the facilities were very clean. It's long overdue! Brownie points given for the owners knowledge of Honest Chops in NYC. :) I also purchased bottled milk and organic eggs. The milk indeed tastes fresher than regular supermarket milk. There's a $2 bottle deposits which is mentioned upfront. It's a bit far to drive out there from Toronto but it's well worth it. I plan to return for sure."}
{"text":"Although my first experience here was bad enough to warrant a two star review, my wife sent me back as she's a fan of their organic whole chickens. My past two visits have proven to me that this store actually needs to be downgraded to one star in my opinion.  These people are masters of wasting my time. My second visit here had me stand at the meat counter along with two other patient customers as they happily conducted a photo shoot of their meat behind the counter. The food stylist and the photographer addressed us and went to the back to get someone to help us. The owner guy once again came out to \"help\". He was in a nice suit so he too had to then go to the back as we waited patiently for a third person to come out to help us. I think their photo shoot could have been scheduled on any other day rather than on a busy Saturday morning.  Last visit... (ever)... I waited at the meat counter for a couple minutes before, you guessed it, the same guy came out to \"help\" me. I asked if he had any whole chickens. Here's the capper: \"No sir, sorry. As you see we have no chicken at all this week. We missed chicken order this week. Next week sir\".  Bye bye Blossom Pure."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting distinction of being the only purveyor of organic halal meat in Canada from what I have been told. My friend's family only eat halal meat and want it to be organic which is quite hard apparently so they were the one's who found it. Will make it easier for me to entertain them in the future as this place hits both marks.  Nice clean space with neatly laid out items. The variety of red meat isn't that much from what I saw and the marbling on the steak was mediocre. They do have grass fed version as well so I guess I can hold judgement till I have tried the steaks.  Otherwise plenty of options for chicken i.e ground (white and dark) packaged skinless and boneless and one can order in advance apparently to get the meat butchered to one's liking.  I also enjoyed browsing the other organic items and though wasn't looking for anything in particular found some items that peaked my curiosity. Prices were in line with other organic meats. The best part for me that even though it was Sunday the place wasn't a mad house like other spots.  I will be back for sure and will update after I have tried the all important steaks."}
{"text":"Very good quality meat, dairy and eggs. It's my go to whenever I can make the drive over. The owner is very passionate about delivering good quality products. I recommend."}
{"text":"I went to this place because they are the only ones in the whole GTA who carry Kosher/Halal and ORGANIC meat! As I walked into the store it neat and clean and surprisingly their prices were reasonable for organic meat. I bought organic/halal beef cutlets, beef stir fry, organic/halal chicken breast and legs and organic turkey breasts. All of their meats were perfectly packaged and FRESh! I also bought organic goat milk which is very hard to find in the city and few items from their organic produce section. This is the closest I have ever gotten from farm to table when it comes to buying groceries!!!"}
{"text":"I come here twice a month for the last few months.    High quality products,  their eggs are the best I've been able to find anywhere.    Chicken,  Turkey,  Grass fed beef it's all extremely fresh.     I am internationally known amongst my circle of friends for my chicken livers.   I've bought chicken livers from grocery stores,  butchers,  direct from farms from all over the GTA,  I can tell you that I typically spend alot of time trimming the livers prior to cooking.    The chicken livers I've bought from Blossom Pure are different,  they are smaller,  way less fat,  I do next to no trimming and I can definitely tell that this is coming from healthy birds.   I noticed some reviews about bad service,  Not my experience.   The owner can go on forever about where he buys this and that from,  ask him about any products they carry and he can take you back through the entire history and origin from the animals to the amazing Mennonite made preserves, butters,  maple syrups etc..    The people at Blossom Pure come across as authentic and sincere.   PS they also carry Birds &  Beans coffee here.   For those of us lucky enough to know and drink this stuff it shows how they source the highest quality  ethical products here.   Big fan!  Keep it up Blossom Pure!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Terrible, miserable, awful customer service. Wasn't greeted with so much as a GLANCE when we walked in. Grunts were given as answers when we asked simple questions. \"How much is this juice?\" *shrugs* \"I don't know...like 8.50?\" No. Don't question ME. YOU figure it out. She didn't even check after her pathetic answer. Horrible customer service. Disgusted."}
