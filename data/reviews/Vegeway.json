{"text":"first timers and plan to visit again! we had the fish tacos, chicken nuggets and hawaiian burger. fish tacos are packed with red cabbage, chopped mango, diced tomatoes + guacamole. chicken nuggets have a nice crunch and the hawaiian burger includes cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions + a grilled pineapple steak."}
{"text":"Great food. Need more vegan places like this. I tried a few different things on the menu and enjoyed them all. The mango shake was hands down the best thing I got. I just wish they would open up more around town since this one is so far from me.. but it's worth the travel every so often. I'd recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"I went there for the second time and tried their cheese burger, it tasted great. They're still lacking in customer service though. I called in an order for pick up and they didn't have it ready. Lol They had to cook it at the time I arrived (which is okay, cause it's freah) but I'm in a hurry to get back to work. A few tips are not to use their drive-thru and don't order food when you are in a rush, they have no sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Really good place to come eat! The flavor of their Hawaiian burger is beyond amazing. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always delicious meals on the go!!! Thank you for the yumminess on your menu My favorites are the Sammy and Seitan Bites"}
{"text":"Great food for someone who isn't a vegan. I love the options. Have been here a couple times and they haven't disappointed. I've tried the chicken sandwich and the burger. Both great choices."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or any sort of vegetarian. I love meat, but I wanted to try this place since it's near where I live. I ordered the burger and fries. I went through the drive thru and I waited a bit for the food to be finished. The burger I believe was made out of soy beans (?) and it wasn't too bad. I just wouldn't get it again. Their french fries was good though! The thing that got me were the prices. It was a bit overpriced to me. I recommend this to those who are vegan/vegetarian or any other sort. I'll be sticking to my meat burgers. Would I go here again? Maybe for only the fries but I would also want to try their other items."}
{"text":"The chicken wrap was delicious... full of flavors not dry at all and the coleslaw was also good w a hint of sweetness. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My hubby ordered a strawberry milk shake tasted like a vanilla shake and took SOOOO long to come out. Our food came our way before his shake. NOT COOL..We ordered the chick' N wrap and the beef sandwich. The wrap wasn't good but the beef sub was amazing. The texture was on point and the flavor was delicious."}
{"text":"Good place for Vegan food. The vegan chicken poppers where kind of oilier than I would have liked but that's ok. The vegan beef sandwich and the vanilla milkshake were awesome! Definitely going back for those two things!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! The food quality was very poor, especially for the price. I don't plan on coming back here."}
{"text":"My wife is vegan and wanted to try this \"fast-food\" vegan restaurant. While I am not vegan, all the food was vegan and it was great! I ordered the Hawaiian burger, peanut butter shake, and sweet potato fries. it was served fast and super delicious. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We used to drive to the other side of town for this place. So happy it's near us and afraid lol 
Love the drive thru. 
The veggie burger add pickles is perfection. I haven't had anything else since when I go I only want the burger! 
My daughter loves the chicken nuggets and curly fries too. 

Plant based food is my goal so this place makes it within reach! 

Clean, friendly, & delicious!"}
{"text":"I love that is a plant base fast food! I tried their cheese burger and I loved it! Definitely going back! I also loved that it was Drive in"}
{"text":"And my burger sucked. Gross. Chef Kenny ..... your food is delicious but please replace your staff or revamp standards. Also frequent visits to the restaurants, durango location looked run down."}
{"text":"Point blank this place sucks. I gave it a try for lunch one day and this is what they give me in my sandwhich. 2 jalapenos and no cilantro. So I call and the employee that answered says \"I'm sorry i will let our cooks know.\" I let her know I could have gone to subway for a 6 dollar sandwhich filled with toppings and double the size, again an apology. I wasnt fishing for a refund or discount but what i got was pitiful. She did offer a discount 
off My next purchase if i bring my picture next time. So 1 star for the crap sandwhich sandwich and 1 star for their sorry ass customer service."}
{"text":"I love their chicken ranch sandwich and fried zucchini!  Every employee I encountered was very nice as well, wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Pricing is somewhat too much for so little of a portion, but they do have a fair variety of vegan friendly alternatives. The monster fries, mango tea, and shakes omg, yess so good. Sadly, their burgers are prepared very sloppily, have a weird mushy texture to the buns & the patty is either totally burnt or undercooked. Drive through service is constantly slow especially if you're in a rush. Overall it's a cool little spot to check out. Vegas doesn't have all too many plant based restaurants."}
{"text":"First time I went here loved everything, got the burgers, fries and milkshakes that we had been missing since going vegan. Second time got pretty weird heartburn and stomach upset, as well as them forgetting some water bottles as well as ranch sides. Third time even worse heartburn and couldn't finish the burgers. So if you are a big fast food eater and are use to the norm fried foods that I'm apparently no longer able to eat then go here. Because at least you're not buying into animal slaughter. All the grease, none of the guilt"}
{"text":"I wasted 30 minutes and $8 on a sub-par chicken patty. The thing is, they didn't even get my order right. After I asked for a \"chicken\" sandwich, I waited in the drive through for 30 minutes. I would have left, but sadly I was boxed in. When I finally got to the register, they had to ask me multiple times what my order was again. I told them it was the \"chicken\" sandwich with no sauce and I instead got the regular burger imitation that was a sad room temperature. I wanted to leave so badly, but I would've been out of both lunch and 30 minutes of my time. If they couldn't get the order right, they shouldn't have opened the drive thru"}
{"text":"Strange experience. Pulled up to the drive through to order a cheeseburger for lunch. Arrived at the menu was told they were backed up so I needed to wait a moment to place my order. No problem! About 10 minutes goes by and 3 cars lined up behind me. I proceeded to remind the lady I was waiting and just too make sure she didn't forget about me. She then says we're really busy right now and again refuses to take my order. I had a conversation with the lady behind me and they couldn't believe the situation either. I decided to just drive through as I was becoming hangry at this point. No other cars had been waiting at the window so thankfully I was able to drive right out. They could have been swamped inside for all I know but this situation just seems very unprofessional. So sad because I do love Vegeway but unfortunately there always seems to be an odd encounter with a very long wait each time."}
{"text":"I am giving them 3 stars because they finally opened a Vegan restaurant in Centennial Hills! My happiness is tempered with caution, because I'm just not sure how long they will stay in business. They need to compete with other restaurants, and be so good that meat lovers (Carnists) will be willing to go there too. 

Sadly, I am the only Vegan in my family, and I was finally able to convince my Carnist Husband and son to go to Vegeway. They were out of more than one item on the menu, but we placed our order for \"fish\" tacos, veggie burgers, \"milkshake\", and fries, then sat down at a table to wait. It was a big disappointment to me that they do not have a soda machine or a refillable drink station, as that is something I enjoy when I go out to eat. We waited quite some time for the food, and when it came, only my tacos and fries showed up. My husband and son's food was nowhere to be seen. Somehow they had lost that part of our order. We showed them our receipt to verify that we had indeed ordered all of those things, then had to wait just as long as the first time to get the rest of our food. We didn't even get an apology, or offer of something to compensate. Even a free cookie for my starving son would have made an impression. I loved the fish tacos, and hubby loved the vegan milkshake, but the poor service made it so that my hubby won't take me there again.

Going out to eat as a Vegan is hardly ever an easy task, and it is so refreshing to go to a restaurant and know that anything you order is Vegan. I'm so disappointed in this place. I can get a Vegan veggie burger at quite a few places, so I would love to see more of those items that you miss as a vegan, but usually don't take the time to make for yourself. My ideas off the top of my head: vegan mac-n-cheese, brown gravy for fries, \"beef\" tacos. BBQ \"beef\"sandwiches, etc. If the menu was a little more varied, I'd go every week and leave the hubby at home."}
{"text":"I am so happy that a vegan drive-through exists! After a lifetime of vegetarianism and several years of veganism, this was my fist time at a veggie drive through. I made a special detour to the Jones location on my way to the strip. 

However, I didn't enjoy anything about the experience or the food. I noticed that the prices and the wait time parked at the pick-up window were several times more than at a traditional fast food place, which would have been fine if the service and the food were amazing. I ordered a chicken wrap, popcorn chicken and a chocolate shake. Several minutes after pulling up to the pickup window and after I'd already paid, I was told that they were out of chocolate shakes so I eventually got a cash refund. 

When my food finally came out, I was excited to eat but I noticed later that there were zero napkins and zero condiments in the bag which made it a bit difficult. The popcorn chicken was extremely greasy and flavorless and I only ate a couple of pieces, even after I went inside for condiments. The chicken wrap was also very flavorless, and there were sun-dried tomatoes (?) that were so chewy that I couldn't get through them and had to spit them out. I usually love anything with guacamole in it, but I was wishing I would have just stopped at a Chipotle instead where I would have gotten more food with flavor for less money and less wait time. In Southern California there is a vegan comfort food chain called Veggie Grill, and while it does't have a drive-through, it puts this place to shame. Sadly, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"the food was absolutely fabulous!!!!  everything was great!!! the employees were so very friendly and helpful. i love this place!!!! so happy to finally have such a great vegan restaurant in this area!!! can't wait to go back again!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Food is decent but drive thru times are ridiculous. Currently been waiting 15 minutes with only 2 cars ahead of me. I would just leave but I'm completely blocked in. I had the same issue last time and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Don't call it fast food if you have restaurant waiting times. 
I waited 27 minutes for one cheeseburger in a short drive thru line. How does that even happen? 
They don't even give you one napkin with your order. This happened last time too and I thought it was a fluke, but apparently they're the only my place that doesn't provide one napkin for your messy burger on the go? 
I really like this place but drive thru and walk in times are crazy for what they market as \"fast food.\" Are the workers trying to sabotage this place on purpose? I'm honestly befuddled by my last 2 visits and I'm not being facetious. First visit was walk-in and wait time was longer than your average fast food as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this vegan restaurant for the first time. We had the soy free burger on gluten free bread.  The burgers were tasty!  We are VERY excited about this vegan fast food restaurant with options such as soy free and gluten free. We were also told that the produce used is organic. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable about options such as gluten free that were not listed on the menu.  As a side note the owner might consider that some people eat vegan because of their compassion for animals while others choose to eat vegan for a healthier diet.  That being said , perhaps offering drink choices other than soda and water would be prudent. 
We will return!"}
{"text":"So lucky this opened up right next to me, 
absolutely love their food and so does my non-veggie boyfriend. Their white chocolate peanut butter shake is the bomb! 
I am just so grateful, it's hard eating out being vegetarian/vegan and this just makes it so much easier for us!
Now when it's late and my boyfriend asks me what I want to eat, it won't be this huge headache trying to figure out what fast food place has bean and cheese burritos since that's almost always the only vegetarian option"}
{"text":"When I discovered this place I was quite thrilled to have a vegetarian restaurant of any type in my area of town. My girlfriend and I went there fairly regularly and then, for no particular reason, took a break. I returned last month only to find the place looking shabby. The sauce and condiments area was not maintained. There were empty spaces on the walls where posters of their food and additional locations used to be. The menu had been reduced or changed. Yesterday I went back with my girlfriend only to find it had further declined. Someone has purchased 1980's video games and is storing them in the restaurant. One is jammed into a space by the cash register. These machines are not operational. They're just stashed in awkward places. The restrooms were closed. The sandwiches seemed smaller. We had to ask for sauce since it wasn't provided. I am pretty sure we will never return. We are not picky people, but it felt like we walked into someone's attic and asked them to make us a sandwich. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"This is the best vegetarian steak sandwich I have ever had, can't wait to go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great I uses to be a repeat customer. The staff is great! Very friendly. But this review is mostly about the food. I believe they have changed the burger recipe. I bite into my much anticipated deliciousness....But it was different. I thought that maybe I bit into some paper...o.k I take another bite. It was the same. The texture was off. I couldn't finish it. I love this resturants. Please change your recipe back to the way it was."}
{"text":"Hey what's going on? Our first experience was really great. I see you doing better and doing more on social media and in surprised to find the dinning area dingy. This other couple finished their meals before their fries ever showed up?! Bummer. So we ordered a combo and after the fact we asked for our drink options and find that you could have a coke, root beer or Diet Coke... or an option of iced teas. I'd imagine you can refill your tea if you chose but their soda is not coming from a fountain but from a case. So I doubt you can refill your soda. Our order was just called out to us instead of the previous \"we'll bring it out to you\" and now my partner is standing by for our fries as well. So not sure what's go by on back there. For two burgers and fries and a drink at 21$ this has become very disappointing. It's dirty everywhere table chairs trash and drink area. And I'm sorry.. cool idea for a tv but the cable mess it super tacky. And an HBO documentary on the Boston bombing is playing. Appetite killer much. Oh and while the cashier could fill her drink 3 times during our visit.. I'm not sure how she missed the mess in the dinning area. 
... can not even eat this food soggy fries and the burger were just really gross. Not cooked perhaps. Food was so bad it was offensive. Never coming back.. blah!"}
{"text":"Mess.......this location is new but the same issues apply.

Consistency and quality of food.

I love you Chef Kenny.....but sorry.

FrankenFood thats what hubby calls it.

I have tried and tried to like this food but its seriously one star for me. Thinking about it even gives me a \"film\" coating in my mouth. 

The third time I came here (today) I got the chkn wrap and seriously it weighted ten pounds. I was scared to even try it. Full of Veggie House brown rice, gooey chkn, tons of sundried tomatoes, wilty lettuce....just not good.


The burger patty is ok, but todays was dry like a hockey puck. The first time I tried one it had a melted plastic taste because of the Daiya, two more times I minus the cheese and onion and realize it just does not taste like a burger, why? no pickles. This place does not believe in pickles.

The fysh taco is good but wow its soggy and just a mess.  
The first time I tried, it had a great taste, guess I was super hungry.

Chkn bites are super gross and doughy and the \"ranch\" tastes like oily old dill.

Milkshakes are bomb but hey the ice cream is from Perfect Scoop. 

I did order curly fries and they taste exactly like the ones from Arby's I ate 20 years ago. Not a reason to come back.  

Just not a fan. Jones location......same experience. 
And consistency is a huge issue here and at the other location!"}
{"text":"Well...it was worth a try. I'm a frequent vegan/vegetarian food eater so my expectations could be higher than most. The vegan cheese just didn't do it for me. I felt it ruined the burger. 

I'll probably try other items on their menu and update my review as I try them. For now, the burgers were okay but I wouldn't buy it again. The sweet potato and regular fries were good as well as their spicy dipping sauce. 

My husband who is not vegetarian and surprisingly liked the Hawaiian burger. He said he would give it a 7 out of 10 and would buy it again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. We love veggie house who serves fabulous Asian food. However, vegeway was awful. The lady cooking the burger did not have a hair net & her hair was barley up, that's gross given the fact that fans were blowing & her hair most likely ends up in people's food.
Don't waist your money the food is awful. They were very unorganized & were out of ketchup containers, napkins, milkshakes, ..... it was ridiculous"}
{"text":"Being vegan for a while now, I didn't ever really think that it was possible to have vegan food that tasted so unhealthy. I understand not all brands taste great do not get me wrong, it's not always easy finding vegan food chains which provide 5 star meals. I did not want to judge my experience based on going there once, so I decided I'd give them another chance. However, their food not only tasted terrible on the several occasions I've been there, it left me feeling nauseous and gave me a nasty stomach ache. I also understand that it is hard to efficiently produce meals in a timely manner when they are so short staffed, but the fact I have had to wait fifteen minutes for one chocolate shake is astounding to me, especially considering I was the only car in line. I understand vegan food is hard to find in North West Las Vegas but I can assure you it is not only a waste of time going to Vegeway, but a complete waste of money as well."}
{"text":"Super inconsistent. Menu is always changing, food quality has changed and they are always out of something. I was craving the beef sandwich and of course they didn't have it. Disappointing. I hope they can get it together so I can come back."}
{"text":"Disappointing,  been there twice. Food was pretty good 1st time but out of fried zuchinni, this time theyre out of it again? Waited for 1/2 hr in the drivethru, no food, no one saying,  hi its going to b a while,  nothing, then a guy comes to the window w an order w a drink, i know i didnt order one so i say whats that, i didnt order a drink, he says let me check,  looks confused,  cant seem to work register, theres 3 girls & a guy behind him running around but it looks like no one is actually doing anything. Finally i say, ill just take a refund bcz really half hr in a drive thru & still no food. They cannot figure out what food is in the bag,  doesnt know where my order is. Gives me my money, no apology, nothing. Im starving! Wow, will not go back there & this is so sad!"}
{"text":"So far every time i go to order monster fries which are literally the best thing, they are out of cheese. Literally like my 3 or 4th time in the last few weeks. I'm so disappointed, I guess I'll just stop getting those delicious fries. Why is there never cheese ?!"}
{"text":"AMAZING - drive thru, fresh and delicious VEGAN food! Prices are good, quality is very good. Friendly staff, food is cooked fresh. The orders come out correct, even when custom.
thanks Chef Kenny for another awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for like 3 days, and I've already eaten here twice for lunch. It's healthy fast food with an all vegetarian menu."}
{"text":"So far they are getting 5 stars. I went yesterday and ordered the vegan cheese burger and fries combo. A little pricier than other places with regular meat patties but it was well worth it. The burger was large and delicious. The fries were obviously fresh, a tad greasy/heavy but still delicious. The food had a diner feel to it. I'll be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Thanks chef Kenny for opening up this new location! I tried it today and it's just as delicious and wonderful as the one on Jones. Super friendly and happy employees, tasty food, not a bad waiting time for the drive thru. I mean, what more could a vegan girl ask for? 
Even if you aren't vegan, this place has got some seriously tasty food that is absolutely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Usually delicous and slow...tonight was excruciatingly painful. From order to out 25 minutes. Wont be back :("}
{"text":"First time going to a vegan restaurant and I've got to say this place is pretty good.  Ordered the wrap and fries and both were good.  Fresh ingredients and very tasty.  Staff was very polite and friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their double cheeseburger is out of this world:-) I know it's supposed to be fast food, but their service is anything but fast, which is disappointing. I've been there twice now. One time I dined in and another time I use their drive-through which literally took 15 minutes and I was the only person in the drive-through LOL. Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I used to love Vegeway.  This is strictly for the Location in the Northwest.  I heard that the original owner either sold or franchised this location and boy it shows.  I usually try to call my order in so I am not sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for my food.  They either shut off or just stopped answering their phone.  So once again I tried to call my order in and they did not answer.  After trying twice, my wife and I drove the 15 minutes only to find out they were out of what we wanted, the soy beef, this is not the first time.  When I questioned them about the phone, they just told me sorry about that.  They have also eliminated fountain drinks.  I'm going to go back to the south side location to see if it's changed. The north side location has lost me as a customer.  It's a shame.  It was so good when it first opened."}
{"text":"Had the cilantro salad with tofu.  Was pretty good and healthy.  I was really annoyed with the rock n roll music they had blasting obnoxiously.  Would go back and try the veggie burger"}
{"text":"I love that Vegeway has opened in Vegas to give vegans a fast food option for their specialized diet and to allow meat eaters easier access to the occasional tasty, meat-free meal. I really enjoyed the burger I had at their first location (and raved about it in my review!) and looked forward to trying more of their menu here.

The burger did not live up to my memories- bun was dry, cheese was cold, whole thing was barely room temperature. It seemed like it had been sitting out, very disappointing.
I tried the popcorn \"chicken\" and curly fries- texture was okay but neither had much flavor. I like that they have a dipping sauce available at the drink station. Would like to see them offer \"chicken strips\" as an option in the future, and/or more dipping sauces.

Two ways in which this location favorably compares to the other is their service (much friendlier!) and this location feels more spacious. Parking is still a bit tight. Drive-thru available!"}
{"text":"I Love the vegan food here, it's delicious and the beast burger is the best! The chicken burger tastes a lot Berta's too and their burgers aren't as oily as the other location. They a lot more varieties in here than the other location. I just wish they had turmeric salad but this place is wonderful."}
{"text":"You can't tell its not meat!   The cheese burger and how Hawaiian burger are amazing...If you love in and out but can live without the reflux from the grease.......go here"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because a few of my vegetarian friends said it was pretty good. As this was my first time trying vegan food, it is pretty good. The employees were friendly and gave good recommendations, and I'm sure a lot of people appreciate the drive thru. I ordered the monster (curly) fries and the hawaiian burger. Both had a good sauce, and the portions were a lot bigger than I was expecting! Overall, it is a good place, but I just feel like it isn't a place for me. I'm glad I tried it though because it is good!"}
{"text":"Good was really good, but the vegan shakes is where the magic is. 

Oh

Em 

Gee

Idk what they put in these but crack and magic. They taste better than traditional milkshakes. 

The sweet potato fries were womp womp womp. The #1 was good. Wish I read reviews that told me about the sauce first. It was sweet and terrible. Not good on a burger. 

I'll be back for the shakes."}
{"text":"I am going to give them a 3 stars because I am glad there is a vegan place in centennial hills. This was only my first time going but I loved their sweet potato fries and their vegan ranch and Cajun sauce. I also ordered the chorizo taco and a chickpea wrap (instead of chicken).  The taco was very basic just dab of guac and cilantro. The wrap was ok. Full of veggies which I loved but I feel it would be nice if the tortillas are warmed and not cold and stiff. The staff was ehhh, I won't go on a rant. Maybe because it was late they were tired ?. But I will try this place again but feel the menu could be a little better with many salad options and such. But I get the concept of the burgers and drive through vegan style."}
{"text":"Today, was my first time trying this place. I was really disappointed. I had ordered a #2 (double burger) and from the drive thru menu I assumed it was a meal. I ordered a chicken wrap for myself and sweet potato fries. I waited longer than I would have liked, but it's Saturday at noon so I figured it was busy. I pulled up to the window. No greeting just told me my total and gave them my money. Took a good while to get my food. I realized they never asked what drink I wanted with the burger meal so I waited till she came back. I waited probably 3 minutes before I gave up. No one came back to the window at all to ask if anything was wrong with my order. Didn't get a chance to even ask questions because no one ever came back even though I was staring at everyone  inside. Food was mediocre at best. Service wasn't impressive. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes! The food was mediocre Ok. There are so many more great vegan burgers in the market than what I experienced here. They were out of a lot of things; chocolate and burritos being on the list. The appearance on the inside was dirty and run down. Employees were carrying grocery bags from different stores (and they were still out of things). What is with the broken arcade games shoved in the corner? I am so disappointed. I wanted this to be a fabulous experience, but received the latter."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this quaint little place.  The people are friendly and the food is quite tasty.  Everything is freshly prepared, Alisha was the clerk I spoke with and she gave recommendations.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I regularly eat vegeway but for some reason, their food just keeps getting better and better! Their monster fries are to die for, tasting so much better than anything I've gotten from in n out and free of the cruelty and lactose!! Rich in flavor, they top with melted daiya cheese, caramalized onions and vegan thosand island. Also had a cookies and cream milkshake, which was amazing as well. The doubles are also the way to go. These burgers are so good, I think it could turn any meat eater into a happy vegan burger lover. My body thanked me"}
{"text":"One of the better vegan burgers I've had in a long time. The service was the worst service I've ever had in a fast food joint, hands down! Drive thru speaker didn't work had me screaming my order from my car. I had to back out and go inside for Togo which the order was still wrong, waited 27 minutes and they did not pack it Togo! I packed it MYSELF!!! At least it was hot and yummy. Not sure if I'll go back due to service alone.

So I have since returned, only because I love the food and the service is much better. Still a long wait but worth it.  #happyvegan"}
{"text":"They advertise that they have gluten free options but I came in today and they do not. All I can order is sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Went for cilantro salad which was amazing and they took it off the menu ordered a burger once and tasted too much like real meat and that's not for me. Nice people. Bring back the cilantro salad and I'll come back"}
{"text":"My friend and I were super excited to try this place. We were really disappointed.
Burger: all we tasted was vegan cheese. 
Popcorn chicken: great consistency, no flavor. None. Tasted like nothing. Even dipping it just didn't help. We thought for a moment, is this a mistake? Did they forget to season it?
Zucchini: good. Cooked just right and tasted really fresh but so bland. Again, did they forget to season? 
Chocolate milkshake: yum! 
I will definitely be back to give it another try, I'm really rooting for this place but they need to step up the flavor. I'm not even a picky eater and between the two of us we didn't finish the food."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Veggie House for a long time, so when I heard the mastermind behind it was launching Vegeway, my ears perked up. When I heard it was opening in my NW neck of the woods, i knew it was fate.

I had imagined I would just get a burger until I saw a friend's IG post of her bahn mi sandwich...y'all, i literally got in my car and drove there. 

It did not disappoint! The \"meat\" had a great texture and the flavor was delicious, I would have loved that filling mixture over rice with some steamed veggies and more of the sauce, so good! (Definitely going to Veggie House soon!) 

Since it was Fryday I felt like it was my duty to try their sweet potato fries. They were great, very fresh and hot. 

Tiny criticism would be that I wish the sandwich was warm, I did stop next door to pick up a tea at Perfect Scoop, and drive back to my house, but my fries were still warm, so there's that. 

Anyway, I would definitely stop back in for a  veggie burger and to get the sweet potato fries again."}
{"text":"I'm not even vegan but wow it's very good. I had the burger and curly fries with ranch and a white chocolate peanut butter shake. I went the next day and got the same thing. Very impressed with the quality and how tasty it all is. Highly recommend this place to everybody not just someone who is vegan."}
{"text":"Wow. I LOVE this place. I was sad that they moved the bruddahs but this is a great replacement and I left Soooo full. The staff is so friendly and interactive. I'll defiantly be going back soon"}
{"text":"This place.... 

I pulled in (Drive through) with my dog and ordered the popcorn chicken some zucchini and French fries. (My eyes were bigger than my stomach) ordering was pretty easy but the drive through window isn't the easiest to access. Anyways... I was there for at least 30 minutes after I paid waiting for my food.... I was expecting about 5 -10 minutes. 
I get home and am ready to eat, and a few bites in I realised this is beyond greasy!!  Seriously !? It was dripping from the bag!!!! The food itself isn't bad, but the cooking oil is not the correct kind. Pretty tasty and I guess the timeframe is fair considering it's fresh ??? Unhealthy vegan food.... for when you're really bad. ;)"}
{"text":"PREFACE: I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I'm just an average, run of the mill omnivore, and that's the perspective from which I'm reviewing this place. I decided to check out this place because I live nearby, I like to support local businesses, and I felt like eating healthy this particular lunch. 

First impressions : The service was a bit lacking, but I only saw 3 people working. So they may have just been understaffed. One thing that really caught me off guard is just how basic their menu is. I didn't realize before I came in that this place was basically a vegan take on a fast food burger joint. Literally the menu is: Burger, vegan burger, vegan fish sandwich, vegan chicken sandwich, vegan fish tacos, vegan beef sandwich, vegan chicken wrap, and then a few sides and one salad (this was the biggest surprise to me. A vegan restaurant with only one salad? Very interesting). They also don't appear to have any particularly creative or \"signature\" dishes.

Because of this, I went with the burger. Not knowing what exactly to expect, the burger was pretty average by meat-eater standards, but the blend of spices was reminiscent of Mediterranean food or even something middle-eastern. It wasn't bad, but I also wouldn't say that it made the burger amazing. The curly fries were good by any standards. 

Overall, I'm giving it four stars because my instinct was 3, but I also went in with incorrect expectations of the menu. So I gave them an extra star for leeway. I'll try it again sometime and update with how I feel after going in with intent."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Truly the best veggie burgers I've ever had in my life. I took a bite and Genuinely thought I was having a real meat burger. The milkshake was amazing too. I will be back for as long as my wallet can handle lol! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time ever having a vegan burger as this new plant based / vegetarian diet is new to me and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! There was a slight after taste and I realized a few bites in it was the \"cheese\" I didn't care for. Reg fries were fresh and cooked perfectly. Staff was nice and knowledge. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The menu is all meat substitutes like burgers and chicken sandwiches. The fried zukes are some of the best I've ever had, definitely the best from fast food. The owner of this place owns a veggie place in China town that is really good and we didn't know they were affiliated until we got here. The food here is the quality that I would have expected had I known, A+

Service was acceptable. The staff is friendly but poorly executed taking our order, said they would bring it to the table then called us up to the counter. We were the only people in the restaurant so I'm not sure why they would offer this and then not follow through, especially as we wouldn't have expected this without them mentioning it

Some things which I could see that did not greatly impact my experience one way or the other but is telling of how the restaurant is run; several sodas in the fountain were out of order, the water cooler wasn't stocked, tv was off, floor needs sweeping and tables need wiping (we were the only ones here, how long were they dirty?)

All in all I will return several times a week"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a place like this to open up for a long time. The breakfast Sammy hit the spot, the milkshakes are amazing and the burgers are super tasty. Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love how there's more Vegan drive-thru's popping up in Vegas! We decided to eat inside and travel to the Centennial Hills location to try their breakfast Sammy and beyond burger. They both were delicious! And it didn't take as long as how it takes if you were to order through the drive-thru (takes quite a long time.. I've waited over 10 minutes the 3x I went through the drive-thru). I only hope they'd stop serving Coke, Sprite, anything w High-Fructose Corn Syrup & go w the natural sodas to make it more \"health conscious\" I guess you can say. 

Nonetheless, I loved the Sammy. I prefer no tofu.. which I took out after this pic was taken cause I thought it was another hash brown lol. Next time I'll just order double hash brown!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, went back the 2nd time, the internet said they were open but when we arrived they were closed."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets, they made my turning vegan so much easier. The employees are always so wonderful. The only complaint I have is that they are always running out of something. Other then that they are beyond perfect"}
{"text":"Let me just say I am a big fan of Veggie House so when I heard that the owner was responsible for Vegeway I was really excited. 

I got the hamburger meal which I was totally excited about.  I substituted the regular fries for the sweet potato fries.  We also ordered a cilantro salad which we heard the cook staff make very loud comments about how he loved that salad, how good it was and how happy he was to make it.  He did all this in a British accent.  Later it disappeared but not before ten minutes of listening to him talk about whatever came to his mind.  At least he didn't swear. 

The burger was very good. The problem I had with it was there was nothing on it as far as condiments go.  I understand that mayonaise would be a \"no no\" but what about mustard and ketchup on the burger?!  Yes, there were big vats of ketchup on the counter but some of us like those condiments to seep into the burger and mingle with the other tastes going on there.  That, of course, is a personal preference. 

The sweet potato fries were very good.  The manager came by and asked how our meal was which I appreciated.  Will I go back? You betcha."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. I only been here twice each time they are out of what I asked. I ordered a soda and the girl gave me an option of the old school coke and a Coke Zero while a soda machine was right behind them. I asked the girl if the machine was broken and she smiled and said no but then acted like a deer in head lights then shut the window. Had I not asked for ice they would have given me a can. Very unorganized and not sure they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I want to love you, but I just don't.

I would much rather make a Gardein or Beast Burger at home.

The patties are pretty good. But the bread, cheese, etc...it just tastes like the absolute worst, not fresh quality.

As a veg, I like fresh & high quality veggies. No excuse for pink, flavorless tomatoes.

The cheese is like \"cheese product\" orange #4 flavor. It sticks to the roof of your mouth.

The popcorn chicken didn't even taste chickeny & there are a few dozen good chxn analogs at Smith's freezer aisle right now, so there's no excuse.

Zucchini were ok, kinda greasy soggy.

The ranch didn't really taste as accurately \"ranch\" as say, Daiya or Annie's (I think) vegan ranch dressings, but it is actually really good as a dipping sauce anyhow. The herbs are yummy. But I would take it home & make the fries at home, because the ones they have are so meh, soggy, nothing to write home about.

Milkshake was TOO fudgey chocolatey & icy & not milky creamy enough. It took like an hr to be meltable enough to go through the straw right. This was both times at two different locations. It didn't fit the taste of a traditional choc milkshake which is pretty easy to veganize.

The mango was just like, vitamin flavor creamsicle. Not good.

I love having a vegan option around here (5min away), but I just wish it was better. Sigh. We don't even go there when we are dead tired & hungry, it's that disappointing."}
{"text":"I am thrilled beyond belief that this is opened up so close to my house. I absolutely love everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Compared to other vegan restaurants in town, the food is not the greatest. Its not horrible, but the shakes are a bit watered down. They've got lots of options, but keep in mind that they are not always available. I came in for their sweet potato fries but they were discontinued! Also, was not informed that adding cheese was an additional .50 and curly fries were extra as well. I ended up paying almost $16 for a meal with curly fries and a shake. I'm going to stick with veggy street or violette's from now on."}
{"text":"Double Vegan Burger was a very flavorful soy Veggie pattie that had a sweetness to it that I could not tell if it came from the vegan cheese or the Veggie pattie itself. Burger came topped with lettuce, tomato, and onion. 

Fried Zucchini had a light crisy rice flour batter. Came served with a side of ranch for dipping. Not all zucchini were covered with batter as we got towards the bottom of the dish.

Curly fries were typical of any place you would visit. A little undercooked for me. I would prefer it if the cooked a little longer to give the outside of the potato some crunch and not be do mushy. 

Vegan Chicken Wrap was the best item we had. Soy based fake chicken accompanied by brown rice, lettuce,  cucumber,  and guacamole wrapped in a flour tortilla.  Tasted good and was a very filling portion. I would order this again."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. 
If I could give 10 stars, I would. 
I just had AMAZING service. 
Jules helped me in the drive thru and helped me with my order. She was super sweet. I changed my fry order at the window last minute and she was very accommodating. They had an extra order of zucchini fries and gave me FREE zucchini fries. I was so so happy!!!! 
Eli was also sweet. They both made my day. Thank you VegeWay!!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Almost immediately after trying to eat this nasty slop I got the worst stomach cramping. So not worth it. Should have just gone home and had avocado toast... and to top it off she asked if I wanted the meal to add a drink. I said yes, and guess what. She forgot my drink too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites places to go when I am on the run, is vegan fast food.
My daughter loves the wrap and I always get the burger and sometimes the zucchini fries."}
{"text":"I am not vegan, but I've been trying to find more vegan places out here to try. I was extremely impressed with the food I ordered when I came. The Hawaiian burger was to die for. The curly fries were great as well. I can't wait to come back and try different options on their menu."}
{"text":"I came in here tonight to give it a try. I am not vegetarian or vegan but like to balance my meals. And every once in awhile eat meatless. The food was good but that's about the only good thing. The restaurant was dirty. The floors were dirty. The few tables they did have set up were dirty. In fact I had to clean off a table to be able to sit down. There was absolutely no decor. It looked like there was construction going on, on what use to be booths. There were things covered with towels. The \"milk shake bar\" wasn't set up. The whole restaurant just felt run down and dirty. The girl that took our order had no personality what so ever. In fact she seemed annoyed when we ordered. I asked for sweet potato fries and she said the discontinued those. Um why are they still on your menus? Overall I don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"Get the Hawaiian! Very delicious food. The only improvement I'd make is increase beverage selection"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday at 12:58 PM and they're closed yet the sign says \"open daily\". Drove all the way to Centennial Hills for nothing. Thanks!"}
{"text":"First time here and must say it was pretty good. Clean and good service. Very delish and filling. I will come back again and the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Super yummy and well worth the wait. They gave us a free cookie for the wait too. The staff is friendly and the options are amazing!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I was extremely disappointed. The restaurant was short staffed during my visit and it took about 25 minutes for me to get my food-- not because the place was packed, there were only 2 other people waiting.

After waiting for 10 minutes, the cashier/cook told me that they ran out of bread (after I paid for my meal - $16 for a sandwich + fries) and asked if I would like to have a wrap instead or get my money back. I didn't want my money back since I already waited for 10 minutes! She wasn't apologetic for the inconvenience. Annoyed would be more of an accurate description.

While I waited, a customer from the drive-thru stormed into the restaurant and demanded to know why it was taking so long. She even told an incoming customer to not bother ordering because she was waiting for 15 min+ in the drive thru.

The wrap was okay, not terrible. The tortilla was flaky and it looked like it was old. I bit into it and it made a mess. Not worth it. 

Reading through the other reviews, it seems that many Yelpers share my sentiments. This place is poorly managed, shows a lack of customer service and unwillingness to improve."}
{"text":"Mediocre vegan burger. The portion wasn't that big (at least for me), I was hungry in two hours or so. Ordered the vegan burger and the sweet potato fries w/ a drink, there was barely any fries, a lot of the drink choices were out of orders. While people compare this to vegan in-n-out, I'd rather get in n out, tastes wayyy betters and cheaper too, and I usually like veggie burgers!"}
{"text":"Vegeway is great.  All vegan style burgers, fries, shakes.  All fresh, all flavorful, the best.  Try the sweet potato fries.  I usually don't like them at restaurants, but they are unreal here!"}
{"text":"I came back to this place because I had a wonderful experience the last time. Staff was great and treated me well but today A girl named Destiny not only did she mess up my order.. she didn't want to accommodate the fact that I wanted to mix my milkshake with strawberry and chocolate. I was recommended last time to do that and so I liked it and wanted to order again but Destiny tells me they can't do that if they're busy. Why even suggest to do it if your not willing to do it in the future. She had poor customer service. She also didn't listen to my on my order. I wanted plain fries not monster fries. She also comments when she heard she didn't get my order right. \"Are you kidding me\"! Excuse me but you didn't listen correctly to my order so \"are you kidding me\" you can't get a simple order correct. I'll be back because I like the food there but hopefully management can train her better to have better customer service with people."}
{"text":"I got the #1 with mango tea it was BOMB!!!! And all the ladies were super excited to be working there! 

Thank you ladies for great service and delicious fast food!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and fresh. I really love their take on a banh mi sandwich. So many flavors layered in. It's quite delicious. The staff is very friendly. Only complaints are that it's a bit pricey and the drive thru can be a bit slow. But neither of these things have kept me from returning. I've been 3 times in last couple months. Best bet is to order ahead and pick it up."}
{"text":"I am beyond thrilled that Chef Kenny opened a second location so close to me as driving 42 miles RT to the Jones location was getting a bit too much. 
I've tried everything on the menu and have zero complaints. From the double double to the fish tacos, sooo delicious. The fries are great too, be sure to ask for fry sauce, an added bonus to the taste buds.  
And definitely don't forget to try the milkshakes! I promise, you will not be dissapointed. Another plus is that they have a convenient drive thru and all food is made to order. 
Even if you're not vegan, please give Vegeway a chance. As I've taken several friends that are meat eaters and they all say the same thing, \"I can't tell the difference \" \"this food is delicious.\"
They liken it to a vegan In N out Burger.

This is by far, the best fast food joint in Las Vegas! 5stars!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, and the food was delicious. We ate the cheeseburger with curly fries and a shake. All of us ate everything, and 2 of us aren't even vegans.  I would totally recommend this place. Plus, they own the dessert type store across the lot. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So happy they made one up north. Cheeseburger is spot on and for those who dont want a burger how about a Vietnamese sand which."}
{"text":"So yummy! I've had at least half the menu and it's all good. Recently got the fish tacos, the mango salsa made it amazing. Also, the milkshakes are a favorite. Sometimes there will be additional flavors that aren't on the menu. I got a white chocolate peanut butter shake. Omgggg. So bomb. I'm getting hungry writing this review."}
{"text":"Fast food vegetarian is something I've been waiting to happen.  The price is fair and the food is that greasy delicious you just crave.  Put one in Henderson and I'll be there more often."}
{"text":"Solid order/ Monster Curly fries, Hawaiian or Impossible burger Hawaiian style, and a white chocolate peanut butter milkshake or just the chocolate . Everything else is a hit or miss. Chef Kenny (owner) owns an actual restaurant called veggie house, go there: it's vegan Chinese food; my vegan and non vegan friends and family love & crave it."}
{"text":"I have no idea what people are talking about, when they say, \"even if you don't like vegan food, there are good foods here.\"  This place is disgusting.  And way over priced.  Will never back.  $8.00 for a cilantro salad, just greens.  Come on!"}
{"text":"Great vegan fast food. Took 20 minutes on a slow day but it was great none the less. I'd definitely recommend to anyone wanting some plant based awesomeness!!"}
{"text":"I love this place for fast food but today they surprised me when they had no tofu for 3 of my cilantro salads at 2:20 pm. They gave me the meatless chicken instead. Service was quicker today and staff was apologetic for the inconvenience. I hope this doesn't happen often. Thank you Chef Kenny for bringing Vegan food to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I am not a veggie but I like to check in at Veg Places every now and then to see how close they have come to replicating real beef. I ordered a cheeseburger, sweet potato fries, and a strawberry milk shake. The cheeseburger was OK and the meat texture, aroma and taste was pretty close to ground beef. I would give it an 8 out of 10. The fries were OK but a little dry and somewhat lacking in taste. The milkshake taste as if it was clearly made from non dairy products and missed the creamy taste that you normally get with a milkshake. You can see as depicted in the picture the milkshake has a vanilla colored appearance even though it was a strawberry shake. 

The restaurant staff was nice but appear to learning the job as they go along. I ordered my meal as an eat in, yet the clerk bagged it as a to go order. The meal is a bit on the pricey side as my bill was $12.32. Interestingly they also sell the \"raw\"burger patties for those who want to cook there own at home. 

All in all it is a nice break from the traditional beef fast food and I will give them another visit. After all this will probably be our future someday."}
{"text":"Great customer service from Ashton; great food and-music! I highly recommend Vegeway."}
{"text":"Very disgusting! Food was extremely greasy. Taste like it was cooked in old grease. Not worth the $40.00 I spent. Such a waste."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this location a chance after a less-than-stellar experience at their other restaurant, but unfortunately this visit was not any better. There was only one other car in front of me in the drive-thru, and I sat there for 20 minutes waiting to get to the window. There was no acknowledgement of my wait, and by the time I got my food, my milkshake was 3/4 melted and my burger was pretty much cold. I didn't even eat half of my food before I threw it all away (and I'm not a picky eater by any stretch of the imagination). Overall, I wouldn't have been so bothered by the wait if the food was good, but I feel like I just wasted $12 for a burger and shake that I barely touched and could have made better at home. I won't be returning to Vegeway."}
{"text":"This place has the slowest service I've ever experience. As a vegan, I want to support this establishment, but one can only have so much patience. I've waited so long at this place that I once received free sides just to keep me waiting. I've been stuck in the drive through for about 20 mins to where I've left. I've also been told that they are currently out of many items on the menu. This is clearly bad management. Hire and train more people, do something..."}
{"text":"CAUTION IMAGE NOT REAL BEEF but it sure as heck is the best tasting Vegan/Vegetarian/meatless burger hands down! VEGE-WAY may sound peculiar, but this place has somehow recreated the famous IN-n-OUT Burger, Fries and milkshake all in a Vegan menu.  THEY NAILED IT."}
{"text":"The burger was really really delicious! It reminds me of in n out! The staff wasn't very friendly. My friend also has a but allergy and was advised not to eat here because they cross contaminate. The food was really good but I wish the service and place would have been better."}
{"text":"We came here because 1. There's a buy one get one free burger special for today only (find the picture on their Instagram page) and 2. My daughter loved the one on the other side of town. 

We ordered two burgers and curly fries. They no longer have sweet potato fries. We showed the picture at the window and at first they were going to add another burger to the order.  We had to let her know that we just want two burgers. They got that squared away and about 5 ministers or so later we got our single burger. 

We came home and started eating it and realized it's not the same burger as the one we had at veggeway on the other side of town. This was more of a veggie burger (you can see the carrots). Yes I know this is a Vegas restaurant but the picture on the drive thru windows shoes what looks like real meat. The one we got st the other location looked and tasted like real meat. This one was mushy and tasted nothing like meat. It was okay, not the best. Just disappointed in it. Chances are we won't come back and if we are craving a burger we will look for another place or drive across town to get it. 

I understand new owners new recipe but still....at least change the picture on the menu board to make it look like what it really is."}
{"text":"Great vegan burger!  The mango shake was yummy too.  I will be back!  Thanks for being here!"}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good. They have about 5 things on the menu. The only thing I've tried are their \"fish\" tacos. I loved those things. I don't live near this place but I would make special trips just for those tacos. Unfortunately, they removed one of the 5 items from their menu... my favorite fish tacos. It was really nice to see a vegetarian place have something other than veggie burgers. Now, that's all they have. I haven't tried their veggie burgers, but if they're anything like those tacos, I'm sure they're good."}
{"text":"fat kids dream come true.... this is now my favorite place to eat. the vegan shakes  are amazing the tea is also  amazing . the food was so flipping good I couldn't believe it was vegan . price was decent $20 for 2 people to eat with leftovers. this will be my weekly spot to eat for sure."}
{"text":"Zero star! Tried this place for the first time today. Waited 15 minutes in the drive thru and ended up with burnt sweet potato fries, watered down chocolate milk shake and Hawaiian burger that was okay. Could've spent my $16 in McDonalds and would've been happy! Never going back to this place again! Plus almost 50% of the menu was sold out!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but neither me or my girlfriend are not feeling veg-way at all. We've been all over Vegas to all the vegan restaurants and this is probably last on the list. I never would want to take business away from a place but don't be fooled in thinking because it's \"vegan\" it's the healthier option. Food doesn't taste that good and most things are deep fried. Everything is based from soy and that's not the \"plant based\" we are looking for. This was our second time trying it because we decided to give the new location a try but were disappointed again. If you want to try it feel free but we won't be going back. Much rather go to veg nation downtown or violettes vegan. I hope they succeed but like I said, we won't be recommending this place and will not be going again."}
{"text":"Marcel is simply amazing! Amazing! He was super welcoming and suggested great items to try. Even though his co workers were not friendly to him, he remained professional and upbeat. The food was great and Marcel went out of his way to make sure we had a great experience and he's the ONLY reason why we'll come back because his co workers were super rude to him!"}
{"text":"Love the food when they have it. Usually only about 1.5 items are actually available, and then it takes about 37 minutes to get the food out i reallllyyyy wanna love this place but gosh"}
{"text":"Vegeway has become one of my go to vegan restaurants. This was my first time dining at the Durango location and I ordered the ranch chicken sandwich with sfried zucchini.

The sandwich was really good; however, I do have to dock them for the lack of ranch they put on there. When I removed the bun it literally looked like there was less than a teaspoon of ranch and I had to ask for more on the side/

The fried zucchini was okay, the zucchini itself was still pretty crunchy and seemed like it could've been cooked a little longer. I'll probably be sticking to their curly fries in the future because they're always on point 

My mother got the beyond burger and it was delicious! After I tasted it I wished that I had ordered it. Out of all the vegan burgers in the world this one definitely comes the closest to tasting like a real burger, if not better! The flavor and texture mimic that of a beef patty perfectly!"}
{"text":"Glad I purchased a groupon. My husband and I purchased burger combos and an order of popcorn chicken. Food was not tasty. The shakes were ok.  The person who took our order was excellent. There was another young lady who also worked there who was very obnoxiois. She does not need to be customer service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Came here with my vegan brother to try our first veggie In-n-Out and it didn't disappoint. I also had popcorn \"chicken\" that was super yummy. Their vegan ranch and chipotle sauce was great and the curly fries were amazing. The only reason I can't give them all 5 stars is because we had a vanilla milkshake that just tasted like plain almond milk ice cream. They look so yummy in the pictures, we were expecting more. Overall, it's gotta be the best vegan fast food in town if it isn't the only!"}
{"text":"We have been going to vegeway north pretty much since it opened as we live right down the street and even though there have been long waits in the drive thru it has typically been well worth the wait. This experience however was the worst experience had thus far. We wanted to try the new \"curry bowl\" if you can even call it that! I literally ate the curry portion of the bowl in 3 bites that's how small it was. There was like 3 pieces of onion and maybe a piece of bell pepper. The curry was also cold,not Luke warm, but cold. The rice was hard. I took one bite of it and was done. Vegeway had recently stated on Instagram that the fries would no longer be soggy. I can assure you that they were the furthest thing from crispy that you could have in a fry. I find it pretty upsetting that they can charge 16$ for two curry bowls and a side of fries and you actually have to have more food at home because part of the meal was so small and the other part was inedible. Honestly, if the quality of the food gets any worse I don't see myself coming back, which truly is a shame because as a vegan who works really long days, sometimes it's nice to be able to swing by a drive thru and get something to eat for my boyfriend and I on the way home. Very disappointed with vegeway at this point and the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of the better experiences I've had in the past, had this been my first experience there I would never go back."}
{"text":"Thought it was a mirage when I saw sign that said plant-based fast food, but to my surprise not only does this restaurant exist but it is also fantastic. The food is amazing! The staff was incredible! EVERYONE GO EAT HERE. The monster fries are in vegan version of animal style fries at in and out and that his exact same!!!!"}
{"text":"i am very upset with the drive thru portion of this establishment. i came after school and got there at 12:04 and did not leave until 12:39! 35 MINUTES! and there were three cars in front of me the entire time so it wasn't very busy. also i had to tell the man working the drive thru window my order 3 times just after already telling them it at the speaker at the beginning. i ordered a burger, fries, and a shake and i had to tell him about the shake 4 times at the window. i will not be returning to he drive thru portion now because of this experience and i am very displeased. i'm giving it two stars because the food is still good and the restaurant portion has been good each time i go."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. The first time was amazing the second time it wasn't as great but still good. Tonight it was terrible. They recently changed their menu which was a bad idea. The \"chicken nuggets\" were not good at all and actually felt like leather. They were out of everything so they had to keep changing my order. The food actually made me feel sick and the store looked dirty. They aren't consistent with their food one day it's good and the next terrible. Never going again. Unfortunately we don't have many vegan fast food options but I rather go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Finally, I utilized my Groupon before expiration unknowingly during a pop-up event with music, art, specials, and crafts.  As a result, it was quite busy and waited as expected because of the event on a Saturday evening.  Since it was my first time here, I went with the recommendations from the knowledgeable employee such as the chicken wrap for my mum, a fish taco, and a strawberry shake(made with almond milk).  

During the wait, I enjoyed the ambiance of beautiful photographs especially of exotic marine life decorating the walls.  Furthermore, I satisfied my thirst via the complimentary infused water while listening to the angelic singing voice.  

Afterwards, we enjoyed the food in the comfort of home.  Hence, my mum wants to go back again because she loved the chicken wrap.  Next time, we will minus the Cajun sauce because it was a bit too spicy for her taste buds.  However, I plan to order the fish taco again because it was very tasty.  Plus, the shake was excellent and plan to try a different flavor on my next visit.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this establishment because the food is excellent, healthy, and fresh."}
{"text":"It's such a shame that the service is mediocre and the wait time is OUTRAGEOUS! My husband an I absolutely love this place but I literally just waited in line for over 20 min in the drive through and because of this it threw off the plans we had. They need to staff better because this poor girl is by herself!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the nuggets at the other location on South Jones but these nuggets taste like sausage. The fries at the other location are better too. I'm bummed because this location is closer to home but I probably won't go back. It was very ordinary."}
{"text":"Oh my. I've be n waiting for a place like this! The food is great. I recommend trying some smaller dishes and sharing to start. So may people are trying to be healthy and mindful of the meat industry. This is a perfect place to show you great food, great plant based food :))"}
{"text":"Its place customer service sucks the never have food just set in the drive do in waited for :20 minutes at 3:20 in afternoon and they just stated the drive to is close you can only go into the dining room they never have any food they always run out of food this place sucks bad"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. Drove across today to get a beef sandwich. What I was expecting was their usual thinly sliced beef with cilantro, jalapeños, pickled vegetables, and a creamy white sauce, what I got instead was a sandwich with some sort of cubed soggy beef, tomatoes, lettuce, and steak sauce. Absolutely not what I wanted. Unfortunately I had went through the drive and so by the time I realized this I was home and couldn't do anything about it. Had I known, I would not have even wasted the time and money getting it. I then called the restaurant (multiple times before they answered) and asked them if they had changed the recipe. This girl simply said yes. I asked her if the original beef sandwich was still an option, she said yes but that they had run out of cilantro. I then asked her if this was just a temporary \"replacement sandwich\" until they received more cilantro to which she also replied yes and they would be getting it in some time next week. Why wouldn't you tell customers that when they ordered instead of throwing together random ingredients?! No compensation or apology was offered even though I did not receive what I actually ordered. So disappointed, especially considering that what I got did not even taste good. I used to frequent here but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I wanted so bad to like this is place. But the fact that I resorted to watching an episode of Grey's Anatomy on Netflix while I was waiting in the drive thru line. Pretty much tells you how bad it was. I finally got up to the drive thru (25 min wait) and the lady took her sweet time and then scoffed at the fact that I didn't tip them. Now to the chicken tacos I got. Looked good! But the chicken meat felt like I was jussssst barely cooked from frozen. Almost like...a flavored ice cube taco."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food that I ordered. The popcorn chicken portions are very generous. It was super tasty. I would definitely recommend and will for sure be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"First time I went not so great but they had just opened for business. Second time I went it was amazing  so excited for a vegan place opened near my house that is considered \"fast food\" ."}
{"text":"Wish I knew the worker's name that helped me out! Excellent customer service and she made sure my first time here would be great. The Hawaiian burger is delicious along with the sweet potato fries. It's true when they say this is In-N-Out for vegetarians/vegans!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for the simple fact that my wife who is vegan and extremely difficult to please when it comes to food absolutely loves this place. She makes me make the drive to Centennial hills so she can get the veggie burger. Last night we tried the cookie shake and it was really good and you couldn't tell it was vegan. As far as vegan food goes, this place knocks it out of the park and would recommend you try it as well."}
{"text":"I had the single patty combo and it was soooooo good for my first veggie burger. Way better than I expected. I told the cashier it was my first time and she didn't offer any suggestions, she was friendly just not helpful. I'll definitely go back again. I'll just study the menu first so I'll have an idea of what I want to try next."}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star because the cashier was friendly. I ordered 3 times because they discontinued everything that I wanted, including ice tea. Why have it on the menu if it's discontinued? They couldn't get customers orders right and while I was sitting there waiting with my husband and grandson for about 50min they double made orders and ran out of curly fries, which by the way they charge extra for. After 50 min of waiting the came and told us the curly fries were no longer available if reg were ok, my husband said yes, I said no and that I was done waiting for items I didn't want to begin with. We asked for our money back and left. What a shame, because I hear the food is good. We will never return here."}
{"text":"If you're vegan and live in Las Vegas, chances are you already know about VegeWay. 

If you don't / stop what you're doing immediately and head to one of their two locations! The food is amazing! I love that we have a fast food option that's delicious! 

I recommend the milk shake (it's not cows milk, hurrah!) and the beef sandwich (it's soy based not cow based, hurrah!!) ... but pretty much everything is delicious! 

If you're not vegan? I still recommend you give it a go. With all of the evidence and research showing us how terrible meat and dairy is for; us, the animals and the environment - what have you got to lose? 

WE LOVE VEGEWAY!"}
{"text":"New update. I'm a regular here. I splurge on the vegan junk food once a week or maybe once every 2 weeks. I also bring friends and family to check it out. UPDATE I went today after hearing they have a new owner. And boy can you tell \"they have a new owner\". My big pull here was the fried zucchini. Now with the new owner and new cooks! The zucchini came out a slimy over cooked pile of mush! All the breading fell off or bunt!!. I don't want to totally demolish this establishment because if new management! I really want to see this vegan place succeed. Here's the problem. They don't have any of the old cooks that I saw anyway! When I came in at about 630 p.m today they informed me that they are out of EVERYTHING on the right side of the menu. So as I order they are behind me saying \"we don't have that\". The cashier was awesome and said she felt bad. But whoever was along side her seemed to be in \"charge\" she was not apologetic at all. They were out of French fries and vegan cheese and the entire right side menu. They decided to stop selling fountain drinks and replace it with some unknown homemade tea!! Guys please! I am not really a soda drinker but you can't have options of tea or water. If you want to go healthy then offer juices and smoothies. Bring the sods back asap. Learn to batter your tempura zucchini correctly and don't over cook it. Don't be out of HALF YOUR MENU. And then tell customers that you had a hard time. I do hAve a heart and care , but this is a business with a menu and people go out of their way to order food from you. They had no vegan chicken patty or even the ingredients for the monster fries. They are changing the entire decor inside as well (new owners) the frog on the wall is really unappetizing to me in a vegan establishment. There's a dirty running lava lamp sloppily place near the tea. Lots of clutter and just all and all I'm really sad to see such an amazing place go sour like this. Why change a good thing. Keep it simple and don't change the menu from what people originally loved there!!. Train your cooks!! The lady in charge asked me how I liked it and for that I will give 3 stars. I gave her simple advice on what wasn't good! I squeezed my zucchini fry and showed her there was no batter left on it and it was cooked to mush. She thanked me and listened but never did the next level of customer service and invite me back for a better cooked one next time. She was nice and I appreciate her listening . But I don't think they really get it yet. I will go back one more time in weeks from now to see how they settle in. As of now I won't waste my time going for an unorganized management with a staff that really does not know how to cook the food properly anymore ...I mean who really wants to waste their time and money driving all the way there for a nice vegan meal and not getting what you expect. I'm hoping in a few months it will improve. And guys get with it!! You have a menu! Whether you're new management or not or you just took it over that doesn't matter to people who are looking at your menu ordering while you say you don't have half your menu!! you make sure that you get up early and prep! Be prepared we are paying you for your service"}
{"text":"Best vegan cheese burger I've ever had! Fries and shakes are delicious too.
I have been vegan for about 3 years and absolutely loved everything about the cheeseburger.
I am a really picky vegan when it comes to cheese replacements, I usually just skip on the cheese all together but Vegeways is really good! I'm also kinda picky about fake meats (I don't like if the textures weird or looks too \"meaty\" ex: beyond beef burger, grosss) but I'm a big fan of this places home made patty. It almost tastes like tempeh bacon. Yum"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is exactly what the vegan community needs. A fast food burger spot with a drive thru. The food is excellent, especially for the price. The shakes are delicious & their machine is never broken and the staff is always friendly & helpful. I like that they have something for everyone. If you don't want a burger, you can get a wrap, a salad, or some popcorn chicken! I hope to see this restaurant chain spread throughout Las Vegas & beyond."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been here a few times and we really enjoyed the popcorn chicken and the cilantro salad. We went today and they've removed them both from their menu. We decided to get a beef sandwich, some zucchini fries and a few other things. First they tell us they are out of the zucchini, but then they come back and say they started a fresh batch, so great. We get to the window and they tell us they are out of the rolls to make the beef sandwich, so they make it a wrap instead. Then they finally bring our food, which was a beef sandwich, chicken wrap, monster fries, a shake and some zucchini fries and tell us they are out of bags, so I'm handed everything individually. The food was good, but pricey. Whoever made the chicken wrap needs a lesson in wrapping. It looked aweful. I don't know if we'll be going back for a while. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I seriously wanted this place to be amazing. I had gone to the one across town and loved it. I heard they had Beyond Meat and had to try it. But The burger was the only good part. My boyfriends meal was not great. Both his curly fries and my regular fries were horrible. It seems as though they have not filtered the oil in a while and over cooked them like crazy. Also their green tea was terrible. I hope this place gets better because we need places like these to help show people that you can eat fast food without eating meat."}
{"text":"Out of half their items when I pulled up.  Waited 25 minutes in total with only one person in front of me in the drive thru.  Looked inside the restaurant - no one there.  Crazy as they claim they are fast food.  The food had no flavor and the fries were undercooked! Very disappointing experience, especially for a $10.00+ combo.  Will not be going back.  You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Second time here & still impressed! Service is friendly. Food surprised me at how good it is. This time we tried the beef sandwich, chicken wrap, & fried zucchini. All 3 items were good, but the beef sandwich was the best!! Not sure what sauce they put on it, but yum! I've also tried the burger, chicken bites, curly fries, & chocolate shake. Also enjoyed all of that!  I'm not a vegetarian, but what a great alternative to meat. Seriously! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I am extremely upset, my mother just went to vegeway tonight to get us something to eat. The guy taking her order informed her they're no longer serving gf buns. I don't understand why they would take them off their menu. No one wants to eat a burger wrapped in lettuce! Especially when it's dressed with pineapples or jalapeños. Why move backwards? Looks like I won't be eating here anymore, thanks a lot."}
{"text":"I just wanted to update my review for vegeway north. If I could give more then 5 stars I totally would! I stopped in today with the whole fam bam a total of 7 of us. We all ordered combos and appetizers, it was a pretty hefty order..The cashier was so friendly and patient with us. After we put our order in we sat down and they got our order out super fast and threw in extra condiments and even gave us free cookies for our kiddos. Everything was fresh and delish! You must try this place out. They have bomb burgers, fries and my fav is the fried zucchini  everything is vegan so if you're vegan no worries ordering from the menu. Service absolutely rocked"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I'm a vegetarian and have such a hard time finding \"comfort food\". I am blown away by the vegan chicken since chicken substitutes usually aren't that great. Even my husband who is a totally carnivore loves it!!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to eat at this vegan fast food place you have to go all out and try the burger and strawberry milkshake. I think the idea is great to give vegans a fast food option my only wish is that they added a special twist(sauce or etc) to the burger to make it special."}
{"text":"This spot is right around the corner from my place and I've driven by it dozens of times. Today I felt like I needed to go through the drive thru and get my veggie burger on. I will say that I am not a vegan but I do enjoy a good veggie burger every now and then. So, what do you do when you're craving fries and don't want to drive too far? You get in your car, in your pajamas, and drive to this place. 

It's in a small parking lot with a bunch of other business so look out for cars parking and backing up. They have a little sign pointing to the drive thru(go that way) and they have the standard menu/speaker set up. As soon as I pulled up the lovey voice at the other end told me to look at the menu and let her know when I was ready. Well, I'm a prepared mofo(usually only when it comes to food), so I already knew what I wanted. #1 with curly fries and a Dr. Pepper, please. 

\"Bad news\", the voice at the other end says. My first thought is literally ridiculous and that's that they've run out of food. It's worse: they don't do curly fries anymore. I tell the voice at the other end that this is my first time here and I am crying inside(let the dramatics begin). I may be crying inside, but I'm also reasonable, so I say regular fries are fine. Then she informs me that they've stopped selling sodas and they only have bottled Coke left. No, I don't want Coke. I start to question my life decisions at this point. I agree to their mango iced tea. 

I pull up to the window to pay and inquire about dipping sauces(dipping sauces are the cornerstone of any good fast food meal). I ask for their Cajun sauce(which is vegan too, if you care). The lady at the window is nice and my drink gets to me quickly and my food shortly after(like 3 minutes) and is brought to me by another employee. *shrug*. I drive off and take a sip of my mango tea. Continue reading if you care about the actual food because this is why this place only gets 3 stars. 

I got my single burger with \"cheese\" and first of all, I've never had faux cheese before and it was ok. It was a weird consistency. It made the inside of the top bun a weird mushy, stick to the roof of your mouth texture. The overall taste of the burger was fine and I actually liked it. They put some sauce on the burger similar to an In-N-out style sauce. Overall an okay veggie burger that I would eat again sans the cheese. Temperature was fine and seasoning good. The fries were a huge let down. I wanted to cry when I saw them because they just looked sad AF. Like greasy, limp sad potatoes. Some were undercooked and some were sort of crunchy, but the majority were just unimpressive and underwhelming. The only redeeming part was the Cajun sauce I got and you best believe I dipped every fry bite in that sauce to stop the sadness from taking over. Sauce was really good and really spicy. Yum! Mango tea was too sweet but enjoyable once watered down. 

I want to return but only to try their shakes. Other than that, I think this place is a pass in the future for me if I'm looking for a satisfying food experience. My total was almost $11. Kind of pricey for the letdown."}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to like this place more because I want to support healthy fast food places in town. I was looking for more fresh options, but they only had one (ok) salad option that was fine, but left a lot to be desired. I was hoping for more low carb veggie choices...salads, avocados as heathy fats, etc. If you are looking for fresh, whole food options, keep looking. But if you want something in a pinch that fills those needs, I'm glad it's available."}
{"text":"Great place for a bite! They are always adding new delicious stuff to the menu. I want to try them all. I can recommend he milkshakes, they are the best. And I love he chicken ranch sandwich!!! Service is always friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Marley the cashier is amazing! She was so nice and talkative and just had a smile on her face the whole time. They also loaded me up on popcorn chicken! If only this one wasnt on the complete opposite side of vegas from my house. The one by house is so so, they aren't very friendly and have messed up my order a few times"}
{"text":"Me and my son ordered two burgers one soy one beyond meat, tater tots and regular fries, excellent! There WILL be a wait for there fresh food, so that's fine with me! Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Great Vegan food joint, much more flavorful than other spots. My wife loves it here!."}
{"text":"The food is great,  not what you'd expect. I have had veggie patties before, but this one had the texture and taste of real meat. The double burger is quite filling and when paired with monster fries you really are full. This will not be my only visit, I'm definitely coming back. They have \"gender neutral\" restrooms which was a nice touch, however the one I used had not been cleaned in awhile. Outside of that, the visit was good."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see a vegan fast food option, so I ordered takeaway from here. It was so gross. For me, the burger was inedible. The texture was unpleasant, and the flavor did not hold a candle to most vegan burgers that I have tried. The fries were soggy, and flavorless. Really disappointed in this because we need good vegan options!"}
{"text":"So maybe my opinion is biased because I'm an occasional meat eater, but here goes. 

The good- white chocolate peanut butter & strawberry milkshakes were amazing! I've been using almond milk for years so I was very happy! Also the curly fries were crispy and well seasoned. The people at the drive thru we're also nice and courteous as well. 

The bad,  under high expectations- the vegan burger patty. I didn't expect for it to taste like meat but I feel like the whole burger was soggy and just not for me ( or my husband).ok Vegan or not, a patty in a burger should be solid and hold up well with the rest of the burger. I've been to Veggie House and was beyond pleased with both food and service. I expected the same here because chef Kenny initially opened this location. Maybe under new management quality was compromised?

All in all, I'm coming back for curly fries and milkshakes. For burgers I'll stick to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Basically the restaurant takes something that is good for you and deep fries it. I was expecting something else. The food was super greasy! The fries soggy and limp and so was the fried zucchini. The \"meat\" sandwich was actually good, along with the cajun dip. One staff member was kind of rude but the rest of the staff was extremely friendly. The friendliness of the rest of the staff and the \"meat\" sandwich is the reason it got a 3 and not 1 star. I probably will never visit this place again. I will look for other vegan/vegetarian alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"I got the single veggie burger. Very tasty but I think next time I'll opt for no cheese and add pickles. :) the curly fries were hot and delicious! The drivethru was a bit slow but at least all my food was fresh! Awesome! I will be back and hopefully they have pickles *wink*"}
{"text":"I tried majority of the items on the menu and to be honest I just wasn't impressed with anything. Maybe I will give it another try in the future and reevaluate."}
{"text":"For a place called Vegeway, i expected more diverse vegetables and to not be meat substitutes. A nut Burger or some sort of vegetable patty instead of fake beef or chicken would be so much nicer in my opinion.

Anyway, it wasn't bad at all. Probably won't come back since I just wanted a bunch of vegetables not soy!"}
{"text":"Update: the service has gone down hill and fast!!!  Word on the street is that Chef Kenny no longer owns this location. It literally took 35 minutes to get the fries we ordered and we had to ask for them repeatedly, never mind several orders of fries were given to other customers in the mean time. They have taken out the soda fountain drinks. Blast music so loudly you can barely have a conversation with the person across from you. And play movies like Pulp Fiction playing on the TV!! We had to ask them to turn the movie off as our child as well as other children were eating in the restaurant!! Staff is uncaring and downright rude!!  These high school kids are bringing this place down!!  Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"The girls that work here are really cute and nice, but the owner is inconsistent with where they purchase their products so meals often change in flavor, also they usually run out of ingredients at the end of everyday. They do Usually use Follow Your Heart vegan cheese which is one of the best vegan cheddar cheeses on the market."}
{"text":"I used Uber eats to order food and it was ok. The fries and tacos were amazing. The chicken sandwich was ok and the nuggets not so much. I love the concept and would like to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"So I'm far from being vegan, but I wanted to give this place a try. I don't discriminate against any type of food and the concept of a meatless fast food restaurant intrigued me. 

To begin with, the dining room leaves a lot to be desired. You've got your standard tables and chairs that leaves a certain air of sadness. Along with that, you've got hateful posters looking down at people who eat meat. Not really a way to win over a non-vegan crowd. 

The food was subpar at best. I ordered their Hawaiian burger and let me tell you, it tasted mostly like sauce and pineapples. I couldn't taste anything else. Not even the tasteless patty. 

Their strawberry milkshake wasn't terrible, but it's not something I would order again, but their curly fries were good. I doubt they make them in-house. If they do, at least they got at least one thing going for them. 

I won't be coming back again, but I'll continue my search for tasty vegan restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Food is sooo good! I got the  
Vegan-beef wrap with cilantro and tomatos, rice and much more yummy goodness! I love this place! And the sweet potato fries are sooo bomb! The staff is amazing and Steven is the man and puts love into what he makes! This place is great for events and get togethers! Be sure to go to Veggie Way whenever you want an awesome VEGAN and DELICIOUS meal!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was very excited and couldn't wait to try it it was just okay for me then but now it's just so much worst than ever!!!!!!
My last two visits was just awful the first of the last two I went through the drive-through I ordered I ordered a #1 with a upgraded shake, how do you forget fries with a combo????
The cashier looked as if he had been partying all night or on some type of drugs.
On the last visit was The absolute worst never have I seen a place so not together, sold out of EVERYTHING, I ordered the beast burger combo with a shake, the advertised picture has cheese on it but when you order the meal there's a up-charge of .69 cents for cheese
Oh and by the way I found out that day that Chef Kenny sold the place to some that only really cares about only up-charging for everything like having a posted price for a combo and then still adding an additional $4.00 to make it a combo, $3.50 to upgrade to a shake and I already told you about the cheese!
This place has definitely changed for the worst!
I give it 5 thumbs down"}
{"text":"Food takes FOREVER. Extremely under staffed! Only one person cooking and a cashier. They really need a manager or more staff on the weekend.

Food is good but overpriced. Came here a few times when they first opened and then again today. Location decor has changed and does look a lot nicer than before. Apparently Chief Kenny does not own this location anymore, his partner took over.

His partner changed the menu and today they had no chicken anything. Cheese use to come on the burger now there is a charge for it and sides of sauce.

Even though It looks better I watched 4 guest look extremely confused about where they get their drinks for their combo since the drink fountain is no longer out for them. All ended up getting water instead because it's the only thing out. The 3 drink fountains they did have our were empty.. obviously the staff is not telling guest they get drinks from behind the counter."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but my friend is. 
So we went to get a \"burger.\" I'll be honest, I'm not one for fake meat or anything disguised as another thing. But after we ordered her Hawaiian burger and monster fries and my tacos and tater tots, when we pulled around to the window the smell was LOVELY. We were greeted by a friendly smiling face, and given our Sprites (which were the bottles REAL SUGAR KIND.) Shortly after we were handed our goodies and on our way. She raced about the burger and I shared the tacos and tots with my husband when we got home. They were delicious. Now don't get me wrong, they don't taste like meat, but they ARE DELICIOUS. And the tots were crunchy potato perfection. 
We will go back, and I'm so glad we have a place we can go where she can eat something other than just fries."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food was delicious and service was great.  This location seems more spacious than their Jones location."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try it since I read about the first one opening and really wanted to love this place.  In general I don't go for \"fast food\" because I prefer a more healthy lifestyle without a lot of fried and processed foods.  The misnomer is that this was going to be a healthy alternative and the vegan alternative to fast food.

We ordered a Cajun chicken, fish sandwich, popcorn chicken, and potato fries.  All of the items were extremely greasy like they were cooked from a tempered state, so much so that I had that greasy taste in my mouth and needed to get something after to eat after to cover it.

The chicken patty was really just a regular processed chicken patty and nothing special.  The fish sandwich was interesting with guacamole instead of tarter sauce, and the fish flavor was not bad, but was hard to eat without making a huge mess.  Everything is served on white buns - which I would have expected multi grain or wheat.  Fries and popcorn chicken were both very very greasy, although the chicken flavor was ok. 

Thankfully I asked about the shakes before ordering as they are made from almond milk (which was not noted) which would not have ended well had I ordered one.  

While service was friendly the place lacked finishing.  They used bulk ketchup which was almost empty and no plastic cups to dispense into.  Items in the beverage machine were already out of order and were definitely very basic selections. I did like the crushed ice, though!  The whole condiment / beverage station just lacked organization, completeness, and cohesiveness.

Overall, I felt embarrassed to have brought my carnivore friend thinking this would be a healthy alternative and fun new place to try.  I really wanted to say give me a carrot stick or broccoli floret in tempura at least so I could feel redeemed.  Even big fast food is trying to be more healthy and offer different options

Maybe it was an off night for them but unfortunately I would not return or suggest my vegan/vegetarian friends try it."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant time it didn't take long for my food to arrive Ashton was the cashier that helped me he had an awesome attitude and was very polite and just made my experience so much better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot! For my first time, i thought it was delicious. I'm really happy they have soy-free items, because i'm allergic to soy! its an amazing renovation on fast food :)"}
{"text":"While in Vegas I had a meeting with my company and they ordered food from here and when I found out it was all we can I thought I was gonna die but sure enough as soon as it got there I tried the vegan burger I do not eat red meat but I am also not a vegan and I was totally Diggin everything that I was able to get my hands into
I could not remember the name of this place at all but I did not go into the establishment it was delivered for six of us and all I know was I could not believe the whole entire menu was vegan and everything that I touched was absolutely delicious
If you are into this vegan stuff which I'm sorry I only can live without read me I will tell you that this will become your favorite place in the valley but I cannot tell you what the restaurant is like or the employees I'm just judging on the food
I remember curly fries
And I had have a vegan burger and I was done
Call my friend Laura swore up-and-down that I was going to absolutely love it and I did"}
{"text":"The photos attached are from my first few visits which always kept me coming back. No complaints except a long wait time. 

Ugh.. it's become a hit or miss place. 
I'm currently eating a chicken wrap with extremely crunchy rice, the only avo spread is at one end (figured they forgot it again) and they didn't put those really yummy red sweet/spicy pepper things which is literally my favorite thing about the wrap 

Why am I paying almost ten bucks for one wrap that's completely half as.ed ?? 

The last time my wrap was made with the same lack of care and I figured whoever made it was having a bad day, but now again  


As someone else stated, I to have spent over 15 minutes in the drive thru with one lady in front of me. Apparently they gave her food to the wrong customer and instead of being able to handle the situation (how about you say sorry, have her Park, and bring her food out to her when it's ready.. what a concept?) No. we sat there for 15 minutes, my boyfriend got out walked across the street and got food somewhere else, came back, still stuck, I waited five more minutes and got out to see what was going on and why I wasn't being let out. 

I literally told the employee at the window that she should probably consider compensating the customer, having her pull up, and let the rest of us go, seeing that there shouldn't be a problem with our orders.. right ?? No we still sat there for ten more minutes. Absolutely ridiculous 

I'm the GM at one of the greens and protiens and I would never let a situation like this happen. Management really needs to step it up. What's the time you guys are aiming for? 5-10mins? How's the quality supposed to stay consistent? Check the training of your employees. 

As much as I enjoy this place I'm over spending my money to be stuck in a drive thru for over ten minutes and receive sub par quality food. 

Let me know when you guys decide to retrain!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and the food is delicious. We will definitely be back 
We love the cheeseburger and the chicken nuggets 
I'm going to tell everyone 
Can't wait for the new store
We shall definitely be back and bring my friends"}
{"text":"Awesome for your Vegan fast food cravings! I love the fact that I feel like I'm eating a hamburger but no animal had to die for me to do so!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service during the night hours. The first time I came to this place during the day the service was great. They were friendly and very knowledgeable about the ingredients they use. The second time I came I went through the drive through and the girl looked at me like I was asking her for a miracle when I asked for a side of ranch. Today, I went through the drive through and as the guy handed me my food I asked if I could get ketchup he said ok. I waited and he comes back with a bag that looked like it had food and all I hear is a bunch of giggling from his coworkers. As I look in the bag it's half full of ketchup packets! I'm thinking wow so immature it's sad these people get employed by places like this. Great food immature employees."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken was SO good. The monster fries were a little sweet tasting but still yummy!! A little pricey and took awhile. Totally worth it! I added vegan ranch to my burger when I got home. I'll definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Great way to eat vegan in the go. There isn't any drive thru vegan places in town except this place. Great milkshakes and decent food. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally I found an awesome vegan fast food restaurant near me! I went vegan a month ago and I find the most challenging thing about it is when I eat out or when I'm on the go and need a quick bite. Vege-way solves that issue perfectly. PLEASE OPEN MORE! Also the staff is super friendly and helpful. Great food. Great service. Great prices. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the food but service sucks sometimes. 9 Times out of 10 they get my order wrong. They always forget to bring me my drink or fries and I have to ask them for it. Sometimes they don't even put my food in a bag when I go through the drive thru LOL. Sometimes they have attitude other times they are normal. Foods never fast but I don't mind that if its fresh. Pricey for a whole meal"}
{"text":"Had the Hawaiian burger with cheese and the monster fries (curly). Both were really good, although I might ask for light sauce on the fries next time - it's very tangy.

Anyway, I first tried this place about a year ago but wasn't impressed. It was just super greasy and hard to enjoy (popcorn chicken). But I loved it this time, so I'm glad I came back to give them another try.

I will definitely come back again soon. I didn't notice the zucchini fries on the menu, but now I see these pics on here. Looks amazing, so I guess I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Congratulations to Chef Kenny!  I am his loyal customer at the Veggie House on Spring Mountain Road and have long been waiting for this burger place to open, and surely he didn't let me down!!  Outstanding food, good prices, great vibe.  So glad it's full house when I was there today.  Give it a try if you haven't already!  You'll be amazed how tasty a vege burger could be.  Hope there will be more and more Vegeway opening in different locations, and in other states too!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and get the veggie burger... I've asked for no sauce twice and twice I got sauce on my burger... fries and soda are the best part..."}
{"text":"I love this place !!! The service is always awesome the girls in the drive-thru are always so friendly SO CHIPPER.. I have not tasted the fish never liked it when I did eat meat but EVERYTHING ELSE IS GREAT..."}
{"text":"Would not honor living social deal even though as of today, they are still actively selling that on the site. First was told that it is only at the jones location that they accept it, and when I showed them the page stating it shoes both the locations, the girl went in the back to ask someone and came back saying that living social was bought out by groupon so they don't accept it. And that if they do, it'd be like they're just giving away free food. What...? Not free if you actually used money to get the deal, and I pointed out the fact that it makes no sense, as the deal is literally still available. She said that they're aware and are working on it. All the while the two other workers were just staring. 

Honestly they have decent (but overpriced) food but I will go elsewhere before ever stepping foot in this place again."}
{"text":"I really loved the food here i got curly fries and a single vegan burger without cheese, simply put it's the best vegan burger i've had, a great texture, not too dry and the curly fries were nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside, everything was wonderfully seasoned!"}
{"text":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I hate to write this review for a business I love, but I hope they read this and put things BACK THE WAY THEY WERE!
The burgers are different, like something I can make at home, and although there's cheese in the pictures, there was no cheese. I was never offered cheese. The old burgers had that distinct flavor one craves, much like In & Out, but not anymore. 
I brought a friend here over the weekend and kept apologizing for hyping Vegeway up. This was once the place I brought carnivorous friends to show off awesome vegan food. 
This location also no longer sells popcorn chicken.
PLEASE DO THINGS THE WAY YOU USED TO."}
{"text":"I Love Love Love the burgers but you have to wait forever for it. I waited 15 mins in the drive thru once and I was the only one else that was there. The 3 girls working were huddled together talking and my fries ended up half cooked. 

The milk shakes are watery and they don't understand what Neapolitan means. 

One of the managers has a very bad attitude and doesn't know what she's doing! Some of the newer employees seem to be a lot nicer though. 

This place needs to be trained on FAST food. When to time the fries and when to put the patties down. And most of all customer service. 

But the food is good and I love the ranch. I just can't eat here on a regular basis bc the wait time will kill me from boredom and frustration!"}
{"text":"First world problem. But I really wanted fried zucchini. What I got was zucchini with a side of batter. The zucchini tasted really bitter no salt. Lots of great reviews for this place, I think maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"So glad that they opened a second restaurant on this side of town. Hurrah for greasy fast food!

If you are attempting to be healthy, this is as close as you're going to get when it comes to fast food.The vegan equivalent of In-N-Out, everything on the menu is plant-based. No meat, diary, or any of that 'animal' stuff. They offer burgers, fish tacos, and beef sandwiches. I'm not vegan, but my friend is, and it's nice to be able to go some place where her only option isn't 'salad'. 

Milkshakes are amazing, I drank like 3 of them in one sitting. Don't judge me, it's bulking season."}
{"text":"Much improved! They seem to have worked out kinks with customer service! Food is excellent, and I'm happy to see they are much busier now. I don't mind waiting a while for my food, I would rather have the quality and service. Seems they must've gotten rid of that awful manager we dealt with!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan, but I absolutely love this place for convenient, guilt-free, delicious food! I got the chicken wrap and, because I saw numerous reviews for them, the fried zucchini side. I did not expect to enjoy the food as much as I did, but I've gone back a number of times since. The chicken wrap was full of flavors. The fried zucchini was crispy and the vegan ranch-like sauce with it was delish. The staff members are all so nice and have answered all of my questions anytime I've gone in. Overall, I highly recommend this place...vegan or not, you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The double vegan burger tastes pretty meaty.  Could have fooled me!  It comes with lettuce, tomato and onion as well as vegan cheese.  It also has this great thousand island dressing on it.  The Ranch Chicken sandwich is also delish! It looks small, but the protein they use really fills you up.  And yes...the fries portion sizes are HUGE!  I tried all three--regular, curry, and sweet potato.  You can't go wrong with any of those choices.  The menu is small, but I don't think that matters.  Amazing vegan burger."}
{"text":"The burger is amazing! Curly fries were seasoned and crunchy. French fries were softer so, if you like crispy fries, get the curly fries. I liked the cilantro salad. The only greens are cilantro and cucumber so, don't be surprised...didn't bother me because I love cilantro. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"First time going here, food was good 
I got the Hawaiian vegan burger but the patty was a bit hard on the sides
Also got the monster fries, they were out of cheese but gave us a 10% discount for the inconvenience 
They were pretty good without the cheese, they add some kind of sauce plus grilled onions.

We went through the drive thru and wait time is pretty long (about 15 min)."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in the world!!! I really enjoyed the Hawaiian burger and monster fries! And the staff are SO friendly! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Dirty Dirty Dirty! This place was so disgusting dirty. The front counter dirty! The glass door for drinks crazy dirty! The small sink for employees to wash hands crazy dirty! Everything looked dirty! The employee with glasses and blue hair stones outta her mind. I was terrified!! I didn't even dare eat there!! Just left there BTW 11/27/2917 11:20am!"}
{"text":"Aww, man! I was so looking forward to trying this place and it was not what I was hoping for.
I arrived around 4pm on a Sunday and stood at the counter for a few minutes before a young man came out to greet me. As I started asking questions he interrupted me by listing off ALL the things they were out of. Burgers, \"chicken\" and pretty much everything I was interested in trying. He then told me their other location on Jones would have a better selection... seriously?!
I settled on a southwest burrito. While I waited I heard the female cook yell, \"No! Why did you do that?!\" Not a good sign in my book.
It was $9 and I took four or five bites. It was mushy and didn't taste fresh at all. So much for that! I won't be back to this location. I'll have to think about trying the other one."}
{"text":"Chef Kenny, responsible for operating Veggie House, has opened a second Vegeway location in northwest Vegas, and I couldn't be happier. Vegeway has been called the vegan equivalent of In-N-Out, and I'd have to agree with this description. Equipped with a drive-thru and offering vegan burgers, fries, and 'milk' shakes, it's a vegan fat girl's heaven. I went to Vegeway on opening day because I couldn't wait to try Chef Kenny's take on American fast food. 

VEGAN BURGER ($4.69): Comes with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and thousand island dressing. The burger is really good. I've no idea what the burger is made of or how they get it to look like a 'real' hamburger patty. It's something you have to see and try for yourself! 4/5

POPCORN CHICKEN ($4.69): I only had a few bites because I was too full to eat any more, but these were quite good, especially when dipped in the vegan ranch! 4/5

FRIES ($2.59): I ordered the curly fries and sweet potato fries, favoring the former. Generous portions. 3.5/5

SERVICE: I went through the drive-thru and waited about 10 minutes for my order. No one expects opening day to be perfect, so I was cool about it when the cashier got my order right on the third try. 

I'm excited to have a vegan restaurant close to home and will definitely be back for more.

{"text":"The vegan cheeseburgers are decent, but the real star of the show is their popcorn chicken. I'm convinced that one serving is enough to feed two hungry people, with their own fries (of course). Add to that a chocolate vegan shake and you'll be in vegan food heaven. Just we prepared to wait about 10 minutes for you food."}
{"text":"Vegan or
Not this place is great . I wish everything wasn't soy , so my mother could enjoy fast healthy food . Hopefully they will expand the menu a little more . The burgers are amazing and even the pickiest meat eater will devour this Vegan burger !!! So happy the Nw has something."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place?????? I went here a few months ago and it was excellent.  How it went wrong today: when the guy opened the drive through window I heard a loud sneeze and saw the chef wipe his nose on his hand. He grabbed I assume a veggie patty from underneath with his bare hands ( NO GLOVES) and put it on the grill. Also wearing no gloves while putting on the toppings. I open the box in the car as I pulled away, the bun was not grilled or toasted like it was last time, very sloppily put together, the lettuce changed to some dark green wilted stuff, the onion smelt bad and looked old, and where was the cheese?? I felt like I was eating food for a dog. This was disgusting and it's really unfortunate because it was excellent the first couple of times."}
{"text":"I'm new to plant based dieting and didn't realize how tasty and satisfying it is. Try the burger and a shake, so delicious!!
The staff are helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite things are the classic double patty burger, strawberry shake and monster fries. I've tried the other stuff just once and not that impressive taste wise (sort of bland). Staff is friendly and my mentioned order is always more than filling. Did not give 5 stars due to it being a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is Under New Management now, and the menu has been greatly downsized, but the prices have been increased. They also no longer offer Fountain drinks, so the only option other than water are drinks loaded with sugar.. I will always give two stars to a restaurant that does not offer healthy drink options. How about at least bringing back the unsweetened iced tea?. At least the sweet potato fries were still good. But that's not enough to bring me back.
And the Video Game Machines, really? That's pretty tacky."}
{"text":"30 minutes in drive thru line- then they forgot half the order.  Not exaggerating.  At least they didn't charge for what they forgot but being trapped in a fast food line motionless is extremely frustrating. I think they messed up the car in fronts order and instead of pulling them out in front they just kept everyone in the line."}
{"text":"Not bad and I'm in no way a vegan or healthy food eater. Was surprised honestly. Have been twice so far. Wife loves the strawberry ice tea!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try their food. Went almost 10m after they opened. A lot of the stuff on their menu is fried food. I ordered the Monster tots and they told me the fryers are not ready yet and can be about 15m. Why would you clean them the morning right before you open and not the night before? Very disappointed because I've been dying to try this place. Also they open at 1030 not 10 like yelp says"}
{"text":"SO happy they opened on by me! Great fast vegan comfort food!"}
{"text":"The food is great, especially for vegan fast food. Today I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches, and waited 30 minutes for them to tell me that their order had come in and no chicken. Why couldn't they tell my when I ordered? Always have to ask for napkins. It's frustrating because Henderson location doesn't run like this."}
{"text":"I love Vegeway!! The beyond burgers are amazing! And their shakes are great too! I love that they have a drive thru also! Thanks for being there for us vegans who still want to eat fast food!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find more vegan places around my side of town and I'm glad that Vegeway isn't too far away. As mentioned in other reviews, their menu does not have that many choices, but I personally like that it is simple. As a person that is just starting to eat more vegan food, I like that I am not overwhelmed by so many different options. Their prices are reasonable and I didn't have to wait long for my food to come out. Restaurant is fairly clean and organized, and their employees are friendly. 

I ordered the vegan beef sandwich and my sister ordered a chicken ranch burger. The vegan beef sandwich was a little bit too spicy for me, there is some kind of chili sauce and jalapeños in the sandwich - I'll probably ask for no jalapeños next time. But overall, their foods are flavorful and the portions are just right. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food here is ALWAYS amazing! I love everything on the menu. Except they do take a long time to get the food ready for you. Perhaps a larger staff? Regardless the visits here are worth it!!"}
{"text":"The food itself was good, but nothing at all like the other location across town. They must have changed the recipe or something because 1) the patty was a bit mushy and looked a lot different than before and 2) the flavor was more of a vegetable taste and not the way a burger tastes. If I didn't already have expectations from the last location I probably wouldn't have had anything to complain about but I was just a bit disappointed to see how different it was. Customer service was okay, just a little slow. Overall still good though."}
{"text":"Seriously this spot used to be good and the last two times I've gone it's been miserable.  The first horrible time they didn't have like 80% of the menu and I had only found out after I paid and ordered because the cashier was ill informed on inventory. And then they took away 2 of the better things they offered (curly fries and popcorn chicken), although replacing the popcorn chicken with seitan nuggets.  I literally cannot tell you the last time I returned something at a restaurant, and these were just that gross that I had to.  They looked nothing like the picture they advertised and tasted like burnt flour in dirty fryer oil.  And while I returned them I had waited at least 5 minutes before the employees had finished gossiping to notice me standing at the counter to help me out.  Granted they were nice and let me get something else.  Ugh get it together.  On top of that, two big dead bugs just chillin in the bathroom that had no toilet paper... not the greatest experience.  And there was horrible loud music playin.. simple plan? My chemical romance? Some emo stuff playing just too loud to hear your thoughts, or someone standing in front of the register for 5 minutes for that matter ;)


What happened to the awesome collage and artwork, friendly vibes, pop up events, healthy salads, ????"}
{"text":"For a fast food spot even if healthy...PRICES ARE TOO HIGH!!! was not surprised when i saw no one in line at the drive thru. Don't see this business lasting ling unless they figure out a way to make prices more reasonable. $6 for a shake ??"}
{"text":"I loveeeeeeeeee this place! This is the first drive thru plant based place I had found. I've been here a few times. The staff is always nice!

The drive thru takes a little bit, but for freshly made plant based food, I'll wait. They have anything that you can imagine from a fast food place without worrying about animal products or dairy being used. 

Their burgers taste like a real burger to me and are yummy!  

One thing, they use daiya cheese. I'm not a fan of it but sometimes I get the cheese there. That's just me, I can't stand daiya, I'm all for Follow Your Heart cheese products. 

Best things on the menu I've had are the zuchinni fries/sticks and their sweet potatoes fries, yes please! 

Definitely recommend this place for fast and fresh plant based food!"}
{"text":"I used to love the food here but there is trouble in paradise.   I am not the only person who has complained about this location always being out of food items on the menu.  They never have much of anything, the Jones location said they aren't even technically vege way anymore.  It's a let down because some of the food items I used to love there are no longer the same in taste.  The only thing consistent about this Restuarant is it's inconsistency .  I am no longer amused and will take my vegan business elsewhere.  It's a shame because there aren't that many choices for vegan food up in the centinial area.  And the one immediate choice is some less then mediocre establishment that has clearly become a ghost in the shell."}
{"text":"Ever since I became vegetarian (and slowly becoming vegan) I have been missing In and Out, this is the no meat version! 
I love the burger and the popcorn chicken! I have only tried the strawberry shake but I love it, it's as close to a real milkshake as you can get. 
I am a regular here, so glad they opened this location!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My wife and I just moved from out of state and were exited to try a plant based fast food restaurant but this place needs a lot of help. The beyond burger was decent but $8.00! I can get 2 at Whole Foods for $5.99. And the fries came out like wet noodles! We took the fries back and asked for a new order and it seemed like they just dropped the same fries back in the oil. Not to mention the place just looks dirty. I can't help but feel like I wasted $20. I will not return."}
{"text":"Honestly i had high hopes for this place but was greatly disappointed, the food was nothing but grease and under cooked. My boyfriend and i tried both the soy patty and the soy free patty with regular fries and zucchini fries. The patties were so greasy and poorly made they upset our stomachs and the zucchini fries were practically raw, might as well should have handed us a whole damn zucchini. The only good thing about our order were the regular fries. As for the freshness they claim they have is highly doubtful. I don't recommend eating here if you're looking for real, delicious vegan/ vegetarian food. They have great customer service, terrible food, and are overly priced."}
{"text":"Horrible service waited too long and there were no customers. Food was tasteless and they forgot my side for the Togo order."}
{"text":"I'd have to say I've liked it every time I've been there. However I feel like this is the slowest fast food joint I've ever been to. it shouldn't take more than 5 min an order when you only have two sandwiches. Everytime I've been here even if I'm the only one there it has taken 10 min or more.
Food is good though"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat and found this on yelp. Easy to spot and they have a drive through or you can go inside and eat. We went inside and it's super cute in the inside. They have a chalkboard with cute sayings and cartoon animals. 

Ordered single burger with fires and a cookie and cream milkshake. The burger was delicious and fries were decent. My cousin got the spicy chicken and liked it. Milkshakes are good but not as thick as I would make myself. 

Overall good but I knocked it one star because they didn't have napkins or ketchup out and we had to ask."}
