{"text":"Food was good! Called for a special today! The order taker literally said \"it's the same as it always is\" .... I don't know the everyday special because they don't advertise on social media, t.v., text messages etc. I am trying to keep up with the trend and I was shamed for it!? Not everyone reads the penny saver... And if you want to become a dynasty pizza shop learn your menu and and learn how to present it. Poor guest service!!! Actually \"customer\" service is not even on the mind let alone guest service!!!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. There are much better places in Carrick/Mt. Oliver area that have better pies, though. The price is average. They do tack on a $2.00 delivery fee which many other places do not charge. The selection is pretty standard for the area. Most of the pizza joints in 15210 are pretty much the same. This place is a step or two below the rest, unfortunately.  We got a medium pepperoni pizza and a small capiccola hoagie. The hoagie was great. Crispy, crunchy bread. A good hefty portion of spiced ham. I asked for banana peppers and they were quite liberal with those. The hoagie was quite nice...and again pretty standard for the area.  The pizza wasn't too great. The crust was nice and crispy, big plus. There was alot of cheese on it....salty, oil and nutty. The only complaint was the sauce...which tasted like canned tomato sauce...no spices or nothing. It was tart and very basic...very bland. Normally I don't fret so much over the sauce as long as the crust is spot on...but they slathered on way too much sauce and it kinda just killed the pizza for me.  The price for a medium 1 topping pizza and a half hoagie plus delivery fee was $18.01...like I said quite pricy for the area. They had a bunch of coupons for specials where we have gotten like twice as much food for just a couple bucks more....but we didn't need a whole hoagie and a large pizza...it woulda been a waste.  All in all...this place is just a little below average. We had the pizza before and we remembered it not being all that great. This second time confirmed this. The hoagies are good though, but plenty of other places in the area have hoagies just as good. The $2.00 delivery fee is a real downer, though."}
{"text":"Pizza is always amazing with generous toppings!!! The BEST pizza delivery going to southside!!! Cheese sticks are amazing and crispy, steak hoagie is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Aprimo's because we had a coupon. We probably won't be ordering again. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. We ordered wings and a hoagie. However, it's not really the food that left us wanting more, it was the service. When we called to place the order, the employee seemed like he was in ten different places at once. Very spacey. After telling him what we wanted, he responded with \"Okay. That'll be $25 and will be there in 40 minutes.\" He didn't even ask us how we were paying. Since we wanted to pay with a card, we called right back to give them the card information. The employee once again seemed like he had no clue what was going on and thought we were calling to add on to the order. He didn't understand we just needed to give the card information. It was pretty frustrating. If the food would have been out of this world I would have excused it, but it was really just average. 20 wings and a half hoagie was $25."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! The taking orders lady should be fired as due to her bad attitude i just canceled my order."}
{"text":"The food is not the problem for this pizza place.  It's actually quite good.  The problem is the accuracy.  I ordered a breaded chicken hoagie with lettuce and cheese only.   Easy enough.  Well I got one with tomatoes, onions, and tons of mayo.  Yuck.  So I called up and the man was really nice, and said that he'll get another one to me ASAP.  Which was done, however the second hoagie was correct on the toppings, but it was grilled chicken.  AND the grilled chicken was icky little squares.  Ew.  Just ew.  Not like a real piece of chicken.  NOT HAPPY.   If you want what you order to be right, maybe just pick another place.  That's what I am going to do next time."}
{"text":"This is a technocrat's pizza parlor.   If you order online, you are taken to a website called foodler.com. You place your order just like you would order a book on amazon.com, and you get a total and everything. They even calculate a tip for you (15 or 20 percent) that you can put on the card, send you an email confirmation, and even estimate a delivery time.  The food came ten minutes early. Pretty nice.   Was it good?   Oh my my, oh hell yes, got to put on your party dress! Or um...pants if you're um...not that there's anything wrong with, I mean, Roddy Piper wore a kilt...  While they've embraced the future in terms of placing orders, they get medieval when it comes to food prep.  Stone oven folks. That's what they say anyway, and I'm inclined to believe 'em since this was crispy and chewy where it needed to be with a strong mozzarella blend, a nicely sweet 'n somewhat chunky sauce, and those uncanned mushrooms that get burnt when the pie comes out.   The Aprimo Steak has it all and as a result is magnificently sloppy. If you ate it standing up you'd be doing the Philly Stoop, and you wouldn't care who was staring since what you're eating would be too good to allow for an awareness of your surroundings.   \"Mozzarella & provolone, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, hot peppers, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes & Italian dressing,\" they sez.   What is it with mayo on steak hoagies these days around Pittsburgh, and why didn't people start doing this ten years ago? It's not the greatest steak hoagie ever, but it doesn't back down at all from any challenger.  The Italian Hoagie was rather good too. The bread on both sandwiches wasn't baked so much that it gets rock-like. It was toasted just enough to maintain pliancy and didn't skimp on the meat at all.   How many years has it been since we got delivery from anywhere in Mt. Oliver? Jeez. They have something to boast of now."}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck, yuck.  This pizza is not palatable.   We only ordered from there because of their aggressive coupon doorhanging campaign, and being recent transplants from Chicago, knew no better.  We sorely regretted the decision.   Anything would have been better than the pizza we received.  It's hard to screw up pizza, so the one star is awarded for accomplishing just that.   The pizza was laden with unevenly melted blobs of the worst mozzarella I've ever tasted, the sauce was bland, the crust lackluster, the toppings depressing.  No one should have to suffer this pizza.  I would advise them to shut down and stop desecrating the pizza world with this slop."}
{"text":"1and 1/2 hour to get a special prome pizza and bread sticks. Guy shows up and says i ordered wrong. I ordered of the prome i had hanging on my fridge. He gave me a crap remark as he was getting back in his delivery car, i called him on it. They take 1 and 1/2 hour to bring the wrong order, coward driver gives me a hard time under his breath... Place is no good."}
