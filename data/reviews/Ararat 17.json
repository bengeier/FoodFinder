{"text":"We love to try new types of cuisine, and never had the opportunity to explore Armenian or Georgian food until now.  Ararat 17 made for a great experience (loved the traditional music and elegant decor).

Between the two of us, we ordered:

Baltica Beer 8 - I didn't try this, but my dinner companion compared it to a Blue Moon

Tarragon Lemonade - so cute and tasty!  It looked like a tropical drink, but had a (surprise, surprise) citrusy and herbal taste.  To the restaurant:  if you would like to add a new cocktail to your menu, try adding some vermouth to the tarragon lemonade.  It would go great together!

Chicken Kiev - who doesn't love fried chicken stuffed with butter?  The chicken was a bit chewier than expected, but the breading was very crispy and the butter was perfectly seasoned.

Khinkali - a Georgian coworker insists this is THE dish you must order if trying Georgian cuisine for the first time.  So I did, and it was the perfect choice.  These are meat-stuffed boiled buns, each about half the size of my fist.  Ararat 17 serves them with sour cream and butter, but I tried them as recommended by my coworker:  seasoned only with black pepper.  He was certainly onto something because they were very yummy, but I only managed to eat 3 out of 8.  This could easily be split 2 or 3 ways.

Overall, we had a great time.  The service was very good, and we both thought the food was delicious.  This may have been our first experience with cuisine from this part of the world, but it definitely won't be our last time at Ararat 17."}
{"text":"Thought a place next to Harris Teeter in a Mathews strip mall would be a little kid friendly. They had 2 high chairs that were taken by others so we had to eat with the baby on our shoulder. It was a difficult meal and we rushed as fast as we could because we had to hold the baby. The establishment is not looking to have family clientele obviously. I wish there had been a review like this before we went so we would have known."}
{"text":"Ararat 17 is a wonderful addition to the area!  The menu has a wide selection of Mediterranean and Armenian appetizers, sandwiches and entrees.  The owners have transformed a bland space that previously housed other restaurants into a calming and comfortable oasis.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.

We had the spinach pie as an appetizer, which was fabulous with a very flaky pastry.  My husband had the lamb sandwich and I had the Armenian stuffed beef as entrees.  Both were great.  Choose the hummus, cole slaw and rice balls as your sides.  The hummus was smooth and creamy, while the non-mayonnaise based cole slaw had a nice tang.  I could have eaten a whole plate of the rice balls, which had a crunchy exterior but a creamy interior like risotto.   We tried two desserts, the baklava and the Armenian Una (?).  I love that they were light and not overly sweet, a perfect way to end our meal."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch there. Great ambiance. Food was delicious and very tasty. We definitely will go back to try different stuff. Friendly staff and a great place to enjoy s great food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant! Quality food and great staff.  Thank you.  

From the smooth music in the background to the wide variety of selections available on the menu it will make it enjoyable."}
{"text":"Very nice place! We celebrated my wife's birthday here. Amazing food, amazing service, glad we came here and will come back again."}
{"text":"Great food!
Pleasant staff.
Very hard tp find great tasting mediterranean cuisine around these parts.
This restaurant covers it all. Well seasoned, well cooked food and an amazing assortment of wine pairings."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a good Middle Eastern restaurant to open in Charlotte, and better yet, Ararat 17, is an Armenian restaurant. Everything I grew up on in the Detroit area, where Middle Eastern restaurants are everywhere. The food was excellent! Totally authentic! We'll be back often!"}
{"text":"This is the real stuff. Being Armenian I'm a tough judge when it comes to food I can compare to my mom and pops and this gets an A, no doubt. Great people, great food. Highly recommend it to all. Thank you Ararat!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food here. Everything is made from scratch and the flavors are absolutely delicious. Staff and service was great too. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, delicious and authentic Armenian food, along with a welcoming ambiance will have us coming again and again! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"we liked this restaurant a lot , the place is very clean , nice furnished and  food. .. its  so tasty , everything is   fresh  and portions are big..  when you read the   menu ,   everything sounds so delicious  .  me and my husband will be back to try more dishes from the menu."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good service and very good food. Kinda pricey but portions are on the large side"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Kabobs are incredible, and large portions. Had the Lula Lamb and beef. Hummus and salad great, good service and nice ambiance. Date night or families. Most tables were occupied on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Nn-existent service  The food might be fantastic, we will never know.  We were seated right away.  There were 2 other tables of diners, so not a busy time.  After sitting at the table for 15 minutes, no one came by the table at all, not even to give us water.  One server walked by after 10 minutes, looked at us, and kept going. All 4 of us had looked at and discussed the menu, and had decided what we wanted to order. Never got the chance.  After 15 minutes of sitting there being ignored, we left.  That was not acknowledged either. No staff said a single word."}
{"text":"It was alright not quite impressive for first time. Quite place with lots of variety but tastes same"}
{"text":"A surprise find near my house.   Great food, service is outstanding, and plenty of options for all on the menu.  Yes, the rice balls are the BEST!

My only 'ding' is the background music was too loud.  Should be BACKGROUND music, not blaring.  

Looking forward to my next dining experience at Ararat 17....."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fantastic food, drinks and service then look no further. This place has a wide range of food to suit anyone's needs! Everything's made in house and fresh as can be. Too many good things to say and nothing bad. Just go and see for yourself! Chicken kabobs and hummus are my favorite so far with many things still to try. Quit pondering and just go!!"}
{"text":"OMG. My friend told me about this place a month ago and I should have come right over. This food is amazing, from app to baklava. Everything that all four of us got was so so good!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is good , food what I tried is worth trying once if you want to try Mediterranean Armenian cuisine, but I don't think I will return to try again . Ararat chicken cutlets are good , didn't like khinkali at all. It was tasteless beef Georgian dumpling. Medium range prices."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today for something new after our Queens Feast plans fell through. I saw their ad on Instagram earlier this month and was intrigued.  We arrived around 3pm and the place was empty. The waiter said we could have our pick of tables, so I chose a cute round table in the corner, but was told we couldn't sit at it because it was for 5 people (we were a party of 2) but we could pick any table for  2 or 4 people.  So I chose a window-side table for 2; after all, I wouldn't want to take up too much space in a completely empty restaurant. 

Moving on.... the decor was fresh and inviting. The place looked immaculately clean. The waiter was friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. They offer food I haven't eaten before, so I was excited.  Based on other Yelp reviews, I immediately ordered the Pomegranate wine.  It's amazing!  If you go, you have to try it!   In fact, you should go just to try the wine. 

Now on to the food...  We ordered Dolma ($6.95) for our appetizer, which was stuffed grape leaves. It was a good choice and I enjoyed it.  However, the food beyond this was average - not what I would have expected for the price point.  I tried the Chicken Shawarma ($14.95).  It was ok. Didn't love it, but didn't hate it.  The price point was ok with the 3 sides. My hubby splurged on the Seafood Combination Kabob ($29.95).  He thought it would be great to try Sturgeon, a fish he had never had before , but it was a bit of a disappointment. All of the seafood on his plate was over-cooked and rubbery.  And salty.  Definitely too much salt on the Salmon.  We skipped dessert. 

We won't be going back, unless we go to pick up a bottle of Pomegranate wine.  They do sell wine by the bottle.... That wine made the whole trip worthwhile."}
{"text":"Fantastic kabobs and pomegranate wine! I loved the lamb and beef kabobs. I got the two kabobs plate with three sides--coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and hummus. The lamb was my favorite and the spices and seasoning was perfect. We liked
all the sides--hummus was my favorite. 
The appetizer of rice balls was phenomenal and we shared the five and had leftovers. They also give you bread as a free appetizer, including a yummy herb mixture for dipping. The pomegranate wine was sweet and refreshing. The awesome waiters were attentive and gave us tastes of the wine.
The restaurant is next to Harris Teeter and there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their salads, hummus and the rest of the food, all of which is very fresh and delicious.  Even the atmosphere is nice (for a strip center restaurant); you almost feel like you're in Armenia.  I do wish they were open on Monday, since I use them often for dinner takeout."}
{"text":"This place has been open a few weeks and already has rave reviews.  We decided to try it tonight for dual Birthday celebrations. The food is wonderful, the portions are generous, the ambiance with the music was perfect. We ordered the gyro dinner, Cornish hen and chicken cutlet and for appetizers we had the eggplant dip (delicious) and the taziki salad. All us were very pleased with everything we tried. The server was very kind and although he was busy, he remembered everything extra that we asked him for. I look forward to returning and trying different things. I think that with the good service and keeping the food delicious they will get a great following. Kudos the the chef as everything is made from scratch according to the host. Prices are very good overall."}
{"text":"We went for lunch last Saturday and were very impressed! For such a small restaurant we found the atmosphere to be quite elegant! The food was excellent, as others have mentioned on this website. We were not at all disappointed after having driven a half hour from the other side of Charlotte to get there.We loved the warm borsh soup with a dollop of sour cream. We found all of the food to be authentic and made with love."}
{"text":"Being Armenian, I'm fairly picky about Armenian food. This place is the real deal! We will definitely be coming back, probably weekly. Each of our party of five had something different and we were all very pleased."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! We brought 9 people there the other day and had a great time! The various dumplings--pelmeni, khinkali, etc. were great. The food was very fresh and we especially liked the bread, the Kilikia beer...but the really tender and wonderful beef kabobs were a very special treat. Each of us liked a different dessert, and of course, we ended it all with Armenian coffee."}
{"text":"We went to Ararat 17 last night with another couple. We each ordered something different and we were all very happy with our meals. I ordered the rice balls to start because I read on Yelp that they were good. I'm happy to report I wasn't disappointed. The order was 5 fairly large rice balls, so plenty to share. I tried the pomegranate wine. It was a little sweeter than I normally drink, but I wanted to try something different. The other 3 had a Russian beer and they all liked it. The food portions were good and the prices reasonable. There were 2 dessert choices, baklava and a napoleon. We got one of each and shared. Our server was very pleasant and attentive. It was fairly quiet for a Friday night, so I hope more people find out about it so it stays around for a long time."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the warm surroundings, the food was excellent and service was outstanding!!  This will be a regular place for us going forward. 

Ovik was an excellent server!  Ask for him by name."}
{"text":"Wow... Just wow!  This is now one of my top five restaurants in the greater Charlotte area.  The food was OUTSTANDING!   One of those restaurants where everything on the menu looks delicious.   The place looks brand new, is wonderfully appointed, and has a friendly staff.  The owner said 'hi' on the way out.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful,elegant, and fresh Armenian cuisine! Our party of 6 enjoyed it immensely! Hummus is excellent and shawarma is so great!"}
{"text":"Armenian restaurants are not exactly common in Charlotte so when one appears you go try it. In this case the experience paid off. The food is very good, authentic, and tasty. I had the dolmas and my son had the shish-kebab and both meals exceeded my expectations for sub $20 entrees. 

We walked in about 6pm and were only one of three tables. By the time we left there were people waiting to be seated. Given that this is a new restaurant they're still working out the kinks on the service but that's to be expected and while things were a little slow on the service side the food arrived hot and the waiter was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant! Beautiful presentation. Nice people. Reasonable prices. Great selection. Fantastic food! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean restaurant in usa .The service is very elegant the food is the best I ever seen so far for 25 Year's in usa . Waiters are the most polite and service is in perfection .I do recommend this restaurant as the best in east coast and I will recommend all Mediterranean population in east cost to try and they will love the food for sure .prices are very reasonable and very affordable

{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. Very classy one of a kind restaurant in Charlotte! has a relaxing ambiance and pleasant music plays in the background that makes the overall dining experience a whole lot better!
Service-5 stars
Ambiance-5 stars
Food-5 stars 

Not to mention the portions are very generous and plate design is beautiful. Highly recommend this place for a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"As someone with a lot of Balkan, Mediterranean and Russian food experience, I had high hopes for Ararat 17. I had this place in my sights for a couple of months and had the opportunity to try it, tonight, with my wife.

The food was excellent and so was the atmosphere. The Muttabal and Tabbouleh salad were both very good and extremely detailed. I think that this is the best Tabbouleh we had in the US, so far (we love sour, minty Tabbouleh). 

Both Lula Kebab and Shawarma were perfectly done as well. Seasoning was spot on. So were the deserts and the Armenian coffee we had to wash this all down. 

Notable mention: these guys serve Baltica Beer (Russian), which we never head in the US before (we had our share of Baltica elsewhere).

Ovik, our host, was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable and made the entire experience better.

If you are looking for a great offering of Armenian, Balkan, Mediterranean and Russian food, I would highly recommend that you give Ararat a try!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant, it had been recommended by a few people. It was not a disappointment. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Definitely recommend and make sure you have the rice balls!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here & I'd highly recommend! We had the combination platter including homemade hummus, grape leaves & tabouli..everything was extremely fresh and beautifully presented. Our waiter Ovik was very helpful in recommending popular dishes, the rice balls & euro platter which were delicious! He was super friendly and took obvious pride in his restaurant...go there for some Armenian cuisine & you'll forget you're in Charlotte :)"}
{"text":"Ararat is a new opened restaurant . The ambience is great . Beautiful bar and set of chairs and tables . Food is awesome. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is they are short in waiters . They need more employees to cover up serving people because restaurant gets full soon !"}
{"text":"This restaurant had been open all but a week when I walked in for lunch. Albeit was Sunday I don't believe they have built their traffic to where they have regulars quite yet. So the restaurant was very empty. Walking into this establishment, I got the sense of what they were trying to achieve. The ambiance felt very upscale and I thought the decor was on point. The chairs had alligator skin on it and it looked very shick.  The food was great. The appetizers were delicious. We had the 3 meat kabob with fries, hummus and rice balls. It was very good. The reason they earned my 4 start as opposed to the 5 was due to the wait time of getting our food. They're still getting their timing on check, but I fully expect them to have a handle on it before my next visit. Great service, good food, wonderful decor, what else can you hope for."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere here is out of this world!  You've got to try them out and keep them open. This place is a real gem in the area. Austin Village doesn't get a lot of traffic so I'm worried they won't make it."}
{"text":"We started with the rice ball appetizer--a generous portion you could share with 4 people, but there were only two of us to eat them (and we did!). Filled with rice, mushrooms and cheese they were a great introduction to the restaurant. 
I had the chicken shish kabob sandwich with a side of hummus. Inside the pita with the chicken breast pieces was a nice \"salad\" of lettuce, tomato and cucumber. The pita was soft and warm. Delicious. 
My husband had the Gyro sandwich with a side salad. He said it was large, flavorful and he liked the chunky tomatoes inside. Yum yum. 
We looked at the homemade desserts, but we were stuffed, so we'll have to go back to try those. 
The decor was impressive. The place looks brand new. Tables were artfully set. The bar was high end and inviting. The restrooms were spotless."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. I especially enjoyed the Blinchik appetizer.  The desserts were so good!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is sparkling with nice furniture and a definitely eye catchy bar. The moment you step inside, it does appeal you giving you a sense of cleanliness and luxury. Once you are seated in your table, you get this cramped feeling - obviously the restaurant is a bit smaller and has packed more tables than it should. You are provided with bread and oregano as a free appetizer. Not very appetizing, would have loved if they had hummus instead. The menu gives you a variety of Mediterranean options with some sandwich options that may be for the not so adventurous patrons. The options are indeed fun with a twist. The Arrarat cutlet gets a definite vote of innovation from me - a chicken hot pocket packed with spinach and mushrooms! The food came in with an extra delay than you would normally wait for. I could relate the delay with the 'now hiring' sign posted on the outside door. The food wasn't so bad - but it didn't really seem like a carefully orchestrated menu. You can order three sides from hummus, veg Salad, rice, French fries or mashed potatoes. Except for veg salad and rice, I found it rather difficult accompanies to meat. Are you supposed to choke down on the hummus or mashed potatoes? The French fries are not your regular American fries - I found them rather larger chunks of unappetizing steamed or baked potatoes. For a cuisine known for their meats, found that their chicken or lamb was not succulent and juice. They were much more hard and rubbery, it does definitely become a struggle point of your meal. The portions are good but it's on the pricey side - about 35-40$ for two with just entrees.

Summing up Arrarat definitely tries to set itself apart from other Mediterranean restaurants by giving a great ambience and styling, with an innovative menu. With all that well done, the food is not top of its class."}
{"text":"As an Armenian growing up in Los Angeles and recently moving to NC, I had lost hope I would eat delicious Armenian (Mediterranean) food again until I tried Ararat 17. Dare I say the food taste better then anything I have had in LA? 

We ordered the \"family platter\" and it was seriously enough food to feed 4 adult men. Everything that came out from the kitchen was fresh and tasted amazing. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!  We'll be coming back!  We loved the tabuleh and the Luleh kabob especially."}
{"text":"It was a last minute substitute to try out this restaurant just because it has high ratings on Yelp. And indeed it has been a great choice. The 5 of us were hungry enough to order a variety of appetizers and mains. Everything was fresh, tasty and good. The hummus, the falafel, the cabbage salad, the chicken schnitzel, the jumbo shrimps, the brisket, were all cooked to perfection. I didn't think I would enjoy Middle Eastern food as much as I did. So did everyone else. Then we notice the clean and unpretentious surrounding. Oh, before I forget, the service was really friendly and pleasant. Would like to come back if I wasn't just visiting from California. But if you live in the area but hasn't been here, you should definitely frequent this place."}
{"text":"Went here when they first opened;  We started off with some houmus and fresh bread.  Then we tried a variety combination platter that included a mixed kabab, salad, rice, grape leaves and potatoes.  We also tried their khinkali (dumplings).  The best part was their pomegranate red wine! Absolutely fantastic!  I'm not usually a red wine drinker but this one made me love it!  Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Visited this quaint gem while in town on business. Everything was delicious...from the pomegranate wine to the Ararat Chicken, our tastebuds were delighted. Warm, inviting service and beautiful presentation. Everything was fresh and tasty. The Hummus!!!!  Just can't describe how unique and fresh. Go...just GO!"}
{"text":"All of the local Russian Facebook groups have been buzzing about a new Armenian restaurant that opened recently in Matthews so naturally we had to check it out ourselves.

Ararat17 is located in a strip mall, next to a Harris Teeter, as most great restaurants do. The name is inspired by Mount Ararat and 2017, the year that the restaurant opened.

The menu is large and spans Armenian, Georgian, Mediterranean, and Russian cuisines. The pricing is reasonable and the portions are generous.

Here's what we ordered on this visit:

A bottle of Revah Pomegranate wine from, you guessed it, Armenia.

Our first course was Tabbuli, one of my absolute favorite salads.

The second course consisted of two meat pies. We originally ordered the Khinkali (Georgian dumplings) but they were all out. Next time!

We tried two entrees: Cornish chicken tabaka and fresh sturgeon shish kabobs. The chicken was perfectly cooked and inspired me to re-create the recipe at home. The sturgeon was served with a sauce that was amazing and I forgot to ask what it was. All I know is that it is a reduction of some sort of a fruit.

Each entree is served with three sides and we tried as many as we could: hummus, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, french fries (for the toddler!), and rice balls.

The standout stars were rice balls and coleslaw. Yes, slaw! It's another dish I will try to re-create at home: cabbage, green apple, carrots, corn, and parsley tossed in a house dressing. Yum.

For dessert we ordered the chef's special. We didn't catch the name of the dessert but as soon as we took a bite we were transported back in time. It was almost identical to a cake my grandmother use to make for special occasions and holidays. It was a lovely trip down memory lane and a sweet way to end a great meal.

We're already planning our next visit, this time with a larger group so we can try even more menu items and share them family style."}
{"text":"Best in town. Great choices of alcohol and food. Classic place perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"Well this is my second trip to Ararat 17 and although it is a darling little restaurant, I don't think I will be back. We were seated and had a charming waiter. He brought us delicious, House Made, Armenian bread. We ordered the Mashed Eggplant to go with it. It was  good and smoky.  My husband ordered the Pork Schnitzel, which is a German dish, not quite sure why it was on the menu, but due to a allergy issue for Oregano, this was a suitable dish for him. It came with two nice pieces of Pork that were fried, a side of Hummus and Rice. He rated it pretty good in the taste box. My sister who is a Vegetarian had the Veggie Skewer, Big pieces of vegetables that looked grilled.  I ordered the Potato dumplings which seemed like they were Polish, Not Armenian. They were plain and I do mean plain, white boiled dumplings, filled with Mashed Potatoes, totally unseasoned! Sitting in a bowl with some water in the bottom. Not good, not flavorful, not anything. All the dishes lacked seasoning, and I am talking even the slightest bit of salt and pepper were missing. Just not what I expected in this cute little Strip Mall restaurant. So I would suggest stopping in for some  Armenian bread and perhaps the Eggplant, but my recommendations stop there..."}
{"text":"I haven't had beef stroganoff in a long time because it's mostly a northern dish OMG to die for. My wife had the lamb another fantastic dish. This is an upper class but not expensive fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Wait staff was very informative and attentive. Great wine full bar. And great atmosphere.

{"text":"My name is Sari and I have a confession: I have a passion for food. 
I enjoy trying different foods from different cuisines, and broaden my culinary horizon. 
I was excited to try an Armenian restaurant for the first time. I managed to drive to Ararat 17, 30-min drive from Uptown Charlotte, and it wasn't as exceptional as I hoped. It wasn't bad nor outstanding, but rather good food and worth sharing. I asked the waiter what's some of the traditional Armenian dishes, he suggested the \"Ararat\" Chicken Cutlet, so I got that. It was chicken breast stuffed with mushrooms, spinach and mozzarella cheese- nothing special. Also, we ordered a Mediterranean combo platter ( hummus, bland baba ganoush, dry falafel, and delicious dolma).  
Three Yelps."}
{"text":"My photo is of the lamb shish kabob. It was fantastic. Very flavorful meat. It came with 3 sides for a not bad price. We got two great appetizers. Try the grape leaves. We got cold and hot grape leaves, both of which were great. The service was good. 
I certainly recommend you try this. It's a great way to try Armenian food for the first time. I am Armenian and my dad grew up eating food like this every week. He was very pleased."}
{"text":"This restaurant  was wonderful. The food and service were great . You feel as though you could be in Yerevan. I am Armenian and felt the food was truly authentic and wonderful ."}
{"text":"Armenian and Mediterranean restaurant. Open since July 2017. Overall food was good. Service a little slow but okay. I think if they open longer that will have more experience.

You get home made Armenian bread made they're nice and thick with pita . A bowl of herb pour olive oil for dipping.

Appetizer: Combination platter with stuffed grape leaves (dolma), hummus, and tabouli. Best dolma I've had so far in Charlotte. Good amount of flavorful fillings, Tavoli with very good flavor. Hummus fresh and nice hint of citrus. 

We got a Greek salad with beef kebab. Beef kebab melt in your mouth but needs a little bit more of salt. Greek dressing didn't have much flavor but the salad has good variety of vegetable.

Chicken Pelmeni: ground chicken and a dumpling serve with sour cream and butter. Very flavorful. Remind me of pierogi.

Khinkali it's like a soup dumpling from Jorden. It's filled with lamb. Also can be eaten with sour cream and butter. Reminds me of the Chinese soup dumpling. Very flavorful definitely recommend.

I have the porkchops with rice, hummus, and cabbage salad. Cabbage salad has a vinegar tone no mayonnaise. It also has Granny Smith apple along with corn mix with it I like the combination.The Porkchop was nicely cooked to perfect temperature with good Armenian seasoning.

To finish it off we had Armenian coffee and Armenian cake which is like a honey cake. The cake was not sweet it had the perfect flavor.  it felt dry but when you put it in your mouth it was perfect.

Armenian coffee comes black like an espresso shot no sugar or cream. I liked it it did not have a bitter aftertaste but my husband did not mix it and felt He was drinking dirt.

Would recommend. Definitely getting more dolma and"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Charlotte!  Everything is made from scratch daily.  Service was outstanding.  Fabulous!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such high hopes, and the food might be amazing. I couldn't tell you. 
4 of us went on a Saturday night. There were 2 tables with patrons outside and 2 inside. We were seated right away.... And then completely ignored. After 15 minutes without a word to us we left. They never told us 1 minute and we will be with you, or a glass of water. On the way out the door we passed 2 servers and still not a word."}
{"text":"This is becoming a family tradition for birthday dinners.  Food is fantastic and service is fabulous.  We like to try something different all the time.  Service here has always steered us to great dinner selections.  I have kids 14 and 16 and they enjoy this place too."}
{"text":"Heard they had Armenian food here, and figured I hadn't had Armenian food lately (perhaps ever), so what the heck. As an aside, the food in this strip mall is top notch, with Poppyseed's, Bisonte, and now Ararat, but I digress.

So what is Armenian food? Where the heck is Armenia? As it turns out, Armenia is near the middle east. So it is perhaps no surprise you'e talking Persian food. It's kababs (however you choose to spell them), shwarma, hummus and the like. They do turn things up a notch, and are a bit fancier than, say, Kabab Je, but don't mind if you arrive in casual clothes.

One item on the menu that we tried that I haven't seen elsewhere is the pomegranate wine. Definitely different, and worth a taste.

As to the food - very tasty. They have things other than your standard Persian fare if you don't feel like it, so branch out a bit if you like. The staff will help some with the menu (but mostly just suggests a few things that you can probably read yourself). All in all a worthwhile trip to the outskirts of Matthews."}
{"text":"FINALLY a great restaurant in this space! The food is super fresh and plenty. The hummus is amazing! Waiter was super friendly and helpful.  Definitely give this a try."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today, Ovik was our server and service was great. Food was exceptional. We tried several different items from the menu all of them were delicious, but the chicken kabob was our favorite. I will definitely go back again. Highly recommend trying out this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent food-Mediterranean with many Russian specialties like Borsht and blintzes-think sour cream items.
The hummus is one of the best around here as are there take on gyro sandwiches. 

Strip mall however it is a fancy tablecloth place- but casual is ok. I have been here multiple times and have seen dates, senior citizens, families, and even people carrying out here."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight. Excellent fare and service. Freshly made. Will return."}
{"text":"I spent 10 weeks in the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe (Greek, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Georgia but never made it to Armenia.  I just found Ararat 17 last week and decided to give it a try.  I got there late and the family that owns Ararat 17 were in the process of closing up early for the evening but the owner refused to let me leave and they opened back up to make me a Gyro and even offered a glass of wine. The Gyro was the best I have had in the United States and I will testify for the authenticity of the food and the owners.  It is a place I will visit often.  I don't need to travel around the world to get a taste and have my memories of my trip.  Please if you are at all curious, try this place, it isn't what you assume and I will guarantee you it will be a very pleasantly surprise as I was."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about this restaurant! There are a few places to get kebab in the area (surprisingly) but Ararat 17 is on a different level. 

This is a little gem in beside Harris Teeter that you can easily miss while driving by. Don't make that mistake!

The food is authentic and expertly prepared. If you want to know what stuffed grape leaves made by an Armenian grandma taste like, order them here

My party had lula kebab, grape leaves, chicken kebab, steak sandwich, grape leaves, hummus, and falafel. All of it was delicious. And finally, tabouli the way it's supposed to be prepared! 

Dessert was also excellent. We had baklava and their version of a napolean which was so light and delicious I could've eaten two. 

Service was professional and flawless. 

Entrees run from about $16.95 to the mid-$20's and each dinner comes with 3 sides. Here is my only critique. There is no vegetable option for the sides. That seems a bit strange. It's a choice of fries, mashed, rice balls, rice, hummus, or cole slaw. I'm sorry, cole slaw doesn't count. I would LOVE to see a seasonal  daily vegetable offered. Otherwise, I'd have given Ararat 5 stars. 

*try the pomegranate wine from Armenia. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a mix of Russian, middle Eastern and French food... I guess mix those all together and you get Armenian?  That's beside the point, the food is good and the ppl are nice."}
{"text":"Just don't like the food, I was expecting kebab from charcoal mangal, as they said before we ordered , but they brought just simple and dry kebab from grill"}
{"text":"What can I say Excellent food and Excellent service! Lovely venue with a very nice ambience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, best humus I have had since NY. Great Tabbouleh salad, very fresh. Love the young waiter, the seasons and oil, reasonably priced. Not sure why it was so quiet on a Friday night. Weill be sure to take the drive and bring my husband  back to try it. The only think I was not a fan of is it was so good we bought a humus home so my husband could try it and the chips were so hard  and stale they snapped or cracked. I would suggest if you are prepackaging bags to go, use a zip lock bag or do it when ordered.  Otherwise I LOVED IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Exciting to have some Russian options in our area! Hearty and huge portions, just wish there were more veggie options!"}
{"text":"Pristine and delicious. The lighting was a bit bright but what you gonna do? I'm too full to write a full review."}
