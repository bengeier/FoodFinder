{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5

Came here for a professional meeting. Not sure if we had the regular menu, or a revised one which had fewer options, but there was still a variety to choose from

Food:
Zucchini soup: a little texture in the soup with a little kick, which I loved. Not too salty.
Beef tenderloin: perfect for me. Not too chewy, not overcooked. The roasted potatoes tasted a little weird to me. I can't pinpoint exactly what it was, but it left a slight bitter after taste, but still edible.
Pineapple ginger jelly with cream cheese for dessert: I was not a fan. The cream cheese was super thick and flavor was way too strong, the texture of the jelly was very dense. I think I was expecting more of a jello consistency.

Service:
Awesome. We had the whole room downstairs to ourselves.  So we were offered wine right when we got in. Waiters came around to take our order not long after we sat down. The only thing was that when they were refilling our wine glasses, they kept spilling on the table, and on my dish. I guess that's really nothing to be complaining about.

Atmosphere:
Beautiful there. There was a waterfall in our room on the main floor, which would be perfect for a date. However we were there for a conference, which made it a little hard for the speakers to hear the audience. The room was very spacious. Definitely enough room to connect and mingle. I think it is usually open for regular dining too. So hopefully, you go on a night when there are no meetings, so you can enjoy the mini waterfall too."}
{"text":"I found the shrimp and tuna ceviche to be very weird. First off it was full of walnuts, pine nuts and chic peas. Secondly it was way under seasoned. No lemon, no salt, no spice and no cilantro. It should be called shrimp and tuna salad. It was in no way, a ceviche. The fish tacos were tasty. I found the braised octopus to be flavourless. And the dessert of caramel creme brûlée, was underdone and liquidy. I will not be back. Food wasn't up to par. I used to come here back in the day and food was much better."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there today for a special birthday lunch. It was our first time there and my birthday was completely ruined by the stomach pain and sickness we both had and I wish I could blame it on something else but we both got sick the minute we walked out of there. We had the summerlicious menu and the food did not taste bad at all but the cheesecake was not quite right. I am very disappointed as I always heard great things about this place but I got to say we will never go back."}
{"text":"Went to Sassafraz for the Winterlicious Lunch. Their interior is beautiful, the service is top-notch but their food is just okay. I have never seen such dedicated staffs who execute everything perfectly. Everything was set up in a perfect traditional fine dining manner which made the atmosphere even more enjoyable! Food-wise it was a bit bland and nothing too special that stood out to me. 
I first started off with the cold bread and butter, then the luke warm cream of corn potage, followed by an entree of well-cooked tender beef short ribs ending it with an ordinary toffee pudding cake. Presentation was excellent but taste-wise, it was still something I could have thrown at home together myself.
The portions were adequate and overall satisfactory. I've heard a lot of good comments about Sassafraz''s food but in my opinion, the restaurant was all talk and no show."}
{"text":"Went on Friday July 20 as part of Summerlicious.
The service and atmosphere were excellent.

The food was very good, my husband and I shared the swordfish and cornish hen. The appetizers, scallops and pork belly were well done. The dessert includes chocolate brownie and cheese platter."}
{"text":"The environment is perfect, with a very romantic glasses roof. And the drink is fantastic"}
{"text":"Excellent service from the moment we entered to the time we finished eating. Food portions are perfect and the taste is heavenly. Staff is super accommodating. Loved every second of it. Classy decor and classy selection of food. Good job team Sassafraz!"}
{"text":"Ordered the ancho braised lamb taco, it was exactly what I expected and the fries that came with it were also very good and the price was just right.
The service was great and the restaurant itself was very nice."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst meal I've had all year. Beautiful weather (hot and sunny), you would think that this restaurant would alter it's menu to accommodate the heat. Instead the uninspiring menu had us ordering a wilted salad with less than a tsp of goat cheese. For my main I ordered salmon, which was overcooked, dry and tasteless. My companion ordered the scallops. There were 4 on the plate!  The service was missing in action. Given this restaurants stunning location, TIFF around the corner, I recommend they fire the chef, train the waitstaff and modernize their menu. This is a definite NO NO"}
{"text":"Summerliciousy Sassafraz serves up a meaty fine dining experience despite pesky proletariats a.k.a. moi.

Quick Notes:
1) Summerlicious - A time to pretend to be much classier and well-monied than you are. Hint: likely fooled nobody. 
2) Sassafraz - A resto in Yorkville that promises classy French cuisine and fancy decor at astronomical prices. Expectation: Tiny servings of tasty food I can't pronounce. Yelp homework indicated mixed reviews but generally positive.

Verdict: 

Wallet-pains truncate future visitation; however, fine quality food and an extremely thrifty Summerlicious deal make this resto a Summerlicious contender for the ages!

Atmosphere:

Modern, vaguely rustic chic. This once-Victorian home now comes outfitted with clean white tablecloths, mood lighting and a coutured rock wall featuring an appropriately minimal waterfall. Shh, don't disturb the diners! The classic location, right in the heart of Yorkville, gives superb opportunity to peoplewatch while enjoying your meal. Definitely come dressed to impress, but at least at Summerlicious, cocktail dresses are not recommended. Little black dress, ahoy!

Food: 

Prix Fix $45.00 plus a $65 Bordeaux (read: a $20 LCBO Bordeaux with resto markup).

I curse Paris for ruining me forever. The bread was a disappointment. Butter couldn't save it. Made me want to go to the bakery section at Longo's.

I went upscale on my meats this Summerlicious, having regrets from a previous Summerlicious adventure. Hint: When there is lamb, why order chicken?

Appetizer scallops were tender and the knife went through them like butter. Lonely in the centre of the huge plate on a decorative shrivel of spinach, the scallop duo was nonetheless delicious.

I went to third base on the entree with a medium rare steak that tended towards the medium but was extremely delicious. And big! I was expecting tiny proportions but the steak was 6 oz! The meat quality was excellent, with no cartilage, no inner marbling or sinew, and an appropriate layering of outside fat for added flavour.  The simple, skin-in mashed potatoes tasted good because they were loaded with fine butter or buttercream. Hard to screw that up, but it was nice. The tablespoon of peas and the artsy drizzle of peas puree were there to add colour, c'est tout. 

Banana creme tarte with 1.5 tbsp of mango sorbet was a hit all across our table and for good reason. The banana cream was perfection - it tasted like pureed bananas and My Little Ponies. The mango sorbet was similarly magic. My only gripe was the thickness and sweetness of the cookie in the tart crust, which threatened to overpower the My Little Bananas.

Service:

Good, nothing special. I didn't see much of our servers, but Summerlicious is an odd time and no doubt a hectic experience. Still, nothing standout here. They did, however, serve our food at the same time, which we appreciated.

Location:

Suburbanites, you can get off at Museum if you want a nice walk down Bloor and the Holt Renfrew. If you are wearing painful shoes, transfer subway lines and go to Bay - Cumberland exit. Walk two uberslow, Michael Kors minutes of hip-sashay and you'll be at the front door. 

Overall:

Sassafraz impressed with surprisingly simple food and ample entree portions that left our sassy group of seven quite satisfied. Recommended for Summerlicious only, or if you don't mind forking over your monthly car insurance payment to impress someone with a classic fine dining Toronto experience."}
{"text":"3.5 - Been meaning to check this place out for quite some time. Service was just okay but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt cause I went for dinner later in the evening. Plus the guy who delivered my food said I had good taste in what I ordered so there's good staff my waiter was just preoccupied.
Drink prices may seem steep but once you see the wine list you might as well grab a cocktail, and the choices really complemented the season.
Food quality was excellent. I started with oysters which were briny just how I like them. Could have done a tiny tiny better job removing the grit but not at all bad. Then got the mac and cheese with andouille sausage and it was so rich and buttery. Would have liked to stay for dessert and a coffee but the vibe I was getting was to clear out.
I would definitely go back just for drinks. It wasn't a disappointing experience but I'm sure for the price there's something in the area that's downright spectacular."}
{"text":"First and foremost, yeah, this restaurant is in a nice area of Toronto, Yorkville. Great place for people watching and seeing fashionable people. I have been to Sassafraz quite a number of times and each time that I go, I am more and more disappointed! 

Recently, some work friends went to celebrate and new promotion. The ambiance is nice and so was the staff but the food, well, it is not nearly as good as it used to be!

The food was very uninspiring, bland, lacked finesse and was really just something that anyone could cook at home. When at Sassafraz, for what you pay, you are expecting top notch presentation, flavour and taste but yet, it just isn't there anymore whatsoever! 

I ordered the chicken on quinoa and it was bland, lacked flavour, the quinoa was watery and just tasteless. My friends ordered the lobster tail which looked as if it came from a can. It was limp and lacked any flavour as well. My friends who ordered the steaks were happy with them but the sides were very boring and bland.

I would recommend going for dessert, which was awesome, but skip the main course. Go elsewhere in the area for the amount of money that you will spend."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here having purchased a groupon, our server was friendly and attentive making for a good dining experience. 

For apps:
Lobster bites: Fried green tomatoe with lobster, fish eggs and greens on top. This was tasty and had a good combination of flavours.
Baked Escargots: There were about 8 escargots baked in a creamy cheese sauce with mushrooms, served with crustini. This was heavier so I found it good for sharing.

Main: 
Beef Striploin: This was pretty big (10oz) cooked to a perfect medium with horse radish butter on top, which added nice flavour. This was served with creamy kale and mushroom and roasted sunchoke. The creamy kale and mushroom was very salty...and I found myself drinking a lot of water that night.

Dessert:
Strawberry rhubarb cheesecake:  This was a nice cheesecake, with a hint of tart rhubarb on the inside. (it was crustless) perfect end to a meal.
Maple Beignets: I was expecting a warm light and fluffy beignet, and was disappointed it tasted more like a tim bit. The amaretto creme anglaise was good. After my first bite, I regret not ordering the milk chocolate mousse instead."}
{"text":"I visited Sassafraz last night as part of their Summerlicious promotion. After reading a couple of other Summerlicious @ Sassafraz reviews below, I was a bit skeptical so I admit that I went to the restaurant with low expectations. 

Perhaps it was because I wasn't expecting much that I was pleasantly surprised at the experience and the food. The hostesses were extremely friendly and our waiter was both attentive and polite. 

Contrary to what a few other commenters have said, I actually found the portions to be generous. I had the creole shrimp and grit cake to start, and there were at least five huge shrimp on the plate. With an extra side, this could have been a meal in itself! 

For my entrée I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The pork chop was HUGE and I found myself unable to finish it. (This is shocking because I have a talent for eating.) As something of a mashed potato fiend, I was a little disappointed with their offering but the collard greens were well-cooked and tasty. 

I ended the meal with the cheese plate with flatbreads and fruit. Though the cheese was delicious (and award-winning according to the menu!) I found myself wishing I had gotten a \"real\" dessert instead. I had a bite of each of the other desserts: the blueberry tartlet, and the cherry \"soup\" with chocolate mousse. I would highly recommend the cherry soup and mousse. It had some kind of crunchy bits on top that were so tasty! 

All in all, I enjoyed the experience. The food was delicious and I liked the décor and ambiance at the restaurant. I would definitely recommend the Licious experience at Sassafraz to others."}
{"text":"Sassafraz is one of the Toronto's gems. Brunch, lunch, dinner: they're all good, and the service is always excellent. For instance, at dinner, I asked if the risotto was vegetarian. The server confirmed it was, but asked if I ate fish, and I said no. When the fish-based amuse-bouche came for everyone else at the table, I was given my own vegetarian one--no need to even ask. 

Wonderful restaurant for a lovely night out, and the cafe is perfect for a more low-key, but equally satisfying, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Was there for summerlicious. Really not worth the money. Food was mediocre. Service - excellent."}
{"text":"Great summer patio. I like going for brunch in the winter sometimes, but really it's all about the summer patio. This is where you go for people watching 100%.

The service is pretty good and as far as the swank value, it's pretty affordable. I like the nicoise, but that's kinda a standard for me. This is a great place for an after work drink."}
{"text":"A nice patio for a summer lunch.  Reasonably creative and well-executed bistro-contemporary cuisine, although for the summer and the style of the menu the chef has a bit of a free hand with the sugar and the oil -- a tad lighter across the board would have been in order.  Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I held my wedding reception here  - the food was amazing, the service 1st class and the decorations were beautiful.  The staff really made my day run smoothly.  
I highly recommend sassafraz!"}
{"text":"Pretty good- atmosphere is nice, although a bit loud, food is solid but lacks a bit on flavor and presentation. Service is just ok, not exceptional. Overall, enjoyable, but not a complete \"fine dining experience\"."}
{"text":"Sigh.
Stopped in for a cocktail and a beer on a warm Wednesday evening. We were seated right away by a lovely hostess on the Bellair side patio where we were left parched and unattended for 25 minutes. Interestingly, bus boys and other servers walked down Bellair and they made eye contact(ish) and offered us half smiles.
 But we didn't come for that.
 We came for a drink. Did I mention it was hot out?!?
 After another forgotten table aggressively flagged down a bus boy to place their order, we decided to stop being nice Canadians and impose ourselves upon our server and place a drink order...which arrived 10 mins later: 1 cool beer (not cold) and 1 terribly artificial and cloying watermelon mojito accompanied by a meek inquiry from Manager Mario as to whether we have been 'well taken care of this evening?'
Hey Sassafraz, maybe you can fool the tourists, but you are no longer chic enough to pull off bad service."}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious. Loved the flat iron steak. Had the scallops for appetizer, they were a bit too sweet for my liking, dessert was a bit blah. All in all, Decent food, nice deco, will prob return."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in terms of everything. I always have such a great experience. The staff are extremely friendly and positive and make you feel very welcomed. The restaurant itself is stunning with a huge plant wall/waterfall at the back. The sound of the falling water is so serene. The food is always cooked to perfection (I recommend their buffalo mozzarella, steak as well as their gnocchi). What I enjoy about this restaurant the most is how creative they are with their menu. Their flavours are always unique and exceptional and you can tell they have fun preparing their menus which transfers to customers that order from it. Just great positive vibes and always a wonderful experience when I go there. Recommend everybody to try this restaurant at least once!"}
{"text":"So I had a groupon voucher that was expiring soon, so I decided to make good use of it. This place is known for their yellow victorian home and is split between a cafe on the right and the fine dine on the left. We sat inside the dining area for this occasion. We sat by where the running little falls were against the tree wall. You hear the nice pleasant flow of water pouring down. One thing about fine dine I DO NOT like is the darkness! Its hard to see the menu and also the dish that is presented to you.

We presented the voucher to our server Walter and he handed us a pre-fixed groupon selection. 

For starters we got the beet salad and roasted bone marrow.

Ontario beets walnut crusted chèvre croquettes / field lettuce / pickled fennel /maple tarragon vinaigrette
- I thought the size for this is quite small, but then again it is a salad.
- I enjoyed the oven cooked cheese round balls.
- Not a big fan of arugula. Beets are new to me and I hear its healthy.

Wild mushrooms and Marrow garbanzo purée / roast garlic / lemon frisée / house crostini 
- First time trying bone marrow and it was a hit n miss for most ppl. For us, its a 'HIT'. Its like consuming melted fat. You pick it in between the bone and the flavour is really there. Two bones to enjoy the slitter meat fat in between.

Mains we got the Ontario Lamb Shank and ltsumo Tuna.

Ontario lamb shank 
ancho braised / northern bean tomato ragout / lamb sausage / garlic chips
- This was a good size drum stick meat. It was very tender and a bit fatty at the same time. My gf enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it.
- Didn't like the bean tomato ragout.

Itsumo Tuna purple potatoes / edamame / kumato tomatoes / Sriracha emulsion / soy glaze
- Cooked right at medium rare tuna. Really enjoyable but only two rectangular pieces. 
- Noticed the purple potatoes and the kumato tomatoes.
- Didn't really taste the sriracha, but did taste the soy glaze.
- edamame beans were a few.

Desserts we got the churros and dark warm chocolate cake.

chocolate dark warm chocolate cake / vanilla ice cream / lime marshmallow white chocolate pistachio lollipop / raspberry sauce 
- hockey puck size of gooey chocolate flowing out as you cut it in the middle. Goes well with vanilla ice cream. Didn't really like the lollipop marshmallow.

churros Spanish donuts finished in cinnamon and sugar /chocolate chili / cajeta 
- Its alright. Not that impressive.

I also got a mixed non-alcoholic beverage that had grapefruit, orange juice, pineapple and ginger beer. It was quite tasty.

Overall this place gets a solid 4/5. Service was attentive and good. Food was good. Atmosphere was good. Just a little too dark for me. Only has one stall in the bathroom for men in the cafe area which is kind of sad. =(

After the groupon discount with tax and tip, I still shelled out an additional $35 for the dining experience."}
{"text":"Had their burger. Best burger I have had in a while. Had nice seasoning mixed into the patty that really made the flavours comes out. French fries were delicious. Service was good as well. Will definitely be coming back here again to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, but this place is relatively pricey.  We ordered the Tenderloin and Lamb.  The lamb was good, however, the tenderloin was a bit overcooked.  We ordered medium-rare, but it came as medium.  

They were happy to make another one for us, which was a plus."}
{"text":"Excelente localização, comida deliciosa, atendimento muito bom, decoração descontraída e ainda por cima, nos finais de semana tem um pianista INCRÍVEL!! Soubemos que um dos chefs é brasileiro; vai ver que todo o charme vem daí, hehe!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with clients.  I would go back.  Food was nothing stellar but solid nonetheless and service was timely.  Had the black bean soup which was a bit chunky (not sure if it was supposed to be like that); that said, it was flavourful.  Main was organic salmon - it was a bit overcooked.  I think it was frozen --- tasted like the Loblaws President's Choice organic salmon.  Ambience is nice and airy.  I could see why it draws the Yorkville (ohhh...look @ me) crowd --- I was expecting Posh Spice to enter with Beck.  +ives: solid food, comfort -ives: price"}
{"text":"Very disappointing food. Mediocre and flavourless. Kind of what you would expect at an upscale seniors' home. The bathrooms were filthy and this was at 6 o'clock in the evening-hardly at the end of the night. There were suspicious smears of something in the bathroom cubicles and overflowing garbage containers. It feels like there is lack of attention to the place as a whole, and that it is riding on its past reputation as a place to see movie stars. The saving grace was the service which was good. Save your money-there are so many other fantastic places to eat in the city."}
{"text":"We made a pitstop to Sassafraz for lattes and a sweet fix while walking through Yorkville/Bloor.  I am glad we did.  The lattes were good, even surpassing the expectations of my cousin who is a coffee connisseuer.  The tiramisu with espresso was one of the best I have ever had.  My brother really enjoyed the caffeine fix cocktail drink.  I look forward to coming back here to sample cocktails and food."}
{"text":"After an extraordinary dining experience one year earlier, five girlfriends and I returned to Sassafraz for their Winterlicious 2015 feature. We all agreed that we didn't want to go anywhere new, since we were so impressed with our experience last year. 

Unfortunately, our evening did not fully live up to our expectations. I have to say the food was great, except last year's lamb shank was much bigger and juicier than this year's (yes I had the same main, and the same dessert). It was the service that was lacking - our food took way too long to come out. And when it did, everyone ended up with each others dishes. Our server was not attentive nor helpful about the menu. This is in stark contrast to our server last year (Mike) who truly set the bar, and provided us with an unforgettable evening. 

In total, we were there for over 2 hours. We didn't mind, as we were in great company. I realize much of the restaurant industry is worn down after the craze of winterlicous, given we came near the end of the 2 week event. However, at an establishment such as Sassafraz, I expected better.

This will definitely not stop me from returning. The food and ambiance is amazing, and most of the staff are very gracious and attentive. We even flagged down Mike and he took a few minutes to chat with us. Next time, I'll be sure to request a table in Mike's section!"}
{"text":"Food was fine but a little bit overpriced.Pretty like the bread."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Toronto's Yorkville district, walking distance to upscale shopping and the Royal Ontario Museum. Went for dinner with a Groupon, fantastic value, food was outstanding, bistro crossed with gourmet comfort food, wine pairing was excellent. Our waiter John was outstanding!  Not overly noisy despite being a Friday night at 8:00pm.  Would recommend it if you need an upscale business casual dinner in very comfortable setting with unbeatable food!  Top Marks!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Sassafraz is that it's close to the office. I can't think of other reasons why I keep coming back. The food is OK but not great. The decor is impressive but borderline ostentatious. 

And since I seem to have spontaneously lost the ability to write in paragraphs - or form proper sentences for that matter, here is the rest of the review in point form:

1. I find Sea scallops to be a great litmus test. The first time I tried them here, they were overcooked and chewy. The second time I ordered them, they tasted like balls of butter - the seasoning completely overpowered any of the delicate taste of fresh sea scallops.

2. On one particular visit, I couldn't help but ask myself: what is up with all the parsley garnish. Really. Where is all this parsley coming from? Why is it on all the dishes? I think this was an isolated incident, an experiment gone terribly, terribly wrong, as it hasn't happened on other visits.

3. Molecular foam. Am I the only one that's ready for this fad to blow over?

4. For better or worse, you're gonna get the Yorkville crowd in here. 

5. The bad ass mojito has a nice kick.

Reservations: Day of. Short, if any, wait for walk-ins.

The Damage: ~$60pp, pre-tax,tip,drinks.

Extra tid-bit: the dining room has a stunning 2-storey waterfall as the  backdrop"}
{"text":"My fav place in Toronto~~~

We go to Sass once to twice a week during summer, they have the best PATIO and the lounge! 

Let's talk about their FOOD ( Not Summerlious/Winterlious crap!) it's simply great!! Can't go wrong with anything from salad to steak. 

One thing I found out......They are big on supporting local farmers, use local products most of times and they also use Bullfrog Power (Green electricity) 
Locals supporting locals!! Why not!!

I had my baby shower, birthday dinners etc....

But what makes me to go back to Sass!?? THE STAFF!!! (I hope they get pay well, they changed a number of General managers and ... hmmmm..., hey Sass owners, I'm sure you already know but just a friendly reminder that you have to pay well to retain good people)

P.s.

I wish I had my wedding reception there, too late, one marriage is enough for me lol, (persuading my soon to be married friends to have theirs at Sass)"}
{"text":"They have a great patio for dining in the summer.   It can be considered a place to see or be seen!  

I came here for lunch and I ate the sablefish.  I also had a B52 coffee.  Both were made to perfection!  I was impressed with the service and the accomodation of the staff.

Please be aware that the portion sizes are small to moderate.  If you are really hungry, have a snack before you come here."}
{"text":"I love coming to eat here. The food is amazing and the staff are so friendly. The last time I was in Maura was our server. She was so knowledgeable, but more importantly really sweet! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined there for the first time (we've been before for drinks) on Saturday and had a lovely experience.  We had a great little booth in the bar area, which we had requested in order hear their pianist (John Roby) who is awesome and comes on Fridays and Saturdays.  We were not rushed at all and ended up there for almost four hours.  My husband had the duck which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I had the Sirloin, which came out kind of blackened and not how I asked for it.  Someone other than our waitress brought it and when she came around - she was very quick to notice the steak problem - I didn't have to point it out.  She encouraged me to send it back (I hate to be that table) and quickly brought out another that was perfect.  Furthermore, she saw to it that all our apps were comped off the bill.  Very proactive, great customer service and I would go back as a result."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. Food, drink and atmosphere are fabulous. There is a great bartender, Hannah, who makes awesome drinks though I have not seen her behind the bar lately; hope she returns soon. And Alex, one of the servers, is fantastic, really knows the menu and always gives me great direction in terms of what to order.

All the specialty cocktails are delicious and my fave appetizers on the menu are the unbelievably delicious beet salad and the poached lobster -- sublime. For main courses, you cannot go wrong with any of the steaks or the wildly fantastic braised lamb risotto.

LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Sassafraz is one of those overrated restaurants in Toronto which has been hyped up due to the number of well known personalties dinning there in the past. My order took the better part of 45 mins to arrive. Champagne was overpriced as expected and less than 1/5th of the glass was filled for around $30.00. Service was atrocious.  If you want a quality meal or to impress someone better to take your money elsewhere.  That being said they will continue to do well regardless of the food or service because of the \"Hype\" surrounding the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had 5 person dinner last night
The girls loved the decor, it feels very comfortable & friendly surroundings.
Lot of details on the walls & the waterfall.
Not too many salad choices & they were out of the large steak, so ended up with lamb chops, which were cooked well, but smaller portion.
Service was good & accommodating.
Will repeat"}
{"text":"I went here last summer with my mom she was visiting Toronto from Italy, we set outside and enjoyed the Saturday crowd passing by and showing off cars and dresses on a nice summery early afternoon.

We enjoyed our visit, the food was good and not expensive has I thought it would be.

Definitely a must try in Yorkville."}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicious and I was amazed by the service and food.  The staff are friendly.  The atmosphere depending on where you're seated can set your mood.  The food it was classy in presentation, and a little above average.  Their cheese dessert were the best!  The price - a little too much.  I would go back if I have extrac funds to spend."}
{"text":"Over priced and poorly designed dishes. I had the lentils with pastry. The lentils were overly salted and dry while the pastry was burnt. My wife had the black cod. It was poorly seasoned and served in an odd broth that did not go with the cod. Will not return."}
{"text":"I have been told by my fiancee that I should try to be more funny in my reviews. So here is a joke to start off. 

What did the mother ghost tell the baby ghost when he ate too fast?

Stop goblin your food.

Now that that is over with, on with the review. 

So, Sassafraz restaurant, I really enjoyed my experience. We stopped in for a glass of wine and some food after work on a Friday night. We ate in the cafe section rather than the dinning room. The cafe is very comfortable and is a really nice place to have a casual meal or drinks, especially if you are fortunate enough to score one of the two or three tables with couches rather than chairs. 

I was very pleased with the food. I had the salmon special that came with a succotash. I can't  think of much more to say about it than it was really good. Yes, it was simple, but the quality of the ingredients was evident because of the simplicity. 

I don't know that I would ever go and eat in the dinning room because I can see how it would be a bit too 'starched' for my liking. But I am definitely going to go back to the cafe. We had a very lovely experience."}
{"text":"we live right across the street and this is one of our favorite neighborhood hangouts - whether for weekend brunches, mojitos (best in town) on the patio, late night food, or just a glass of wine at the bar.  Cool ambience, great food, decent prices, great services - they always make us feel at home."}
{"text":"Part 2
I realize that this restaurant is located in an upscale neighborhood and normally caters to those who have the means to afford to eat there. I have eaten here once before and that time was no better. Summerlicious is a great way for those who may not have otherwise been able to afford to eat at some of these high end restaurants to experience fine dining at a great price. If these high end restaurants are choosing to participate in this event which will attract a different customer base of middle class patrons, then maybe they should inform/prepare their staff to be more accommodating to all types of people, just not ones that carry Chanel handbags and know the staff by name. The service we received today was unacceptable and degrading.  I too am in the customer service field and would never treat anyone the way our waiter did to us.
How are people suppose to buy into the whole fine dining experience (even if it is at a pre-fix price) if they are in turn going to be made to feel like second class citizens? I didn't think that dining at Sassafraz at a discounted price would mean that my friend and I would have to leave feeling discriminated and looked down upon.  We could have had lunch at McDonald's and have gotten better service. I WOULD NOT RECOMMENED DINING HERE! The food was good but it was overshadowed by the nose up attitude and horrible customer service. Take your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Went there for a 3 course prix-fixe menu, got the Ontario beet salad to start, the dressing was light and fresh - just perfect; the crusted chèvre croquettes complements the salad really well.  My friend got the ancho braised lamb, though she said was good, said wish she'd ordered the Cornish hen.  I ordered the Cornish hen, and it was the star of the show!  Stuffed with squash in the middle, sitting on a bed of polenta, the flavor, the sauce and all the ingredients just works really well together.  We both got the chocolate cake, similar to a lava chocolate cake, it ended our evening on a high note!
Definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I attended a dinner here for Summerlicious 2011. I was VERY excited for my first experience at one of Toronto's most celebrated establishments, but I left feeling extremely disheartened and disappointed. Why, you ask?

ATMOSPHERE: Spacious and tastefully decorated, though we had to request the AC be turned down repeatedly

MEAL: Very small portions but tasty and well-presented
(EG: \"Bouquet Salad with Baby Red Romaine, Roasted Tomato, Bacon Crostini and Roasted Garlic Dressing\" translates to \"one tomato, a piece of melba toast and a sprig of lettuce for colour\".)

PRICING: Both food and beverage pricing is astronomical considering the portion size (IE: Expect to pay for one glass of wine what you would for a bottle at the LCBO). An 18% gratuity was also automatically included for our group, which left the service subsequently slipping.

SERVICE: The service from both the wait staff AND managers was absolutely appalling.
- No accommodations were made for allergies within the group.
- Our group made up for 75% of the upper floor. When we requested that the air conditioning be turned off as we were all quite cold (we felt, at $100 a head, we deserved to be comfortable), the wait staff gave us a ridiculous story that their heat was controlled by Toronto Hydro and they had no control over the temperature of their own establishment. The manager later corrected this fabrication and eventually turned the AC off after 7 or 8 requests from guests.
- Despite the fact that I was assured we would be able to pay separately upon making the reservation, we were required to the balance of the ENTIRE $1200 bill on one credit card, which was quite an inconvenience as not everyone in our party knew one another.
- Finally, when I explained that I would not have reserved at Sassafraz had I not been assured that we could all pay separately, it was suggested that AS SUMMERLICIOUS CUSTOMERS, WE DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT THEIR REGULAR CUSTOMERS DID! I absolutely could not believe it and urge Summerlicious hopefuls to avoid this restaurant at all costs.

IN SUMMATION:
1) There are many fine restaurants in Toronto that offer much higher quality creations at far more reasonable prices.
2) Sassafraz is not appreciative of the business that Summerlicious brings and is prepared to let their Summerlicious customers know it.
3) The appalling treatment by the managerial/wait staff of who they clearly feel are \"third class customers\" left me feeling as though the place ought to be reduced to tinders... but apparently someone has already tried it: http://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2006/12/sassafraz_on_fire_no_celebs_injured/"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fancy place to celebrate your birthday, anniversary or just want to have a luxury night this is the place to go. Yes it is over-priced but which fancy restaurant isnt? I think for the service and the food its worthy.

All the servers are professionally trained, they know what they are doing. I went there for my sister's birthday and i brought a cake there, the servers know exactly what to do without me instructing them. Also, one time i went there and i lost my voice they offered brought me honey water without me asking for it. 

  I have been to this place several time for different occasions. The menu changes from season to season, the sides for the food is different but it all taste good. The first time i went it was great and the next time i went there i was surprised  that i could find it better than last time,because you usually dont get amazed by a restaurant twice. It is a beautiful and elegant in there. I have tried their beef, chicken, shrimp risotto and foi gras. It was all good. 

The only thing negative about this restaurant is that the lunch at this place is not as good as it should be. also i think the regular food taste better than the summerlicious or winterlicious :)"}
{"text":"I have never eaten a bad meal at Sassafraz and I've been going here since high school. Their salads are delicious. I love their burgers. The fries that they come with are amazing. The eggs Benedict I had at brunch was superb. The white sangria I had that day was quite possibly the best drink I have ever had. I have attempted to imitate the recipe and come very very close. I went for winterlicious this year and had potato and celeriac soup that was creamy without being heavy and flavourful, the most terrific mushroom tortellini I have had in Toronto and a lemon tart (okay, I've had better elsewhere but it was pretty good). I always have great service. No complaints at all. They can nearly always seat you if you're early for your reservation or apologize profusely if they can't. If you are wandering in for a late lunch on a cold afternoon even on the weekends then there is a good chance you wont need a reservation. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"The food and service are impeccable, so I like coming here for special occasions or during special promotions when the prices are a bit more affordable. Love the ambiance of the restaurant as well and the sunny yellow exterior."}
{"text":"Perfect ambiance, amazing food, and very friendly service! We used a Groupon but were not treated any differently. I came to Sassafraz about 4 years ago for lunch and did not think it was anything special, but my recent experience has impressed me. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious and was so stuffed by the end of my meal! I had the duck pate, duck breast, and the banana tart with coconut mousse (the duck breast was definitely my favourite). To my surprise, the portions were larger than I expected. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night and the service was impeccable. 

Price seems on par with the rest of Yorkville. I would definitely return for their regular menu when I'm in the mood to splurge."}
{"text":"We got this Groupon for a set 3 course meal so we gave it a try. There were other tables around us enjoying the same deal so we were not the only ones. They had quite a selection of dishes between the appetizer, main and desserts - similar to Winterlicious but extended version. For appetizer, I picked the chowder - bay scallop / conch / celeriac / vintage cheddar crouton / Sriracha oil. I was expecting a creamy soup like the clam chowder but it was not, not as creamy, not that many pieces of seafood and not that much flavour. I like the cheddar crouton, it was very cheesy. I think I should have gone with the mushroom and marrow instead.

For the main, I had the Cornish hen stuffed with winter squash - topped with polenta / vintage cheddar / wild mushrooms / golden pearl onions / sauce Périgueux. This was amazingly delicious. The chicken was tender and moist with the squash stuffing and the skin was full of different spices that makes it more tasty. And the polenta was a good side - mellow taste + the crispy chicken. I licked the plate clean!

I was pretty full by then but there is always room for dessert! I got the churros - Spanish donuts finished in cinnamon and sugar /chocolate chili / cajeta. It was good because it wasn't too heavy. I like the cajeta sauce which is a sweeten caramelized milk. I prefer that over the chocolate sauce. Overall, it was a pretty good meal and good price. Hope they will have this deal again later."}
{"text":"We were here is January with our daughter before she moved to BC. The wide variety of food to choose from was delish! Our waiter Michael was superb and having been there once before, I was so pleased that he was taking care of us. From beginning to end, a lovely experience at Sassafraz. Thank you Michael for making everyone always feel welcome and special."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for winterlicious.  I arrived a little early for our reservation, but the hostess guided me on our table right away.  Our table is beside the window overlooking the Cumberland street.  The ambience is nice and I didn't realize that this place is huge til just pass 7pm that people are constantly coming.  I heard they do weddings in this restaurant, and for me its a very nice place cor intimate wedding. 

The service is pretty decent. Except that we waited for our main course for a while. I ordered basil lemonade that came in small glass with a lot of ice.  I should've asked for light ice.  For Winterlicious menu, I ordered pork belly for appetizer, steak for main course, and decadent chocolate for dessert. The pork belly is too salty for my taste that I ended up drinking all my drinks so fast and I alreafy got full cause of the drink. I ordered medium rare for my steak and after waiting for quite a while, I ended up getting medium well.  As I don't typically like to complain to the server about my food, I just ate it regardless.  For dessert, the decadent chocolate is so rich. If you're a sweet addict, you'd lo e it. 

Overall, the service is average. The ambience is nice. The food I should say did not really meet my expectations. I guess that maybe because we ordered from their prix fixe menu, that the standard of food is just average.  I don't think that I will come back here again except if I get invited to come again and if I have no choice."}
{"text":"Everything was quite average. We were there for Winterlicious 2014 and expected a lot since this restaurant is well known and in the heart of Yorkville. 
The staff seemed novice; like they all had part-time jobs. This was clearly not a place where professional waitstaff were employed. 

Our waitress was friendly but her knowledge of the menu was lacking. I was served an appetizer with an ingredient I did not like (which she knew) and both her and the manager were unaware the ingredient existed in it. I even specifically asked both of them.  I unfortunately had to send it back. 

Our appetizers were almost thrown at us by the wait staff. I had to move my food back to where it originally sat on the plate. 

Our desserts took forever to come and we were not asked about tea or coffee. 

It was a lackluster night with very average service and food. I would not recommend Sassafraz."}
{"text":"While staying at Harbour Castle, and heading up to Union Station, walking around dozens of underground shops, then heading North by subway to Yorkville (I always have to enter this area of unique little streets & shops to my list), I was getting tired.  (and thirsty)

It was time to find a chic place, sit in comfort, and treat myself to a nice glass o vino.  [ check marks all around - this is the place!]

From the moment I stepped into the entrance, I was warmly greeted by the hostess, addressed by the maître d, and was given great service by my own personal bar tender (I was mid-afternoon, so I had him to myself for a bit).  It was exactly what I needed and wanted.  A perfect little mini-vacation, within a vacation.

Loved the way it was designed and furnished.  Cute sofas at some tables.  A very special & posh place to visit."}
{"text":"I was there for Summerlicious with a couple friends. We went for lunch on a Sunday, it was not very busy. Services were attentive, and food was delicious and enough portion for lunch. 

Summerlicious is always a hit or miss, and Sassafraz is definitely a hit."}
{"text":"Two of us went there with their groupon for a 3 course meal for 2 for $70. My lobster bites appetizer was tasteless and my companion's lamp meatballs were nothing to brag about. For the main course I had the duck which was very well made but the veggies and the puree were quit tasteless. My companion's steak was made well too. The dessert however was quit cold (both the creme brule and the flourless chocolate cake) as in just came out of the fridge! 

Here are the real problems though: We didn't (and from the convos from other tables around no one else knew either) that they would charge the food tax on top of the Groupon we had already paid! Also, the service was nothing to brag about. Our server forgot to punch our order or something he came back 45 minutes later after seing everyone who had come way after was even finish their first course and pretended to confirm our order but it was obvious he had completely forgotten about us. He then bolted to punch in the order, we could see him from where we were sitting. No apologies no nothing!

Ambiance was great though. Not your usual too close together and not too noise. It was perfect."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came to Sassafraz for our 10 year dating anniversary and couldn't have been happier with the experience. 

The location is fantastic and the atmosphere is so welcoming and effortlessly alluring, with the water running down the back wall, big ceiling windows and plants. It made a bitter cold and grey day, seem so much warmer and bright, once inside.

I went with a early reservation as we had tickets to Second City that night and we didn't want to rush dinner. I was quite literally the first person in the dining room for dinner and the staff was great. They came over to talk to me without hovering and made sure I had a glass of wine while I waited. 

Dinner was amazing! We had the Brown Sugar Pork Belly to start which were great, nothing too crazy, but a decent pick. My fiancé had the Ontario Crab & Corn Chowder, which he said was one of the best soups he had ever had and still talks about it, weeks later. We both had wine to start and then moved to cocktails - I had the French 75, one of my favorite cocktails and he had the Southern Gentleman, both were wonderfully made. For dinner, I had the beef tenderloin and he had the veal chop. My meal was out of this world good. I literally ate every last drop of food on my plate, it was to die for. I got it cooked Med Rare and it was literal perfection on a plate. My fiancés food was delicious as well and he absolutely loved it. He did try mine and he said mine was better than his, since mine was out of this world and his was just really good (like that's a bad thing- its not). We actually enjoyed our steaks so much, we told all of our steak loving friends and family this was worthy of a visit.

We ended the meal with a flourless chocolate cake with chocolate house made ice cream. Neither of us care for dessert and we finished it all, it was that good. 

So what I'm saying here is, make yourself a reservation at Sassafraz and go enjoy some really good food, atmosphere and service. I highly recommend taking your time there and trying something from every course since they have so many great offerings. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went during a corporate event. 

Food could have been better but then again they had to cook for the masses. Not memorable."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely Summerlicious experience tonight with my boyfriend and parents. Our server was wonderful, and the atmosphere was relaxed, yet sophisticated. I had the buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad to start, which was delightfully fresh and came with fried green tomatoes (yum!). For my entree I chose the French lentils, which were served with puff pastry, asparagus, artichokes and kale. The dish was surprisingly filling and had good flavour. To cap off a wonderful evening, we all enjoyed the rich and creamy strawberry rhubarb cheesecake. 'Twas a great summer night!"}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for a 3 course meal for 2. Overall, good food, drinks and service. Good value for getting the Groupon compared to regular price."}
{"text":"Three words: \"Chili Rubbed Bison.\" Wow. I still dream of it, and smile.

Sassafraz has considerably stepped up their kitchen practises since the 2006 fire that saw the Yorkville mainstay destroyed. Everything food-wise -appetizers, mains, desserts -is top-notch, though their service, when busy, can be scattershot and distracted. 

I've had many delicious meals there, including pastas, salads, meats, fish, foie gras and yes, one chili-rubbed bison, and have been most impressed with the range and skill of the Sassafraz kitchen. 

Aside from dinner, the locale is also a wonderful late-night stop, where two can enjoy their lovely cheese plate and a half-bottle of good wine for a decent price; it beats paying a lot more at trendier, louder spots, for a lot less. Sassafraz is a nice choice for those of us who prefer the people-parade of a warm summer evening, with good wine and food, over the noisy, sub-par environs of a trendy club. It's especially nice if you can get a spot on their street-side patio, particularly the one that faces out onto Cumberland Avenue + park. 

Solid, reliable, and a lovely atmosphere. And the bison kicks butt. Dear Sassafraz, I'll always find a place on your patio in the summer; you'll always have a place in my heart any season."}
{"text":"Dined yesterday evening at Sassafraz, made the reservation the day of for 3ppl at 8pm on a Saturday and got in no problem. When we arrived the place was nearly empty which surprised me for a Saturday night. Some hits, some misses, but overall a very enjoyable meal! The cocktails we had were exquisite so I may just drop by for a drink in the bar in the near future!

Decor:
Sassafraz has some of the most beautiful decor I have ever seen inside a restaurant. The white and cream colours are exquisite and I love the little pop of colour with the fresh orange flowers on the tables. The waterfall at the back of the restaurant was very nice as well, even the bathrooms were luxurious! All the cutlery and glassware were beautifully polished, a lot of attention has obviously been put into the details. 

Service:
The gentleman who served us had some hits and misses. He was always available, refilling our waters, taking our orders and checking to see how the food tasted which I really like. He did seem to lack some menu knowledge though, when we asked for recommendations he pointed out almost every dish on the menu and described them as they were written on the menu, practically verbatim, so this wasn't very helpful. One suggestion I would have to Sassafraz is have the service staff who bring us our dishes describe each component on the plate.

Food:
I had the scallops to start and they were amazing! Perfectly cooked with light chanterelle foam and a very generous portion. My guests had the tomato/avocado/goat cheese salad which was very good and the terrine which was made with some game. Appetizers were spot on, very delicious! For my main I had the arctic char and this would be where Sassafraz lost a star. The plate looked very bland, almost all the components were exactly the same colour (very light creamy pink) so the plate did not look very appetizing. Although the char and the sides were delicious and cooked nicely it was way way way too salty, my guests were startled when they had a bite just how salty it was. It made an otherwise very nice dish significantly less nice. For dessert I had the chocolate banana cake with pineapple carpaccio, very rich and sweet but really yummy, maybe one of those desserts that is best shared. The dining experience was finished with petit fours with delicious custom chocolates, a very nice touch from the restaurant.

All in all, I would definately go back and look forward to dining there again, I may just ask for less salt on my main dish!"}
{"text":"Came during summerlicious. Guess u get what u pay for. Food was average. Poached quail egg on my beef tartare was too well done - no runny yolk, making the dish quite dry. Seasoning was also lacking. 
I also had the pork t-bone and piña colada panna cotta. Main was ok, good quality meat but it was over-cooked and dish also needed more sauce. Love the corn on the side though. Panna cotta was bland I didn't even finish.
Ambience was nice (I sat near water feature at the back of dining area). Service was average. Staff all looked too stressed! 
Not recommended for summerlicious."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Sassafraz restaurant on Saturday afternoon, April 19, 2014.  Boy oh boy, worst restaurant experience we ever had.  From the moment we sat down in this place, I felt very uncomfortable.  We choose to sit outside to  in soak  in the afternoon sun and the atmosphere on Cumberland.  Our waitress did not show us any enthusiasm when we arrived and placed us right on the entrance on the wall, even when the outdoor seating area was empty with only two other tables having guests.  We asked to be moved to a bit more open space and were placed to the end of the patio which was not even closed up so anyone walking by could have just grabbed our bags from the floor. We ordered our two drinks and two steak tartare. Again, no extra effort from the waitress or a smile.  When our order arrived, I spooned up my steak tartare only to notice it is all a big tangle of fat, muscle tissue and tendon.  You could not separate it.  Since we are eating raw beef here, the beef must be the freshest and best cut available. I called the waitress and returned my portion.  Just the feel of this place made me say, I do not want another portion. However, after a few minutes the manager came, apologized and acknowledged that thus mess on my plate was unecepible and offered us something for free in return.  Since my daughter had just driven 7 hours from out of town to come and see me and this was to be the mother/ daughter time and did not want to have a totally wasted Saturday, we accepted.  We were given a grilled, pulled pork sandwich.  The taste was not too bad but it was dripping with oil and gooey cheese coming out on all sides.  That might have been appropriate for some teenagers or a fast food place but not in a highly recommended restaurant.  That was way too messy for this place.  And we never received any napkins with either one of our orders.  Since I had taken a bite out of my half of the sandwich, my hands were dripping with oil and cheese.  I could not take a sip from my drink to wash down the taste since I was covered in oil.  Finally I got the attention of a server and showed him my hands and asked If please can get a napkin or something to get rid of the oil. 
We asked to pay, all we wanted was to get out of there.  And sure enough the waitress told us we need to come inside to pay since outside the machine does not work.  I will not mention the amount on the bill since we expected to pay quite a bit.  But from the quality of the food and service, we way overpaid.  This was not even worth the one star I gave the restaurant.  I had never ever experienced such bad service and food before."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for my wife's birthday.  When you first walk into this place, you will notice that it's definitely a very classy place with a bar.  It's very cozy and features a very quiet atmosphere.  This place would make a great romantic date night out and you do see a lot of couples.  Located in Yorkville, a super high end area located in downtown Toronto near Bloor subway station.

I had the lobster bites for appetizer, it was really good and they're real lobster meat. However there is a little room for improvement if they would make it a tad more tender.

I then had the strip loin steak, at a very good portion of 10oz, cooked  well to what I asked for.  The steak sits on top of seasonal  mushroom, cream kale and horseradish butter which was the best side I've ever had for a steak.  You definitely don't get that kind of sides at The Keg.

I always complain about portions when it comes to these nicer places, but this place gives you great portions,  extremely filling for a guy like me that eats more.

If you are a visitor to Toronto, definitely explore this high end rich area.  Get off at Bloor station and you can easily spend whole half day exploring this areas.

Parking is greatly available within minutes of this place.  Lots of public indoor parking garages near by."}
{"text":"I went with a friend on Saturday for Winterlicious and we were seated in the cafe, which was super cute and cozy.  Our reservation was for 6pm because we had plans that night but we ended up leaving at 840! We were having such a good time and didn't feel pressured to leave at all.  The food was really great, I had the marrow and mushrooms for my app and it was good, the trout I had for the entrée was to die for though and I couldn't get enough of it.  The chocolate cake dessert was a bit of a letdown but overall the atmosphere, the drinks, the piano player and great service really made for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Had a private dinner party here a few weeks ago in the room upstairs. 

The wait staff was amazing and very friendly. The food was also very good. 

The ambiance for the upstairs private room was perfect for our event."}
{"text":"I had a lovely time at Sassafraz last night. My fiance and I went for winterlicious and were very impressed by the service, ambiance, and food. Ate every drop. We couldn't get enough of the bread. We might have had three loaves. 

I had the Lamb Meatballs, Lamb Shank and Banana Tart. My fiance had the green tomatoes with mozzarella and balsamic vinegar, the bison short rib pappardelle, and flourless chocolate cake.   

Everything was great. However, the chocolate cake was too rich for my fiance so we switched desserts. The one bit of the banana tart did taste lovely though."}
{"text":"Background--came here visiting from Boston with my girlfriend during Summerlicious, for dinner on a Saturday night.  We sat outside and I expected good things. 

FOOD
Overall, food is good, but amongst the upper-third of restaurants you would eat at in Toronto (i.e nicer meals or Saturday-night date meals), this doesn't immediately stand out in a unique way.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good and I personally think that the lack of quantity is not a big deal, just as long as the food is good.  Still, the menu could be a bit more interesting than it was--I didn't feel like I had a lot of options for the entree, but then again we were working off the summerlicious menu so go figure.

WIth that being said, The positive here is that just about everything we tried was at least interesting to eat, with tasty cornish hen, an interesting scallops-nuts dish for an appetizer, etc.  The sangria was ordered since we were outside and didn't want to fall to a sleep-induced state from red wine, and for $45 let me tell you that the amount and taste of the sangria doesn't justify the high price.  Just stick with old-fashioned's or red vino and you'll be in a better place.
The negative for the food is what I alluded to above--a good menu with good ingredients, but I expect a menu to excite me, not dampen my enthusiasm.

ATMOSPHERE/VIBE
The atmosphere here is great.  The outdoors environment is just as good as the indoors environment, and both are interesting in their own right.  The patrons all seemed to be outgoing enough, and it was nice to be there.
They also had these two singers who were incredible and made it fun to be there--amazing music and great vibes from those guys.  They were interactive and, quite frankly, made the night fun.

SERVICE
I think the service was extremely poor.  While this is a restaurant in Yorkville where cars averaging $80,000 in MSRP pass buy throughout the meal, I think that any nice restaurant needs to treat its patrons with respect.
WIth that being said, as I walked into the seating area outside, there was a dogbowl hidden from view that was directly underneath our table.  My dining partner also didn't see it until we sat down and her foot splashed into the bowl.  It was just filled with water, but it was still disgusting.  I then went to the waiting staff and asked for some water and explained the incident.  
Normally, a classy restaurant would use this as an opportunity to shine here.  Unfortunately, Sassafraz failed to show any interest.  The waitress told us that the dog bowl was \"probably left here by the previous patron\" and brought a few napkins, and that's it.  
I wasn't expecting much more than an apology, but the restaurant staff failed to show any regret for that incident, which is a shame because it's a Saturday night date and, given that they have partially ruined the night from the get-go, I would expect some assurance that this was an accident and they feel bad about it, as such a small gesture would have made us feel better.

FINAL VERDICT
--Food isn't so great that you need to go here--wouldn't go out of your way to come here, though if you do come here it won't be a bad meal.
--Vibe--cool, unique, and interesting.
--Service--could have potentially ruined our night but luckily my girlfriend and I are easy-going.  Still, I would not risk coming here on a date where you want to impress or truly lay back and enjoy yourself.  Given the incident I went through, I would recommend steering clear on any nights that may matter to you, just to hedge yourself against the risk of any similar incidents ruining your night. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Monica had the chance to visit Sassafraz, a well-known restaurant in the Yorkville neighbourhood for lunch last weekend with some friends.

House Cured Salmon Tartar -The pomegranate ginger mousse was supple and the baby greens on the side had a citrus taste, which was really good. It went with the salmon tartar very well. 

Honey & Chilli Glazed Prawns with saffron risotto - was just delicious!  The saffron risotto looks really bland as it's just very yellow in the picture but it doesn't do the taste justice.  The prawns were juicy as well.

Braised P.E.I beef short ribs on pommes puree (potatoes) - The meat was tender and of good portion - not too big and not too small.  The Bordelaise sauce was yummy!

Gothan city cheese, served with flatbread and assorted dried fruits - I wish I knew what the jam-like sauce was because it complemented the cheese SO well.  It was definitely my favourite part of the whole meal.

warm apple compote with oat crumble, maple walnut and caramel cream - The cararmel cream melted in your mouth - just amazing!

Overall, I had a great dining experience at Sassafraz.  Their service was great, environment, gorgeous and the food, delicious.  I'm glad I got to try for Winterlicious and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Their food is not as good as before, but i still like the ambience of the restaurant. I take my friends from other cities when they come visit me."}
{"text":"nice ambient, liked the waterfall/green space at the back, makes it a nice place to have brunch in the winter. 

Food is so so, the winterlicious/summerlicious menu are good value, but i would probably not go for regular priced menu."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my friend. The atmosphere is really nice, and the food is heavenly. Our waitress was extremely pleasant, and took care of all the details. Do make a reservation, as this restaurant is very popular in Yorkville. All in all a very good experience, and I can't wait to come back to the yellow house in the corner!"}
{"text":"I love love this place! Everything on the menu is fresh and tastes so great! Even just their frites, their so delicious and to die for! Their patio is cute too, it's nice to just have your lunch/dinner or just afternoon drinks with your friends. And right now, their glasses of wine are half price with any appetizer or main course. The prices  there are reasonable as well especially with the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This is and has always been our go-to place when visiting Toronto.  Food is great, service is always topnotch and the location is perfect.  In the summer you can enjoy the patio and in the winter it's a cozy place to watch the world go by. Also love that fact that they allow you to dine on the patio with your puppy!"}
{"text":"It's always great to come to Sassafraz. We have been here for lunch several times. The food and service are always great.  We love the very informal lunch setting, especially with our toddler.  The one thing I would like to see is a change in the menu every now and then."}
{"text":"Georgeous interior. Good customer service - they were slow when bringing our meals but they offered us free desert and coffee to make it up."}
{"text":"Was there last night for a special occasion. Again the food I had as an appetizer was delicious but when it came to my
Duck breast entree I wasn't impressed with the side of Brussels sprouts, they were plain, and beans were okay. Usually Sassafraz can take a simple ingredient and make it extraordinary. I just found my dish to lack what makes Sassafraz so special. My
friend's dish was the venison, and that was great. No complaints there."}
{"text":"This may have been a hot spot in it's day, but the tired decor needs freshened up.
We sat in the non-smoking section of the patio only to have the table behind us smoke.  When I complained to the waitress, she asked if I wanted her to say something to them.  Well, um, yeah!  Why do you think I sat where smoking isn't allowed and why would you even ask the customer that just complained to you?

Service seemed aloof and confused.  Food was just OK.  Slightly stunned to have 4 cocktails, a sandwich, some fish and 2 cheeses come to $170.00

Too many better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great service and TINY portions !!

Their food was overpriced and their drink menu was nothing fancy. Just the usual. For such a large bill, we barely got any food. Which we came in for a celebration and still left the restaurant pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I was a little afraid to visit Sassafraz on a Friday night, but we had no problem getting a table, and I wasn't asked to leave when I showed up in my casual attire (I hadn't planned on going to Yorkville).

My Cosmopolitan was delicious and strong.  The drinks menu had quite a few fun, creative options.  We were starving so we shared a few appetizers (tuna and foie gras) and though the portions were small, both dishes were delicious.  

The bar was quiet enough for conversation and the service was great.  The décor is beautiful, even in the washrooms.

Sassafraz is a little pricey for my wallet, but nice if you want to treat yourself."}
{"text":"The first time I've heard about this restaurant was from my ex-girlfriend Heide, in grade ten.
She was from the upper echelon of the Forest Hill community, and I was an emerging name in the...Pacific Mall/Metro Square consensus........
I've never gotten to experience the restaurant prior to the electrical fire which forced the restaurant to completely re-think everything about the business.  I just remember hearing that I would need at least a week's notice to reserve a table.  
This intimidated me as a sixteen year old, as it should have.  I didn't even know where Forest Hill, I thought she lived in the Woods.

I imagined myself having a love & hate relationship with the restaurant over the years of frequently it, but the simple fact is that they've been nothing but highly accommodating in every aspect of service, and the food has never disappointed, or embarrassed me before.  I don't see Toronto as a world class city, but after given serious thought, the restaurant Sassafraz could be considered on par with some of the top restaurants I've ever been to anywhere in the world, especially given the circumstances of being located in Toronto, a city which in my opinion does not strive for, or demand the absolute best of anything.

In terms of real estate, Sassafraz holds the most coveted corner of all of Yorkville, and it is certainly the most distinct in architectural design--not that it's unique, but in that it is a big yellow house.
Some people use the weather system, some use the news, but I use the Maitre'Ds standing outside of the restaurant to verify whether if it's really summer.  
The girls working there are always pleasantly dressed and well groomed.  For such a young demographic to be working in a high demand business, they are actually properly trained as service persons.  
I do appreciate their professionalism, considering the Sassafraz is also a local hangout for some of the most pretentious people in all of Toronto.  There is this elderly gentleman who dresses like he is a metropolitan cowboy, and often parks his Rolls Royce Phantom outside while chatting up whoever he can find younger than him.  I don't have anything against him, and I certainly would like to be in his situation when I am older, but I don't think I'd be as garish.  And for the waiters, all I can hope is that the tip is well worth putting up with that kind of pish-posh.

There are more expensive, and higher-end restaurants in the city, but somehow I always find myself here for a special occasion. 
I took the two loves of my life here on our first date, and they've gone relatively well.  Relatively well for me is as good as it gets.
I took a dear friend here once during the time adjacent to the Stafford Festival, and I ended up meeting Harold Perrineau, and Mr. Laurence Fishburne!
Yeah, Morpheus himself!  I wish my phone rang during my conversation with him, so I could have told him to take it first...HA!
Mr. Fishburne tried to hook a brother up after my conversation with him, and commented about the woman I was with in the following:  \"Wow, you know, you two, you two make an incredible couple.\"
I withheld every urge to shove out my fist and go for a props with the Hollywood legend.  

My most memorable evening was during my friend Tia's twenty-third birthday.  
I booked the VIP table on the second floor, but I received a call telling me it was double booked last minute.  We were given the centre floor in the restaurant area, which ended up being empty, so really I did have in the end our own VIP room, and bigger!  I saved $100 because that's the donation which is given to the Fire Fighters Association when booking the VIP table, which I was glad to pay.
They restaurant accommodated us with complimentary cake slicing which would have been $3 per slice, and a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine.
The service was delivered by a Egyptian looking gentleman, and the evening was just simply perfection.  

Sometimes Sassafraz do experiments, like booking a live pianist which ended up singing Britney's Spears' 'Baby One More Time' too freaking loud in the Bar area.  I could barely hear my friend while he echoed that trademark \"Ack Ack Ack AcK!\" into the microphone.  If he kept going, I swear I was going to ack right into my food. 

There are a few key points about the restaurant which I am a fan of, like the vine backdrop in the restaurant, and the cheese tasting menu.  But there's no point for me to mention it all, because I feel that Sassafraz is a place where you should develop your own experiences and stories.  It is without a doubt one of the more romantic spots in Toronto.  

Not everything will be perfect, but that's the excitement about it I guess.
Like last time I came here, it was the morning after the biggest birthday party of my life, it was around 10am, I walked to the front doors of the restaurant to see it was open for breakfast, and was greeting by an elderly Italian man who shouted the following at me: 'VAT DO YOU VAN"}
{"text":"We visited Sassafraz for my wife's birthday dinner a few nights ago. The ambience, the food and the service was all perfect and we had one of the best dining experiences in a long time. The food is a little pricey but you'll cherish the taste and experience for a long time; so in my opinion it's still a very good deal. The flip-side is that they spoiled the average french fare for me for I'll remember the taste and compare it with Sassafraz. 

Food - We had Nova Scotia Lobster bites and red oak and radicchio salad to start. The lobster bites were nice and the red oak and radicchio salad was okay. 
For mains, we had a Quebec magret duck breast and a thai Coconut red curry on server's recommendation. We were slightly hesitant ordering the thai curry at a french restaurant but it was the best thai curry we ever had in our life. It was so much flavorful that it was divine. The Quebec magret duck breast was very good too. We thoroughly enjoyed both of them.
For dessert, we had a flourless chocolate cake and a banana custard tartlet. Both were very good. I personally liked the chocolate cake a little bit more.

Service - The service was very warm, friendly and professional. Our server Melissa treated us very well and was very much competent. Even the other servers didn't mind checking on each other's tables to see if any patron needed something which was a nice touch too.
We were served a basket of freshly baked warm bread with olive oil/balsamic vinegar and warm butter along(complementary) with wine. The bread basket was replaced with a fresh one as soon as we were done with our bread.

Price - We had a groupon which had a three course meal for two for 70$. We paid about 55-60$ extra for wine, taxes and tip. It was a very good dining experience for 130$. 

Ambiance - The restaurant has a very classy and upmarket feel to it. It is very well suited for a date night or an occasion. I wouldn't go here regularly as it's too pricey for that. But they will be one of our top choices in Toronto for dining out of special occasions."}
{"text":"This place is continually a great place to dine.  While the service is a little quiet and aloof, I actually prefer that so I can enjoy the food and the company.

Happy to report that after several years, this is still my preferred date venue."}
{"text":"Sassafraz is my favourite brunch spot in Yorkville.  The dining room is bright and airy. Service is top notch and the brunch menu is reasonably priced.

You can usually get a reservation day of which is great because most other brunch spots are lined up to the door on weekends."}
{"text":"Went to Sassafraz with 17 family members this past Easter. They did a great job on all accounts! Food was great as was our wait staff. Our table of 17, located down the middle of the restaurant was wonderful! Restaurant is open and airy .... what is more, you could actually hear each other's conversation .... how novel these days! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for Summerlicious. Good menu. Fast service for Summerlicious... I got the gazpacho as an appetizer, tasted kind of like eating cold salsa from a bowl. My Mom had the tomato salad, which was okay, could have made that at home quite easily but I do understand that the Summerlicious menu is often easier than a regular one. I got the asiago mushroom penne, very cheesy, good portion of mushrooms; which I liked. I had the panacotta for dessert which was delicious. Overall it was alright. Wouldn't return to pay full prices for it. Maybe Summerlicious isnt the best time to try the place, but I came here in the Fall 2013 and it was better then."}
{"text":"Sassafraz, I love you. You make my dates more exciting, my company more interesting, and my family bearable.

Don't come STARVING, as you won't be particularly satisfied. The portions are modest. However, the quality and taste are quite good.

My only qualm is about the servers. Their impression is a tad higher-than-thou. My advice? Dress to impress."}
{"text":"I love this place! We came here because we bought their groupon deal which was I think $68 for two set meals. 

The portion sizes were huge! My partner and I chose to have the bone marrow as our appetizer. I liked it but I thought that it was a bit salty but other than that I got no other complaints for it.  We both got the lamb shank as our main dish, and the portion was so big that I couldn't even finish it. The meat was very tender. The only thing that I didn't like as much was their dessert, which we both got the chocolate one. The chocolate cake was extremely dry and the ice cream was too sweet. 

I love their service! We got seated as soon as we walked in, and I was offered water and bread pretty much as soon as I sat down. Food came pretty quickly and the servers were all very nice and friendly. I would definitely come back for their summerlicious! 

PS: If you want a more quiet dining, I wouldn't suggest you to come at night because the place gets pretty packed at night. I could barely hear what my partner was saying because the other tables were so loud and so close to us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal. Everything is superlative. Decor, Atmosphere, service (Kudos to Andreanne, one of the nicest servers in the city, and Brigitte, awesome manager!) and the food, the FOOOOOOD! Highlights: PEI grass-fed beef so tender you can cut it with a fork, cornish hen tender and tasty, quinoa risotto, hand foraged mushrooms sauteed to perfection and for dessert, amazing churros with chili chocolate and dulce de leche sauces. They know how to mix great cocktails and have a great wine list. Pricey but  the quality is in proportion to what you pay."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon for two for a 3 coarse meal. The service was excellent and I really enjoyed the food. I ordered the steak and lobster bites. Both dishes were delicious except I ordered my steak medium rare but it was more medium. It still tasted really good as they placed a melted butter on it and the outside was charred. For dessert I got the chocolate mouse which came with a passion fruit sauce, a custard sauce and placed on top of a butter like cookie. It was tastey especially with the hint of lemon and basil. My husband got the escargots, it was so creamy and filled with meaty bits. It was alot of filling. He ordered the Cornish hen which I didn't taste but said was bland in comparison to my steak. He got the maple beignets, filled with custard and a sauce around it. Yummm. My husband also got a whiskey drink with ginger beer and grapefruit juice. I actually took it for myself after a sip. 

The service was really great. I've had experience with Groupon and the service being really bad because of it. But they were all helpful. I actually ordered a shrimp dish and changed my ordered to the steak and the waiter said it was no problem. 

I'd go back again. Their charcuterie board looked good with a glass of wine after work one day. The decor is beautiful. Love the green wall and water feature."}
{"text":"Two weddings and a dinner, that's what it took for me to finally pen a review for this iconic Yorkville restaurant. The was a dinner many years ago, and while I'm sure none of the menu items (or staff for that matter) are still the same, I do remember it was memorable.

Fast forward to two years ago, we were invited to a friends wedding here and at first when we heard this we were puzzled. How? Well let me tell you how, their gorgeous main floor easily transforms into an event space for a group as much as 100 guests, with people sitting on long tables across the length of the main dining room. Then once dinner was over the remaining space could easily be used for enough room for dancing and drinks. Aside from the food being plentiful and easily the highest quality of any wedding we've been to save for a couple of venues (but definitely at the same level), the staff and venue transforms beautifully to accommodate any private function, even a loft space open from above next to their fantastic live wall for photographers to take amazing even shots once the party started.

Fast forward to last year when we were talking to those same friends whose wedding we loved about how tough (expensive) it was to find a nice venue for our own wedding reception (cocktail style with passed apps, stations and open bar). We had been to several restaurants and venues across the city each time being greeted with insane pricing with even crazier add ons for silly services. It was disheartening to say the least. Our friends said that we really should reach out to Dennette and her team at Sassafraz as not only were they a dream to work with but very reasonable. Yeah right! A top restaurant in Toronto's most exclusive neighbourhood? Come on. They insisted we reach out and so we did.

Dennette the main event coordinator was lovely from the very first email exchange and phone conversation. Understanding exactly what we needed and what we were looking for, and then providing us with a quote that was not only one of the lowest of any of the EIGHT we visited but also offered the most, with the fewest \"add ons\". Things like room rental fee, cake cutting costs for bringing in our own outside desserts and even set up fees were not even a consideration. The main objective was to ensure we hit an extremely reasonable minimum spend. We knew on food alone we'd hit that number so we decided to secure our date.

Part of the reason why they don't charge a room rental fee is because they have a private event space on the upper floor with capacity for 200-250, so they don't need to shut down the restaurant to host your event (unless you want the main floor - then I don't know what their protocol is).

Throughout the planning, our meetings and our eventual menu tasting a week prior to our big day, Dennette was always extremely helpful with suggestions, planning, and quick on response times. Despite the stress of planning any wedding, this was as stress free as you could hope for.

Our cocktail wedding reception had us arriving at 3:30/4pm for set up, have a legal wedding in the room at 4:30pm and our guests began arriving at 5pm. It was perfect! Then the food began to roll out, OMG the food, the food, the food. Everything you would expect from a Yorkville restaurant, and more! Our expertly curated menu included the following (and more as I know I'm forgetting some things:

STATIONS
* Canadian Cheeses/dried fruits/honey comb/nuts/figs crisps
* Cured Meats/Pickled Veggies/Chipotle vinaigrette/sriracha aioli/breads
* Assorted Sushi (Maki, sashimi, rolls, Nigiri, etc)

PASSED CANAPES (single bite)
* Smoked Salmon/Dill crème fraiche/toast points
* Poached Lobster Medallions/Orange Zest/Fennel
* Tomato and avocado salad/Chipotle vinaigrette/tostada
* Duck Confit Croquette/apricot orange jam
* Wild Mushroom tart/ truffle essence

PASSED TASTING BOWLS
* Buttermilk fried chicken/creamy grits/waffle/maple gravy
* Potato gnocchi/wild mushrooms/Arugula/Parmigianno-Reggiano

PASSED CANAPES (more than a bite)
* Grilled three cheese on sourdough bread
* Mini S Cafe bar Burger/ Canadian Prime Beef/ aged cheddar/bacon jalapeno aioli
* Traditional Quebecois style poutine

Is your mouth watering? It should be, because everything on this list tasted, smelt and looked as amazing as it sounds.

Our special day was made easy, delicious and memorable, thanks to the staff of Sassafraz, and as if to add a cherry on top of all of this, they finished a full renovation of the main floor (see their Instagram) a mere week before our date and guests were all marveling at how gorgeous it looks now!

We're planning to be lifelong advocates and customers of Sassafraz, so if you're ever there as for us, we'll have a table every year on our anniversary

Eatcrest Out!

Pro-tip to couples getting married. The Yorkville park across the street from Sassafraz is an easy choice for wedding day pictures and you don't require a Toronto photo permit according to their list on their website!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here!   There are far better spots to eat  in Yorkville - not worth the money based on the service and the POOR attitude of both the owner and the General manager. The waitress was great so not her fault it was poor execution on all other fronts AND A ATTITUDE I HAVE NEVER EXPEREINCED WITH ANY RESTAURANT.

Just came from lunch today (March 28th 2013) -  MY ANGER IS DIRECTED TO THE Owner (you know who I am beacuse I left you my card!)

Service was extremely slow (almost an hour to get main course) and when we complained to both the manager and the owner they argued with me about the length of time fro the main course and in fact gave an attitude that showed they could care less if we ever came back!!!

Good luck guys YOU JUST DEFINED THE WORD ARROGANT. My office is down the street from you and I run a multi-hundred million dollar investment fund that spends significant dollars on dinners and lunches in Yorkville.

BASED ON HOW POORLY THE OWNER AND GM TREATED ME,  I WILL NOT BE COMMING BACK AND WILL NOT BE HOSTING ANY BOARD OR CLIENT EVENTS HERE!!!

SINCE THE OWNER AND GM DON'T FOLLOW THE VIEW THAT THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT I THINK YOU WILL SUFFER AS A RESULT!!

i AM VOTING WITH MY CHEQUE BOOK AND WON'T RETURN!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, my girlfriend brought us here to have brunch before her wedding dress fitting at Whites Canada. She really liked dinner here, so she wanted to try out the brunch! We came on a Saturday afternoon with reservation, and it was very busy. Our food took about 25 minutes to come out. The server gave us extra fruits because it took so long, so that was really nice. I ordered the {Lobster Croque Madame} because it sounded delicious ~ It was pretty much like an open faced sandwich/eggs Benedict. The egg was perfectly poached, and had the delicious runny egg porn going on! The house brioche was lightly toasted with the cured ham on top, the texture of the brioche with the lobster tasted absolutely amazing!!   The lobster was also perfectly cooked, still tender with a slight crunch to the bite. The sauce was not too salty and added a nice touch of creaminess to the eggs! The arugula salad was fresh, I loved the vinaigrette with it. The salad was sorta like a palate cleanser, so refreshing. Highly recommend this dish for my eggs Benedict lovers! 


{Caramelized Banana and Blueberry Pancakes with Fresh Whipped Cream and Blueberry Maple Syrup} 
Even though our bride was going to a wedding dress fitting, that didn't stop her from ordering two brunch dishes! She ordered the pancakes because she wanted to try it.  I'm glad she ordered it because it was delicious!! The pancake itself wasn't amazing (because I am biased with Mildred's Temple pancakes ), it wasn't fluffy, sorta just regular. However the flavour of the blueberries really complimented it. The blueberry maple syrup wasn't overpowering either, it only had a slight blueberry flavouring to it. The caramelized bananas was a real treat to this dish, wasn't too sweet too! So yummmms. I could only have a couple of bites because I was so full from the lobster croque madame. 


{Chicken and Waffles with Watermelon Dragonfruit Compote & Maple Gravy} 
Our friend was starving, and so she wanted a lot of food.  Of course I had to try some rightttttt The chicken was juicy inside, but I wish there was some sort of spice on the fried batter. A bit bland, but good for those who don't like spices on their fried chicken. The waffles was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. I really liked the compote, although I was expecting it to be a sauce, it was cool that it was cubed fruits! Really refreshing to a heavy dish. The maple gravy pulled whole dish together, sweet and savoury"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio yesterday for lunch with my wife. What a great location to soak up some rays and have a great meal....the scallops were terrific (a second choice as the halibut was sold out). The service was nice and the mojitos were made from scratch and were delicious...resisted the temptation to have more than one. A great spot to watch the people go by and sample a little of the good life. Quintacential Yorkville."}

{"text":"This review is for S Café Bar at Sassafraz, not the main restaurant. The set-up is delightfully decadent with plush couches forming little sitting areas for individual parties. Situated by the massive open-airred windows, it's a fantastic spot to unwind with a watermelon mojito and gawk at the endless parade of ostentatious vehicles and painfully fashionable passerby clutching their Hermès totes (there's also outdoor seating if you come early enough to snag a table). Ordered a grilled cheese sammy on sourdough with three different types of cheese; unarguably one of the best meals I've ever had (including trip to Europe). French fries were equally divine. Service was exceptionally warm and friendly. One of my new favourite spots in Toronto -- hope to return many times in the future."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for date night. The hostest who greeted us was welcoming, the food was delicious, the ambiance was romantic, but I give this rating 3 stars instead of 5 because I wasn't a big fan of our server.

I wish we had someone else, because the other servers seemed great tending to their tables. However I felt with our server we were a little neglected and he was a little snooty when speaking to us. After we were seated, it took a long time for us to place our order. While we were having our meal, we wanted to order some drinks but then eventually decided not to because even getting water took very long (we asked a few times).

It wasn't a busy night (maybe 15% capacity) and we didn't go during those winterlicious/summerlicious season, so we were a little upset with the speed of our service."}
{"text":"Came with a Groupon.

Ambience: Amazing.  I had come a few times before the fire & reno's, but this is the first time I've come since.  Nicely done.

Appetizers: The marrow was great, and the highlight of the meal.

Wine: Andeluna from Mendoza, Argentina.  Hard to compare, fantastic.

Mains: they were ok.  For the price, I don't think it's fair value.  Hard to see why this is such a hotspot for celebs and such during TIFF.

Dessert: Before this, I was ready to give them 4 stars. Their lava cake... didn't run.  More like a brownie.

In summary, I wouldn't choose to come back, but it's not \"bad\" food, just not great or good value."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on my birthday! The location and and exterior of the restaurant is so chic and cute! Even though it was freezing outside, I felt all warm and giddy walking up to the restaurant. The inside is even more appealing! The decor is so cozy and elegant. The dining area is very spacious and glamorous. We loved everything about the atmosphere. Our servers were on top of everything! Their service was fast and I felt that we were always being looked after. We ordered the octopus to start, which was a bit smaller than I expected but it tasted DELICIOUS. The feta that they serve with this was the best tasting feta I've tried at a restaurant. And I'm Greek! Our mains were delicious too - the frites were so tasty and I got the tandoori lamb which was very tender and delicious! To drink I got the raspberry margarita but if I am being honest it wasn't my favourite, but it wasn't bad either. The overall experience was very romantic, cozy and intimate. Exceptional for a date night!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service. 

Took my fiancé for a belated birthday dinner. We ordered oysters to start (the mignonette was soooo tasty); he also had a jalapeño margarita that had a very pleasant spiciness to it. For our mains, he had the beef tenderloin with fingerling potatoes (done perfectly), mushrooms, and creamed kale (so good and so rich that it left me speechless). I had the duck breast with sweet potato puree (again, so rich and so yummy that I could cry), roasted beets, and fennel. Although the breast was a tad tough, the cider bourbon reduction that went with it was flawless. For dessert, I requested the roasted cherry cheesecake (so silky and light) with a candle for my fiancé's birthday; kitchen staff not only added the candle, but presented the whole thing on a beautiful plate decorated with tiny meringue drops, dried apricots and nuts, and the words \"Happy Birthday\". 

Really enjoyed dining here - the food was excellent, the wait staff were attentive, and the dining room with its vaulted glass ceiling and living wall was gorgeous. I look forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit ever to this gorgeous place.

I watched the creation of this establishment on a show called 'Opening Soon' many years ago and I just can't believe I've finally gone many moons later.
Honestly I think if you can say anything bad about this place, your flat out un-pleaseable.
This restaurant goes above and beyond in every field. 
A PLUS!!
The place looks very tiny on the outside, but inside its HUGE!
The most beautiful interior, very luxe. (it reminded me of the interior in Beverly Hills)
The staff cater to Toronto's elite on a daily basis, and don't make you feel any less important even if you used a Groupon to eat here (which we did... I LOVE GROUPON!)
Staff checked in with us throughout the meal to make sure we were taken care, and manager did as well.  Incredible.  Zero attitude.
The food was just incredible, all 3 courses were so elegant, and the ambiance of the table with roses everywhere, lighting, etc. was really something."}
{"text":"I mean it was okay. The environment was nice but the food was so so. I ordered the Cornish hen and to be honest it was pretty dry."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here for a weekend getaway and it was fantastic again. This time we sat on the waterfall side (note: always sit on the waterfall side) and the ambiance was 100% better. The food was fantastic, well presented and satisfying. The serving staff was fun, kind and really helped to make the whole experience worthwhile. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. No staff acknowledged us. We had to keep flagging someone to et our order, water etc. we didn't have one consistent wait staff. Also te food is below average. Sassafraz is literally the definition of mediocre Canadian businesses succeeding because there isn't much competition."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for snacks and cocktails and was blown away.

Ambiance:
An amazing pianist was playing through most of the night. Honestly couldn't get enough of his soulful singing. The decor is on point and the lighting is perfect for an intimate date. There was a woman sitting next to the pianist with a book and a glass of wine. You could tell she goes to Sassafraz often for the ambiance. 

Service:
Our waiter was named Jon and we agreed that he was the best waiter we've had in a long time. He was friendly, attentive and really knew his alcohol. He made several drink recommendations all of which were extraordinary. 

Food and drinks:
That brings me to my third point. We only had some fries and dessert so can't comment on entrees. The food we did have was absolutely delicious. The cocktails again were exemplary. We had just finished with drinks and dinner at Scaddabush and were not impressed with their cocktails. Going to Sassafraz afterwards was like comparing night and day.

Recommendation:
Great date place and go on a Friday night when the pianist is there."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. 

Pros 
Service was well above par. Very quick and efficient. 
Very clean and upscale look. 

Cons 
Small portions
Very pricey 
Food was ok (given its downtown there are many other places one can eat for half the price and better tasting food)."}
{"text":"Summerlicious visit after much debate on which restaurant to try this year and having heard about the place from a colleague. Overall my verdict is that I should trust my instincts, and regard my colleague's opinion with the same scrutiny as I regard their work - carefully and with a grain of salt. I arrived timely on a weekday evening and the place was bustling. The corner shop had all the windows and doors open for a covered patio feeling, the décor is somewhere between modern, vintage, ornate...think white-gray marble with gold accents and how that's coming back in style. My party of three sat on a white love seat with two round tables between us, and two average black plastic chairs on the other side. The setup was cozy, the music wasn't terribly loud, and the service arrived shortly.

The menu was short - seasonal I suppose? Most items were available as part of the Summerlicious menu, so it was the best deal for sure at $48. I went with the grilled octopus, Cornish hen, and chocolate cake. The open rosé had quite sweet notes which suited my palate, at $10. Plating and overall presentation of the food was great - so at least first impressions were promising.

The octopus came with a side of Caprese salad - the small portion of octopus tasted blanched then tossed on the grill, soft and fully cooked inside, but burnt on the outside. All I could taste was the charred outer - the ends were a bit crispy but the other pieces just tasted like blackened food.

The hen was well presented and not bad - crispy skin with sesame, flavourful inside, the asparagus and cauliflower purée added texture variance and made the dry parts better. The asparagus lattice had a similar texture as the octopus, which I didn't care for. The mixed grains went well with the chicken, though I'm not typically a fan.

Finally, time for dessert. Perhaps I didn't look closely enough into the menu but a sliver of mousse cake with a rice cracker base was presented. On the sweet side, but went nicely with my wine. There was a spoon of sorbet? Ice cream? It had an icy texture but appeared creamy, and melted rapidly. Either way, it went well with the cake, but everything melted quickly.

Overall, the service was timely and attentive and I had no major complaints - except our waiter never mentioned his name. Fortunately he was always only a step away so that compensated most of the time. The food didn't meet my expectations but matched to the average Yelp rating - I guess I should've known! The atmosphere would be great for a casual glass of wine and a chat, it didn't make for eating as much as I would've liked and the bartender was rowdier than I expected. At one point, odd smells came from somewhere, and the open concept brought in all the flies trying to sip my wine. Given the price point, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I've had quite a few groupon based dinners at Sassafraz, and though these can be quite good, what you really want to hit up Sassafraz for is breakfast and brunch. I've had just about everything on their brunch menu, all amazing. The pancake stack doused in a thyme honey sauce, as opposed to plain old syrup, is particularly dream-worthy."}
{"text":"I had always been fond of Winterlicious but never went for Summerlicious. Perhaps there's not much better to do during Winter than to fill my stomach up:P

Sassafraz is the first restaurant I've tried for Summerlicious accompanied with two other friends. I heard good things about this restaurant and being pretty posh in Yorkville, so I've decided to give them a visit for dinner!

The restaurant has a lounge and drinks seating, separated from its dining area with two glass doors. Its interior is decorated very well and modern with a waterfall wall sided with greens like a rainforest. Their tables are also half sofa couches, super comfy.

Per usual dining, each customer can select an appetizer, entree, and dessert for their special menu choices. You can always find those items on their standard menus too. Being friends and alike, we all chose the exact same combination (dinner at $45): Ontario Beef Tartare, Ontario Artisan Beef Striploin, and Strawberry Rhubarb Cheesecake for dessert.

The tartare tasted really great! It was seasoned well yet still has its original beef flavour. The sour dip on the side spiced up my taste buds - compensated for the raw beef texture.

As the the striploin, I was quite disappointed. All three of us asked for medium rare steaks. What was brought to our table was three medium steaks. Mine pretty much was the only one that had slight blood oozing out when sliced. It was only little bit pink inside and when I ate further from the middle, the more overcooked it was. Not sure if this was their standard or just because of their chefs being overwhelmed due to Summerlicious.

The cheesecake was interesting. It was decent but nothing very special. The texture was quite soft and mousse-like in comparison to New York cheesecakes which has a thicker and stiff texture. The raspberry sauce was alright.

Service overall was good except for just one tick off. Two of my friends had finished their plates and I was still eating the last bites but paused to talk and had my fork/knife placed in the \"I'm not finished yet\" position. However, the server wanted to take my plate away too and hesitated right next to me. I had to resume my eating and movement to make him stop.

Overall, I think Sassafraz is a nice restaurant but not sure if it's entree is the best. It's more of a 3.5/5 rating."}
{"text":"For a Stiploin Steak and an apple martini, you will pay $70.00. The steak was OK and I loved the Martini. It could be better.
Customer service is 5 star
An old man plays piano and he is very good
I like the atmosphere. will certainly go back"}
{"text":"Walked in here. Plenty of tables and seats available. Sat a table and waited. And waited. No one came. Asked the hostess to get my waiter. No one came. No water on my table, no recognition that I was there. In town working on a show. Will make sure everyone knows to skip this pretentious place."}
{"text":"I am a big brunch person and  love the idea of lingering over mimosas and eggs on a sunny weekend afternoon. Sassafraz is in my neighborhood and we really like the ambience. We walked in off the street one Saturday and they were able to seat us inside right away ( there was a wait for patio seating). My SO got bennys and I ordered scrambled and although the portions aren't huge, the food was impeccable. I truly eggs are the trickiest to get right and these were close to perfection. We were allowed to linger (which is very important for my Zen).Brunch for two without alcohol was about $50 including tip and tax. Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"Love love love love love this place! Now we were a bit spoiled because it was a large travel industry event but the food they served is from their regular menu.
That zucchini lentil soup is the best soup I have ever had. I can't believe how good that was! All the other food was great too. Also, the wine list is impressive. I can't wait to go back sometime!
Great service, lovely ambiance, delicious food. What more do you need??"}
{"text":"Great apps, service and cocktails. Fun music selection, too. There's a reason this place has been around for so long in the heart of Yorkville."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious. Ordered a chicken dish which was very well cooked. Appetizer included escargot in a bacon cream sauce. Desert was a cherry cheesecake. Aside from the main dish, appetizer was ok, and desert was nothing out of the ordinary, but tasty. Service was excellent. I did find a small hair in the butter that came with the starter bread, but the waiter was very apologetic and exchanged it right away. The atmosphere was nice. The restaurant is quite large and airy. It got a little chilly at the end of the meal. Maybe they could have turned up the heat a little. It was a good experience. Great for Winterlicious, but I find it would be overpriced on a regular day."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for summerlicious dinner 
Order a pitcher of rose sangria, by far the worst drink I've ever had. 
Had grilled octopus - which was previously boiled until soft and then placed back on the grill, and by soft I mean like you barley had to chew, kinda like baby food. 
Duck breast was nicely cook but you get two tiny little piece maybe half of a duck breast. Protein is small or course everything else on the plate is tiny as well lol. The sauce was really good as well. I pretty much got full from eating bread and water. 
Got the dark chocolate cake was extreme sweet probably due to the ganache. I have a sweet tooth and I did not finish cake. I noticed that all 3 of my plates was pretty dirty with water and grease mark. Service was pretty slow as well."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a Groupon deal for a small pre-birthday dinner with my boyfriend. I've always wanted to try Sassafraz since it is a Toronto icon known for being a celebrity hotspot when TIFF used to take place in Yorkville. 

I made the reservation on OpenTable. No one phoned to confirm the reservation beforehand. When we arrived, the hostess quickly found our reservation and asked if we were using Groupon and seated us without any problems. For the whole evening, service from the hostess to the server to the busboys were very courteous and non-intrusive.

I've read on Yelp lots of rave reviews about the ambiance -- the two story waterfall, etc -- but I found the restaurant to be just OK. I did not think the setting was particularly beautiful nor the atmosphere very romantic. I would have preferred dimmer lighting for dinner. The furnishing was modern-ish and minimalist-ish. I find it similar to the inside of Nota Bene. The dining room was large with no nooks or crannies so it did not have an intimate feel. The boyfriend found it a bit on the noisy side.

For appetizer, we had wild mushroom and marrow and chowder. I loved the mushrooms which were very tasty on a crostini. The marrow that came with the dish was ok. The mains were beef flank steak and tuna. The steak was tender and nicely cooked. Unfortunately the outer seared part of the tuna was a bit hard and lukewarm. We had chocolate cake and some kind of pineapple dessert. They tasted like standard banquet hall fare, nothing special. 

Overall I felt the quality of the food and the overall dining experience was worth the Groupon value I paid but no more. I can see myself going back to Sassafraz perhaps in the summer for a drink on the patio (just because it's so nice to relax and hang out in Yorkville on a weekend afternoon in the summer) but I would not return for dinner. The food is simply too average and there are too many other great restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"This is a very fancy restaurant where you can spot some of the hollywood stars during the TIFF. Thus I had high expectations. The food is well presented in beautifully arranged dishes, but it was not particularly interesting or tasty. For the price they charge, I was expecting more. The service was attentive, but not as high quality as you expect from a place like this. In sum, you will not have a bad meal or be mistreated, but for the prices they charge you can get much more interesting food and higher quality service in town."}
{"text":"Skillet Baked Escargot: yum - creamy - greasy, that's the general feeling about this appetizer. The escargots were kinda lack of its own flavour, which has been covered by the creamy sauce.

Lobster Bites: It was ok.

Ontario Cornish Hen: The chicken was tender and juicy, the skin was crispy, plus the stuffing and the side dish which added more layers of flavour, like this dish.

Sturgeon Fillet: Black quinoa and sturgeon - not a fan of this combo. The idea might be using quinoa to reduce the fishy taste, but the fish was soft and the quinoa was hard and lack of flavour, this one is not recommended.

The desserts were great, the cheesecake was yum and the beignets were out of expectation.

Service and atmosphere were nice too."}
{"text":"NYE 2014 dinner was just ok... The chowder was good an my friends tell me the pork belly was excellent. HOWEVER -- the Amuse Bouche of seared tuna was bland, Sweet Potato Ravioli was undercooked and the pasta was too thick/hard, strip loin was  under seasoned and barely warm (I know meat needs to rest but come on), and the chocolate cake barely had any flavor. For a $100 set menu it was not worth it - we won't be going back. I would rate 2 stars, but since our friends' wedding dinner last NYE 2013 was a much more enjoyable experience I'll give it 3 total."}
{"text":"Hi and, a special thank you to the staff for what they did for me in terms of how much I learned and, what I can apply to my next job. I am glad that the staff were nice, and, also I focused on their kindness. The management were great and, might I add nice to be thought of so much,  have a Happy Valentines guys!!."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Cafe/Bistro. 
Great cozy ambience; much more welcoming than the main dining room which seemed really stuffy

We shared a few dishes:
- Mussels: Great flavor and juicy mussels. Generous portions
- Mac & Cheese: small portion, not very tasty. Lacking in crust (breadcrumbs). $18 for it? Crazy
- Fries: Tasty and well-seasoned

I also got the French Onion Soup which was very tasty, but at $13, way too pricy, eh? It was more like a $8 onion soup...definitely over-priced

Overall, great ambience and tasty food, but many items were completely overpriced and not worth it"}
{"text":"I was here for Brunch on Valentine's Day. My boyfriend ordered roses from a 3rd party, and the hostess delivered it to our table. I'm happy they offered that service, but I am a bit disappointed because my boyfriend had requested to have them delivered to our table at the end.

Brunch menu was a bit limited in my opinion. The blue cheese was delicious, the fresh bread was to die for! (Mouth watering as I type). The main course was okay. Ambience is nice. My only other complaint is that we were next to the corner booth - thank goodness we weren't stuck there because the tables were jam packed so tightly.

I had higher expectations of this place but I left with a content restaurant experience, but a great overall Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Spacious but usually empty. Good service compensates pretty average food."}
{"text":"I went there for the 2011 Summerlicious as well.

The restaurant is really nicely decorated and the the service was great up until the end, when we asked to pay separately and the waiter looked at us like we were crazy. He was so rude to ask us if \"we would be able to cover the bill, with us all paying separately.\"

The food was pretty, but it wasn't mind blowing.  I don't think I will be back in a hurry. I thought for such a high rated restaurant the food would be amazing. I had the lobster soup which was nice in the hot summer weather, and the truffle essence made it really good. I also had the Cornish hen, which was cooked well and the blueberry tart. 

So overall the experience was nice, but it's not food that I would rave about."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this restaurant this past Saturday evening for dinner. It's a beautiful establishment, bright from all the light coming in. This was my first time eating there so I was not sure what to expect. We were greeted promptly by a friendly hostess, she seems nice and down to earth. We were seated and she asked us if we were happy with our spot, and we were. We were watched for a while by two men, one of whom ended up being our server. He was nice, just seemed like the typical type of server for a restaurant like that...you know, accent, turned up nose, very polished looking and up talked the whole time. Not the type of person I would have beers with lol. He took our drink orders as well our appetizer and main course at the same time. I order the Scallops and my husband ordered the Poached Lobster that came with a side salad.  We were given bread with our mean. The guy serving the bread seemed more down to earth, though very soft spoken. My husband devoured the bread so he came back and asked if we wanted more. Of course my husband said yes. 

Appetizers: 
Our food was serves in a timely fashion. The scallops were served on a bed of forbidden rice with a seafood broth and cauliflower. The scallops were perfect! I don't know how you can improve on them, they were perfectly seared to a golden brown on all sides, they were tender, my knife slide right through them and the taste and texture were amazing. I'm sure the rice and broth were just garnishes but I polished that off too. The rice was great and so was the broth. My husband bit into his lobster and his eyes rolled to the back of his head, he hardly talked because he was busy eating. I tasted the lobster, it was good, but the scallops were better. 

Main course: 
While waiting for our main I did witness our server scolding the bread guy simply because he cleared the wrong table first. He cleared table B first when he should have cleared table A first...was that really anything to make a scene about?! I felt bad for him and witness another staff member roll his eyes and shake his head, saying to me that it was typical behavior. I thought it was mean and unprofessional to do that in the front of the house. I ordered the Red Pepper Risotto and my husband ordered the Bison which came with sweet potatoes. The risotto again was wonderful, I loved it! REALLY loved it! You can certainly taste the red peppers and it mixed nicely with the cheese. My husband loved his meal too. He never had Bison before so for him it was different than steak, I'm not sure if he would get it again but he wouldn't stop talking about the potatoes. 

We shared the cheesecake for dessert. It was really good and creamy and light. 

The price was not as bad as I thought it would be. I would love to go again! My only reason for not giving it a 5 star was be server's behavior with staff and his pretentious demeanor."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a couple of weeks ago as a birthday present.  We sat outside, which was lovely and the service was very, very speedy.  I had the yogurt and granola and my friend had eggs.  Overall it was fairly good but I find more experimental brunches far more appealing.  I'd like to try out dinner at some point as I've heard it is quite good.  For brunch, I'd go to the Studio in Four Seasons."}
{"text":"Terribly over-priced and overrated... Didn't follow through on the promise of the menu items. Pork belly could be great if a decent portion, but not here. The scallops were nice but the sea beans had a slightly off-putting smell. We were drawn in by the quail at $39, but oh my, the surprise that it was only half a quail!  The 10 oz filet could've been more tender, clearly not aged meat.  Nice flavor but lacking a charred crust. Service was delightful, tho. Great decor and a wonderful piano player on Sat nights."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant during Winterlicious on a Sunday afternoon. The yellow color of the exterior wall looks cute and bright. You can not miss it

Their Winterlicious menu is great, very good deal with high-quality food, as well as the great portion. My appetizer is Chef's Feature Soup. Very smooth and fresh. My friend ordered the Smoked Salmon. The fish is a little bit fat but overall a good appetizer in terms of the dressing.

We were very surprised at our main course.The 9-Spice Roast Harrison Co-Op Chicken Breast.Beautiful presentation and big portion. My chicken breast tastes awesome, very tender and I guess the 9 spice just play a magic to the flavor.  Ontario Pork Chop is not bad, very chewy and without any pork smell. 

The texture of my Flourless Chocolate Cake is between a brownie and fudge, quite strong."}
{"text":"From the outside, this pretty yellow house restaurant looked very promising... loved the ambiance, it definitely offered me a fancy and yet relaxed lazy summer European cafe experience. Located in hip and trendy Yolkville, it attracts a lot of classy customers, both old and young which makes this place an interesting people watching spot. Cappuccino was pretty good, it tasted better than I expected. However, the crepe was subpar,  I was not impressed. I might go back again but I would definitely skip the crepes!"}
{"text":"Been here about a dozen times. Fell in LOVE with the Cornish hen and cheesy polenta & not to mention the live music and wine! The food is nicely presented, portions are well sized. This place is better enjoyed with a group over aps and cocktails.

One of the main issues is with the service: Incredibly long wait at times in between courses, dinner completion might take up to two hours.

Personally, I'd stick to the dinner menu as breakfast and lunch items are quite limited; also the cheese plate isn't anything special.

Average price around $75 per person."}
{"text":"A very expensive place to eat very average food.  The atmosphere isn't bad, and perhaps it's really the quality of people you are paying to be around.  I don't mind when the guy next to me pulls out a $45,000 necklace for his girlfriend.  I just gifted my brother the kingdom of Spain."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for Winterlicious on a weekday night. We had a reservation and were promptly seated once in their main dining room. 

I had the duck pate for appetizer, veal chops with barley risotto for main and the cherry cheesecake with chocolate ganuche for dessert. My boyfriend had escargots with bacon for appetizer, duck breast for main and chocolate cake with barley ice cream for dessert.

Except for the duck, the portions size were larger than expected. I would say it's \"full sized\" portions - like what you get if you paid the regular price. I really enjoyed my veal chop, it was really tender. The barley risotto had a chewy crunch, but could of been cooked a tad bit longer. I find the duck a bit too gamey, but my boyfriend enjoyed his dish. 

When my cheesecake came, I was really surprised (and relief) that it wasn't cover with a cherry syrup. I'm not too fond of cherries or syrup... The baked cheeeecake was smooth, had a strong cream cheese flavour and it wasn't overly sweet or dense like typical NY styles ones. I really liked it! The chocolate cake was DECADENT. It was rich and smooth, but I wouldn't have been able to finish the whole thing. 

Overall, I'm really please with the food, the service and the atmosphere at Sassafraz. I would most certainly come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"We had the cheese plate here once, and it was amazing! Great selection of wine, and the server was able to make some on-point recommendations.I can't comment on the other food for now, but I'm sure I'll try it soon. We were out on the patio, which was really nice for people watching. Service was prompt, friendly, and professional. I could easily see this being a great place to celebrate a birthday or go out for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Review on the Run:

The first time I was at Sassafraz was during summerlicious.  Overall I was fairly disapointed. The Watermelon salad, was.. well watermelons and a sprig of mint and red onions. 

For the main I had a red curry pork tenderloin. You had to close your eyes and really imagine the taste of curry. For dessert it was short bread, and nobody finished their bread as it was stiff as a board. 

Overall pretty meh.  And for the price, uber-meh.

Conculsion: Eat Here?  Meh."}
{"text":"This should be a 0 star review.

We came here tonight after purchasing a Groupon last week for a 3 course meal, which we were really excited to try. I've been here before for lunch on the patio, and thought it was a great value.

This time was very different from my non-groupon experience.

We were seated in a lovely table in the cafe by the window and given the Groupon menus, which actually had more on it than expected. 

That is where the good parts of the experience ends.

Our waiter, Vesley, scoffed at my boyfriend for ordering a burger from the menu, rolling his eyes and loudly announcing \"The burger, reaaaaaaaallly? YOU would be getting better value if you ordered the scallops or the veal.\" 

After politely confirming, he left with our order and returned with the drinks that we had ordered. 

Another server dropped off the appetizers- which were actually delicious- we had the octopus and the braised beef poutine. 

Another server also dropped off our mains, which were the scallops (also very good) and burger. Something was off with the burger, it tasted very musky as if a little past due. So, my boyfriend opted to only eat the side salad.

When Vesley returned, he made a mockery of my boyfriend for not eating the burger. \"What is wrong with it?\" \"It's okay, I just didn't like it.\" \"Can you tell me EXACTLY what is wrong?\" I chime in, \"It just tasted off, I tried it too.\" \"But, it's okay if you could just take it.\" Waiter, \"I would hate for YOU to leave without getting the value\" while physically pushing the plate back into my boyfriends face. \"It's okay can we just get our desserts\", I insisted. He then still while pushing the inedible burger in his face, kept insisting in a mocking tone to get our value for the meal. Eventually, my boyfriend told him to just leave, because we were made so uncomfortable by the aggression of this waiter and he wouldn't just clear our plates and exit. 

We promptly asked for our bill and to leave before getting our dessert. And on our way out, the manager was very nice, but could not make up for the waiters mistreatment. We did not want to be in this establishment for another minute. 

Out of all of my life's dining experiences, I have never experienced such poor service and attitude from a waiter to the point of leaving a restaurant shaking and in tears. No one should be made to feel cheap for using a groupon, and to feel bad if you you don't like your meal. This is the opposite of what service should be, and I am very disappointed in paying for this discriminatory experience."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about Sassafraz and was excited to come here for lunch with my friend. Unfortunately, neither of us was impressed with this restaurant. Service was quite mediocre especially given the price point. Portions of my steak salad was very small and was nothing special. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon - there are definitely other great choices in the Yorkville area!"}
{"text":"Came here for the winterlicious menu and I was not disappointed. 

Environment/decor: This is the place to go where you would go if you want a romantic dinner. It seriously reminded me of a wedding reception. There's candles, flowers in vases, waterfall backdrops, white linens, etc. 

Food: I had the pumpkin spiced duck pate. It was delicious. For my entree, I had the Ontario veal chop. I got it well and it was still nice and tender. And my favourite part of the meal, the banana custard tartlet. It really tasted fresh. The coconut mouse on top of the banana was a nice balance. 

Service: Our server was amazing. Very professional and caring."}
{"text":"Nothing stands out . I would say sangria pretty cute. Nice display , taste is good , typical cuisine you get for this price . Good for regular eat."}
{"text":"You can probably get better food elsewhere for less money.  What Sassafraz has going for it is location.  It's located in Yorkville.  The crowd is slightly older (because most 20 something year olds just can't drop $300 on a meal).

The decor is like upscale Rainforest Café with a wall of cascading water and some greenery.  The rest of the restaurant is mostly white and beige.  A clean look.  If you stay until 9PM they usually have a live pianist on weekends.  Like most Yorkville restaurants on a Friday it is LOUDDDDDDDDDDDDD in here.  So if you want to have a private conversation about that married man you just started seeing, this is not the restaurant to have that discussion.  

THE FOOD:

I started with a Wild Boar and Red Currant Terrine which was served with house flat bread, pearl onion confit and pickled grapes.  I loved the acidity of the pickled grapes.  And it was more like a one-onion confit.

My sister had the Tempura (calamari + octopus) which had a nice and light batter.

For our mains I opted for the Pan-Seared Scallops which had the potential of being good were the scallops not overcooked and drowned out in a purée of dessert-like sweetness that was butternut squash AND apricots.  This dish definitely lacked balance.

My sister opted for the 10oz Striploin which came with fingerling potatoes and sautéed kale.  The steak was good but nothing special. 

Desserts were disappointing.  I dared to order churros (they call it donuts on the menu) which came with a duo of dulce de leche and chocolate chili sauce.  If you've ever been to Pancho's Bakery in Kensington, you will know why ordering a churros anywhere else will leave you disappointed.  And yes, I was disappointed in the 3 large, giant sticks of hardness that were presented before me.  The only thing I finished were the spoonfuls of dulce de leche.  

My sister's Trio of Creme Brulees consisted of: Maple + Ginger Crisp, Bailey's with Peppermint Crunch and Oreo Crumble.  These came in mini \"condiment dishes.\"  Texture was bang on but the only one that really had identifiable flavour was the maple + ginger crisp.

The two things that I will remember most about coming to Sassafraz are the good service and great wine."}
{"text":"I was absolutely overwhelmed by my dinner at Sassafraz last night - I went for Winterlicious and the menu options were phenomenal. Each course blew me away and I savored every last bite! My evening was only enhanced by the fantastic ambiance of the restaurant and amazing service. I would definitely recommend for anyone to try to get a last minute Winterlicious reservation - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Sassafraz Burger and Fries were delicious, even according to my picky wife (she's tough to please in a resturant). Great service which included accomodating my 11 month old son with a high chair, stashing his stroller, and warming up his bottle. 

We will be back!

--Chris"}
{"text":"I've had what was probably my best steak here, and each time I've come in here my dining experiences have been superb from the service to the value for money when you consider this is sort of a big time Yorkville establishment. You will definitely be spending quite a bit here unless you come in here for a \"licious\" meal which I've done as well. You get live music in the form of a cello or some similar elegant set up providing a very nice ambiance. 

They change their menu often from my experience so I won't get in to specific details about my dishes, but they all deliver for me in terms of platting and quality, as for drinks I highly recommend them and you really should not be looking to cheap out on a night out at Sassafraz. 

There are a few good places to visit in Yorkville but Sassafraz should be high up on your list."}
{"text":"The food is good, no doubt, but for the price you pay, you may be able to get the same thing else where. Or for the same price, something different. 

We came here for winterlicious, but I've been here a few times pre-fire a while back. It hasn't changed much, with over priced simple dishes with fancy names, and servers with a pretentious attitude. 

When we came in, we were greeted with annoyance from the male host, but a friendly female hostess showed us the way in.  I do like this room (not the main room) where the sky light create a bright and clean atmosphere, and the waterfall is a nice touch. 

Today, we ordered from the Winterlicious lunch menu ($25 lunch), we had the option from the regular menu, but it wasn't a brunch menu either. 

The Arugula Salad was just a salad, and the Smoked Salmon Carpaccio didn't seem like anything different.  I got the Potato and Celery soup which tasted better than it looked. It was a creamy soup without the cream (I think). 

For the mains, the Chipotle Beef Cheeks are definitely worth tasting.  It was tender and almost melts in your mouth. The subtlety of the spice was still there in the sauce.  The sweet potato hash was just sweet potato small squares with some red peppers. The Haricot Vert were green beans. I hate restaurants who put descriptions on the menu that tries to make it fancier than it really is. 
The Chicken was good, but seemed a little dry. The Quinoa was good too, but seemed undercooked (or maybe I always over cook it?)
The Pasta was yummy. If you look creamy pasta, this is the perfect dish for you. 

For dessert, the cheese was very good, but perhaps not worth the price you pay. It was a good side dish to sharing a dessert. 
The Chocolate Pave was amazing. The chocolate wasn't a mousse, nor a cream, but had the texture of ice cream. Perfect for a chocolate lover. 

The Lemon Lavender tart was good too. It was filled with a Ameretto custard and some milk chocolate in the middle. I was VERY disappointed that the \"Toasted Meringue\" was actually Whipped Cream sprinkled with some cocoa (see pics). 
I don't like being lied to. I totally would have mentioned this when we were there, except I only realized it now. 

The only other complaint, other than the attitude, is that Coffee/Tea is ridiculous expensive. Loose Leaf tea (that comes in a pot) was $5.50
Espresso is $3.75
Americano (which is espresso + water) was $4.50 - water must be really expensive
I asked for a regular coffee $3.75 and I was scared to ask him to top it up, I don't know why. 

Our $25 meal was about $35 a person including tax (not tip).

Just like Tony F. said. Meh."}
{"text":"I was alone on a saturday night and decided to go to a bar in my neighbourhood. With Hemingways in mind, the thought soon soured as I got closer on Cumberland and thought of getting bombarded by single older men while sipping on overly sweet coloured cocktails served by big boobed waitresses (no offence Hemingways). It was then the sound of the piano playing which lulled me into a hypnotic trance that pulled me into the bar of Sassafraz. The thought of dining alone personally scares me, but here i felt completely comfortable, and safe, being a female drinking alone. 
I got the french martini, and a bellini, the latter being pleasantly sweet and bubbly. 

I came again for lunch during winterlicious and had a similarly pleasant experience. I sat in the main dining room, which is a little bit uptight and outdated looking with everything padded in white leather so you may feel as though you are being admitted to an institution.
My date had the soup, roast chicken and apple compote - enjoyed it all
I had the salmon tartar, short ribs, and chocolate malt cake.
The presentation for everything was stellar. The salmon tartar was accompanied with pomegranate puree, which was a complementing sweetness to the saltiness of the fish. The beef was on the fattier side, and the chocolate malt cake was simply a brownie. But its winterlicious and it was $25 per person, so all is forgiven, for the price we were beyond satisfied. 
The staff is also impressively trained, and really shame other Toronto restaurants regarding customer service."}
{"text":"Sassafraz is a French restaurant located in Yorkville. It has a sophisticated atmosphere. The Victorian exterior is a nice contrast to the modern interior. As you would expect, the service is top notch. 

The menu is safe but well done. I had the soup, duck and dessert. All of the courses were excellent. However, I would recommend the duck if you have never been to Sassafraz as the duck is a mainstay."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner this week and was excited as Sassafraz has been on our list for a while. We arrived and were seated but it took about 15 minutes of us sitting there before anyone came to our table. We didn't even get water during that time. Finally, someone (a manager I think?) noticed that we were looking around trying to locate someone and she came by to get us started. The service the rest of the evening was slightly better although there were still a couple times we were waiting for service (i.e. to have our plates cleared, to ask for the bill, etc). Despite being aware that our service wasn't off to a great start, nothing was done to compensate for the bad experience. I normally don't expect anything in return, but considering that we were in a Yorkville establishment, I thought they would at least try to do something. I've had bad service compensated at much lower end places compared to Sassfraz so was surprised that they didn't quite seem concerned about the lack of service. The table beside us had the same experience where they were seated and waited 15-20 minutes for anyone to even offer them water.

For dinner, we ordered soups, the duck and veal for mains, and both got desserts. The veal chop was probably the best item of the night. The duck was good but quite salty. For dessert, the chai creme brulee had great flavour. However, the texture was almost more like flan or jello rather than being creamy.

All in all, I'm glad we went to cross it off our list but this is not somewhere we'll be returning. There are many comparable restaurants that offer better service and food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Sassafraz used to be my favourite brunch place, I got the eggs Benedict with spinach instead of ham. I went back recently for my usual and it was a COMPLETELY different experience! The spinach was just tossed onto the bun, it had bland dry roasted potatoes and barely any hollandaise sauce. Very disappointed, and definitely not coming back! 

Went for lunch also, very bland and expensive. All the food is things you could make at home for half the price, nothing special."}
{"text":"Arrived in town late on a Friday and stumbled into Sassafraz. While the people and service were friendly that is where everything positive to say ends. Foods was just awful. Now I have to say this was the scaled down menu in the lounge area but that really isn't an excuse. Lobster bites and Ricotta dishes were awful! I wish I had something more positive to say...guess the only positive is I know I won't be back?"}
{"text":"I love this place. t is iInnovative and delicious with great ambiance. I also love this neighborhood. I've been here about 10 times with various people and everyone always raves about it."}
{"text":"By Toronto standards, this is one of the finer dining go to places to impress and open up your wallet. 

The only minor issue that bothered me throughout dinner was the tap water provided at room temperature. I wonder if this was a devious ploy so that one would be encouraged to order bottled water service or pay up for any beverage. 

On the very plus side. Although this place comes across as upscale (as it is in Yorkville after all) and pretentious (with all the dinners in their designer outfits), I do find this place accommodating when I show up in much more casual attire (i.e. shorts and golf shirt). That's just me, as you may want to dress like the Jone's. 

At any rate, dinner was fine. Leisurely with well above average service."}
{"text":"Service was great from start to finish.  We made reservations going here with a Groupon my mom purchased for a party of 4 which included a 3 course meal (starter, entree, dessert). Our waiter (I think his name was Mufasa) was excellent attentive and funny at the same time. Very interactive and made our dinner enjoyable. Atmosphere was relaxing .. our reso was for 5pm and we were there till 7ish. It started to get really packed around this time towards the end of our meal. I don't have anything else to say but keep up the good work with the attentive service. We had a great experience here and would come back again to try then regular menu."}
{"text":"It is with a sad heart that I write this review. Upon reading this back I feel I am not giving the situation enough emphasis as to how bad this experience was! I also give this review on the basis that in general I am easily pleased, I dont ask a lot jus good service, good food and if I get those I will be a loyal customer!

I went here as part of summerlicious and a large group of us were going out for my birthday. So $45 for a 3 course meal, such a bargain! I was so excited as I had heard rave reviews from friends and had got caught in the hype of this restaurant.

Cocktails are fantastic, the girls tending the bar are lovely and the food was ok so for that I give 1 star. The food...was ok, I have to say I have had better and I was expecting better. 

The service was something else and to be honest in an establishment such as this I was extremely disappointed. So I did feel for our waitor as he seemed rushed off his feet, but seriously long wait for drinks. On the plus side they did get more waiting staff to help him bring out the food without being asked. One of my friends has an allergy which she alerted the waitor too but I guess he forgot to tell the kitchen or the chef forgot as her plate had to be returned as it contained food which would trigger her allergies. My friend made a request for the AC to be turned down a little due to the fact it was cold, they did this eventually after about 10 requests (although it kept getting turned back up again, perhaps others were complaining about it being turned down, its hard to please everyone I know this!)...but the waiting staff kept making cheeky remarks to my friend and making up silly stories. I honestly dont think I am describing just how bad the service had been. So two of my friends needed to leave as we had been in the restaurant for over 3 hours and it was late by the time we got dessert. They asked the waitor if they could pay for their meals by card and this is where it really took off! This was a huge issue as the waitor thought we wanted seperate bills...which we didnt. This ended in the waitor asking the manager to come out, mass complaints about the general standard of service.  

After all the hassle and carry on the manager proceded to stand over the table as we sorted out the bill and cash as we had been told on the phone that we could use multiple cards to pay the bill but on the night this was not the case so some people had to leave to go get cash and come back. Honestly I felt as though we were being watched in case we made a run for it or something insane (we did not all leave the restaurant to get cash at the same time or anything silly like that). Overall it was just very embarrassing. 

I dont mind paying money for decent food (in fact I will pay a lot for decent food as I am a bit of a foodie) and to be honest had I not received the treatment I did then I would have been back as it had inspired me enough try again. However I have never had such bad service in my life and I have vowed to never give that restaurant my business again and neither will any  of my fellow diners. Am sad as I am searching for a decent Canadian restaurant to become my regular haunt and had thought I had a strong candidate from the reviews this place has received.

My advice save your money, try somewhere else...I certainly will be!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to dine at to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or any special occasion. For a Yorkville restaurant, it is one of the most spacious and the service here is usually quite impeccable. Of the few times I have been here, everything has been smooth sailing but on my latest meal here, the waiter and waitresses knocked over my glass of water TWICE. Luckily I caught the glass before it was completely knocked over. I just take this as an odd occurrence.

As for the food, it has always been savoury and full of flavour. The butternut squash soup was made quite well but could have just used a touch more flavour. The steak was cooked perfectly to order and spilling with juices. The salmon was cooked well with a slight crisp side. The dessert was nothing spectacular but I have to say that it wasn't too heavy as some places tend to have. 

Overall, this is a good place for a dinner date, especially with larger groups.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Sassafraz this past weekend, and we used a Groupon. Although we dine frequently in Yorkville, Sassafraz used to be our special occasion type of dinner, so when we found a Groupon that seemed like a great deal, we purchased it. Our first visit here, was fantastic, impeccable service, beautiful fine dining experience, and it used to be my favourite restaurant in Toronto. 

This past weekend however, felt much different as overall the entire feel of the restaurant has downgraded very much over the years. The atmosphere has overall become a very casual, and loud restaurant. We were seated in the dining area, right in front of the door, which opens about 20 times in the span of two hours, with basically wind blowing in your face, and loud music from the bar/lounge. I decided I wouldn't let this bother me, and that it was alright. However, the service was absolutely terrible, our waiter was rude and basically uninterested in our table. He barely checked up on us, did not ask us whether we wanted more wine, and I was basically without water after the first course. 
Fortunately for the restaurant, their food quality has not changed, and their meals were wonderful. I had the arugula and grapefruit salad which was lovely, and the striploin, as well as the rhubarb cheesecake for dessert. Everything was delicious, but my striploin was a little cold, however the cut, size, and way it was cooked was delicious, so I did not mind. I did however notice that the potatoes it came with, were not fully cooked. 
Overall, I am super disappointed and sad that one of our favourite restaurants has gone downhill. I think the overall ambience and atmosphere has completely changed, and although the food was overall good, people do not only go to fine dining restaurants solely for the food. We do fine dining for an experience, and for service food, combined with excellent service. For the price you pay at Sassafraz, there are so many better choices in the city that are so much more worth it, and there are so many better restaurants in the Yorkville area that are a lot cheaper, and much better overall."}

-tasty food
-amazing flavours

-and they also had the weather cooperate (how did they get that done)

Highly recommended!!!

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. Lots of other French places in the area that are much better. If you're going out to be seen then this is your spot. If you're going out to eat delicious food, skip it."}
{"text":"Tis the season for Winterlicious, and as Sassafraz for my first stop, the bar has been set high and we'll see how the other participating restaurants fare.

I started with the smoked salmon carpaccio, with mustard mousse on top, which left a smooth finish (and I don't even like mustard). I got the wild mushroom stuffed supreme of chicken for my entree, which was at the perfect moisture and was nicely seasoned to perfection. And I finished with the lemon tart, which came out to be nice and light, and not too sweet.

In regards to the service, it was impeccable from start to finish. We never felt rushed or pressured when it came time to order, and our server had a lightheartedness to her. She would check up on us occasionally, while still giving us our space, and overall was just pleasant.

Hopefully they're participating in Summerlicious, because lets face it, with my starving student budget, I won't be able to afford to go here on any given day."}
{"text":"\"There was no obvious signage outside, we did not even notice the restaurant name written anywhere. The standalone Victorian house is definitely a landmark of its own.\"
\"The distance to a person at the next table was actually shorter than to your own date across. On the bright side, you can always befriend someone else's date and chat with them.\"
\"An original Cheesecake with no bottom crust had a beautiful texture with dried rhubarb inside adding sour tanginess. The strawberry compote under, on the other hand, offset it with sweetness. A thin, sharp, dark chocolate piece was there to help the compote too. A well-made cheesecake is always a delight. \"

{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. First I want to thank the hostesses for working with me because I did get to my reservation late and called them to tell them my flight pushed us back longer than we thought. They were very accommodating and moved the reservation. I was ready for tapas and Tinis. We got here and it was brunch I
Until 4 which was kind of a bust To me because I really wanted their other food. I do love brunch though.. when our waiter first got to the table we were excited after he left he seemed very knowledgeable. Little did I know he said they were out of two things: when he said that I though he said out of two wines. I misunderstood him. We ordered drinks and told him to come back so we could read over the menu and choose new items. As time went on and on he seemed to really neglect
Our table. Knowing my mom ordered a small salad for her meal. He did not bring Bread to our table at all, when he knew we were very hungry as we stated we wanted our bacon our first. At every other table he served them their bread on their plates? When we asked at the very end of our meal he said oh I thought someone brought you some....? Okay. Then we had to ask where our wine and sangria was 3 times. It never came out until AFTER our meal came out then his excuse for that was oh the bar is really busy, even the manager is there. Okay so your manager is okay with drinks taking 20 minutes and not even being sorry when you have
Open tables? Not acceptable for drinks that cost $13.. then whatever we would ask he would \"forget\" or not acknowledge. My mom asked for pepper and I wanted some syrup. Did he bring them? No. We had to flag another Waiter down get them after not eating our food and waiting for him to bring it. He did not have an obsured amount of tables but he seemed to be served everyone else everything else they wanted but us. He knew this was our first time here and that we were Sykes to try it as I picked this from many many restaurants for us to eat at. The only good thing about this place was the food. It was very tasty and all was served very fresh. The avacado toast was sooo fresh. It tasted like the avacado had just been mashed up. The sausage was really good. The bacon was good but I honestly expected more flavor but still it's bacon so it was good. 
The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. It wasn't just not clean the door and walls had stuff all Over them. It's not appetizing to go to the restroom at a mildly pricey restaurant to a nasty bathroom. It makes me think bad things about the kitchen. The food and hostess earned the 3 stars on this review other than that go somewhere else... server was Davis. He really did deceive us from the start :("}
{"text":"Was such a great find in a fun area of Toronto.  We were in the area to go to the Royal Ontario Museum and this spot was just around the corner.  Had a delightful white sangria that was full of fruit and oh so tasty.  My husband had a burger and enjoyed it.  I Had the foccacia bread with mushrooms, melted brie and arugula!  It was one of the best lunches I had in Toronto.  Would highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for the Summerlicious Pre Fix. I started with the Grilled Green Tomatoes topped with F'ior di latte. Lack lustre. Instead of two 3/4\" slabs of tomato, I would've preferred four slim, classy pieces. Sadly, the F'ior di latte was over-cooked, rubbery. This type of cheese is best served at room temperature. To kick it up a notch, this dish could use a balsamic reduction and garnish of basil.
Next was the Nine-Spice Chicken Breast. The skin wasn't crispy enough to eat, but the chicken was tasty and moist. 
My dessert of Profiterole was light and summery, but would be much improved with fresh raspberries in place of the jam-like centre. 
All said, nice atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"My GF and I had dinner there last week. I had salmon which tasted nothing like good salmon. Well, it didn't really taste like anything. Very plain. I cannot be 100% sure as I usually dont have frozen salmon, but for some reason I think it exactly what it was.

My GF had a pasta with shrimp. It wasnt bad, but wasnt great either. Very average, something you could easily make at home.

Overall, I dont know what I expected, but 3 is the maximum i can give to this place. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Went there on a date on a Saturday night
- service level - excellent
- ambience - excellent - they had piano playing and it was very romantic - a good place to chat, relax, and enjoy your meal
- food - very good in my opinion - i think they taste even better with the soft piano music in the background, which i really loved... 
- price point - ok for the portion, quality, and ambience

I really liked the color scheme, and decor in there - very stylish! I find it modern and calming. I would certainly recommend this place for special occasions or a get together with friends to splurge and relax for a meal out. I would go back there for sure."}
{"text":"love the atmosphere -- maybe it was the waterfall wall ?? maybe it was the high ceiling and the beam of the sunlight coming through and warming up the whole 2 floors of the restaurant ? maybe it was the idea of a baby grand piano in the main floor?? 

overall --- i always enjoy my summerlicious/ winterlicious moments here .. Yellow roof house stands out in the lovely area of Yorkville. 

FOod is good , but I can't say AMAZING (maybe i need to come here for regular menu instead of always getting the fixed resturant week menus)... but I love this place for a date night or an evening with friends."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious. The restaurant was very cute; painted a soft yellow, the building really stood out amongst the neighbouring brick walls. Inside, the decor was minimalist and clean. At night, the restaurant feels very cozy and intimate because of the dim candle lighting. The restaurant is separated into 2 sides; the side where the entrance is houses the bar, so this section is a bit noisier with the increased foot traffic and louder music. The other side however, is much more calm. 

I had the grilled calamari to start. There were 4 or 5 pieces on my plate, so I thought it was a pretty decent portion. The calamari was tender, and seasoned very well; I was almost embarrassed at how fast it flew off my plate (and into my tummy). 

For my entree, I had the seared diver scallops. The scallops (3) were seared perfectly; they had great colour and weren't rubbery at all. I also really enjoyed the other elements in the dish despite not knowing what the hell I was eating (the online Summerlicious menu doesn't seem to match what I had last night). The mystery broth was delicious, the lentil/rice/grains in it was equally delicious, and the tiny, crunchy baby asparagus-like things added some texture and colour. Dessert was alright; I had the chocolate torte. It was dense and rich. Nothing to write home about. 

The service was A++. My boyfriend reserved a table online and made a request for the \"most romantic table in the restaurant\" and they definitely delivered; they gave us one of two corner booths at the back of the restaurant under the garden wall/waterfall. Definitely romantic. The wait staff were efficient and courteous and provided excellent service. 

I will most likely come back for their regular menu."}
{"text":"Sassafraz is definitely one of Yorkville's hot spot ! This chic, convivial and the quality of food and drinks is superb ! 

I've been there several times for a whole range of occasion from my Father's 50 birthday, having brunch with friends, diner with my boyfriend, tea with my grandma and professional meetings and even alone with a good book.

Let's start by ambiance and decor. Sassafraz is divided into two parts: the restaurant and the bar/ bistrot: the S-café.
The restaurant is just magnificent ! There is a waterfall wall, a green wall and a glass roof ! This is luminous, warm and intimate at the same time. There is also a contemporary \"cave à vins\". This a pearl in the heart of the city ! 
The S-café is cosy, this reminds me of the chic of the French cafés mixed this edginess.This is simple, elegant and casual \"du bon goût à l'état pur\". 

Food wise now... I went to the restaurant during Winterlicious festival and I had such a great experience. I had fois gras as a starter. It was delicious, not too salty, smooth but ferm, not to much Cognac, just the way it is supposed to be ! Then I had \"Ricotta and basilic Ravioles\", the sauce was stunning and for dessert I had a chocolate and passion fruit fondant which was really good but a bit too cold. 

At the S-café they definitely have Toronto's best fries ! They're crispy, tender and they add garlic and herbs on it! Once you order one, you order three ! 

The choice of liquor is also superb ! They have a broad variety of Macallen whiskies and scotch. The cocktails are beautiful cocktails too like the Strawberry margarita, the Lady Marmalade or the French Martini !

My least satisfying experience at Sassafraz was on a Sunday brunch. It was good but not exceptional.

In a word, Sassafraz is for sure one of the classiest place of Toronto. It does worth the price and this appropriate for a large range of occasions !"}
{"text":"Great local place, attentive staff, but a bit pricey I will say. 

My wife had the BLT, while I had the burger, and both were very good.   She had the white sangria and I had the seasonal brew (stout) and both were good.   Despite the prices, well worthy of returning in the future."}
{"text":"The food is just average, but other than that I would give them 5 stars for service, location and atmosphere, etc. One thing I don't like about is the dog policy. They allow dogs on the patio and I'm totally fine with that, but I'm not fine with the dog owners who give their dogs food and leave a mess under the tables. My bf and I went there on a Sunday for dinner and a couple were sitting at the table right beside us. The girl kept giving the dog food and she left such a mess on the ground and that wasn't pleasant for our dining experience. We paid over $150 and I expected to dine in a clean place."}
{"text":"I am bored at work today so I decided to write some reviews.

I have been to Sassafraz over a 100 times over the past 10 years.

I've had some crazy moments in that place. Anyways, I don't go anymore. Ever since it burned down last time, I don't find it enjoyable. Primarily, I don't like their food anymore. They had amazing dishes before. Now the menu is not that good. I am glad they do live music again, because before the piano was in the dining room. Nonetheless, I find the bar area not as comfortable as it was before.

Their cocktails are great. I can't complain about that.

I believe Zoran is still the owner. Zoran, if you are reading this, get a new a menu. Otherwise, there are better places to go (i.e. Four Seasons)."}

Went back for the third time in December. I notice the menu has changed. 
Ambience was as I remember, romantic enough for a dinner date and buzzing with conversation. Waiters were busy, but tend to your needs.
Ordered the Ontario Lamb Meatball and Veal Chop, however the taste was not up to par,lacking in flavor. I was seated at the back against the very high booth against the back wall, but I was freezing the entire time."}
{"text":"The service was great, the servers were courteous and attentive.

I had the kale salad, oysters, and pork belly to start. There wasn't much kale in the salad, but the greens were fresh and the poached pears were perfect. The pork belly was crispy and tender on the inside, the sauce is what won me over for this dish. The oysters were fresh and clean. 

For the main course, I had the Itsumo Tuna. The tuna itself was sashimi-grade cooked perfectly and and the Sriracha emulsion complimented the food quite well and did not overpower the tuna. 

Aside from the one random fruit fly that kept disrupting my partner while eating, the facilities were clean and well-kept. 

The dining room is beautiful and well lit. Nothing is gaudy and I love the wine room. The music in the cocktail lounge was great and wasn't too loud. 

Food: 8/10

{"text":"I was in Toronto in time for Summerlicious.  Arranged a date with my sisters for lunch here and luckily I was with good company because food was just meh.  

Now why am I compelled to write a review about it?  Because if this is one of the better establishments in Toronto's restaurant industry, then I'm worried. I hear about Sassafraz all the time, with all the celebrities checking in, but I don't think it's the best representation of Toronto's dining scene.  It's got a cool vibe (+1 star), the location is great (+1 star), and the staff was friendly and accommodating (+1 star... at least they were to us that day -- it was the first day of Summerlicious and the restaurant wasn't busy)...  But the food just didn't blow me away.  I know it's the Summerlicious menu, but if you want people to come back, then present them with your best meal -- discounted price or not."}
{"text":"What could be better then a Caprese salad then a Caprese salad in an omelet. Seriously delicious. Light and fluffy and oozing with the perfect balance of buffalo mozzarella and fresh tomatoes -- even a bit of prosciutto. Worthy trying too is the Belair Breakfast: scrambled eggs with sharp Canadian cheddar, fried potatoes that put Tater Tots to shame and spiced sausage.  A totally leisurely let-the-day slip away brunch drinking Prosecco, people watching on trendy Cumberland street."}
{"text":"Horribly bad experience!!

I was part of the dinner party of 15 people for Summerlicious.  I won't go into all the gory details (just read down...there are at least 3 other reviews from people who I was with...yes, it was THAT BAD!!)
I will say that Sassafraz is a pretentious, over-rated restaurant with EXTREMELY poor service, mediocre food with arrogant stupid names that make boring meals sound exciting....until you see what arrives.
This was my first (and probably last) time out for a Summerlicious dinner.  I was always under the impression that the point of this city-wide event was to entice people who don't normally frequent these restaurants, to partake in their food and fare and hopefully return after Summerlicious is over.  I can honestly say that Sassafraz clearly missed that memo.  They had no shame in telling us (not in so many words) that they treat the Summerlicious crowd differently than their regular patrons.  I understand that this practice is probably not uncommon, but it doesn't make it acceptable. 
This experience has sadly tainted my impression of Sassafraz and any other establishment that feels it's ok to treat clientele like second class citizens."}
{"text":"A really cool place, we went there around 4 so they did not have their dinner menu yet. We decided to just get drinks with a charcuterie. Everything was great, the only start missing is the fact that I order the badass mojito but got a classic mojito, also i found the brazilian to be really strong not my taste but definitely someone else's."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect! What a great way to spend the first night of my first visit to Toronto. Talked to some locals. Server was a perfectionist. He made the experience fantabulous. Apparently Howie Mandel walked by a couple times. I saw the back of his head both times. Perfect location, great vibe. We sat outside, but when I used the perfectly decorated restroom, I discovered the piano bar inside!  We ordered the trio creme brulee, red wine and a latte. It was amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I respectfully disagree with my fellow Yelpers..

To be fair, Sassafraz has much reputation already, and most either love it, or hate it. I mean the bloody place burnt to the ground a few summers ago (mafia?)..

I came to the re-opening with an open mind, expecting the bad reputation of this being a pretentious, yuppie hangout to be swept away with those ashes. I was disappointed. My server continuously made me feel like an amateur in regards to the menu, especially the wine list. He also tried to up-sell me from my $130 bottle budget to a $300 bottle, thus making me look like el-cheapo in front of m'lady. Not cool.

The dining room had hospital-bright white lighting and decor, the dishes were so precious I laughed a little and the prices exorbitant. 

I recently received a $100 gift card (aka 'Drop-In-Pond), so I look forward to my second visit. Most folks seem to enjoy Sass for an after-work drink, cocktail hour, or dessert option, so perhaps that's the way to go.

Sometimes I wish I lived during the Yorkville Hippie Movement. Sigh."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but for a restaurant in the heart of Yorkville this restaurant has totally gone down hill .
The prices are to what to expect in Yorkville but the food was terrible , I actually felt bad that they killed the lobster to create such a terrible non tasty dish. Service was below average and it looked like they was a shortage in experienced help ."}
{"text":"3.5/5
Sassafras is one of the old establishment that's still surviving in the heart of Yorkville.

I am a long time customer of this place due to the location, and I can confidently say their food is just A Ok. Have too many up and down days. Seems like they are doing many changes to bring younger clientele and it definitely uped their food game but we will see whether it's going to last for long or not.

However, as a bar, they are pretty good. They have decent collection of wine and good cocktails. 

They also have the most classy chill vibe around the neighbourhood. Despite of the all the recent changes, clientele of the place is still more on mature side. So it's a perfect place to do wine with ladies or mom & aunts. 

Is this place worth making a trip? No. 
Good place to bring a date? If you are 20s, no. If you are mid 30 plus, yes. 
Will I go back? As long as my friend is working at the bar, I will."}
{"text":"Got a groupon to this place:

The good:
Amazing decor, really nice and you can actually talk to the person in front of you. 

Food -  it was a set menu(since we brought a groupon) and this is what we had:
Appetizers:
Pumpkin spice soup - Creamy and warm
Buffalo mozzarella & Tomatoes - This was amazing. The cheese of such high quality, definitely get this plate
Mains:
Herb Roasted Cornish Hen - The chicken was small, but made up for it with the sauce and the marinate. The sourdough side that comes with it was delicious. Great quality
Pacific Halibut - Tender piece of white fish. It was very nice and you can tell again that the quality is there
Dessert:
Maple Beignets - 3 small doughnuts that were a bit stale I felt, not as I would have expected. The sauce was nice
Eclair trio - 3 small finger size pieces. Really good, but do not expect a large portion. Quality over quantity here, so make sure you take small bites to enjoy the taste. 

The bad:
Since we were on a groupon, I felt the service was not up to par as if we just dined without one. Also when I called to make reservations, they had told me how busy they were, we arrived earlier then our time and the restaurant was half empty. Seems they just didn't want to take too many reservations for the groupon customers so that they could save that for walk in(people that pay much more). I don't think the service was great at all. The amount of time we had to wait for our waiter to ask us about our drinks took too long. Also the amount of time we had to wait for our bill was not great. 

I am giving this 3 stars(great food, service not so great)"}
{"text":"Amazing food here. Sometimes the pricier places in Yorkville don't hold up in quality, but Sassafraz really delivers. I have enjoyed all of my meals here."}
{"text":"Summerlicious is always a gamble, and today's dinner at Sassafraz was unfortunately only average. I started with the buffalo mozzarella with fig, which was oddly paired with pomegranate seeds and mango sauce. It was only okay (for good mozzarella I would go to Scaddabush!). For my main I had the duck breast as recommended by the server, and this was good but not mind-blowing. The last bite of my dish had that melt-in-your-mouth rendered fat, but the other pieces were actually a bit tough and lacking in flavour. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse which was definitely the best part of the meal, but again not particularly impressive. I would say that the best thing about Sassafraz is the ambiance. It is a beautiful sunflower yellow building on a prime corner of Yorkville - a place to dress up and be seen, and maybe to spot a celebrity, but not a place for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"It was our friend's birthday dinner. She decided summerlicious & it was wonderful. Service was superb and food tasted amazing. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant by chance while walking around the area and decided to have lunch there with my husband.

Their french lentils dish is a completely must. They're the best I've ever had. The puff pastry they serve with it was absolutely done to perfection (I'm a pastry chef, so I can tell :) ) and the kale was crunchy in the way I like.
Service was friendly, efficient and the place is very accessible if you don't have a car (it's a couple of steps out of Bay Station).
You won't find a bunch of options there (at least not in lunch time), but I'm pretty sure you cannot go wrong with anything you order.
Food is not cheap, though, but I've been to some other places downtown who charge as much and aren't as tasty.

It's definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

I've been wanting to try this place for years.  But the price always deterred me.  But then I saw the Groupon for this place and I decided that this would be the best time to check it out.  My friend and I decided to go on a Sunday - we thought it wouldn't be as busy as a Friday or Saturday night and we were right - the restaurant was just slightly less than half full.  The front  of the restaurant is more suited for drinks/lounging and it is beautiful - dark woods, white comfy couches all bathed in candlelight definitely make it a romantic spot.  

The sit down restaurant is to the sife and it's gorgeous as well - light tones, serene.  The groupon allowed us to try 2 apps, 2 mains and 2 desserts.  They even had a special Groupon menu so we could choose appropriately (the Groupon limited some of the choices from the regular menu but I would say about 85% of it was the same, however this was nice to avoid any extra charges unknowingly). 

I ordered the lobster bites for my apps - overall I liked it however I wish the lobster was a bit colder and it didn't come with this big dollop of cream on it.  But it was a nice start to the main.  My main was the BC Sturgeon with black quinoa  and some turnips and shaved fennel.  I really enjoyed this dish - I just wish there was more of it!  The fish was nicely cooked and it paired well with the flavours of fennel and turnips.  I'm a tiny person and I can say that it's a small portion.  For me it's ok but for a larger person I can see how they would be hungry afterwards.

Dessert was the roasted cherry cheesecake with toasted crumble and cherry sorbet.  I'm picky with cheesecake and I found this was light and delightful - not like a typical heavy cheesecake...in fact if you didn't tell me the name of this dish I would not have guessed it was cheesecake. The sorbet provided a nice and fresh contrast to the cheesecake.  I really liked the hint of sweetness this provided at the end of the meal.

My friend had the pork belly for her app which she liked and decided to try the mac/cheese with chorizio for her main.  The mac/cheese looked bland and unfortunately tasted bland - no flavour/spice could either of us detect.  Even salt/pepper would have livened it up.  We had assumed that maybe the sausage would be incorporated into the dish however we were wrong.  It come out with 2 pieces of sausage on the side....these long pieces of meat...just sitting there.  It was odd to say the least.

Service was ok - everyone was nice per say...they just all looked bored or indifferent to working there.  I felt awkward - this is supposed to be a \"nice\" restaurant and I would have thought I would have gotten better service, considering the price.  

Overall I am glad I had the opportunity to check it out as I did enjoy my meal but I doubt I would head back - maybe for a summerlicious meal....but I would not pay full price for the portions.

Located in YorKville there is plenty of street parking and a few underground lots down the street.  In the summer they have the patio open so you can enjoy brunch in the sun."}
{"text":"Not having the luxury (finances!) of taking restaurants of this ILK for granted, I've enjoyed a couple visits to Sassafraz.. Ultimately it's pricey (for me it is; middle class), if you don't mind dropping a 100 or so for dinner.... and then eating a couple hours later due to very small portions!  Get into drinks, etc.. not ordering from the Winterlicious type menus; very expensive."}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't choose to go to a place such as Sassafraz. I prefer a down-to-earth place where the waitresses call you honey and everything can be made into a combo. Sassafraz offers neither of those things, obviously. The food is delicious, if a touch precious. Any normal-sized person will have trouble getting full here, though they will enjoy the taste of the food and the great wine selection. The sidewalk patio is lovely, though if you're paying attention you'll make eye contact with everyone going by who thinks you might be a celebrity (I don't dissuade them of this notion). The menu is well laid out, and you won't be overwhelmed with choice, which I like. The staff is beautiful and highly attentive. It's a good place for a business lunch, especially if you want a quieter table to close a deal. My guest and I had a salad with a piece of salmon and a chicken dish with potatoes, coffee and mineral water--about $75 with tax and tip. With wine our lunch would've been over $100."}
{"text":"You have no idea how excited I was when I saw the Groupon for Sassafraz come out! Any opportunity to save... I'm there :) For 3 courses, I bought a groupon for 4 people totalling $26 per person.... that's a great deal. Even winterlicious doesn't offer a meal at that price.

When we arrived, we already had groupon menus waiting at our table (we had to specify when we reserved). We requested to move because we were originally seated by the drafty door, but they gladly obliged. The options for the three courses were the same offerings on their menu. The waiter was courteous and water glasses were filled promptly. The restaurant manager did not waste anytime collecting my groupon code (understandable).

I ordered the beet salad, while others ordered the pate, soup, and spinach salad. All plates were beautifully presented, flavours seemed to meet everyone's palettes, soup was tasty, and the spinach salad (although looked bland), had loads of flavour... mysteriously tasty!

For the main course, the ladies ordered the striped bass with little pastas (i forgot the name), and kale, while the gentleman didn't think twice about the 10oz steak, that came with the option of 1 side. Two large pieces of bass presented itself on the bed of vegetables and pasta. It was cooked beautifully, not too done and flaky in texture. Each bite was delicate, but still full of substance. The steak although slightly done was very tasty in each of the guy's minds (my friend has lived in London for the last year and a half and missed a REAL cut of beef)!

For dessert, we were intrigued by the trio of creme brulee - white chocolate, peppermint, and maple sugar. It was mainly the garnish that changed the overall flavour. A chocolate cookie to top one, candycane shavings on another. The maple sugar, however seemed to be infused into the dessert, which had a nice sweetness overall. The other dessert was the Churros - thick, fat pieces of deep fried sugarred dough with two dipping sauces. A large portion, I must say... a little overload. It was tasty, but too much for one person to consume.

I have no complaints about the food throughout the night. Service was so-so but I cared more about the company. The reason I took away one star was because the bill was brought to our table after we declined any coffee. I felt like the restaurant was rushing us to leave. If they have notified me that I had a two hour window, I would understand given the time frame... however, any conversation we were having felt like it had to stop.... I would prefer not to have a bill waiting for my attention. especially when I didn't ask for it."}
{"text":"Attended a private party of 75 people.Great vibe,Great space.
Not a fan of the food.
Restaurant lives by its location and decor."}
{"text":"Great ambience and amazing food ! Went with my friend for summerlicious lunch. Ordered scallops, beef short ribs and chocolate torte. The scallops were perfectly cooked with chorizo. There is a slight kick to this appetizer. The beef was so tender and flavorful. I would highly recommend trying this restaurant for summerlicious. Our sever was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Great venue in a really nice street in Toronto.  The ambience, the interior, the lighting all points to an expected great experience in food.  Then comes the menu - a little bit on the uninspired category.  But we trudge on still glass half full kind of mindset.  The Tamato Gazpacho was to be shared by both CB and me but they only bring the one bowl.  We had to send it back to be split into two bowls.  Never mind the snafu - the gazpacho was quite good.  Now for the main course I had the dish with Bison sautéed veggies, candied carrots and mustard - nothing came together but the candied carrots was delicious.  CB had the tenderloin with smoked potatoes - the dish was Vapid - medium came medium well and had an overwhelming smoky flavor, the collards was too crunchy, and the asparagus was cooked well - all in all still vapid...  Finally we had the beignets and well I was not expecting New Orleans style, but it did not blow us away.

Our waitress was awesome though, kept a close watch on her tables, always had a smile on her face, got CB a good wine for dinner and all in all top notch.  

The three stars here is for the wait staff and the ambience and maybe the gazpacho."}
{"text":"We arrived for our reservation at 7pm on a Friday night and took a gamble at the Groupon that we found for this place (3 course meal for two for $64.99). The first thing that I noticed was that the ambiance of this place was very classy, modern and intimate. Noise level is low to average, at a table of two, it wasn't too difficult to hear from across the table.

The food wasn't anything wild. For portion size it was average...
I ordered the tomato and mozzarella, mac 'n' cheese, maple beignets. 

The tomato and mozzarella was pretty good. It came with tomatoes and green peppers, a bit of cheese, and spinach coated in dressing. I'm not usually a fan of raw spinach, but I really liked how it was used to compliment this dish. In the dressing, which I want to say was balsamic vin., it was pretty good. I think they put a bit too much dressing on - at one point toward the end of the dish, I coughed a bit...good, but overwhelming taste. The mac 'n' cheese was fairly good as well. Portion size a little bigger than most places that serve mac 'n' cheese. The maples beignets was a mild, but sweet taste to it - good for those who don't enjoy overly sweet treats. 

My boyfriend ordered beef tartar (?), pumpkin gnocchi and eclairs.
I tried all of them - don't really have much to say about them by comparison to my dishes. The pumpkin gnocchi, however, was a nice and original taste to it - definitely worth trying.

We were completely served and billed within about an hour and a bit. I was pleasantly surprised considering the restaurant was very busy. My advice is to make a reservation, or you may be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"We came here for a company lunch and they were great with accommodating a larger group (around 10 people). Service was attentive and I was impressed by the decor. The restaurant had been renovated and looks really modern and classy now. I got the Cote D'Or salmon and the chocolate bar for dessert after. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the soba under it complemented it really well. The chocolate bar while rich was a good finish to the meal."}
{"text":"For a lunch that spanned 2.5 hours I expected a little more. Mind you this was for Winterlicious and there's always a stigma that because of this said event, we are to expect less as guests. Well, if less is what you can deliver then why not just don't participate? Anyhow, it's a discussion for another day, another time.

I can sum up my experience at Sassafraz as underwhelming; food and service. I do applaud them for a fantastic varied menu all at an amazing price considering we are in Yorkville. I am going to start with a few things I thought were good. The pork chop was nicely done; tender but could use a bit more flavour (though the sauce was nice, it was a little one dimensional and sweet). The fresh loaf of warm bread was a very nice way to get the meal started. I always appreciate warm bread. As for the rest of the menu, well it ranged anything from average to not so great but they all had one common trait; a little bland and a little overcooked. My chicken breast was quite well-done and a tad too stringy but where it's lacking is flavour and a skin to be remembered. I couldn't tell the difference if this was 9 spice or 2 (salt & pepper). My fregola was very al dente, almost raw but charred. It added a little too much chewing and texture to the dish and I would imagine most probably had a difficult timing eating this stuff. Next we have the bison pappardelle where the bison had a lot left to be desired. A little dry, very bland and exceptionally stringy. I have to say this dish was a little amateur in it's execution. It was a sad dish to look at and taste. Last but not least the salmon and I don't have to convince you that it's bland. Though it was somehow tender unlike the former two dishes.

The dessert was well executed and not exactly too memorable. The space is quite nice, classy, clean and comfortable. As I had mentioned, our lunch took over 2.5 hours so I don't think I need to comment on the service, it's pretty self explanatory.

All in all a pretty forgettable meal and experience."}
{"text":"I remember many years ago in Summer, Sassafras offered Live Jazz.
I was in the corner of the Restaurant patio and listened the beautiful piano and stunning looking Jazz singer's song. This restaurant was always special for me and I haven't been there since I moved away from this area.
I decided to bring my daughter and it's perfect location after shopping and long day.
Restaurant was changed, but still beautiful and elegant. I love their wall decor with green.
This restaurant can be pricey but you would enjoy every bite.
I had Nova Scotia lobster and my daughter had Baby spinach and Kale Salad.
My lobster was good but I wish there's more lobster or more portion, Salad was great. I loved dressing. My steak was perfect and server was very attentive.
We will be back in Summer next time"}
{"text":"I went there with my husband for supper with a Groupon three-course coupon for two. We were seated very close to a door which opens to some place, (kitchen I guess), on the way of the servers. I was not happy with it at all, and the whole time, I felt uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it had any thing to do with the fact that we were Groupon customers. 
Our server was very nice though, greeting us friendly and very helpful in giving us tips about the menu. 
The food was Ok. I didn't like our appetizers, specially the poutine, but I enjoyed the main dishes. The most delicious course was doubtlessly the dessert; the  chocolate cake was dense and rich and the cheesecake was perfectly creamy and flavourful. 
I would have given it four starts for the service and food, but since I was not happy with our seats, I give it three."}
{"text":"Every birthday my family takes me here because it's one of my favourites. My only complaint would be that some menu items are extremely overpriced. However if you want melt in your mouth kind of food you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"If you're into overpriced food and poor service during winter/summerlicious this is the spot. They are overplayed and need a refresh. Food quality and portion is fair, needs update to be more welcoming. 

3.25/5*"}
{"text":"Service:  A server came to give us bread 10 mins after we sat down but we had to wait another 10 mins before our server asked us which water we wanted. I felt so ignored, generally the service level was disappointing especially for a restaurant of this class.

Food: the pasta, couscous and steak were all average. Salmon was nicely cooked but crust was slightly too salty. 

Interior: very nice, French style with a waterfall. The best part was the environment; food was average and service was a letdown."}
{"text":"A solid choice for anyone dining in the yorkville area. Got the 3 course lunch for $30+ and it was great. Service was attentive and server made sure our drinks were refilled"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service.  A bit overpriced though.  I had the SUMMERLICIOUS menu which was similar to their regular one but with fewer choices. 

The grilled calamari was excellent, the grapefruit being an original addition and going well with the tangy green salsa, but there were only three (3) pieces of squid on the plate. The local beef sirloin was also great (I had it medium, and it was around 10oz), but nothing out of the ordinary which makes one wonder why it's almost $40 on their regular menu.  

The chocolate torte at the end was a disappointment. It was dry and stale and the raspberry caviar was replaced with jelly which had the consistency of the one you are buying for thanksgiving. Not cool for a $45 (top tier) summerlicious dinner selection.  

Overall, not bad for SUMMERLICIOUS deal, but I'd never pay their full prices for this level of quality and creativity.  I guess the Bay St. vicinity has an automagical influence on inflating prices without corresponding to actual quality and creativity."}
{"text":"\"same review as Mei. L\" except cheesecake instead of beignets \"

Seriously. User Mei. L wrote the exact review I was going to write. Very good food for a Groupon and would go back again with another Groupon. Service was done very we by the same server. Was happy to eat here. I've been here for a few events and was always impressed and this time was no exception.

Very happy with all items, all cooked well and presented nicely. 

The wine at $40 is a great value too."}
{"text":"Popular brunch spot and Toronto's posh Yorkville neighbourhood. Decor is classy, and the atmosphere feels very fresh once you get inside. My friend and I arrived at the peak of Saturday brunch time, so there weren't any tables available. We were sat at the bar, which was fine. 

We shared a Toasted French Baguette with truffle butter and mixed mushrooms, and an Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The food was pretty good. The baguette smelled strongly of truffles, but it definitely smelled stronger than it tasted. Was hard to taste any truffle at all once you bite into the baguette. The mushroom mix on top was very flavourful though and made up for the lack in truffle taste. Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly. The yolk oozed out over the plate once you cut into it. I especially appreciated the root vegetables served with the dish. It's a bit different from other eggs benny dishes. Both dishes came with a side salad, which added some nice freshness. 

Service was quite slow, but they were very busy that day, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Would probably come more often if it wasn't so expensive."}
{"text":"Sassafraz seemed to be the most inviting place in Yorkville while showing an out of town friend around the city. We were not disappointed.

We sat on the patio for a late lunch and the atmosphere was very charming, kinda European. The service and food were excellent!

I had the S Cafe burger which was so tender and juicy, I had to use a knife and fork. That's not a bad thing. My friend had the asparagus and broccolini quiche and said it tasted every bit as good as it looked. See photos.

Sassafraz is definitely on my list of places to entertain friends!."}
{"text":"We use to come here a lot, but sadly the quality of the food seems to be getting worse. Ordered the Tenderloin and it was over cooked, sent it back and it came back pretty much the same. The meat was very tough, which was odd for a tenderloin. The potatoes were so hard it was almost impossible to chew. 

Usually when a restaurant messes up your meal (I pretty much ate my meal after everyone at my table had finished theirs) they try to make it up. This restaurant or management didn't do a thing about it - very poor service!

It gets 2 stars for its ambience and it's relatively easy to get reservations (but that should say something in and of itself...)"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Yorkville. They have the best burgers ever and the service is always good."}
{"text":"We went to this Toronto hotspot for dinner on a Saturday night courtesy of Groupon. We had made reservations and were seated promptly in the cafe side of the restaurant, where the piano is. Our server, Courtney, was great; she was patient, sincerely friendly and very nice. I tasted everything that we ordered from appetizers to desserts and it was all delicious. Everyone was pleased with their meals. The portion sizes were great and they were generous with the toasty warm bread and soft, room temp butter too. I liked that when we asked for water they didn't push various types of bottled on us. They were organized when it came to redeeming the Groupon and the Groupon menu was really good. Our only complaint was that it took a really long time for the food to come out. Our server compensated us for that by taking the coffees off of our bill without us even asking. The upside was that we got to hear John Roby tickle the ivories around 9:00pm, which was a pleasantly unexpected surprise. No restaurant is perfect on every single night so overall I would rate our experience a solid 4. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because the regular prices are quite high (for example 6oz glass of Gewürztraminer $16) but it is Yorkville, so it comes with the territory. Oh! I almost forgot, it was my mom's birthday so the chef was thoughtful enough to write happy birthday on her dessert dish."}
{"text":"Mistake #1: I really wish I had taken a look at the reviews before coming here ... 

Mistake #2: Coming during Summerlicious.

To be fair, my eating partner is working at a participating restaurant during Summerlicious so he really wanted to try out a restaurant. The only day he had off was Sunday .. and one of the only seemingly-decent opened ones was Sassafraz. So we ended up here by process of elimination. 

Why the 2 stars? The food was underwhelmingly mediocre. Despite it being a $25/$45 menu, they really set a precedent by serving such disappointing food! 

Also, the service was not satisfactory. We were seated a full 15 minutes before anybody came to our table to take orders. And after clearing each plate, they took a full 20 minutes between courses. We sat there for a minimum of an HOUR without anything on our tables! It was ridiculous. 

The server apologized by saying they were slammed in the kitchen, but we were seated at 1:30pm (final seating for lunch) and we ended being one of the only tables outside. So in reality, i think they just forgot about us. It really detracts from the dining experience. 

The food: the starter, a lobster-potatoe-y soup was delicious. There is exactly one little parcel of lobster in the soup. 

The main: he had the pork tenderloin doused with a pumpkin-orangey puree. No other sauce. The meat was of great quality but the puree was super bland and definitely not strong enough to accompany the pork on its own. I had the grilled salmon over a bed of orzo and some dry beans. Again, no sauce. The salmon tasted like it was cooked a few hours ago and then microwaved before coming to me. Definitely not appetizing. 

Finally, the dessert. I don't understand WHY it took them 20+ minutes to bring this out (after clearing the last plate). He had a slice of cheese with some dry fruit. I had a chocolate brownie. It was ok. 

Such a disappointment! I've always heard of the distaste for Summerlicious and now I finally understand why. 

Will not be coming back to Sassafraz."}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious lunch.  The server is very attentive and knew we were on a short lunch break.  Then again, the food came out very slow.  This might be more of the problem with the kitchen.  We waited probably 20 minutes for the first dish.  The first dish I ordered was Bay Scallops.  The scallops were overcooked with sands and did not tasted fresh.  Also I did not taste any chorizo.  The next course was the Braised Ontario Beef Short Ribs.  This dish was very good, the short ribs were cooked nicely and the sweetness of parsnip puree tasted very good together.  Also the sunchoke chips really added that crunch to the dish.  The last dish I had was the Chocolate Torte.  This dish was very rich in chocolate.  My dish lack a bit of the sauce which would have helped the balance the dark chocolate with the sweet white chocolate sauces.  This was a decent meal but not amazing."}
{"text":"Darling Restaurant that has been around for years! The ambiance is great. The service was just ok. I had to ask for my drink to be refilled, and she took a long time to come back with it. I ordered the burger and it was good! But tasted more like a meatball vs. a burger. It was well cooked and tender. The fries were homemade and very good! Overall nice experience. 3-Stars because service was just mediocre."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed the wine WAY more than the food. Was this meal worth the 100 I paid for?...ABSOLUTELY NOT. Although my waiter was friendly, the \"upsell\" was ridiculous. I've been here twice. I won't come here again. Bland was an understatement."}
{"text":"My main appeal for this place is the location and ambiance. Truly in the heart of Yorkville, Sassafraz is surrounded by trendy shops and restaurants in Toronto's most posh neighbourhood. 

We stopped in for some drinks and small bites on a Thursday night, taking a table up on the sidewalk patio. It was cozy and not busy - which was great. I assume that the happy hour / Thursday crowd likely had thinned out from earlier in the afternoon/evening already.

Service was a bit sparse at times, but the waiter was polite and attentive (when present).

I had a couple of the barrel aged vodka Manhattan (martinis) while she had the gimlet. We munched on an order of frites and baby kale and honeydew salad. Both tasted great.

All in all - a trendy place to hang out, people watch, and have a good time."}
{"text":"Great restaurant located in the heart of Yorkville. The interior is quite large and spacious so it's relatively easy to get a reservation or table even on a Saturday night. The ambience definitely elevates the experience, very modern and elegant. The back wall of the main dining area has a beautiful waterfall framed by plants and open light flowing through the  ceiling.

The staff is very professional although I find that they do try to upsell a fair bit - tried to recommend way more food than we could possibly finish. 

We got the 28oz Ontario beef rib steak to share between two people. The portion is huge, I think it could comfortably be split between two or three people. The steak was very tender and flavourful although not overpowering, would definitely recommend. It came with a large side of vegetables to share which paired nicely with the steak. 

Overall this is a great restaurant if you're looking to celebrate a special event or just want a nice night out."}
{"text":"On a cold and wet Easter Monday, my daughter asked to go for high tea. Of course it was too late to get a reservation so we decided to wander around Yorkville and roll the dice.

I had been to Sassafraz before for drinks and it was raining and so it's warm yellow exterior drew us in.

My daughter was drawn to the cozy sofas instantly and the warm sourdough loaf. It was quiet and cozy.

They were excellent with my daughter's egg allergy, splitting our buffalo mozzarella salad such that the fried tomato was only on my plate. I wished my daughter had noticed the grilled cheese had her hated goat cheese on it when she ordered - but she didn't so we took it to go. It may have been the best grilled cheese that I have ever tasted. The pickerel special was outstanding.

Service was very attentive. I dropped a knife and they brought me a replacement unasked instantly."}
{"text":"Came with a large group, and  had a private upstairs room. The decor downstairs is awesome, and the upstairs is a little bit of a let down after walking through the downstairs. It's still nice though, and you get a good view of two side streets, which is fun for people watching. 

The food was pretty good, though for the price I was expecting something a little more memorable, but that's probably because we had a fixed menu. I bet ordering off the real menu would make a big difference. The wine list is great.

The service was the best I've had in ages. It was service the way I wish all service was. 

Bottom line, go here, and for a group of 8-10, ask for the little balcony over looking the waterfall. So fun!"}
{"text":"Our group went on a weekend for the Summerlicious lunch menu; the atmosphere and the customer service was superb. Everyone was friendly and courteous.

I ordered the gazpacho, salmon and chocolate torte. I also ordered one of their non-alcoholic drinks, which was the tealicious.

Tomato Gazpacho - it has a really good texture, and the avocado mousse was very soft and balances with the flavour well. I just found the overall balance of the dish to be a bit too sour for my taste.

Canadian Atlantic Salmon - the salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned really well, I thought this was the best course of the meal. The accompanied vegetables were okay and fit with the Asian style of the dish.

Chocolate torte - the desert was really sweet, it was very rich and dense which was really nice. The cranberry caviar was phenomenal. If the desert was a little bit sweeter, I would've really enjoyed it.

Tealicious (drink) - I thought the drink had too much ice in it, so it watered down the flavours.

Overall, I thought the restaurant's atmosphere and customer service was top-notch. I thought there were some minor flaws with the dishes I ordered, but I will definitely go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Sassafraz for ages and I've been won over! To begin, the dining room is beautiful with the exposed high glass ceilings and waterfall wall. We ordered the duck pâté and lamb meatballs to start. I thought both appetizers were delicious but the lamb meatballs would be my pick out of the two. As a pasta lover, I really wanted to try the bison parpadelle (maybe next time for lunch,,,) However, I decided to try something new and I am happy to say that it worked out for the better! For the entree, I had the duck breast which was cooked perfectly and worked very well with the brussel sprouts and cauliflower in a delicious sauce. Everything was also plated beautifully which really adds to the experience. For dessert, we opted for the crowd favourite (banana tart) along with the chocolate cake. Honestly, after trying both the desserts, my boyfriend and I agreed that we should have each gotten a banana tart instead because it was that good! Overall, I had a great date night here and am thoroughly impressed that the dinner met all the expectations I had about Sassafraz."}
{"text":"I always end up at Sassafraz for lunch when I go shopping in Yorkville. Their menu is limited, but adequate. Service is always spectacular- even during Summerlicious!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a date night spot and you can anticipate shelling out more than just a couple bucks.

Like any great restaurant, your experience starts and ends with your server. Our server was an older gentleman with a warm grandfather type vibe. Friendly and hospitable, but limited in terms of recommendations for new comers. Either way, he was absolutely lovely.

The Mojito was fantastic. Would highly recommend.

Food wise, we started with a pistachio seared tuna salad that was delicious and fried chicken drums. A strange but delightful combo.

Mains were the rack of lamb and Ontario striploin, both ordered medium. Lamb was cooked to perfection and spiced very nicely. Unfortunately, steak arrived well done."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner before and it was average from what I remember. I've never been here for brunch so my friend and I decided to give it a try.

We both got a Cumberland detox drink - kale, cucumber and coconut water ($8). We were both sucked in by the name because we've never had any \"detox\" drinks before. We were also curious to try kale in our drinks. I expected the drink to be sweet and almost smoothie like. However, it was very liquid and salty, the opposite of everything I expected. It's like drinking soup with ice in it in a cup. It's possibly the worst drink I've ever had in my life.

My friend ordered an omelet - mushroom, asparagus and chevre with mixed greens ($17). I thought her omelet was done very well and they were generous with the cheese.

I ordered the Cumberland breakfast - scrambled eggs with chive, buttermilk pancake, lamb sausage, smoked bacon and potato chive croquettes ($19). The scrambled eggs was incredibly creamy and surprisingly, so was the potato chive croquettes. The smoked bacon was just like any other bacon you can at any restaurant. The lamb sausage was interesting because restaurants don't usually offer lamb sausage. The pancake was not the overly fluffy kind which both my friend and I prefer because we find the overly fluffy one just soaks in all the syrup and gets all mushy. This pancake had an odd sour taste to it though probably from the buttermilk.

One thing nice about this restaurant is that not only do they offer complimentary bread at the start but also a nice assortment of fruits. Their portion is reasonable compared to Le Select Bistro and their food tasted great compared to La Societe. This restaurant may become my new go to spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"You will feel delightful when realize how beautiful the inside is after entering the insignificant entry. My table was event facing a small artificial indoor wall of falling water, despite the little spraying. GREAT SERVICE, GOOD FOOD, even quiet surroundings gave me lots pleasure. In the end, extra chief chocolate was served! Nice place!"}
{"text":"Had a really good time the one time I came here. The food and wine were excellent. Definitely a classy place to have a meal for a special occasion... for me at least. I could also see this place being an excellent date place or restaurant to hold a business meeting or meal too.

I'm slightly ashamed I didn't get better photos because these ones definitely do not do it justice."}
{"text":"For some reason, i always remembered this restaurant as a fond memory back in 2001.  One of the best restaurants I've been to date, and I've been to many all over the world on expense accounts and out of my own pocket.  I even remember I paid about $70-80 for the dinner by myself on a weekday.  Was in Toronto on a business trip.  Service and food was the best, ambiance top notch.  Some celebs go here every now and then.  Some pro bball player was treating his entire extended family out to here the day I was there.  I just remember everything so nice and vividly still.  Beautiful hostesses here too.  But I was young, so maybe I was impressed more easily.  This place also turns into a nightclub late at night on weekends."}
{"text":"I had an incredible meal at this fine restaurant today. I'm in Toronto a couple of times and always manage to squeeze in one or two meals at Sassafraz. I was in town visiting a friend and had to stop by for lunch. I've had brunch, lunch and dinner here couple of times and everytime was just amazing. 

One of the great ideas they have is to not only serve bread & butter but also you get a small fruit platter before your meal. We had appetizers and oysters. For my main meal I had the French Onion Soup MINUS the crouton! Loooolz. The broth really had that caramelized onion taste that I love. F.O. soup and brie is my favorite! ;) ;) My friend ordered a Canadian riesling and the halibut with pureed potatoes, spinach, and portobello mushroom stems. I tasted the dish and it was awesome. A great blend of flavors and textures. The other time I was here, I ordered the grilled cheese and lobster, delicious! Although we didn't have dessert but I've tried some of their desserts before and they were really good. The food was DIVINE. So much so, I find myself looking for excuses to head back for another lunch in the next few days or so ha! It was so perfect, I would just have the same meal over again! I'd call the food modern French.

My only minor complaint was that they need a better selection of red wines considering they're a \"high end\" restaurant. I really loved that they had Pierre Juliet tho (my fav)- very good champagne from Paris almost as good as some California stuff. And speaking of wines... a little heads up, do NOT order a glass of Chardonnay. We saw the couple next to us how they sipped on their wine and my friend told them that Ontario isn't really famous for any good Chardonnay's and we gave them a glass from our bottle. The waitress agreed with us, I wished as a waitress she had given them a wine recommendation as they told her that they were new to Canada and Ontario. The waiters there are not very informative but friendly.

The environment is really great. A wonderful dining room and there are lots of nice quiet tables for 2 where you can sit next to each other, and it is also fun to sit in the piano bar and have a drink. Perfect place to relax with wine and dinner. It's a fun spot to stop if you are enjoying Yorkville. :)"}
{"text":"This is a limited review-I was here for an event and not for a meal.  Suppose I'll have to go back to eat.  The things I put myself through for Yelp!

My friend Susan and I were going to a work party that started at 7.30pm.  I'm not sure exactly what time we eventually tottered up to the door-maybe 8.30pm.  It had taken me way too long to do my hair and she had a wardrobe emergency.  I also still have a tendency to work on \"Irish time\" where 7.30pm means 9pm at the earliest.  Anyway, we entered and asked the maitre d where to go.  He beamed and started to lead us in the right direction-but also managed to tell us we were late in a semi-scolding manner.  I think he may have been joking?

The function room upstairs is medium-sized and airy.  Smiling staff came through offering hors d'oeuvres.  I wasn't that hungry but they were so friendly that it seemed rude to refuse.  They were very tasty!  I particularly liked the duck and pear.  Mmmm.  The bar staff were similarly lovely and incredibly patient with a crowd that rapidly became rather tipsy thanks to drinks vouchers.  They managed to keep beaming. I maintain that they were generous with their pours too.  I need to explain my dancing later in the night somehow! .

A nice plus was the huge TV on the wall which was set up for presentations-we got to see a movie that had been put together for the occasion.  The bathrooms were spotless and seemed to be only for the room.  There were no lines!

Based on this experience I will definitely be back to have a sit-down meal.  I'll be on time though!"}
{"text":"A perfect place for an extravagant date! My hubby booked it for my birthday night and I had an awesome birthday dinner, although the weather was pretty harsh. 
Lol, The restaurant is my new favourite in Toronto. The pricey one, but I found the prices justified, with the amazing experience I had. 
They worked well on their presentation of food as well as it's taste and the selection of menu!

Decor & Ambience- contemporary & romantic, privacy with a lot of sitting area and tables are quiet at a distance, so you get a privacy. Even with 75% of the room was full, It was quiet in there. Candles, waterfall, street view adds to the beauty of the place.

Service- super awesome/ delightful Mellisa (our server)- Not pushy or judgy, as other upscale restaurant's servers are. 

Menu- Innovative, every dish is worth a try! 

Location- just right at Bay station, have 2 nearby green P parking lots.

Reservations/ Walkins- smooth! But I would suggest having a reservation before you visit, we went on a weeknight ( Wednesday) and it was almost full. But there were many walk-ins, I saw. 

Food: 
I ordered veggie Red Thai Curry- OMG! Heavenly! Wh would know that the best Thai curry would be discovered at a Non-Thai restaurant. It was not the traditional Red Thai curry, but it was awesome. and red with Thai flavours so, no harm naming it as Thai :P
The hint of ginger drove me crazy! \"food orgasm\" that's what I call the experience :)
For starter I ordered the Red oak salad- They could have added more lotus stem chips :P, It was good, but I was not impressed until I had my curry! And now comes the dessert- we ordered 2- flourless brownie and coconut-banana tart.
Both we again delicious and so unique in flavour and so beautifully presented. 

Plus the complimentary bread and olive oil-balsamic were great too and they would keep refilling. 
The drinks were, however, expensive, for the choices that they had on the drinks menu. We ordered a red wine and white wine sangria both were pretty good, still, they can do a little better with the drinks choice and selection. 

P.S: I wanted to lick my plate!  I consumed every element from my dishes :P"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch should be special, classy and trendy. That's exactly what brunch at sassafraz entails. The lavish resturant is located in the heart of Yorkville, if you come here around TIFF you'll for sure see celebs dining. The ambience makes you feel like you're not dining in Toronto, rather a upscale resturant where you can forget your worries and pretend to be someone else for a meal. The plant wall and bright natural light is what draws me to the dining area. The food is great, on the lighter / healthier side and as expected the portions arent huge. They were sold out of the acai yogurt bowl which was a disappointment so I opted for the sourdough egg sandwich-- it was perfectly toasted and so flavorful. My friend got egg white chive fold over which didn't appeal to me but he enjoyed it. I SO impressed with their house bottomless coffee... it was delicious and you can telex freshly brewed. 

The only negative aspect I have is that the service was quite slow, we were seated and had to wait 15 minutes till someone acknowledged us to give us water. 

This isn't s cheap brunch spot but it is somewhere everyone should experience! 

Bon Appetité!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on the last day of Summerlicious. Although this restaurant is in Yorkville, I did not get any judgmental and pretentious vibe from waiters. 
The service was actually quite friendly for our large group of young adults.
The grilled octopus starter I would not bother trying again, but the pate was not only delicious but there was an entire bowl of it, enough to go around. Lamb meatballs were also cooked nicely.
Mains we tried were the tenderloin, duck breast and hen. All were equally excellent in terms of taste and presentation.
The only qualm I had with the meal was the dessert. None of the frozen yogurt, chocolate cake, or cheese plate were a satisfying end to the meal.
There were also 2 summerlicious drinks - sangria and iced tea. The sangria consisted of rose (i think), malibu rum, watermelon lemonade, and fruits - I thought the watermelon lemonade sounded refreshing but it just ended up tasting like a normal light sangria, although I wouldn't mind having a pitcher of it anyway."}
{"text":"If you're contemplating going to Sassafraz for Summerlicious, don't wait, run! We had their Summerlicious lunch menu, and it was my favourite Summerlicious meal!

I was with a couple friends so I had a chance to try a few different options. For appetizers, the blue crab salad was tasty, though a bit small. The lamb meatballs were also very tasty but a lot more filling. They also had a red pepper puree soup that I found very unique and delicious.

I tried the ceviche rice bowl and chicken mains. Both were beautifully plated, relatively filling, and delicious!

The chocolate cake may look like any ordinary mousse, but it was anything but. The mousse was rich and delicious, and it was complemented by a crunchy bottom layer and basil ice cream.

Plus, the service here was great and sitting on the sofas they have in the cafe was an enjoyable experience. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went with my husband and Mother to enjoy the Winterlicious menu for lunch today, and we had a great time. Service was prompt and great, but our server was just mediocre and was out shined by the wonderful support staff around her, who all made our meal much more enjoyable than her painfully put on pleasant airs. Food was delicious and portions are huge, but unfortunately, my chicken main course came out cold. I didn't want them to heat it up again because the chicken was cooked perfectly, and we had a time limit, so I didn't tell anyone, and that was that. I had their house made Gotham City Cheese for dessert, which is a must-have and my Mother's beignets weren't too sweet, which she loved! The cappuccinos and coffee are also delicious here (they use Lavazza) and the interior is beautiful, with many gorgeous paintings on the walls to admire, and wish you could purchase. Happy Monday, all!!"}
{"text":"They get props for having Badoit water. My favorite mineral water! I was with a coworker and we stumbled on this place for a late-night dinner on their patio. The appetizers we shared were really great and my squab entree (it was a while ago but I think I had squab?) was unique and delicious! Great service. Great beef tartare. Great wine and a great patio to take in this little fun strip of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I lucked into an outstanding piece of fish on a bed of black quinoa for lunch.  Grilled to perfection, with a lovely Sauvignon to go with it, I have no complaints about the food or the service.  Yea! I did sit outside however, and with a lot of construction going on nearby, I decided not to linger for dessert.  Never mind: I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad! All the appetizers were good! Beer and cappuccino were great as well! Absence of some menu items (namely cheescake) is somewhat frustrating for the restaurant of this level. Good overall with room to improve!"}
{"text":"The 4 of us arrived at 7pm on Saturday and were seated promptly at a lovely table in the dining room. There is a door between the bar area and the quiet dining room which was great. Always nice to be able to have a conversation! 

Our server Nicole was very patient while we decided on drinks and read through the menu. We decided on a nice California Cabernet Sauvingon ($58) and ordered 4 different mains: Bison ($39), Black Cod ($39), 10oz striploin ($37) and I ordered the Cornish hen ($29). 

The Cornish hen was moist and flavourful and the onions that came with it were amazing as well! Definitely recommend. The bison had an interesting taste (and the chipotle mustard was incredible!). The dish was enjoyed but the sweet potato side was nothing to write home about. The black cod and the striploin are also highly recommended. 

We didn't order dessert but Nicole brought out a \"happy birthday\" plate with 4 chocolates that were delicious and a nice touch! 

A great place to celebrate a special occasion if you are in the yorkville area."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews on the Yelp page, I feel like I must have gone to the wrong restaurant! I hate to come onto Yelp to trash a restaurant, but I wonder if the chef was off the day that I came in for lunch? That being said, this was one of those truly remarkable dining experiences that astounded me at every turn... 

Let me set the scene briefly: my parents were visiting for the weekend and were on a mid-afternoon flight out of Toronto. Although my office is near Yorkville, I never venture past the local sausage proprietor  A colleague of mine suggested that I just wander around Yorkville looking for a place to grab a bite, and that I \"couldn't go wrong\". It was that miserable snowy day where it rained in the afternoon and turned the entire streets to slush. Have I evoked enough melodrama yet?

Anyways, we sat down and ordered. My Mom went for a starter - some sort of fried chicken dish with a coleslaw, my Dad, the lentil dish, and I went for the burger. We also agreed (after much pushing from our waitress) to get the arugula and grapefruit salad. The food arrived quickly and looked pretty (if slightly larger than we had anticipated) on the plate. High marks for presentation. HOWEVER, tucking into the food, it was remarkable how terrible every dish was. My burger, to start, was completely over cooked and the \"bacon aioli\" (a condiment that seems to tap into the cultural zeitgeist at various levels) was nowhere to be found. I was left with a chewy and greasy burger that was completely bland, but I got off easy. My Dad's artichokes were not cleaned properly and he found himself sifting through bits of toughness and grit. Also, his lentils were completely overcooked. I know what you're thinking: how does that happen? If there is any food that is resistant to overcooking it is the resilient and malleable lentil! Alas! So did we, but Sassafraz's chef demonstrated, definitively, that an overcooked lentil exists. Finally, his puff pastry was pliable and without any finesse or delicacy. My mom's \"chicken dippers\" (or whatever nomenclature du jour they use on their menu) were actually pretty tasty - crispy and salty. Her coleslaw, however, was unpalatable due to the bath of vinegar it was swimming in. Her celeriac puree that sat underneath also just tasted of, well, nothing. Finally, our shared arugula and grapefruit salad was the biggest joke of all. We received a huge mound of arugula with four sections of grapefruit at perpendicular angles and a few toasted cashews hidden beneath the bed of salad leaf. There was none of the \"rhubarb citrus vinaigrette\" and when we asked the waitress to bring us some, she returned with a dense, red-colored mayo and it was unclear how to dress the salad. In effect, we found ourselves staring down the business end of a $14 pile of arugula. The only excuse for food this absolutely bland is that the kitchen must have run out of tasting spoons. Or maybe a new sous chef was being trained (this was, to be fair, 12:00 on a Monday)?

To give credit where credit is due, our waitress was attentive and the food did come quickly. That being said, the experience was almost a parody of service itself. I don't want to delve too far into meta territory here, but just as the menu seemed to try and capture certain elements of haute cuisine (cf. the \"citrus roasted cauliflower\" or \"grapefruit gremolata\"), our waitress also seemed to perform her role without any substantive backing. For example, when she asks how our food was, she didn't let anyone answer before saying \"It's delicious, I can just tell from looking at you\". She was also halfway to the bar telling my Mom \"Let me get you another glass of that Cote du Rhone\" before my Mom had to jump out of her chair and practically tackle her and tell her that \"No, I need to stand in airport security\". She was performing hospitality without any actual hospitality! I feel that this may have been part and parcel of the larger economic logic of Sassafraz. Our waitress, after pushing dessert on us for the third time, mentioned a \"mousse dome\" that she refers to as a \"pleasure dome\". I told her that this was clever and she looked at me said, \"Oh, I know. It helps me sell a ton of them\". This line was revealing. As a moment of critique of the neoliberalization of the food industry, it was poignant. Our waitress slipped from her performative role as \"hostess\" and unveiled the bare economic mechanics of the restaurant industry. In order to keep afloat, bloated and expensive (and, quite honestly, tacky) restaurants, waitresses are forced to up-sell drinks, desserts, etc. etc. and this is done through a feigned affective intimacy with each customer. It is a Janus-faced role: waitresses are forced to become both cut-throat saleswomen while also maintaing their affective bond.That being said, this didn't add much to our dining experience or shave off the $150 lunch bill.

All in all, I feel Sassafraz a prime contender for Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"i will let my unanswered email to the owners of sassafraz tell the tale....this would not happen at Pangea or Opus 

\"Dear Sir/Madam,

I regret that I find myself having to write an email of complaint. I had a party of four for dinner at Sassafraz on Sunday, March 6  last. The dinner was a birthday celebration, something I specifically mentioned when I made the reservation. The first half of the dinner went well but at that point all service essentially stopped. The waiter was nowhere to be seen. I asked the woman at the reservations desk for service; nothing happened. I then asked the manager for service, nothing happened. 
 Finally, a half an hour after my initial request, I asked for my coat from the woman at the front desk. My coat was brought but not the waiter. I was literally at the table in my coat waiting. Finally, the waiter appeared with no apology or explanation. By this point we had long given up on the ordering dessert and coffee, which we would have done. 
The young woman whose birthday it was got to watch a birthday plate arrive at the table next to us, reinforcing the suggestion that somehow her birthday was not being noticed. 
As I left I mentioned again to the manager that I was extremely disappointed in the service. The manager indicated that he had my telephone number from the reservation and would call me. I have heard nothing. 

 I expect better service and a better experience for $400.00.  I look forward to your comments. \"

very poor at the time and the complete lack of a response speaks volumes..."}
{"text":"This was my first ever winterlicious attempt - and it was fun to try a restaurant I probably never would have gone to on my own. We did the lunch menu. I started with the baby spinach and kale salad (though there was zero kale) and my husband had the smoked salmon and farro. Both were just okay. For the main dish I had the Thai coconut red curry with shrimp. I liked that adding shrimp had no extra cost associated with it, especially since I had to have the tofu removed to make it gluten free. My husband had the pork chops and enjoyed them but was fairly put off bc it didn't come with any side at all. Not even seasonal vegetables. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake - it wasn't the best and I didn't enjoy it. Didn't even finish it. It had some weird cream cheese whipped cream on top. My husband had the banana custard tart and said it was good. Our waitress was great and provided good service.
Overall it was a fairly underwhelming experience. I wouldn't go back but didn't mind it for cheap winterlicious prices."}
{"text":"My mom was in town visiting for the week and I had planned a mixture of meals out - Toronto restaurants that I love and ones I had been waiting to try.  I work in Yorkville and had dined often at Le Societe, Cafe Nervosa and Ciao but had not yet tried Sassafraz. I will not be returning.

It was Wednesday evening after work and not terribly busy yet. We were seated at the end table on the patio....and then forgotten for 20 minutes. The table next to us had their order taken, the table behind us (that arrived at the same time as we did) had their order taken. We were ignored. No water, no bread, no beverages offered. Was it how we were dressed? The couple being fauned over next to us were obviously wealthy (you know the type - bombastic alpha male with the \"woman of a certain age\" that has obviously been remade). But then..I was in a well made suit accompanied by a casually dressed person obviously my mother. Anyway..after our drink and food orders were taken:

Food:
Shared the Tomato salad. Avocado puree, fresh tomatoes, goat cheese mousse - DELICIOUS and couldn't wait for our mains
Capellini pasta that was described with so much flavour in the menu (roasted garlic, fresh basil, fresh tomato, burrata). Bland bland BLAND. It tasted like mashed tomatoes with no hint of seasoning let alone roasted garlic or fresh basil.
Cornish Hen - flavourless, bland corn puree (reminiscent of canned creamed corn) (which could be forgiven because it was served with \"grilled pepper & scallion salad\" - but NO, it was mushy, unappealing peppers) and burned potato & chorizo rosti.

Did we want dessert? Forget it - we'd been there almost two hours already and had enough. We went over to the next avenue for homemade icecream.  Will I return for work or pleasure given my close proximity? Not a chance. I'd rather pay the same prices for the restaurants mentioned at the outset."}
{"text":"Went to lunch today for Winterlicious with 10 friends and we were seated on the second floor. We had the entire floor to ourselves and we loved it. We got to be loud and silly without having people look at us funny. The main floor was packed!

From the get-go I was impressed. Our waitress was nice and very professional. She was constantly refilling our coffee, bringing more bread and butter, and checking-in on us without being overbearing. I would go into detail about each dish, but the fact is that everyone cleared their plate. That to me is rare. For 11 people to enjoy their appetizer, main and dessert is uncommon; we are a picky bunch. I went to Canoe several days ago for lunch and I was really unhappy with their desserts. Sassafraz however knows how to bake! I would not get the cheese plate though. Even though the cheese plate tasted great, you really gotta try their raspberry cream roulade or warm chocolate cake.  

From all the mixed reviews I had heard and read about, I really felt apprehensive about Sassafraz. I am so glad that I decided to try them out for myself because this lunch has become one of the best meals I have ever had. 

*Great service, pretty ambiance and great food? Sold! 

Oh, and another cool thing was that we were all served at the same time and only had to wait less than 10 minutes between courses. You literally saw the line of staff come over to us so that we all got served at the same time. It was nice to see 4-5 servers all come up the stairs together and walk in a line towards our table. So professional!"}
{"text":"I came here for my bday last week, after a very very long time. I was glad to realize that the service here is still stellar. Our group of 8 were really well taken care of - everything was on time, well prepared and the server(s) made sure to always be at hand without  interrupting every few minutes. The food was delicious as well. Will definitely be back more often !"}
{"text":"I like sitting outside at this place. Drinks are pretty good, and it was strong, which made me feel like I was getting a deal because you usually don't feel like that in Yorkville, especially at the nicer places. Ice coffees are good too. Their service is good but not warm or inviting, just good as in they bring you what you need in a reasonable amount of time. I had beef tartare once upon a time with quail egg on it and that was really good. I've had other food items since then and they're quite good too."}
{"text":"I came to Sassafraz and ordered from the Summerlicious lunch menu. For the experience (food, ambiance, service), the $28 + tax + tip was worth it! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. We sat in a booth next to the waterfall wall, in a well-lit area. The service was also good as the servers ensured checked up on us consistently and were very accommodating - for example, when I asked for another scoop of ice cream because the one I got was partially melted. 
As for the food, I loved everything I ate (to be fair, I rarely complain about food). I had the blue crab salad, atlantic salmon, and dark chocolate cake. 
Overall, this summerlicious experience was incredible for me in terms of value. I would definitely recommend the restaurant for a nice lunch or dinner out because the classy atmosphere is really nice and great for conversations."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a party of 18 for a birthday. It was nice because before we went, the birthday girl was able to choose a prix fixe menu. She was able to make changes to the menu to cater to our groups needs. 

The prix fixe menu was $75/person, which is more on the expensive side. However, the food did not disappoint. 

Appetizers: I ordered the wild boar terrine, which started out cold and salted, but ended pleasantly sweet with a red currant geleé. Some others raved about the salad, which they stated had many dimensions. I also tasted the red lentil and carrot soup with pistachio cream, which was rich and savoury. 

Entrees: I had the Cornish hen with quinoa and double smoked bacon, which was rich and fantastic. My fiancée had the lamb and mushroom risotto, which I had 1/2 of and it was also fantastic. Rich, creamy, and with perfect texture. I also had the NY striploin, which was cooked to perfection and was very good. 

Dessert: I had the Apple Bread pudding and sour cream ice cream. I recommend this dish any day of the week. It was very rich with a brandy caramel that you pout over your own dish. Others had the chocolate lava cake, which was good, but paled in comparison to the apple pie.

Service: we were serviced by a waiter named Gio, who was caring, informative, and very quick with service. I felt like he paid special attention to us, but he was frequently serving other tables, which shows that he is a very dedicated waiter. He made a mistake with a wine when I reordered, giving us a more expensive bottle, but when I brought it to his attention he adjusted the bill in our favour. That was nice. 

Drinks: The wine was fairly priced, but if you are ordering scotch or hard liquor, know that it's going to cost you. 2 double Glenlivet Scotches cost $96."}
{"text":"I was here on Tuesday for winterlious dinner and celebrating a friend's birthday.  The food is 3 star in average, but service is bad and disappointing. 

I tried the duck pate, duck breast and cheese board to go with a prosecco.  The best out of them is the duck breast. Duck pate is good, but it's a lot of pate for 3 pieces of bread, they should provide a proportional amount.  Cheese board was disappointing, they were low quality cheeses.  The prosecco didn't taste good too.  A complimentary prosecco from four season spa taste better than this.

Service is a problem here as others mentioned.  The server didn't offer coat check for us, I realized they had it later when I saw others got the service.  The server didn't come by for water, not once!  One of us ordered coffee and it was totally forgotten until we asked again, yet, no apologies.

We have a baby and find that it's a challenge here, this place is Not kids' friendly!  They don't have a ramp outside, it's only stairs outside.  When we were sitting at the table they didn't provide a high chair until I asked versus Toula, which I just ate on the weekend they were very attentive to my baby, they offered high chair right away.  So we were holding baby on lap, struggling with all the winter jackets, didn't really have time to look into the menu then asked to order food.

Food came so fast that the 3 courses came one after another before I can finished them.  Isn't it suppose to be a French restaurant!? What's the rush?  Or they just don't care?  

There are lots of other places offer way better service and food with this price point.  This location is not wheelchair or stroller friendly.  If you are celebrating and want to have a pleasant night, you would be more pleasant if dined in another restaurant."}
{"text":"From all the 'Media coverage' I thought this place would blow my mind...but sadly it did not!!! First time eating here & had the opportunity to come here due to my work Christmas lunch. As we were a large group, we were separated onto three large tables (which is understandable). 

The group menu was standard, starters: soup or salad, mains: beef, pasta or veggie dish and lastly dessert: moose or pineapple jelly.

My starters was soup which was nice but needed additional salt & pepper (which was not available)...pretty presentation but it doesn't mean anything if the soup is standard tasting.

Moving onto my mains, I ordered the beef steak. Again very pretty presentation BUT the majority of our party had ordered the steak BUT had to send it back to the kitchen...the meat was so rare it looked like it just been killed (sorry for the extreme description). 

Another point to mention was that our group was left alone with empty wine glasses on many occasions. At times, when staff were available - I had to call them over to top-up my wine glass. I believe the general rule is not to leave your guest with empty glasses!!!

Onto dessert, ordered the pineapple jelly. Again beautiful presentation and tasted good but too much of a good thing can make you sick. The pineapple jelly was a thick pineapple jelly shaving with a cheesecake tasting filling inside the shaving...not much I can say about the dessert but it was the best part of my meal.

To finish up, the group was offered tea & coffee. As I am not a coffee drinker and I was offered tea....Avoid!!!! My tea tasted like dish water....AVOID at all cost! 

This has probably been the worst restaurant experience I have had since moving to Canada.

I believe in giving any eatery a second chance to redeem themselves...only time will tell!!!"}
{"text":"Sassafraz came highly recommended to us and we traveled a long way, hoping to enjoy a romantic evening.  The food was fantastic forever the service was extremely poor.  This rating is only getting two stars because of the service.  The meal was quite expensive and the fact that our waiter treated us so poorly really put a damper on the evening.  My hope is that management takes note of this post and makes the necessary changes, the restaurant has great potential with a staff that completely undermine the experience!"}
{"text":"So, just got back from Winterlicious lunch at Sassafraz, or should I say their cafe bar? They don't actually seat you in their main dining room for Winterlicious, so we ended up at their crowded cafe bar with people always standing in the doors waiting to be seated by Maitre d'. It kind of gives you a feeling of being a second sort, but you get it at almost all trendy restaurants in Yorkville for Winterlicious. Past this little upsetting setback, everything was great.
  Service: Immaculate. Always on time, never interrupting a conversation, attentive to details and pleasing you in every way. There are a few managers on the floor overlooking everything and attending to issues in a blink on an eye.
  Food: Amazing. My first Winterlicious restaurant where I liked everything that was ordered. First of all their white Sangria is just like they make it in Spain, I might have to come back specifically for it. I ordered a potato celeriac soup which was delicious and had some truffle oil on top, my partner got salmon carpaccio which came with super fluffy whipped cream, for a second course I has mushroom stuffed chicken and my partner had braised beef cheeks. Both dishes were very well prepared, served hot of the stove, garnishes well complementing the meats. The dessert did not disappoint as well, my cheese came on a plate with a bunch of grapes, some crackers and dried fruits and my partner's lemon tart had some browned meringue on top and was very delicate. Overall, very satisfied with all we had.

Now the sour part, the price...all mentioned above and a cup of cappuccino came to 94 green papers, which is way over what I usually spend on a Saturday lunch, hence one star off. IMHO, good place for special occasions and for those who have unlimited finances."}
{"text":"My first winterlicious review! What can I say, this place is real amazing. 
The four of us came ten minutes before the reservation time, and we were seated right away. Our waitress was nice and attentive, but she made a mistake in one of our orders. Nevertheless, we were quickly given the right dish so it was pretty decent service we got. 
I got the smoked salmon and farro, bison short rib papparadelle and the banana custard tartlet. All these dishes were done very well! 
For the appetizer, the salmon was so fresh and had a lot of flavours. It complemented the farro really well, along with the nuts, I think it added an earthier taste into the dish. I could eat this all day. 
The bison papparadelle was really rich and savoury. I personally prefer less heavy dishes but it was definitely delicious anyways. The slight acidity in the cherry tomatoes gave the entree a good balance. I like the bison too, it was soft and tender, and paired well with the pasta. 
Finally, the banana custard tartlet was such an experience! I loved it, because it tasted so light yet had great contrast in textures. The tart shell was hard but not dense, it was delicate and had a nice crunch to it. I liked how the banana filling didn't taste artificial at all, in fact the natural sweetness of the fruit really shined through the dessert. The plating of the tartlet was beautiful as well. Probably my favourite part of the meal, but I do have a major sweet tooth so...
I enjoyed this restaurant a lot! I'm thinking I should come back here soon! Glad I got to try it out with the winterlicious event."}
{"text":"Went to a NYE wedding here, staff were amazing! Only wedding i have been to where each table has a dedicated waiter.

The food was EPIC!"}
{"text":"My fiance (now husband) and I booked the upstairs of Sassafraz for our small wedding. We wanted a nice dinner for our guests with a beautiful space and room for dancing - Sassafraz was terrific and fit our vision of the big day perfectly!

Dennette was awesome to work with and her friendliness helped make a stressful planning experience incredibly enjoyable. The setup/service and food on the day of the wedding was incredible. Our guests loved the food and the atmosphere and still days later we're getting so much positive feedback on the food and the venue.


I definitely recommend this venue for a small/medium size wedding!"}
{"text":"Came with my mother after bridal dress shopping for a drink and appetizers. We sat by the window in the bar/lounge area. We had the sangrias - white and red and a glass of champagne. Had a salad and the cheese platter. Everything was very nice and the restaurant and lounge have a great atmosphere. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Me and my mom went to Sassafraz for lunch when she was in town. It was a beautiful day, and we sat on the cafe side, with all of the windows open. It felt like we were sitting outside, without having to sit on the street! We had great service the entire time, and didn't feel rushed at all. 

On top of the atmosphere being perfect for a ladies lunch, we both really enjoyed our food. I had the fish tacos, which were super fresh. I loved how the fish was pan fried rather than deep fried. My mom had the red Thai curry. She really enjoyed it, and it looked like it had tons of fresh veggies. We also ordered a side of fries, which was exactly what we needed. The fries could have been a bit more crisp for my liking, but we're still good. 

We will definitely be back for our next lunch!"}
{"text":"you get what you pay for--awesome"}
{"text":"One of my old time favorites when I visit home...I have been going to this place forever...used to be the Belair Cafe....my hamburger was delicious...however, the service was not so great :("}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is pretty nice. You have the option of sitting in the lounge area with some live music or you can opt for the candle-lit dining room with a gorgeous waterfall.

Our waiter was pretty attentive but I wasn't particularly impressed by the food. We ordered the entire selection of cheeses, the campanelle and the steak. Although we got a good selection of cheeses, I found the campanelle to be slightly undercooked and my partner wasn't impressed by his steak either. 

I would say it wasn't worth what we paid but if you're interested in trying this place, I would recommend going during Summerlicious."}
{"text":"Was here for Easter brunch with my family and friends. It looks like a very posh fine dining place. We ordered the blueberry pancakes, egg whites and chives, and lobster egg sandwich. The portions for the pancakes were generous but not so much for the rest of the items. I liked the servers and their  polite attitude. I would love to go back on a regular day for dinner to try out some of their items."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! I couldn't be any happier with the experience. I made reservations a week in advance, mentioned the Groupon I had purchased earlier and got a confirmation in my Email. The place wasn't crowded at all on Sunday night. My party of 4 were welcomed and were given a choice to sit where we pleased. I absolutely adored the atmosphere and decor. It's a quite classy place, certainly good for professional meetings and celebrations. 

I had the cauliflower soup for appetizer, which was quite creamy and rich, garnished with olive oil. My friend tried the buffalo Mozzarella and tomatoes for appetizer and he liked it, even though I didn't like the cheese when I tried it. For main course I had the Alberta bison striploin and it was perfectly cooked medium, just the way I like it. Finally, for desert I had a milk chocolate mousse, which was alright, and not too sweet. My friend who had the eclair trio didn't quite like her desert though. I would love to come back for special occasions with friends and try their regular dinner menu."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go to for a special occasion!  Their plates were fairly portioned and I love their menu selection. I tried this place for summer Lucius the first time and they've made a positive impression  for me to return again for my birthday."}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon deal ($70 for a 3 course meal for 2) and had an overall amazing experience.

We requested a more private table which they kindly accommodated, and our server Michael provided us with the best service I have had in a very very long time. 

The meal itself was great (minus the lobster bites in the apps - those were just ok).

The pork belly app was tasty, the steak main was huge and cooked to perfection and served on delicious creamed kale, and the shrimp pasta (with dill and cream sauce) was amazing.

Had the beignets and chocolate mousse for dessert (licked plate for both of these) and also grabbed a bottle of the red wine that came with the tasting menu (only $40! and delicioussss).

The sign of a great experience: We ended up staying there for 3.5 hours without realizing how much time had gone by and without feeling rushed, or like we were always waiting for our food or service. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We had purchased a groupon for our last night in toronto dinner. We were moving out of the city and wants to have a nice meal at a restaurant we never got a chance to check out. Ive always had sassafraz on my list of places but the opportunity never really came up. 

Service: very attentive service. Our server was so helpful and funny. You expect to always get a bit of snubby service when using a groupon at a posh restaurant but this was not the case. 

But the food took FOREVER to come out. We arrived at 7:30 and left around 10pm. My parents also had a similar experience. The kitchen was super slow to get the food out. 

Food:
We ordered a bottle of ontario niagara wine which was reasonably priced at 30-something dollars.
For the appetizers we shared the chowder with scallops and the bone marrow. The chowder was much more filling and quite tasty but the bone marrow was a lot more enjoyable with a lentil puree which seemed a little off place... and two small portions of Crostini.  Thankfully there was free warm bread and butter. I wish the butter had been soft. Cold butter ia hard to spread.  I regress....

For the mains we shared the lamb shank and the steak. Truthfully... these were huge disappointments. Very underwhelming... there was nothing that made hear dishes stand out or pop out. The beans with the lamb shank were just meh. Something easily made at home. The steak was just steak. Wih a few little potatoes.  I expected something more.

Dessert: churros and a chocolate cake with ice cream . Both were good. The chocolate lava cake I prreffered more just because there was more of it. 

So in conclusion. We were pretty disappointed. The food itself would have gotten 2 stars but the service of our waiter elevated it to 3. This was an opportunity to see if we would be back on a normal evening and sad to say, likely not."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here last night for my birthday celebration. It was a lovely night. 

First off, I mixed up the reservation date but they graciously re-arranged their seating plan and put up by a table near the windows. It looked pretty busy on a Saturday night, good thing we arrived by 6pm or else we probably would be out of luck without a reservation. 

We used the groupon 3 course menu for $70. We were given a specific groupon menu, which we were surprised to see a wide array of choices.

The good:
- located in a nice restaurant near Bay station
- our waiter was prompt with service, friendly, professional 
- the braised pork belly on lentil appetizer was great! 
- our entrees were wonderful - Artic char and Tandoori lamb (good flavours) 
- nice little candle with birthday message, very thoughtful 
- it was nice how they took the utensils away with each course 

Other points:
- the octopus appetizer was good but my partner wasn't a big fan of it, unless you like that kind of distinct texture 
- the desserts probably wasn't made in-house and kept in a fridge (was my partner's guess). It tasted mediocre. Both portions were huge, we weren't able to finish, though we tried to. And a tad too sweet as well.  

Overall - we both had a great evening here. We would likely come back again."}
{"text":"I didn't find the food to be anything special... I absolutely loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, my friend booked a table right by the manmade water fall they have in doors, it was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Hey if its good enough for Mick Jagger it should be good enough for the rest of us."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was walking by and I thought the restaurant looked really cute so I wanted to try it. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Was it as good as some of the higher end restaurants I've tried in France? No, but it was an interesting mix of French/Canadian cuisine that delivered consistently delicious food.

Service is always excellent here. The servers are always so nice and helpful, not at all pretentious. Atmosphere is relaxed and the space is really lovely. I usually get seated in the back near the waterfall which I think is really pretty. 

I've never been here for Summerlicious so I can't speak to that menu but I highly recommend going any other time so its not as crowded. I've never had a bad experience here and I recommend it to friends all the time. 

It's a nice place to take a date or a bunch of girls for lunch."}
{"text":"I ate here for Summerlicious 2014 and had a decent experience.

First and foremost, the restaurant is beautiful--and this is rarely something I pay a lot of attention to. Personally, the typeface used on the signs outside could use an update (sorry...), but the exterior of restaurant looks quaint and warm, and its interior is light, spacious, airy, and elegant. 

As for the food--overall, it was good. The complimentary bread was carby and delicious. I wasn't a fan of the gazpacho, but it was my first time trying it, so maybe it's just not a dish for me (no biggie--the bread basket made up for it). My Chinook salmon entree, however, was rich, flavorful and well-cooked, and I secretly resented having to share it with my friends when I couldn't eat their dishes, as I don't eat red meat :(. My chocolate mousse dessert was heavenly and a perfect way to end the meal.

Oh, and lastly, the service was great too. I was wearing a cheap black dress (I'm a broke grad student, okay, I'm allowed to buy $15 dresses from Forever 21), but the waiter was kind enough to ignore that and still swap out my standard white napkin for a black one to avoid white lint. OMG, like, I get that this is probably standard at upscale restaurants to make patrons feel important but... yeah. It made me feel important, and I'm writing about it now... So it worked? Hahaha."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom for lunch during Summerlicious this year. 

Service was a bit iffy - I have nut allergies and couldn't have the desserts I wanted, so our waitress said she would bring me out a nice fruit bowl. I expected a variety of fruits, maybe with some whipped cream or at least a garnish, but all I got was a bowl of strawberries. Since we were already getting such a deal on our lunch ($25 each for 3 courses) I didn't complain, but I would have been turned off if we were paying full price. 

My meal was otherwise good. I had a gazpacho to start that was supposed to come with a lobster garnish, but there was literally only a fleck of lobster on it. Not sure if that was a mistake or if it was supposed to be that way. If it was intentional, they might as well have just left it off since it didn't make much of a difference. I loved my main course, which was BC chinook salmon with a fennel and parsnip hash, green beans, and Bearnaise sauce. I would have paid the $25 for this dish alone!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so beautiful. When I walk by, I couldn't believe there's such a bright building in the corner. I went there for breakfast and coffee, everything was just perfect. 

Ps: the waiters are so handsome and I felt so delighted when he poured water to my glass lol"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday and got seated on the couch infront of the piano. Its an amazing date night restaurant. A very romantic and relaxed atmosphere.

We had the burger (coz I can never say no) and the bison. Both delicious!

The servers were very polite as well.

All in all a wonderful experience.

Tip: Bring cash to tip the performers. The guy at the piano was amazing!"}
{"text":"I work in the area so have been here numerous times for business meetings... I must admit that I absolutely love the ambiance of this restaurant. Further, Yorkville is such a great area to spend your time in during the afternoon. As another reviewer mentioned, the vaulted ceilings and the two-storey waterfalls really helps you relax in the middle of a busy day.

In terms of the food I have always found everything extremely fresh - typically have eaten either pork or scallops when there and both are always done amazingly... Highly recommended if you need to book a lunch in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Yorkville. Great food and drinks. Patio is great for people watching."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Sassafraz.  The restaurant is beautiful.  One wall with a waterfall and plants...one with what looks like a very old bank vault (it's actually a red wine cellar).  Service is outstanding. 

The red oak salad was good, but dressing could have been a touch sweeter.

The pumpkin spiced Duck pate was fantastic.... smooth as silk... Just needed another piece or two of bread. 

The venison osso buco was as tough as old boots.... Extremely disappointing.... And the meat was not seasoned at all.  Salt, pepper? The sauce with it was good, but there wasn't enough of it.  And meat must be seasoned, whether there's a sauce or not. 

The filet was good, nice butter on top.  Again, meat was completely unseasoned.  The mushroom side had vinegar in it, but because they were hot, it worked....it wouldn't have otherwise! 

The chai crème Brulee was dreadful.  Not sweet enough, and some flavors don't belong in dessert.  Chai is one.  

I was also disappointed that there was no foies gras..."}
{"text":"Dinner here had great ambiance; the food was not as great an experience. The texture and flavors were great (the soup de jour was especially a highlight), but the portion size of the entree was typical of \"upscale\" restaurants in Yorkville. The small salmon fillet on a large plate was solid (hard to mess up salmon), and the potato/spinach dumplings were a great counterpoint to the salmon. The dessert was slightly disappointing, not in flavor but in accessibility; the graham cracker topping the dark chocolate marquise only served to maim the structure of the dessert. And the marshmallows were just weird."}
{"text":"Way overpriced, but I guess you're for the atmosphere with these kind of restaurants.. The scallops and the sea bass are good.  The steak was mediocre for the price. The terrine was one awful appetizer. The calamari was good though. However the desserts were universally awful. Service was top notch."}
{"text":"I only went to Sassafraz once, that was during Winterlicious of this year (yikes- I am a little late?) 

There was 7 in our group and we decided as a work outting to go to sassafraz as our Winterlicious choice. 

Location: Great, very cozy feel and the restaurant itself was nicely decorated and had an intimate feel to it.

Service: I've experienced better. As a previous server, I expect a lot as I know what good service is and I felt rushed more than anything. The waiters were extremely nice but our main waiter got the bills all mixed up (drinks and food not matching the correct person) and often times I noticed staff was hovering over us to remove our plates. At one point, a waiter grabbed someones plate and they weren't even done and they had to tell them \"I'm not finished yet\".

The worst part of our experience? The Manager told us (only 5 minutes after we paid) that we had to go as it was extremely busy due to winterlicious and another group was waiting for our table. I understand it is a very busy time for them, but you do not rush people out the door literally 5 minutes after they paid. We weren't planning on staying there that long after we paid anyway (just trying to finish our drinks, is that okay sir?) Not to mention, our table alone spent over $600.00. We didn't just order off the winterlicious menu, we had bottles of wine, drinks, etc.  For this very reason, I will never return.  

Food: Presentation was fantastic, portion size was reasonable. I had the Quebec Brie to start, great starter size and it was delicious. It had the right amount of of flake to cheese ratio. It was a great salty/sweet treat.

I had the cornish hen and polenta as my entree, the polenta was delicious and the cornish hen was not so bad.

And finally to finish I had a chocolate lava cake for dessert with a candied lolipop with ice cream. Ice cream and candied lolipop was ok- the cake was awful. Not even sure if it was cooked properly- something was missing. Huge disappointment.

Overall, would not go back- if the food tickled my taste buds more- I would perhaps give it a second try, but it didn't."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for winterlicious. Service was good. Only thing was the croquettes appetizer came cold and had to send it back. Otherwise it was a cute romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on Monday, pretty fancy. Large couches, nice tables. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a French restaurant in Yorkville. 

I met a friend for tea here, it was nice, but nothing special. They had a grand piano in the main dining room, unfortunately no one was playing it, maybe it was just for show. I'm generally a huge fan of places that have live music (especially piano), but maybe I'd have to come back another night. 

If you're looking for a place to grab a tea/coffee like I was, I wouldn't recommend it, but perhaps the food is good enough to justify it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during Winterlicious 2014.  Had the roasted red pepper soup, chicken and raspberry dessert.  Food was fastastic.  Service was pretty good except we had to wait a long time between courses.  Decor was nice in the big room.  I was facing the waterfall.  I don't get the ikea couches in the lounge area.  I thought they looked cheap!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for Summerlicious '17 and came at 11am for their cafe area. The place was full by 12pm so reservations are recommended if you want a guaranteed seat. We chose a seat that faced the open window so we had a good view of the street outside. 

To start, I ordered the tealicious. It's a non-alcohlic drink of a combination of infused teas. I enjoyed it! A refreshing drink to start the day. 

I ordered the blue crab salad as an appetizer. I can't say that I enjoyed it all that much. I'm usually a fan of seafood, crab being no exception, but the taste of the crab salad just left a weird taste in my mouth. It was definitely 'crabby', if you will, but the combination was too much in my opinion.

For my main, I had the Cerviche rice bowl. It was a mix of mainly rice, tuna, avocado, walnuts, mixed with some type of vinaigrette sauce. The sauce itself seemed a bit strong and left an aftertaste in my mouth. Paired with the salty tuna, it just wasn't a favourable combination for me. 

Lastly, I chose the Gotham cheese plate as a dessert. I love my cheese so this was the best part of the meal. It was drizzled with some syrup and walnuts. Loved it! 

Overall, the atmosphere of sassafraz is great. Nice open windows to help with a hot summer's day and a cafe style feel. The food, however, I didn't love. I can only speak for the dishes i ordered this time around though since it was my first time here. I may come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Very quiet and sophisticated place.
Fusion French was one of a kind!!! Love her so much"}
{"text":"To be fair, I am writing this review several years after visiting with my then-fiancee, prior to the fire that burnt the place down.  I have not been since.

We stopped in or an afternoon bite on the patio while waiting for an appointment nearby.  Our impression quickly soured when, in the middle of taking our drinks order, our waiter left us to fuss over a table of regulars, greet and chat with them, and take their order instead.  I was in mid-sentence when he left.

Shocked, when he finally returned I finished our order and asked to speak to a manager.  Instead of politely saying yes of course, the waiter asked me why and then proceeded to argue with me over the issue of his abandoning us during our order.

Perhaps soured by the experience, we did not enjoy our food, which was overpriced and boring anyway.  When the manager finally elected to grace us with his presence some time later, he defended his waiter's behaviour and offered a free dessert.

We said no thanks and also left no tip.  I will never return here again, and couldn't help that Karma had made an intervention when the place was reduced to ashed some months later.

I take great pains to tell anyone I know who spends time in Yorkville - lawyers, colleagues, business people, etc. - to avoid this place for its arrogant service and overpriced pish-posh vittles.

If you appreciate being treated like a valued customer, head to Harry Rosen.  They may not feed you, but they will treat you like  you are the most important person in the store."}
{"text":"This was my first time there, as i was celebrating my birthday, and the atmosphere was incredibly beautiful. The hostess was good and the server was the best I have had in years. The server and cook made quick and easy substitutions for my meal as i do not eat meat and it was done with ease and finesse. The food was good, just different then I have had before and I enjoyed that. Dessert - yummmnnm! I loved the live pianist as well. Great place to go, I'll definetly be going back again."}
{"text":"Sassafraz is housed in a gorgeous yellow Victorian house in the heart of Yorkville. This year, I was here for a Summerlicious dinner. When I walked into the restaurant, I was stunned by the elegance of the interior. The restaurant was truly a beautiful space. I loved the skylight that poured into the room.

Now onto the food!

Vichyssoisse with lobster and truffle essence- for me, the soup was overly sweet and I needed more salt to balance out that sweetness. I couldn't really detect that truffle essence. 

Creole spiced gulf shrimp on corn grit cakes with cayenne bell pepper sauce- the dish was very beautifully presented and I loved the vibrant colours. It was also very tasty- the shrimp was nicely cooked and had that perfect springy bite to it. I also enjoyed the touch of heat in the cayenne bell pepper sauce. I've never had corn grit cake before, so I was surprised that it had a fluffy, egg-like texture, almost like a quiche. It was a great vehicle for soaking up the delicious sauce.

Dungeness crab cake with adobe cream and jicama salad- the crab cake was full of crab meat, which was great. However, I'm more partial to pairing crab cakes with something creamy, usually some sort of mayo-based dip or aioli. While the sauce here was tasty, it lacked that creaminess that I desired. As well, the jicama salad was warmed by crab cake, which made it less refreshing. I would've enjoyed it more if it stayed cold. 

Rose water scented chilled cherry soup with dark chocolate mousse, crisped rice croquant and vanilla tuille- the mousse was delicious: intensely chocolatey and smooth, and the rice croquants were crispy delights! 

Blueberry tartlet with white chocolate crème diplomat, toasted meringue and lime gelée- the toasted meringue was like a melted marshmallow, adding a creamier dimension to the tart. However, I found the lime gelée to be shockingly sour to my palate. On the whole, the tart was very refined but I actually prefer my pastries to be more rustic, perhaps a little more buttery and greasy.

I think the most enjoyable aspect of my meal was the lovely dining ambiance. As I said, the restaurant is stunningly beautiful! However, there were other glitches that marred the meal. For instance, the food all came really fast one after the other, but our server was not very attentive. We had to ask for water refills multiple times. Worst of all, during the dessert course, there were these little bugs flying around that were very bothersome, and our server never noticed. All in all, I would be willing to pay $25 for the food that I had, but I felt that the remaining $20 went to the décor. Ultimately, I'm not sure that I would come back to Sassafraz. Even though the restaurant is beautiful, the service wasn't perfect, and I'm reluctant to pay a premium just for prettiness."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for Winterlicious on Saturday and we surely made the right choice!

We sat by the window on comfy sofas (based on request) and each of us ordered different meals.

Really enjoyed the trout and chocolate dessert! The portions were larger than expected (considering it's French) so it was easily sharable.

You can tell that the staffs are extremely professional, when the timing of every food coming in and being cleared out is perfect. So flawless. Had a wonderful time chatting up with my girl friends :)"}
{"text":"Came here for two 3 course dinners. I tried the brown sugar pulled pork belly, pan seared digby scallops, and their cheesecake. The pork belly was mostly a bed of lentils and the scallops were a bit too salty. You can never go wrong with cheesecake though!

The service was good as they weren't pushy or over the top, food was served relatively quickly, but it took a while for them to give us the bill. They also have coat check, which is great in the winter. 

The atmosphere is clean and upscale, overall a good place for a date or nice family dinner."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience even with a groupon deal! My sever was so knowledgeable with wine pairing and suggestions. Overall a phenomenal date with my mum."}
{"text":"Good place for a date night.  Located at Yorkville, this restaurant has an easygoing atmosphere.  Service was attentive...really attentive.  

We got two appetizers, two entrees and two desserts.  Octopus appetizer was bit chewy/rubbery while the pork belly appetizer had decent brown sugar balance to contrast the protein.  

Entrees - I had bone in veal chop.  Asked for medium rare and came out perfectly. Decent dish/portion.  BUT I found something better , my partner's dish is Cornish hen.  The white asparagus cauliflower purée was really really unique and delicious, definitely elevated the moist chicken breasts.  So good I kept taking more from the plate lol  


Overall, attentive service, easy going atmosphere with decent entrees, would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Update: Went here mid-March.  The restaurant is re-opening April 20th 2018 after renovations."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Great service. Great food!! 

It all comes with a price that I'm not always willing to pay. It would say I'm a fan and would definitely return, but maybe not on a weekly basis =P

Worth checking it out! Live music on the wknds... Ah, that was nice!!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time to visit this restaurant.  Every time we had excellent service and delicious meal. The ambiance is romantic and elegant at the same time. Live music at the bar section.  Cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"It's a fancy-schmancy spot to chill in Yorkville, great ambiance, but i'm not crazy about the food... it's mostly mediocre. It's more for people-watching and perhaps romantic dinner or lunch in the patio during summer.

Service is great and pretty quick. Very friendly servers.

The place is nice and pretty. Well-dressed guests.

I've had their halibut which was overcooked. The food was a bit bland for my taste and not the best value. Arugula salad with shaved parmesan was good, but nothing special. The red-wine Sangria is really good and better if you get the pitcher than by the glass.

I usually like going there during summer and sit outside in the patio to enjoy the weather and just relax.

Overall, I'd give it a 3/5, because the food could've been better for the price you pay. I know it's in Yorkville, but there's many other Yorkville restaurants that serve better food for the same price. I know it cause I worked right in the middle of Yorkville before."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based on my experience I had here a year ago at Summerlicious. I went with quite a large group of friends, so I was expecting the service to be below average to average especially due to our age. To my surprise they were very catering to our group. They made recommendations on the wines and didn't mind that we were here for the Summerlicious menu. 
I had the scallops as appetizer, which were great.
For entree I had the lamb shank, which was cooked quite well.
I don't recall what I had for dessert, but I remember that this was a great dining experience and they were even catering enough to take pictures for us, which means quite a lot to me when you don't see your friends as much as you would like to when you become a workaholic."}
