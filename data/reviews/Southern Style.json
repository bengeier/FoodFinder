{"text":"Ok this is THE spot for catfish. Actually I had the catfish, shrimp, greens, Mac n cheese, banana pudding, and peach cobbler. Not a morsel left! I found my new southern/soul food spot! I definitely give this five stars plus. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way there with our restaurant.com coupon.  There was signage and equipment there, but on the counter there was only a big sign that says \"Restaurant Available\".  Oh well.  Another one bites the dust.  This location has been all sorts of things over the years.  It's one of those gas station convenience stores with a couple of take out restaurant counters inside.  They have previously sold pizza, burritos, burgers, and now southern food and even the gas station has changed hands several times in the last decade.  So if something else ends up at this address my advice is to call ahead first."}
{"text":"20+ minutes for a lunch time order, and I am the only one waiting.  The girl on duty was more concerned with her phone call and playing music than preparing my order.   Did I mention the fish was frozen?...yes frozen   Wont be back again."}
{"text":"Been to this place 4 times now. Ask the gas clerk if they went out of business she said no someone back there. Yelled back called number still nothing. Guess they don't need business."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a great experience. The guys behind counter where  super nice. The food reminded me of my grandparents. It's truly southern home style food. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The wife and I ordered gumbo, fish, ribs and banana pudding. The food hit the spot. The gumbo was good despite the rice being just a bit gummy but I'd order it again because of the taste. The fried swai w/Mac n' cheese and fries were tasty and delightful. My wife enjoyed her rib dinner and the banana pudding. All-in-all, we'd eat here again."}
{"text":"I changed out of my comfy Sunday morning pj's to get soul food lunch for the family. I read reviews of poor service and lack of accurate hours being posted.  Well I arrived at 11:15 and despite the sign saying 9-9 it was closed. The AmPm employee stated \"they don't have hours, they open whenever\". Not the way a business should be ran, it screams unprofessional and typical Soul food restaurant stereotypes."}
{"text":"The food here was freshly made upon my arrival and took maybe 5 or so minutes to cook. The service was extremely friendly. The food was true Louisiana soul food. Chicken and shrimp was so juicy and delicious, flavorful and omg fantastic. Best chicken l have had in sooooo long. Don't be deterred that this place is in a gas station. The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"First time I've gone , seen it a few times but was scared do to its Inside a gas station , service was kinda slow , but food was fresh and hot fish is season just right , some place u want catfish and u get the fake stuff ( Mario's ) but will be going back   P.s get over how it look and let your mouth be the judge"}

And with new management they are consistent .So go check them out also try the fish as well as the Gumbo .The customer service was also pleasant all and all I had a great experience. I'm a fan and I will go back to dying there the food is great ."}
{"text":"My Husband brought home fish for lunch. It was the best.  Also we found out that they are now doing ribs. That's next. Try it you will love it. It's now under new management"}
