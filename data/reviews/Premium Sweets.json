{"text":"Horrible Over Pricyy Food With Fake Quality. Need Better Quality Sweets As Per Price Paid. My advice is don't go there it's a big scam these days. Please visit other restaurants for better quality foods."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Premium Sweets before but now I think the quality of the sweets have gone down. The sweets no longer have the taste as before. Also now it looks like they are made overpricy for some reason. The non-sweet items are also very overpricy for some reason. The quality that the food is offered through Premium Sweets is also below average to any other Indian Sweets Parlour. It looks very fake in quality and needs improvement in all areas. 

Please think before buying anything from this OverPricy Restaurant."}
{"text":"Best sweets in Toronto.
Sweet yogurt & Rabri is to die for..."}
{"text":"The epitome of successful marketing is to establish your name as a brand and make products almost irrelevant and make people care less about the actual product and sell whatever you want under your recognized name. Premium sweets made their name in Bengali Sweets and while having demand for Bengali sweets that are uniquley different there arent many such shops in GTA. Their mithais are a hit and with their name established with that they ventured into other food products to cash in their name. Kacchi Birayni is one of their products my wife told me people line up for so she got tempted and paid $15 for a to go pack. When we open the lunch box size pack we found not even 4oz of meat with basically some flavored rice topped with fried onions.  Calling Premium Sweets flavored rice Kacchi Biryani is shameful and insulting and its really sad that naive buyers actually pay $15 for this garbage. Unfortunately the modern day younger desi crowd doesnt know much about their food and restaurants use whatever label to sell their products. I can easily call my basic curry \" Mughlai Qorma\" and I know nobody can force me to stop kidding my customers unless they realize it themselves.To put things in perspective, there are tons of Pakistani restaurants all over GTA selling pretty decent Biryani with a ton of meat for half the price."}
{"text":"Really impressive, I remember visiting 3 years ago and they have grown massively , however I believe they could have utilized the space for proper seating arrangements food was great , have to go again"}
{"text":"The people working at this shop are just sweethearts. I've been here countless times. There was one time when they had locked the doors for closing but we got there just in time and requested if we could be let in for some sweets and they let us in! Their food is absolutely delicious. The chaat papri, pakoras and potato balls are really good. *** The best chat so far in all of Toronto*** The mithai and sweet section is out of this world. All the sweets are mouthwatering and the best thing is it's all so clean"}
{"text":"Great service! I am Caucasian who walked in out of curiosity. I was greeted by Pawan who patiently showed me all items and even gave me some try. I ended up buying main entry, samosas and desserts. All very good. I am very impressed by quality, service and cleanliness. It's very nice cafe."}
{"text":"Bangladeshi food craving satisfied!! Service, food and the place in general, spot on!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of sweets, hot table lunch and chat items.  They let you sample anything and if its your first time the lady who helped us provided us a small plate of all their popular sweets to try. There are packed frozen sweets and curries also. I bought the toasted sweet which was amazing. At the hot table i got the vegetable briyani combo which came with ramamalai and salad and riatha. The falooda was good too. Got to go back to try the chat items.

==============================PRIYA======="}
{"text":"Been coming here for 5 years and absolutely love it! I had no clue what Bangali sweets were before this. This restaurant is so huge and pretty now with an expansion of a chaat station and lunch items. 
I get all my sweets from here now and always get them gift wrapped for weddings and events. For a picky person like me they'll help you through all the gift wrapping and platter assortments. 
Best of all, they have such an amazing staff, everyone is so helpful and nice. Each and every person that works here really know their stuff.

My favourite part is FREE sampling! They will let you try anything before buying it!

You must try the khir toast, pran vogh and cake halwa!"}
{"text":"What a joke lol.. that the only thing comes To my mind when I went here. They are confused whether they are operating a fancy fast food counter or bakery or traditional Indian sweet shop. Jack of all master of none. Overpriced namesake sweets. Please don't waste your money and time."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly ..... its just the money that bothers me a lot for an Indian food service not so good on the pocket..... they have samosa, the most basic Indian snack . 2 for $1.50 , everywhere else its 3 for a $1... and its not like they are special or taste better than others, for their added money difference....same old samosa.... 
I think they take all the extra money on the pound for their extensive interior design and not on the product ..... everywhere else the sweets , I mean the most expensive dollar on the pound is $8 but these guys start from $11.99..... I find this approach towards money mongering people quite arrogant and prude as they know nobody else sells sondesh..I mean its just sondesh thats getting to their head that
\" hey we are the only ones selling sondesh, so we are going to charge the shit out of it !!!!\"...I hope management realises that more and more people will come if they have reasonable prices ...shame I am from Bengal and I have had better sondesh for a really reasonable price...
Sondesh is sold cold and so its hard, you have to leave it to room temperature to enjoy , as everybody know SONDESH IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOFT   ....suck it PREMIUM SWEETs for you aint going to be my regular place to go.... (not like it would matter to them..lol)"}
{"text":"I haven't tried their savory dishes as yet, however the sweets are superb. Like nothing I've had before! The sweets are set up like a patisserie and they have a varied, unique selection. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ive had their sweets and absolutely loved it...not very often you can find clean, sophisticated and quality desi sweet shops...sweet yoghurt, ras malai n shondesh etc...very delicious...a must try!!!"}
{"text":"The nicest dessert place I have ever seen. Clean and modern inside. Very helpful staff. Large selecton"}
{"text":"I strongly recommend visiting the place to everyone not only for the great food but also for the great customer service. I visited the Mississauga branch during Ramadan and assumed the place will be crowded. So, my expectation the customer service will be bad. I was wrong. Every employee was well trained, patient, polite and detail oriented. We ordered sweets, iftar platter, papri chat, samosa etc and truly enjoyed. Price is higher compared to other places, but the quality is amazing. No complaints.

The Scarborough place is also well known for sweets, however, its small compared to the Mississauga branch. Will visit again for Biriyani.
Best wishes for their future endeavors."}
{"text":"I went to the premium sweets location in Mississauga. It's a clean place. But my gosh the price it staggeringly too high. I bought briyani rice, and that was $11.99 just for a box of rice. I also bought a chicken curry, and guess how much that cost, $14.75. And you would think for that price you will get healthy amount of chicken curry, nope, that server was so skimpy. She gave me two small chicken pieces, literally the chicken was the size of a two year olds palm, that's how small the pieces were. So two small pieces of chicken and the rest was gravy. And because they sell their curries by weight, what the server did was, she dumped a lot of gravy in the box, so when she weighs it, it'll be more, and they could charge more. Their chicken curry is $12.99 per pound, so essentially I paid $14.75 for two tiny pieces of chicken and gravy. In total I paid $30 something for a box of briyani and a box of chicken curry that had two tiny pieces of chicken and the rest was gravy. THIS PLACE IS TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE, I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN, AND WILL TELL ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO NEVER GO THERE TOO.   I know food is expensive now a days, totally get that, but this is like daylight robbery, for the amount of food. Mississauga is full of Indian fast food and sweets restaurant, with fair prices and decent portion sizes, so why would I go to premium sweets and pay this much. My first time and my last time."}
{"text":"The ingredients and the overall quality is pretty good. However, a little bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"The mithai itself was v good and I tried the dahi fuchka which was also good. However the service sucked. Everyone who works there is SLOW! Like really slow. I went at a time when no one was at the store and all the sales people were just handing around doing nothing. The lady who initially greeted me told me to let her know when I was ready. I went to her and she said she was serving someone else now and to go to someone else. Wow. My recommendation will be to fix the customer service and perhaps have more pro active sales associates who can handle crowds. If they couldn't handle one person in an empty restaurant I'm not sure how they manage a crowd. All the sweets I tried were v good though so that makes up for the lack of service."}
{"text":"Tasty food and good service but not worth the $ in my opinion. 

Be aware: Their website provided misleading info attached below. They did not honor their own advertisement.  http://www.premiumsweets.ca/ca/signaturefood"}
{"text":"I have been to this place few times, and they have amazing Yogurt ( old fashioned in a clay pot, they even have individual size Yogurt comes in a small clay cup, their Bangladeshi sweets selection are pretty vast and good

I have also tried their Chotpotti (  similar to indian chat dishes ) and it was awesome but way to spicy for me ) 

I am going try their Biriyani soon and will update 

Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"The sweets and chat items are the best in GTA. They also serve pre-cooked lunch and dinner.  Please avoid it. It's very oily and tastes like rubber."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite Indian restaurant. Their customer service is excellent and their food is to die for. They take the simplest dishes and make them into an exotic extraordinary culinary experience. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is your one stop shop to find Bengali sweets and foods! The sales reps are super helpful and friendly. Seeing that we weren't familiar with the desserts, our rep immediately offered us a sample of a variety of the displayed sweets. Many of the sweets here have a sugar-free variant, so be sure to check for that if you prefer a less sweet alternative. Also, they have a hot food table where they serve traditional Bengali dishes such as biryani and samosas!"}
{"text":"Ok so where is zero star option? ??? Shittiest Mithai/sweets in the entire world. Gulab jamun, ras gulla,  barfi. ... all have some sorta plasticy synthetic flavor.  The oil they have used to fry all the Mithai must be very old. Wouldn't buy anything from here next time. No one can compete Bengali sweets besides India Bazaar on Albion."}
{"text":"Awesome  food great service good atmosphere....very good staff  ..and premium sweet    no one bit..."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Bengali cuisine with amazing food quality, quantity and customer service. Highly recommend the restaurant! The environment is family friendly and the décor is fancy. And of course it is Halal which is a plus!
I had the Walima Roast and it was so good! It smelled exactly like the food you can only find in Bangladesh!"}
{"text":"We have been picking up Bengali Sweets from Premium for quite some time now. 

Hands down the best Bengali sweets anywhere in Canada. The quality would be hard to beat - however quality comes at a price. The prices are way above normal. Mind you, I am not complaining about the prices. 

Their Sondesh is as pure as it can get and sweetness is just perfect. Indian sweets can very high in sugar. But Bengali Sweets not as much (most items), and Premium Sweets specially keeps sugar low. I hope it continues. Their Kaju Katli made from cashews is incredible. Lm

Their Desi Ghee - clarified butter is the best our family has ever tasted. Comes incredibly close to home made that great grand parents made when they had cows/buffaloes in their back yard. 

The only pet peeve - as soon as you enter \"welcome to Premium Sweets, please take a number\". However when we went, there was nobody in the entire restaurant! But the lady insisted that we take a number. Upon giving the number, she goes and does her cleaning stuff and putting the everything away. When she the took the number we assumed she was ready to serve. The putting away stuff took a good five minutes. Why let us take the number, then upon taking the number from us do other stuff, when you are not ready?

PS. BTW, upon checking in Yelp offered a $25 coupon for $20!! Thanks Yelp"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service...please don't order any party platter from here... they don't care abt customer needs... the ppl in customer service r inexperienced unprofessional... paid $150 for a platter but they didn't even bother to assist me... the person named Tina ( can't even speak properly) didn't think it's her job to listen to the customer. Don't think we will ever go back there."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Love the 'kushboo pulav' and Walima roast chicken combination. Very nice dish.
I believe they can improve on their service and specially on how to give an order which is confusing for someone first time coming in."}
{"text":"Typical bengali place.. the sweets are all bengali.. didnt like the taste much coz I haven't had much of bengali stuff.. the 3 star is for cleanliness, staff and customer service.. (all 3 were 5 star)"}
{"text":"The best Bengali sweet shop in Toronto. This is the Scarborough branch of the chain from Mississauga. Mouth watering collection and amazingly fresh. They have a very wide variety of sweets, so far I have tasted the followings:

1. Sanar Toast  (moderately sweet)
2. Cream Jamon (sweet)
3. Malay Curry(it's not curry, it's just the name) (sweet)
4. Laddu (sweet)
5. Kheer Toast (moderately sweet)
6. Saffron Toast(not sure about the name) (moderately sweet)
7. Balushai (moderately sweet)

Most people do not like the overly sweet taste of Bangladeshi/Bengali sweets or desserts. Premium sweets understands that very well. They allow you to sample taste the sweets if it is your first time, so that you can make your decision. People working here are very friendly and puts customers first. The sweets are best enjoyed at close to room temperature as the cream and syrup oozes out and fills your mouth. This is the only sweet shop from the Indian sub continent that I will recommend to people from other ethnicity with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"The service was sufficient and the flavours were great but the chicken in the butter chicken was way over cooked and dry and the salad that came with the shish kabob was pre chopped too early so it was browned. If not for these two issues I would have given 4 stars. 

Prices were on the higher end but not outrageous and the decor was nice. I would visit again and try some other items because the flavours were really good."}
{"text":"This place represents our Bengali culture very well. Let's talk about their food and sweets. 

Sweet: fresh, tasty and authentic. But too pricey. 

Food: I tried Moughlai Paratha and Morog Polao (Bengali style Chicken Pilaf). Moughlai Paratha was not similar what we get in Kolkata.  There was almost no filling, just a thin layer of egg and on side only some gravy. It's not recommended. 

Morog Polao was really tasty and authentic. Quantity was good but again too costly. 

Overall I had a mixed experience, maybe I'll try this place once again."}
{"text":"One stop place for all kinds of authentic Bangladeshi food and sweets. Nice staff, great food, great price, a very clean & open space, and good service. There are few tables where you can sit and have your food. Our food was served at the table after placing the order at the counter.

We were there on a festival day. It was very crowded and a bit chaotic. But the staff handled the situation pretty well. So first thing you do is get a number as soon as you enter the shop to be ahead in the queue and once ready a server will call your number. From that point onward that server will take care of all of your needs including the bill payment. The only downside was we had to find our server to pay the bill once we were done eating as she got busy serving other customers. Probably this problem won't happen in case of a takeout order and or if they would have processed the bill before we start eating. It may be a little bit confusing for a new customer. 

Four of us tried different preparations of chicken, shrimp and beef combos with  polao (rice cooked with butter) and khicuri (rice cooked with lentil). Each dish served in a clay pot, topped with a butter naan (ask for it as the other option is to serve them in a plate separately) which looked really spectacular and tasted delicious. The rice and meat/fish - whatever your combo is cooked/warmed-up in the clay pot and than covered with a butter naan. It was really steamy hot inside. The naan was very soft and flavorful. You will cut open the naan from top and then eat the food from inside. This was an interesting experience. Each combo also came with a salad of our choice on the side. We also had tried Doi Fuchka (a round, bite size, hollow puri - a deep fried crisp and savory bread - full of all kinds of goodies) as an appetizer. It was amazingly delicious and simply melted in our mouth.  

There are plenty of space to park your car in-front of the shop. Also this is in a place where driving makes more sense or may be the only option. I will definitely return to try a different combo and the sweets."}
{"text":"Take a number and when it's your turn, an attendant will escort you around to the various stations. If you're not sure or not familiar with something, the friendly helper will give you a taste. It's such a fun and colourful place! I wanted to love it but despite all the free tastes and good service, I didn't love the food. The sweets really disappointed me. They were so beautifully presented on cute little stands - I was entranced. I bought a big box plus an entire box of saffron gulab jamon (I love them).

In my house, we never waste food. We hardly ever throw good food in the garbage. Unfortunately, the gulab jamon was so heavy that, after a week, they were still in the box, uneaten. Gut bombs. For the first time in my life, I threw 2 gulab jamuns away! 

I'm back to Sweet India on Airport Road. The store is not half as pretty as Premium but the food is twice as delicious and at half the price!"}
{"text":"It's a new location and has a lot of Bangladeshis visiting the place (Premium is a famous brand out there). It has sweets, snacks & meals. The staff is super attentive however it gets crowded and confusing as there are folks who are there just to buy sweet vs folks to dine in. I personally felt that the tables are too close to each other and that makes it a crowded place. Items like Biryani are priced on par with restaurants that have just dine-in which I thought was quite high. There is some space on the floor above which could be used. Overall, the place needs to make sure that it justifies the high pricing with the service, food,  and setting."}
{"text":"I am here second time. Best place for Bangladeshi sweet !! Fantastic service and good  I like to invite all Bangladeshi  enjoy the hospitality and best sweet!!"}
{"text":"A great place for Bangladeshi / Indian food. It's the newly opened second branch of Premium Sweets (the other one is in Mississauga). Nicely decorated interior, clean and moderately spacious. The staff are really nice, offers great services with smile.

It has a wide choice of foods, starting from curries, biriyani, tehari, sweets and street foods. The taste and quality is really good, much higher than average. Definitely recommend if someone is craving for good Bangladeshi / Indian food.

We had their signature item Achari Khichuri with Beef Aloo, Ruhi fish, Beef Kala Bhuna. Tastes great!!"}
{"text":"A signature store for Bangladeshi and Indian foods!!! No doubt it's one of the best deshi food shops in Toronto / GTA. They have a good selection of sweets, local street food (snacks / chats) and main course meals. Some of the main course foods may be bit too hot for some (for me the Tehari is spicy hot, but my wife loves it). The Kala Bhuna Gosh is excellent, specially with Achari Khichuri. Overall... whoever loves to taste spicy food or deshi sweets must visit this place... and likely will get addicted, like us  ;-)"}
{"text":"Good selection of food, went during lunch, but terrible service. Asian lady who helped us was very deceiving. We ordered Briyani combo and she asked us to pick a side as if it was included. No mention of what is suppose to be included and upcharged as much as possible. Got my food, waited at the cash for about 5 minutes and no one wanted to help me pay for the food so after waiting for a while, had to ask one of the ladies if I could pay, was told we can pay later. Thats no problem, after finishing our meal, bill came to $15 for Briyani Combo
portions were really small, price was the same as going to an indian lunch buffet instead. Food is decent, but found the deceiving service left a bad taste. Would not go back or recommend.

In summary, way over priced food for small portion."}
{"text":"Amazing collection of authentic Bengali sweets.  You just cant go wrong with them.  Malai Chap,  Khir Toast,  Khir Kadam,  Chamcham,  misti doi are really really good.  Feel free to sample and sample and then make your selection.  Veggie singara is not the really the authentic singhara - for some unknown reason does not taste like back home. Have still not tried their food so cant comment on it..  Sweets - you cant go wrong with them"}
{"text":"I like sweets but only sometimes and I am picky, so when my friend told me about the place , I promised her I would check it out. When I went in I noticed it was a very clean restaurant with snacks, lunch and many kinds of sweets. 

The best thing that I like about this place is that they sample whatever you want to try before ordering. I tried some sweets, they were soo good, not very sweet and extremely soft texture. Liked it, and then bought some diff kinds for the family. 

I also send sweets for my sister in law who is in California, she loves it, they package it very well to send it abroad. 

They have expanded the area and now its big , its very clean and the staff is polite too. People with sweet tooth must try. They will love it for sure."}
{"text":"Review based on atmosphere, service, & SAMPLES.  :)))

Coming from a neighbouring restaurant, full to the brim, I couldn't even think of food.  However, the friend I was with asked for some samples, so who am I to say no to free samples??!! 

More info to consider:  1)  I do not have a sweet tooth and 2) I'm not a HUGE fan of Indian sweets, primarily because I find them sickeningly sweet, too dairy-ish (in an evaporated milk sorta way), & God only knows the shelf life of these things due to the amount of sugar that's in it.

On the contrary, the sweets here at Premium Sweets weren't too sweet, too evaporated milky, or old-tasting.  They were actually quite \"fresh\".  I also tasted a piece of some kinda flat, deep fried Pakora thing, but it was not hot, so it was difficult for me to eat anymore/get a fair sense of whether or not their snacks were good.  Service was also nice and attentive.  

In terms of their atmosphere, I was actually impressed!  It was new, organised, CLEAN & décor was modern.  Very nice.  The direct opposite when I think of other Indian places that I've been to for sweets/snacks, think:  5&10.  Prices were a coupla dollars more expensive than the dumpy places, but I guess you're contributing to the atmosphere.  

If I was in the area &/or going to an Indian party and expected to bring something fitting, this place would definitely be my first stop!"}
{"text":"Bangladeshi food at its best. Pricey for sure but the clean and spacious environment  is worth the extra $. We ordered kala bhuna beef with achari khichuri, faluda and kolija shingara, all met our expectations and then some. Service was great too. 
So good to have food like back home right here in Toronto."}
{"text":"There are lots of little Bengali snacks and sweets shops in the GTA, but nothing beats Premium Sweets. My parents, originally from Bangladesh, were thrilled when they heard Premium Sweets was expanding to Scarborough! 

The sweets taste authentic, they offer a HUGE variety and also offer great customer service. If you're not sure what to get they give you samples of their sweets and also offer cute packaging if you were to take it as a gift!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant, the waitresses are super attentive and a lot of choices available for sweets. You can try before you buy which is always a nice perk because you don't want to end up paying for sweets you don't even like. The savoury options are definitely fresh and authentic, my favourite is the doi fuchka. Also while waiting they have snacks so you don't feel bored which is also a nice perk. Overall, this is one of the best sweet shops in Missisauga and I would definitely recommend visiting here to buy sweets. They also have unique flavours that are also very well made and high quality."}
{"text":"Bangali mishti is one of a kind and cannot be easily replicated. Laddoos can't compare to the kacha shondesh I used to have back in Bangladesh, and this is hands down the one place that has had the most authentic shondesh I've tasted away from home. Very clean location as well!"}
{"text":"We had the goat Biryani, paapdi chaat, and Gulab jamun, rosgulla and moti choor laddo.

Highly recommend all of the above! The Biryani was very flavourful and the meat cooked perfectly. 

I especially loved the Jamun filled with Saffron!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the great decorations and clean environment. But at the end of the day it is a restaurant and the taste of the food is anything but good (way too oily). We ordered chotpoti and the tamarind in it was so overpowering that it felt like I am eating tamarind chutney. Upon telling that it was not good at all, the server replied \"sorry about that\". Unfortunately people from South East Asia knows nothing about customer service, since according North American standards this will be immediately taken back and replaced. I guess buy their sweets and nothing else."}
{"text":"Very good sweets especially the kala jamun and the mihi dana. Need to try their fish delicacies. I am a bong and appreciate the taste. The chaats are not good . Sweets are good.! Possibly a 3.75"}
