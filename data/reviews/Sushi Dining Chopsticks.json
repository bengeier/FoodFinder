{"text":"This is definitely one of my fave places for sushi. I live all the way in the South but I have no problem making the trip for this place. Nice, freindly atmosphere. Not super fancy inside, but the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Sushi restaurant in all of Calgary, I live in the SE and don't even hesitate driving to the NE to enjoy a sushi experience.  Great atmosphere, amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised there aren't any reviews about this place. This place is fantastic.

First, coming in through the door you are greeted by the chef. Yes, the chef. I expected a waitress to come and greet us, but the chef was making sushi in the center of the room, where he can be seen by anyone in the restaurant, and he even greeted us. He asked us how many people we had, and told us to just choose a spot.

The menu is very similar to Globefish (I've heard the previous owners opened up Globefish), some of the prices are the same, some are significantly cheaper, but the selection is the same. They have lunch specials from 11:30 - 2:30pm but I didn't get to experience that. The waitress kept checking us to place our order. I thought that was very good of her, and similar to El's, she is the only waitress serving people. 

For decor, the place isn't decorated as much, so I could not really record the decorations as they were not really noticeable. However they do have a flat screen TV hanging from the roof, with subtitles for our enjoyment. The restaurant is fairly compact in size, but it manages to fit in about 7 - 8 tables, with the middle being the walkway. I thought it was very convenient.

We ordered the Sushi Chopsticks combo, which consisted of 3 rolls: California, Spicy Tuna, and (I think) Dynamite rolls. The waitress was very helpful in helping us figure out what was inside our orders. We also got the Namban Chicken that came with miso soup. The chicken was delicious, and the dressing for the salad was very cool and sweet. What caught my eye after we placed our order for sushi, we could see the chef in the middle at the front just preparing the rolls. Michael (the chef) prepares the rolls very quick and organized. 

The fish literally melted in your mouth. They give very big portions, and I loved the spicy tuna, but the sauce was a bit too spicy. The california roll was alright (my boyfriend loved them though), and the dynamite (it had shrimp tempura in it I think) roll was really different, but tasty. We also got salmon rolls after our first round, but the rolls were kind of warm and not cold. After, we got really full and our bill just came under $30. 

Overall, the quality of food is excellent. However, with the easy rolls, preparation might be rushed, so they don't turn out as well, but they still are great. A bonus that I thought was cool was that the waitress wrote Thank you in Japanese on the back of our receipt. The chef also thanks you right before you leave the restaurant.

Sushi Dining Chopsticks is open from 11:00am - 10:00pm on weekdays and Sat, which is very convenient if you're a student just coming home from school around 3:30 - 4:30. Wait times don't really exist, and there is always a table available."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for sushi, because of the ambiance, service, and overall quality of the menu items. 

The ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.

Since the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.

The fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.' 

I give Sushi Dining Chopsticks a 5-star rating for being an overall awesome dinner destination."}
{"text":"My first foray into Calgary's sushi scene. I didn't have high hopes for this place and just stopped in based on the other yelpers reviews. First thing, I know I will have to get used to the high price of sushi in this town! The decor is simple and like your standard sushi joint in a strip mall. The food...we had the chopsticks roll lunch special: dynamite, California and spicy tuna roll along with that we had an order of yam and shrimp tempura. The roll combo came with miso soup, it was fine but nothing special. As for the sushi, it really was a let down. I liked that they didn't over do it on the rice but other than that there was nothing standoutish about the rolls. I would suggest to avoid the spicy tuna - the sauce on it was just not quite right. The tempura was fried in a heavy batter - very hard and crunchy! This brings me to another general comment for all sushi places; why is the shrimp NEVER de-veined? Grosses me out every time.

All in all, I likely won't be back. Am a bit surprised that I had such a different experience than the other yelpers, but maybe i was expecting to much from a place in a strip mall off a main highway!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at this restaurant was when it first opened many years ago.  The original owners have since moved onto better and bigger things (namely they opened Globefish).  I think they sold the restaurant because they have quickly outgrown the small space, and the rumour of the stripmall redeveloping probably had something to do with it too.   I can still remember the for sale ad from the original owners saying that they would train the buyer of the restaurant on how to make sushi.  As far as I can tell, the current owner was trained by the original owners.

Fast forward to today, the decor and much of the menu have not changed.  Their sushi making skill is probably better than when they first bought the restaurant.  However, they still have a lot to learn to catch up to the original owner's standard.  I probably have not patronized this restaurant in 1-2 years.  I came with a few co-workers as this is the nearest sushi place nearby.  I had one of their lunch combo.  Overall the taste was ok, nothing spectacular.... and can be considered as average sushi in Calgary.  One thing that was kind of disappointing was how thin they sliced their fish on their nigiri sushi, worse than some AYCE sushi place.  I probably won't be back to this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"I guess I'm still on my sushi kick. Tonight's visit was my first time here and even though it's across the city from me it definitely won't be the last. First off the service was great (although our server seemed constantly confused lol). The food came to the table super fast and was excellent. This is probably the best sushi I've had since I was last in Vancouver. Not only was it fast and fresh, but the portions were decent and the price wasn't too bad. I can honestly say that this was one of my better sushi experiences and I would recommend this location to anyone.

{"text":"Just a tid-bit of history, chopsticks was originally Globefish, so this place has the exact same menu, for then GF is closed on Mondays, Chopsticks will be available!!

Intimate dining space so try to get a table away from the drafty door.
Service is always immaculate, and staff are friendly. Menu pretty much follows the globefish menu except the specials are different. Quiet during lunch hours and wait times are never long. 

Sushi portions are plenty, fresh, and well presented. I am never unhappy =) And I'm greedy!"}
