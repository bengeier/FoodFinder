{"text":"Great food with an Indian twist! You can't go wrong for $10 with the massive butter chicken wrap from Eastern Twist. 

No frills, lots of delish thrills."}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken wrap is good specially their spicy carrot topping!!! I always get it for lunch on the weekend......yaaas"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've had the wraps here for a couple of years. Very filling food (I feel like I overate when I leave and keep going back.) Very friendly and cheerful staff."}
{"text":"Situated right on the increasingly bustling corner of Bathurst and St Clair lies an inconspicuous and unflattering little take out place that by all means looks like a run of the mill pan Asian restaurant specializing in mediocre food with jacked up prices; but man what first looks just don't know. 
This place is not one for the decor, it's more of a takeout place and it's just find the way it is because the food here is simply fantastic and while not all of its dishes measure up to the same quality as others, most of the dishes are quite tasty and reasonably priced. 
The point to remember when going here is to order a 'paratha' wrap rather than a dish which comes with rice. Now don't get me wrong, the rice and its even sexier sibling coconut rice is just fine here, but the freshly made paratha bread straight out of the over is at the top of my list as the best wrap bread I have ever tasted.
It's rich in flavour and infuses palatable elements of other delectable flat breads like nan into a stretchy, chewy masterpiece which surrounds your choice of sumptuous fillings like butter chicken or various vegetable masala's in what quickly becomes a textural delight upon completion. 
To top it off, every paratha wrap is served with very fresh standard veg like salad and tomato's and some unique options like spicy marinated carrots and your choice of a variety of amazing sauces like tamarind and hot sauce. 
Last but not least, it's very important to mention the absolutely gargantuan size of each paratha wrap which, to put it in ethereal terms, is roughly the size of a medium human head and feels like it weighs a good kg and a half. Thankfully, it does not feel that heavy in your stomach because of its wealth of healthy ingredients and the high quality of the ingredients used, Also, for those looking to get their money's worth, the massive paratha wrap is often large enough to be divided into 2 separate meals if you are not exceptionally hungry. 
I would recommend the Caribbean Chicken if you are looking for something with meat and the potato curry if you are looking for something vegetarian. I almost exclusively get the potato curry because I think it's not only the best tasting and most filling option on the menu, but it also happens to be the cheapest at $5.95. C'mon, where else in Toronto are you going to get a massively healthy and tasty wrap for 7 bucks tax included?
Answer: Eastern Twist"}
{"text":"I always love coming here. The food is fresh and flavourful. I've always had a good experience here and am happy that it's so close to my apartment. Definitely appreciating it during the cold seasons!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Eastern Twist for the better part of three years since I work in the area and can easily depend on consistent friendly service every time I walk in the door. I order the spinach chickpea wrap on whole wheat and am satisfied (and very full) every time without fail. The wraps and bread are delicious and the portion size is healthy. 
Next time you're on your way to Subway, stop, turn back and try this place instead."}
{"text":"Great fast food made well. They offer vegetarian options and plant-based gravy made from them which it taste just like regular gravy. My boyfriend couldn't even tell it was vegeterian. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place for grab and go food, especially for lunch or after a long work day.  I used to live around the corner from this place.  Ordered food so often from here that the owners recognize me and knew exactly what I wanted.  Yep, sometimes still willing to drive half way across the city for the food.  Love the spices and the after taste that still lingers in the mouth after all the food is gone."}
{"text":"I love this place! So close to where I live, quick and delicious. My favorite things to get are the butter chicken wrap and the bbq chicken wrap, with tamarind sauce! Whole wheat or white, the wrap is so yummy. Also the fries, made spicy (with spices not necessarily the burn your mouth type). The people who work here are extremely sweet, and they even know me as a regular now (lol!). Small place to eat, so tend to always take out instead of dine in."}
{"text":"Really great food! Have tried the BBQ chicken, butter chicken, chickpea with spinach as well as potato with spinach wraps. Prefer with butter chicken and potato with spinach wraps. Flavors are amazing.
Perfect for take-out.
The wrap itself (I get whole wheat) is so delicious.
I'm a fan and a repeat customer for sure! 
We have gone back many times"}
{"text":"The butter chicken wrap is really good, followed closely by chickpea and other veggie wraps"}
{"text":"The food here was exceptional.  The staff are very friendly and the food is well made. I had the potato chickpea wrap and it was amazing.  Very very filling.  Prices are good and place is clean but small.  Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Love this place -- great vegetarian options (not sure how the vegan side of things go)...."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ chicken wrap and also delicious coconut cream noodles with an egg on top! Probably the best little meal we've had under $20. 
Called the order in for pickup on a 15min estimate, and it was kept quite hot all the way home. 
They were sold out of the butter chicken wrap so we'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"The wraps here (both vegetarian and meat-based) are all delicious. Personally, I think they could stand to be slightly more substantial, given the price-point; highly recommended nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place is in my old 'hood and I used to pop in once in a while for their coconut noodle soup. Very similar to Malaysian Lhaksa with rich coconut milk broth, skinny yet satisfying noodles, asian herbs and boiled egg. YUM. Their butter chicken wrap is really very good, as well. I've had it both in the wrap (wow.. the bread was really delicious) and without-- just eaten as a curry. Both times I was impressed with the deep level of spice and moist chicken.

I do find the service varies from really helpful and nice to major attitude, but they'll always make my food super-kill me- drive a burning metal spike through my skull- hot!"}
{"text":"I hate to disagree with Mike S.'s great review below, but I've had three meh experiences at Eastern Twist.  I wish I could love it, but no luck.

1) Food; fine but bland.  Perhaps a little pricey for the portions.

2) Service: total loss.  My first two servers were charming but bizarrely incompetent, and the guy who served me yesterday looked so bored and sulky I thought his brain was about to collapse and create a black hole.

Honestly, I could get more food, tastier food, and less sulk next door at the Subway.  How lame is that?"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today, on my sister's recommendation. Had a BBQ chicken wrap on a whole wheat roti/paratha. Added lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and yogurt/tamarind/mango sauces. It was delicious! Had a slight kick (I have wimpy tastebuds), was very flavourful. I found the service to be very polite and friendly, and it was quick because there was no one else there at the time :) Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Such a gem! One of my favorite things to get for lunch is the chickpea and spinach wrap. The butter chicken one is also delicious. 

Good idea to call in advance, as sometimes it can take 5-10 mins if you order in store."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken wrap which was excellent. The spicy carrots are delicious.  Looking forward to trying other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Ok for real, the butter chicken roti is the best goddamn roti I have ever had. I dream about it when I'm not with it. When I have it, every bite carries just a little bit of anxiety because I am one step closer to being without it. As soon as it's gone, no matter how stuffed I am, I want another. At first I balked at the $11 price tag--then I tried one and realized it was a small price to pay for a little taste of heaven. It takes a long time for a carry-out shop but, clearly, I am willing to wait."}
{"text":"Dear Eastern Twist.  I miss you!  
Since having relocated out of the Bathurst and St Clair area, there are few things about the old hood that have me feeling sad and nostalgic. The wraps at Eastern Twist are a serious factor.  I now live about 45min away, and I've gone THAT far to stop in here.  What?!  
  This is a small, independently owned shop, with a name that in my eyes, does not conjure what it should.  Aside from that, the offerings at this little stop have yet failed to disappoint.  Granted, as others have pointed out, previous staffing have proved the experience less than rich, however, I'll note that upon recent visits, no sign if pouty pants or the bizarre one who kept calling me \"Helen\" (even after correcting her) were seen.  In fact, I did like the young lady who assembled my meal.  
  Now, aside from all that, the food here is really great.  A bit in the pricier side compared to the adjoining food stops, but, this is far more interesting, tasty, and independent.  So, there.  The BBQ chicken wrap comes in a giant portion, rolled up in a slightly chewy, soft paratha wrap, either white or whole wheat.  The chicken is fresh, cooked to order, ANC mighty good.  Add in some handsome offerings of lettuce, coriander, some achar (spicy pickled veg), and hot sauce, and you are off to enjoy.  Other great dishes include the butter chicken wrap, potato curry, and zafrani Palau.  You know how the dog stomps his leg when you scratch that spot on his belly just right?  This is what happens to me when I bit into a wrap from here. 
  Sigh.  If only they delivered."}
{"text":"Consistent go-to for fresh barata wrap with my fave being spinach and chickpeas w/ chili fries combo."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Butter Chicken Wrap (white) and the Coconut Curry Noodle. My first time ordering from here and both was amazing!

You get to put any toppings you want for your wrap. The butter chicken already has enough to flavouring to it so no need to put much other than lettuce and tomato in my opinion.

They seem to be known for the wraps! So make sure to stick with those or ask what's popular***"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer here for a year now, and before I move out of the neighbourhood, I feel almost obliged to share how much I love Eastern Twist. I almost always order a spinach and chickpea wrap, which winds up being one of the taste highlights of my week. You simply won't find elsewhere anything like the paratha that they use to form the wrap; it's charred and textured like naan, but much thinner and less fluffy, yet chewier than roti. The spinach and chickpea curry within the wrap is as good as anything you'd find at a much pricier dine-in south asian restaurant. And the other toppings are excellent, especially the achar, which gives the dish a challenging but perfect amount of heat. Every other \"naan wrap\" disappoints in comparison.

Also: the staff are some of the sweetest people in the world! I'll miss them when I've moved away."}
{"text":"Eastern Twist is a great addition to the Bathurst/St Clair area. It's nice to have a fast-food option that isn't Pizza Pizza or Subway (or, now, Harvey's).

The restaurant offers a diverse options, with a variety of flavourful curries and seasoned meats. When I go to Eastern Twist, it's usually for a paratha wrap. My favourite tends to be the spicy beef wrap, though the BBQ chicken tikka wrap and the butter chicken wrap are both delicious too -- the butter chicken is the best bet for someone who does not like things spicy. The paratha (bread) itself is absolutely scrumptious.

Once the bread and filling are ready, you can choose which toppings you'd like to add. These include lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and (very) spicy carrots. There are yogurt and tamarind sauces as well. Beware the carrots! They are delicious, but will be too spicy for some people's tastes.

The vegetarian samosas are cheap and delectable as well.

Everything is made to order, so you may have to wait for 10 or so minutes for it to be ready. You can call in an order to pick up, but I have had mixed results describing what I want and getting it right.

On the whole, I love having the option of grabbing a bite here rather than the standard fast-food options nearby."}
{"text":"This fast-food place is surrounded by big-name chains so it appears to get lost in the crowd. I went in before work one day and placed my order of BBQ chicken poutine. Was told about 5 minutes after I placed my order that it would be another 10 minutes. There isn't really anywhere to sit so it became an awkward situation between myself and the hostess while I waited. There was no one else in the place while I was there.

The food itself was really good and was a fairly good size. So if you're looking for something different in fast-food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I debated trying this little shop on many occasions before finally making it in - it definitely lacks curb appeal! Don't let that hold you back, though - arguably some of the best wraps in the city. The wrap fillings are great (only the Seekh Kabob is not to my taste), and you can customize with toppings (go for the achar - mostly julienned carrots in their version - if you like things SPICY) and sauces (mango, tamarind, and yoghurt). What really makes the wraps though are the parathas...I've only had the whole-wheat (which is just delicious) but for those of you who aren't that adventurous there is a white flour version too. I love the whole wheat parathas so much that I'll order it as a side to their Coconut Cream Noodle Soup with Gravy. The with Gravy only signifies that the soup doesn't have chunks of chicken...go for the added chicken if you must, but I don't miss it. A small soup and a whole wheat paratha will fill your tummy with deliciousness for $10 - a $10 well spent!"}
{"text":"Sandwiched in with a Harvey's and Subway, this place deserves more attention from people looking for a quick snack.. or even dinner.

We usually drop in for the coconut milk soup with chicken to go. A large is enough for three people to share (and for about $12 after tax, that's not too bad), although we usually also serve it over fresh white rice at home, despite it being a noodle soup. It's tasty and fresh, coming after usually about a ten minute wait. Their wraps, which I've had a few times, are okay, but not quite as special as the soup.

The staff at Eastern Twist are very pleasant and welcoming. Even kitchen staff will greet you when you arrive and when you leave. Dining space at the restaurant is pretty limited and it's obviously intended to be a take-out place for most.

I definitely recommend the coconut milk soup to anyone in the neigbhourhood. They have a chicken-less version as well for those looking to avoid meat. Skip the rest of the typical fast food franchise places and go here."}
{"text":"I was living on Queen and love Gandhi, so when I moved in this area I was kinda wish Gandhi has a location here, but  Eastern Twist fix that for me yeaa !!!
I order the butter chicken on rice ( xtra spicy ), very good
so judging from that, I think their food's very good.
I will order other things from them for sure.
prices are average  $10"}
{"text":"came here with my friends after visiting casa Loma. The wait was a little bit long but the food was really good. The wrap is nice sand warm and the sauces are very tasty. I got the bbq chicken with yogurt sauce and mango sauce.  My friends got the butter chicken and they say it's pretty good. But be warned, it will get messy because of the sauces."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love their wraps!!! What everyone else says is correct 10/10, and I'm Indian! Must have is the carrot pickle,  spicy and flavourful add it to any dish! As everyone says the wait is 10-15 minutes for a wrap but the paratha is made fresh and definitely worth the wait!!!!

Always call ahead and place ur order it's the best way since no convenient parking nearby :( I usually park in the pizza pizza but be wary obviously."}
{"text":"Had the the butter chicken warp. Probably some of the best BC in the city. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Eastern Twist isn't your average take on indian inspired wraps. Each menu item is made fresh to order and wrapped in the most mouth watering naan style bread. Your choices are always consistent and the toppings are fresh. My recommendations are the Butter Chicken and Seekh kabob wraps. They rarely disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've been twice and loved the food. I had the veggie curry. Yum.  The fresh paratha bread is particularly awesome as a hangover-happy food! I had good service both times. Alice served me on my most recent trip and she was very friendly. 

Do not buy the drinks there, however! The orange juice had settled so much it looked like apple juice with a bright orange ring at the bottom. To be safe, my partner ordered a fruit punch. It looked fine from the outside but when he got to the bottom...lots of red flakes. It was gross. 

Otherwise, great for takeout to bring home and eat with your own beverages! They have great hours but are closed on Sundays, which is unfortunate! 

I find the prices very reasonable for such delicious, fresh fusion."}
{"text":"Tried the wrap with spinach and potato .. I liked it .. topped it with some Achar (like indian pickles), yogurt, coriander leaves and tomatoes .. yummm :)"}
{"text":"I walk by this place all the time but never had a chance to stop in. Finally the other day while running errands I decided to stop in and try the famous butter chicken wrap. In reading previous reviews I knew it would take time so I placed my order and returned after a trip to the post office. 

The paratha was fresh and butter chicken was nice and hot. There are plenty of toppings and sauces to choose from but be careful because the more you add the messier it'll be. I'm not a fan of spice so I steered clear of the carrots but they looked delish. 

I would definitely come back and maybe ask if I can get rice inside the wrap to soak up the sauce and hope it's not as messy. 

Edited to add that rice inside the wrap is the way to go! It soaks up all the delicious sauce and makes it easier to eat. Never falls apart on me now."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars

I used to live down the street from Eastern Twist and would go at least once a week for their amazing Indian-style wraps. 

It's easy to miss walking by as it doesn't look that exciting from the outside, but I'm so glad I went in one day!

The wraps are phenomenal (+definitely get a wrap and not the rice dishes... rice is good but wraps are what this place is best for). I used to get the Butter Chicken and the omlette, I don't like spicy foods so both were perfect and so flavourful. I don't think I need to reiterate others' comments about how delicious the wrap bread is, you really have to try it to understand, just take mine and other Yelper's words for it! I have no idea what it is, but it is delicious.

The women who work there are very nice and friendly. You do have to wait a few minutes since they make the wraps on the spot, but I didn't mind waiting since the food is so good. Plus you can call in advance if you are really in a hurry. 

My only issue is I wish they had delivery."}
{"text":"Fantastic butter chicken wrap!!  Super tasty.  The wrap itself has an incredible chewy texture."}
{"text":"Came here with pretty high expectations but was slightly disappointed. The restaurant should really have 2 $ because for a wrap it's $10 (granted, it's pretty big but still). The butter chicken wrap was very good but the spinach and chickpeas was mediocre and not really warm. 

There's also no restaurant here but it's definitely a quick bite place."}
{"text":"Only ever eaten the butter chicken wrap, but it's soooo yummy that I can't bring myself to ever try anything else. 

I've heard the BBQ chicken wrap as well as the chickpea and potato or spinach wraps are great as well so I guess one day I may have to get enough courage to try something else on their menu lol... 

Overall it's not like another wrap I've ever tasted and I highly recommend it even though I do think $11.00 is a little pricy for a wrap but then again, the taste satisfies my craving and suddenly the price doesn't seem to matter :)"}
{"text":"I came her for the first time and to be honest I was very disappointed with this place, food was awful, the new menu is nothing great. I had the chilly dog and to be honest i never had something as bad as that, the seasoning was overpowering and super greasy,i also got a chic-pea rap which was horrible, i don't understand how this place has such good reviews !! Come on people do you know what good food is ??"}
