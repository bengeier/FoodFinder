{"text":"If you're tired, famished, and desperate for food, this is the ideal place! Service was glacial, umbeyonce was bland, and the food basic. 

Our waiter didn't know what guacamole was."}
{"text":"I was in a bit of a rush looking for a quick bite. 

THE AMBIANCE/FOOD:

Located near a pool at the Flamingo Hotel, I came pretty early so it was dead. I wanted something really simple and went with steel cut oats and a coffee. It was my first time having steel cut oats and the oats came with everything on the side. I thought that was interesting. I really liked the oats and even said wow why haven't I tried these before? I enjoyed my breakfast and was out the door. Three (3) stars because the place was super basic and the servers were nowhere in sight most of the time."}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience. The California Eggs Benedict I ordered was delicious and served quickly. Service was good; my water and coffee were never empty. Will definitely eat there again soon."}
{"text":"I'm going with \"decent.\"  I got the California Benedict and it was pretty delicious, everything tasted fresh and I enjoyed this part of the meal most. The home fries on the other hand, were definitely subpar.  They were fried cubes of potatoes - I was v unimpressed.

And now - are you friggin ready for the worst part? THE BERRY MOJITO. First off, I got it half way through my entree...I'm convinced the bartender had to go and pick the mint himself. It was also ALL ice. I was livid. I even told the waiter and he shrugged and smiled. Didn't apologize, didn't try to make another one for me, didn't give it to us for free. I'm attaching a picture. For a $13 cocktail, you would hope for more."}
{"text":"Walked in around 10 am on a Sunday. Sign said to \"seat yourself\". Sat down and waited 5 minutes for somebody to show up. Employees could be heard laughing and having a good time in the back. Got up and took my money somewhere else where they didn't mind being bothered to serve customers."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Platinum for my first time in Vegas. The service was extremely slow. There were only a few customers in the restaurant for breakfast so there shouldn't have been an issue. After ordering a chocolate milk, the milk came to me warm and they had thrown some ice in it to cool it down. It tasted awful. Next came the meal. I got the steak and eggs meal. I ordered a medium steak and it came well done. The eggs were terrible. I ordered them scrambled and they came in a block similar to eggs from McDonalds. The service continued to be slow. I normally don't gripe about food nor do I Yelp but this service and food prompted me to post this review. Your food is terrible, the service is horrible, and for a first timer in Vegas, you have left me with a bad taste. Thanks for $27 worth of shit."}
{"text":"We had 2 late breakfast here, both always very nice experience. Price wise were ok but service always good. Friendly and helpful service from Pieter and Alfonso. Thank you to both of you, without them our breakfast wouldn't be the same."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 20 minutes for a water and apple juice. Had a party of 9 and it took an hour and a half to get the food. Orders were messed up that were specialty. I want to believe they are understaffed but this wasn't the case. The few employees that care about there job made the one star possible. The waitress we had just didn't seem to care or look like she was even present inside her own body. The food was decent which added another star. Avoid eating breakfast here if you are hungover and hungry."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Platinum Hotel and tried Kilawat and was pleased with the food. The Eggs Benedict was really good, service was great and the restaurant was clean. A little expensive but good overall."}
{"text":"Had 30 minutes to get food before my seminar.
So far very very slow service.
The food giver gave our food to another table, who even said it wasn't there's and he left it so they ate it. ALWAYS ASK WHO GOT WHAT!  Don't ASSUME AND GIVE PEOPLE AT THE WRONG TABLE OUR FOOD!
Huge waste of 30 minutes. 
Told server and had to leave.  At the seminar now hungry and mad."}
