{"text":"Steve's Cafe is a great place for breakfast and lunch! I go there about 3-4 times a week. The customer service is awesome. Steve and Amena are very friendly and welcoming.
I love their Spanish omelette for breakfast and they have the best cheese burger I have ever had. The prices are great for the quality of food you get!!!! I would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"They think they are better than they are.  Mediocre sandwich at inflated price. Had better food at lower prices.  Have not returned in 3 weeks and work in a nearby building walking distance.
HUH?"}
{"text":"I love Steve's Cafe. They serve lots of good food at a reasonable price. I've never had anything there that I didn't like, but right now, I'm especially into the Southwestern Chicken Wrap!"}
{"text":"Good, family run cafe. great for local eating."}
{"text":"We buy a lot of lunches from Steve's for meetings.  The price is right for a simple sandwich.  Ruben are very popular.  Steve's is  good place when you need something quick and easy."}
{"text":"The Good:
The owners are super nice. They have a good breakfast burrito. Convenient for anyone who works in the same complex. They have an assortment of sodas, energy drinks, and snacks, which is also convenient for anyone working in the complex.

The Bad:
The place has the look and feel of a hospital waiting room. Its just really sucky looking and depressing on the inside. The coffee is terrible. They have a $5 minimum on credit card charges, which I think is incredibly petty for a business to do. Everything on the menu is more expensive than it should be. 

Because of the look of the place, I have been too reluctant to order anything other than the breakfast burrito, so I can't comment on the quality of their other food."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service ever. I called in two lunch orders and simply asked the soup of the day. I was confronted with a very rude and disrespectful woman on the other end. I will never order from Steve's again. They need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Try Steves delight,

{"text":"Steve's is NOT great. They have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The food is \"Average\" and there isn't anything special about it. Our office order from them often and you would think that they would give us the respect we deserve. After all, they get good business from our company."}
{"text":"Steve's is great! Good food and polite service. Love the omelets but everything on the menu is good."}
{"text":"It is what it is, and what it is, is, solid diner food -- good, quick, solid, inexpensive, consistent. Steve and everyone there get to know you, if you're even a semi regular, and are quite nice. The omelets are great, the burgers solid, the BLT and clubs familiar and tasty, the fries are great, the salads get the job done....

It ain't the Four Seasons, but you're not expecting it to be. Good diner comfort food. Breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I really like this place.
I have had the chicken gyro, steve's chili, and the crispy chicken wrap. Everything is made fresh when you order and I like the quality and service. The menu has everything from sandwiches, salads, wraps, etc. They also serve breakfast too. I had their French fries and they were yummy too! I will tell you the chili is spicy but very good! I can't wait to try more things!"}
