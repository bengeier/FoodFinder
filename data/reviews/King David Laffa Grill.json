{"text":"Small portions but the food quality is great! Went there on a Sunday evening to sit on the patio for dinner and ordered the chicken breast kebob platter. Good service."}
{"text":"Good chicken shawarma on laffa. Amaaazing hummus. Great fries.

With that said, I'm not willing to pay $12 (ever again) for a chicken shawarma on laffa because it's kosher, as mentioned by the staff there. I will try the place next door which was busier, cheaper and has tons more positive reviews. Not crazy about the service either.."}
{"text":"I try to stop by here when I get a chance.
The service is friendly and speedy. The location is great and the food turns out exactly as I anticipate it to be when ordered.

I will note that this place is more baby/family friendly than other places near by.They don't have a change table on premises BUT the manager was more than willing to help my family out when I needed to change my daughter the last time I was there. That level of service goes a long way in my books and I'm eager to find out what this place will turn into in the future.

I usually end up getting chicken schnitzel our chicken thighs in a laffa and pretty much get everything in it. I'd recommend it for sure if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The Shawarma baguette is great, however, the meat portion is pretty small... the fries are a good size and tasty."}
