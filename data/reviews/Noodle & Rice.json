{"text":"Great service + great food = Great place.   Noodle and Rice is hidden near the QT, so hunt it down.  There are not many tables, but it's clean, recently refurbished, and serves great food. 

We ordered two items (one noodle dish and one curry), split them, and still had lots leftovers for later.  

One other thing we really liked - Really large glasses of water that are constantly filled. This was important because we selected \"regular\" spicy level dishes and found them to SPICY. (Loved it!) 

Go there, have fun, highly recommended."}
{"text":"First of all, I shouldn't have to microwave my takeout food when I live literally a five minute drive away. But I guess that is what I can expect after waiting nearly an hour to get my food. I was told after I ordered \"it will be a minute, we have a party order for delivery ahead of you.\" I was fine with that, and went next door briefly to get a soda. When I returned, I saw the delivery driver pass by me with the party order and assumed mine would be up soon, if not next. After all, cooking with a wok is done with small items at high heat and is very quick to prepare. About 35 minutes after I ordered, someone came out and told me that they were waiting on just one more item. This does not bode well for the condition of the other items that were presumably already complete and ready. Meanwhile, order after order after order of takeout for other people was brought out. Nobody offered me a beverage or even an apology. When my food finally came out after literally FIFTY-FOUR MINUTES, I was still offered no apology until I pointed out the time frame to the cashier. All she said was \"sorry.\"  If they really wanted my repeat business they would have given me a reason to return, such as a coupon. When I got home, I found that my pepper steak was hot, my kung pao chicken nearly hot, and all my noodles and rice were only lukewarm. After re-heating food that I had paid $27 to already be hot, I found it to be bland and visually unappealing, and my family agreed. I have absolutely no idea where all the positive reviews on here have come from. Bland food, hour-long cook time, and zero customer service add up to me NEVER RETURNING to this so-called restaurant."}
{"text":"Good pad thai and liked the spring rolls....fyi, new sunday hours 3pm to 8pm started march 1st"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in phx.. And they deliver!! Always fresh & so damn good. The miso soup is the best I've ever had, and I order extra teriyaki sauce just to have for later to cook with. 5 star, i love noodles& rice."}
{"text":"We found this place through Yelp and decided to give it a try since we live just down the street. We ordered:
Potstickers (which were not greasy, and they had the perfect crunch and taste)
Chicken egg roll (it was tasty although I've had better but I am very picky)
Tom Yum soup (it was a nice portion and was good)
Mongolian beef( it came with a lot of yellow onions but otherwise tasty)
General tao chicken (came with a lot of chicken and had the perfect crisp and flavor)
Cucumber salad ( I was surprised by the larger portion compared to other restaurants and it was refreshing!) 

The waitress was super friendly and went out of her way to help everyone, even getting us Prik Nam Pla. It's cute inside with their decorations, although it doesn't look like much from the outside. We will be back to try the curry and drunken noodles, which we hear are to die for."}
{"text":"Red curry is our new favorite....outstanding flavor!!  The lunch specials are plenty, and love love love their hot and sour soup.  It's too bad that others have critiqued them based on service....it is a family business - the parents do the delivery, and the couple does everything else...he cooks, she answers the phone, takes orders, serves everyone etc.....so lighten up folks, and be realistic.  No every place is going to have a wait staff of ten to serve your every 'whim' :~("}
{"text":"I drove out of my way based off of the reviews. First off, I love Kung Pao Chicken and I usually order it first at every Chinese restaurant first before I try the place our a second time. Kung Pao Chick not so good. SUPER DRY. As dry as the box of rice it comes with. Test failed, never again since Kung Pao Chicken is the most popular Chinese dish and in opinion should be mastered before other dishes.."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and due to the reviews decided to order take out. Big mistake! Food was less than tasty and unappealing to the eye. 

We ordered orange chicken for the kids, which was just battered (in a not so good batter) and had the \"sauce\" on the side-a but weird. My kids love orange chicken! But not this one they barely had a bite or two and we ended up throwing it all away. 

I ordered the kungpao chicken and \"fried rice\" it was edible but I can't say I enjoyed it.   The chicken was okay but not your traditional kungpao and the \"fried rice\" was merely steamed rice with soy sauce and a little fried egg, - no flavor, no veggies, no bueno! 
My husband ordered the drunken noodles, they were DRY, definitely missing sauce and flavor. 

In a nutshell we won't be coming back. Not sure where people get all these positive reviews???  Panda Express is 10 times better. Sorry guys we like to support local and small business but I like to enjoy my dinner as well!!"}
{"text":"This little Thai place is simply delicious! I like to get delivery and they're always on time, have the right order, and have even delivered after hours!!! 

I recommend the pan ang curry noodles (if you don't like the crispy noodles, you can substitute with any other kind of noodles) the pot stickers, crab puffs and the won ton soup is amazing too! My boyfriend likes the general chicken. 

Everything I've had here is so tasty and I would recommend it to anyone looking for awesome Thai food and great service!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, very large portions and inexpensive.  Service was the best!  I will go here often!  It is very small, we went for an early dinner and there was only one other diner.  Numerous people came in to pick up to go orders though."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and very flavorful with no perceived MSG or excessive salt. Everything made when ordered, not earlier in the day. Thus, be patient when eating in and call in when taking out. Far above the taste of any others in the area."}
{"text":"terrible!! i'm not a complainer, but they're service was the worst.
i'm visiting from out of town. when i checked they're website to see if i was within delivery range, the zip code where i am staying was listed as somewhere that they would deliver to. an hour and a half later they called to say they couldn't find my address. i stood outside for another half an hour on the phone with the delivery person waiting for the food. when they still didn't show up another 30 minutes later i called the restaurant. they said that i was outside they're area and it would take an additional hour. i said that was fine, then they called me back and told me that they weren't delivering the food after all.
i've worked in the restaurant industry for years and this is disgraceful behavior. i wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I have never written a review of a restaurant before but felt compelled to after eating the worst food I have ever had. I ordered egg drop soup and moo goo gai pan for carryout.  I got home and thought that they had given me the wrong order.  The egg drop soup had mushrooms in it that I am positive they did not clean before putting them in the soup. It was like eating dirt. The same thing with the moo goo gai pan. I had a couple bites of each and threw the rest in the garbage. Absolutely awful!  I had to give this restaurant a star because it wouldn't let me give zero stars...."}
{"text":"Some years back I was a guest in a home and the hostess ordered food from Noodles and Rice..at that time the food was pretty good. Tonight I ordered it and I am sorry to say it was worse than bad...the orange chicken was dried, over cooked chicken poppers with sauce. Frozen egg rolls at Walgreen's are far superior to the baby egg rolls from this restaurant. The inside ingredients seemed like some type of pur√©e. It tastes as if the food is of the prepackaged frozen category that hasn't even been reheated properly.  The only thing that I considered edible was the beef broccoli...and even it was sub par.  I can say that my dog liked the white rice....I ended up throwing away most of food and for me to toss out a baby egg roll it has to be REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD. The staff is nice but that in no way makes up for having to throw out $30.00 worth of food. I would never recommend this restaurant and will NEVER go back. In this case I feel \"one star\" is one too many."}
{"text":"I came across Noodle and Rice quite by accident and I am so happy I did! The place is sparkling clean and the food is great! There is a nice variety of different Asian dishes all offering something different. If you like the gloppy, overly processed American style Chinese food, you won't like this. It is nice and light and tasty! The mini egg rolls are to die for and I've never been to a restaurant that has prettier carry out and delivery. Seriously, the presentation on the takeout boxes is really impressive as is the amount of food you get for the money."}
{"text":"Have to honestly say BEST THAI FOOD I've ever tasted and they DELIVER (which for a stay at home mom is a God send) I ordered their red curry, phad Thai and sweet and sour chicken...I am really picky when it comes to Thai/Chinese food and I've tried many places in the area and this place comes in #1 and have you seen their prices?!?? Nothing over $7!!! I fed my family of 4 for $25 (kinda makes me question why Cook my families dinner every night lol) and we had enough for another meal and the cherry on the top is they DONT use MSG!"}
{"text":"Looks a little sketchy from outside but nice little place. Really good prices! We tried the veggie spring rolls, hot and sour soup (like 4 bowls in the reg size order), garlic noodles, and basil fried rice. Everything was really good. Fried rice was very spicy! Pics on yelp threw us off a little as I think people had incorrectly labelled some items."}
{"text":"I went back to this little out of the way place for the lunch special today. I'm hooked!

The food is freshly made to order (even the hot and sour soup) and really quite delish! I also got a sushi roll to try it - very good! 

I got the lunch special, and it was a ton of food for $5.95. Their hot and sour soup is some of the best I've had!! I hope people will check this place out. Don't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The panang with tofu is our favorite.  Friendly atmosphere, low key and casual.  We are dine in, take out, and home delivery regulars.  Great lunch specials, too."}
{"text":"As a hole in the wall restaurant, this place offers some of the best food in the valley, great pricing, and great flavor! If your a fan of Spicy try ordering your food \"Thai Hot\" but be sure to get some green tea ice cream afterwards because your mouth WILL be burning! Over all amazing experience, the food is incredible, drunken noodles, or garlic noodles are a must."}
{"text":"So this place may not be a fine dining establishment, but DAMN the food is good!  I have introduced many friends to this place and everyone loves it.  The staff is super friendly and I have always had great service.  I have used them for delivery as well and have had great service with delivery as well.

I am biased to the Thai menu so I can't speak to the chinese food.  My ultimate favorites are the panang and pad thai.  

Give it a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Lazy day today, woke up at 9ish, didn't hit the shower until 11ish, struggled out the door at around 12ish, wandering (driving) aimlessly in NoPho famished.  Yelped for lunch places and Noodle & Rice popped up on the list, so N&R it ish.  

I'm not quite certain what to make of this restaurant because I was expecting an order-up type, but it turned out to be a sit-down place. Inside, the place is small with no more than 30 in occupancy tops.  A little cozy I might say if it was packed.  Fortunately, I was a little latish for lunch so hardly anyone was there.  The decor is a mishmash of ?!?!? which you'll have to see for yourself.  Nothing earth-shattering or trendy, but I just couldn't quite describe it so I'll leave it at that.

I ordered the Pepper Steak from the lunch special in the Rice Entrees group.  It comes with egg roll, soup  and a drink for an unbelievable price of $5.95.  The egg roll (chicken) came first - which came first - followed by the soup (hot & sour).  The egg roll was really good but the soup was just ok.  Soon after, I got my entree which looked appetizing as I took its picture.  It was definitely fresh because the mushrooms and peppers were crunchy, however, I felt it lacked spice.  Condiments were nowhere to be seen on my table nor the table next to me, so I couldn't flavor it to my liking.  It wasn't bad but I was not blown away.  Next time, I will try the entrees from other yelpers who gave this place 4 stars.

Overall, it's worth a trip back when I'm feeling ish."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything you expect a hole in the wall place to be. Perfect service and amazing food!! We will go back and very highly recommend it to others.  The restaurant is very clean and there are many different choices on the menu for meat and vegan eaters. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in town, flavorful and spicy. It's Bangkok style (or in the U.S., \"Chicago style\") so ignore the whining about the curries being thickened with coconut milk: that's how it's supposed to be. Curries and pad ka prow are fantastic here. Try the egg rolls too."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. Its so good we will get it for lunch and dinner in one day! We have tried new things every time and all of it has been satisfying! Great prices, would def recommend."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times now. Here's the thing with Noodle and Rice. They are a whole in the wall, with really cheap food. I don't think that its possible to get a cheaper lunch special 3.95 or 5.95(with a drink, soup and egg roll). The food isn't bad, but its not greatest thing either. 
I ordered the lunch Chicken Cashew, but asked for it extra spicy. I think they just sprinkled extra chili powder on top, which was a real shame; the dish had potential to be pretty good without that raw chili flavor. The chow mien was actually pretty good. The egg roll seemed like it had too much cinnamon or something that came off as being a bit too sweet. On another occasion I ordered the mongolian beef. The onions were so raw that it was just acidic to eat, I had to cook it longer, and it was good.
The thing with this place is that it has potential to be a great cheap restaurant, but its like they almost don't care to go the extra mile to make their food great. The people are really nice and friendly and in that regard I hope they get better."}
{"text":"We (at our office) order from here _at least_ once a week. The prices for the lunch specials are unbeatable for cheapskates like us. Un - beat - able.

I'm a pretty boring person, but I like myself some pad thai and and some panang curry. Compared to thai house (scottsdale) and a few other local thai 'ish places, the pad thai lacks flavor. The curry though is most definitely among the best.

It's just my 2 cents, but the prices make these guys well worth a few chances. You might find something you like."}
{"text":"Miso soup is a must to try!!  Great food as always!! Owner and staff is tentative and always pleasant!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed chicken with mixed vegtables.The egg drop soup was delicious.The jasmine tea was very good.Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for leading to to another winner.  My experience here started out slowly: the service was inattentive as they tried to work on take-out orders, my wife's soda was flat (they did promptly take it back and replace it with a tasty iced tea), and I was not a big fan of the salad I ordered, although it was massive for the price.  My wife ordered hot and sour soup-which also came as a huge portion for 1.95-but neither of us were too crazy about it, although it was at least an interesting variation from the usual.

Things changed when the main dishes arrived, however.  Since people had recommended the Thai food, we went with the green curry and the pad ki mao. As with the rest of the food, the portions were extremely generous for the price.  The pad ki mao had a nice amount of spice and was well balanced between shrimp, vegetables, and noodles.  Although there were some \"Pan-Asian\" touches, I must say that the taste of this dish reminded me of Thailand.  The real star of the show, however, was the green curry.  It was almost certainly the best green curry I've ever had and one of the best curries, period: rich and creamy, with bursting flavor in every bite. Frankly I will return to this place for the curry alone - the value you get for your money is just the icing on top."}
{"text":"As we drove by the QT and it's grubby little strip mall on Cactus near Cave Creek Road, I noticed a sign for a new restaurant, Noodle & Rice. For the next few days many coupons for it turned up on various sites including Restaurant.com.  Given such an aggressive marketing campaign, we had to give it a try. Armed with our coupons, we arrived at lunch time. It's a small place with a total of about twelve tables and booths. Make sure you get a booth, because the chairs are deadly uncomfortable. The plastic faux brick black wall and institutional gray paint give the place a kind of depressing air, lightened only by the turquoise banquettes and some leftover prints of Italian food on one wall. However, our server had a pleasant smile, and the menu showed promise.

     Noodle & Rice is an Asian restaurant, serving Thai, Japanese, and Chinese food. The prices at lunch are so reasonable we didn't even need to use our coupons. There are 22 entrees that can be had for $3.95, but for another $2 you can add an egg roll, soup, and a drink. I suggest you do this, because the hot and sour soup is one of the best I've had, and the egg roll is delicious too. China Mist iced tea is served here, and if you opt for hot tea you have your choice of several different kinds, served in a cute little teapot and matching cup. I opted to get chow mein noodles instead of white rice for an extra fifty cents, and I'm glad I did, because they were right up there with the hot and sour soup. Actually they outshone my entree of pad prik with beef and vegetables in a spicy brown sauce, because the beef was a little on the tough side, although still quite flavorful. Ken had shrimp in lobster sauce. The shrimp were properly cooked and the sauce was good, but, not being a green pepper lover, he thought there were too many on the plate. Oddly, at the end of our meal, we were not given fortune cookies.

     There are lots of things I want to try when we return. Appetizers include pot stickers 
($3.95), and chicken satay ($5.95). Tom Yum and Tom Kar soup (which has coconut milk in it) are both $3.50/$4.95. I love Tonkatsu sauce, so I may go for the chicken ($5.95). Panang Noodles ($6.95) are crispy wide rice noodles served with chicken or beef in a curry and coconut milk sauce. The most expensive thing on the menu is soft shell crab with either black pepper or curry powder at $10.95  A little less are two fried talapia (sic) dishes, one with Thai herbs, peppers, eggplant and basil, the other with a curry sauce sprinkled with minced kaffir lime leaves and fresh chili (both $8.95. Happily there's Thai iced coffee and tea, and for dessert green tea or coconut pineapple ice cream.

    Give it a try, with prices like these you don't have much to lose."}
{"text":"So, I'm not a HUGE Thai fan, but friends of ours brought us here and PROMISED us we would love it.  Man, were they right!  OMG, Delicious!  I ordered the Pad See Yew and it was just out of this world!  Not only was the portion HUGE for under $8, but I had enough for lunch, which I could not wait to eat!  ONLY downside is that this place is SUPER SUPER small!  If you are there with more than 6 people, it could be hard to get a table after 6.  I don't know if they take reservations, although I doubt it, so just be prepared if you are a group larger than 6 people.  Be for warned, it looks like a total dump and you probably would questions whether or not you should even enter.  I promise you, enter! It's well worth it! I'd rather support \"mom and pop\" places like this, than any chain restaurant, any day!"}
{"text":"I'm simply amazed how this place can stay in business offering selections at such low prices. And the quality of the food doesn't reflect the prices either. I've had a variety of items of the menu and it's all equally as good. 

I'm competing with my friend Michael for the title of Duke here, that's how much I love this place."}
{"text":"BEWARE THE ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM!!

Previous to tonight, I would have given them 3 stars. The food has been good on all three visits (we got takeout). Not amazing, but good. Would love to see more veggies in the Panang Curry, but it's still yummy.

Tonight, I placed an order using their online ordering system. BIG MISTAKE. The timeframe for ASAP is advertised to be 20 minutes. Our order wasn't ready for an additional 15 minutes! When I complained, she said that they don't receive the online orders right away. It gets faxed to them sometime after your place your order. She also claimed to have tried to call me to let me know the order would be ready later than the time provided on the receipt, which is an out and out LIE. I had my phone with me the whole time, and never received a call.

I'm on the fence about returning to Noodle and Rice, but my DH shredded out takeout menu after last night's issues. Clearly, they've been kicked off the list as far as he's concerned."}
{"text":"Picked this place due to ratings on here...sadly was disappointed!!

Ragoons were horrible, couldn't even finish the first one, not sure if freeze burn or they were expired, definitely not fresh. I was afraid if I finished one I'd get food poisoning. Ordered Kung Pao chicken and just tasted like chicken with some weird white sauce...no flavor, not spicy...the wontons were a hit, I'd order those again...but sadly I won't be going back.
I could have written Martha P's review from 4 months ago...we ate the same damn thing!"}
{"text":"First visit and I'm not trying them again.  I placed a simple order, fried rice, vegi egg rolls, tofu and broccoli and a sweet and sour shrimp.  The food had no flavor.  I was disappointed that the broccoli wasn't fresh but straight out of the freezer section and the tofu was OK.  The shrimp was the best thing, but even that was mostly batter.  They charge .50 for brown rice that tasted no better than what I make at home.  I over heard that they make everything to order and it shows.  I could tell what was prepared first as it was the coldest dish in the bag.  Even with big portions, at least for the fried rice, it's not enough to sway me."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews my colleague and I decided to give it a try. Excellent food especially for the price! Bonus....if you order online they give you 10% off your first order. Defiantly will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really quaint and cute. They don't have a lot of seating but they deliver. 
The wontons you get about 6-8 they are a lot smaller than expected but delicious! We also tried the cream cheese ragoons. They were smaller than usual, they didn't have a strong crab flavor but they did have table pepper in them which kind of set the flavor apart from any other one I've had. 
I ordered the pad Thai with tofu And I wasn't disappointed, the quantity was huge, the flavor was good and they gave us chili on the side to make it spicy.
My husband got there basil Fried rice. It had a good flavor and was really spicy. The only bad thing is it was really dry. 

overall I would definitely try this place again"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic egg rolls and general tso's...but that's about it unfortunately.  Haven't been able to find one decent Chinese place in Phoenix... what a shame!"}
{"text":"Average food and good prices. Nothing that blew me away. Would consider getting food here again, but not my top choice in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Great food at a great price!  I love going to Noodle and Rice and even though I am vegetarian and there are so many items for me to choose from. The food has always been perfect  and very satisfying portions. The curries over rice with veggie rolls make a really great dinner.  Can't say enough good things about this restaurant. As I am writing this it is making me very hungry...Noodle and Rice here I come!!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent.  The food is awesome and the portions are large for a great price.  It's a small business and has limited seating but serving is fast and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"My family and friends LOVE this restaurant!!! 
We order delivery at least twice a month, either lunch or dinner and we have never been disappointed. 
We get different items each time to try,  and everything we have tried is always fresh, hot  and tastes absolutely wonderful. The ladies I've always talked to on the phone are so polite, they will always let me know how long the wait is and are very accomidating if I want to add another item or remove items from a particular dish, and we always get the same sweet delivery lady. 
This restaurant has the BEST Thai food ever!!! 
Cannot wait to go in and try their green tea ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Very impressed with what I thought was gonna be another sub-par Asian dining experience. But I was wrong. The food is very, very good. The decor is...odd, but thankfully you don't need to eat it! Recommended eats!"}
{"text":"I always get the Yaki Udon though this last round there was more cabbage than noodles.  I hope this isnt a trend."}
{"text":"They have the best crispy tofu  large pieces cooked perfectly. Delicious vegetable soup and perfect udon noodles . Staff very friendly and helpful. Small but accommodating dining area."}
{"text":"I recently got an orange chicken with brown rice take out. The sauce was in a separate container. The food was really good, and of a large portion. And the price was great. So I'll no doubt be returning."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place has opened back up! Great food for an amazing price. It's a week-night regular for sure!!"}
{"text":"The spring roll was the best! Otherwise food was ok."}
{"text":"So Yelp calls 3 stars \"A-OK\" and 2 stars \"I've experienced better.\"  So while 2 stars sounds harsh, the description fits.

I ordered the kung pao chicken with chicken egg roll, hot and sour soup, and fried rice.  My wife ordered the sesame chicken + egg roll.

Decent service? CHECK!
Large portions? CHECK!
Looked/smelled good? CHECK!
Fresh ingredients? CHECK!
Flavor?
I said, \"FLAVOR!!?\"

Flavor was a complete no-show --- except for the egg roll, which tasted of cinnamon (extra chewy, but not bad), and the hot and sour soup, which had a decidedly metallic, \"tinny\" flavor (bad).

The kung pao was also flavorless and not spicy, despite the fact that I ordered it extra spicy.  Based on prior reviews, I should have been breathing fire, which makes me wonder if there wasn't a substitute cook in the kitchen that day.

Or maybe they specialize in Thai food and we ordered made the mistake of ordering Chinese.

Either way, there are better Asian restaurants in the Valley and so many others that I have yet to try.  Thus, the 2-star review.  Lots of other Yelpers like this place...we just happen to fall outside that group."}
{"text":"I visited this little hidden gem on a Friday night.  Only one other party was dining in and a few people came in for take-out.  I ordered the Veg Egg Roll, Tom Kar soup, and Panang noodles with beef.  Everything came out quickly and steaming hot...and absolutely delicious.  Total with tip was $15.  They also have homemade green tea or coconut ice cream, which I really wanted to try but was too full.  I will absolutely come back!!   This is a must try for any Thai food lover.  Service was speedy, warm & inviting.  Eat there, and then tell your friends!"}
{"text":"Drove to this part of town to meet a friend and found this little place for lunch- fantastic, authentic cuisine,  VERY reasonable price, super friendly service. Highly recommend the Hawaiian fried rice, General Tao's chicken, and especially the Drunken Noodles if you like spicy! Definitely a must try restaurant, we will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great, close, and a good vegetarian selection for me.  I felt guilty paying so little for the good food we got!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went back for dinner the same day I had eaten lunch here. Told my wife I would pickup dinner for her since she had to work. Ordered Pad Tai for myself and lemon chicken for the wife along with an order of mini spring rolls. 

My Pad tai was very good even after waiting more than an hour for my wife to get off of work before we ate. Her lemon chicken came as two separate components, a large Styrofoam container of fried chicken and a smaller container of lemon sauce. Once the two were blended together they were a perfect match. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it. However the mini spring rolls were okay but nothing like we get at Pho Thang on Camelback Rd. Probably will be the last time we order them. But for a real low cost late night dinner, or even an early one for that matter, you can't beat the wonderful dishes at this delightful restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  They have a pretty diverse menu and really reasonable prices.  I have never eaten there, but usually get the food to go.  They have some really good noodle dishes and really good curry.  My girlfriend loves the Thai Ice tea.  I usually go to Nee house, but have been coming here alot more now."}
{"text":"We have tried a few Asian takeout places and always ended up disappointed. I am happy to say that I think we found our go to place. My husband ordered the drunken noodles and I ordered the pad Thai. Both were very delicious! My husband also got the mini spring rolls which we both really liked. 

I would, however, give this place 3.5 stars if my iPhone would let me because of one thing: the wonton soup. Maybe I'm picky about the wonton soup but this stuff was barely appetizing. The wontons were good. But the broth was like eating dish water. I could barely eat half. It was bland. I was super disappointed because I love a good wonton soup. 

The food was the saving grace and the delivery quick. So we will try this place again. Hopefully if I get soup next time it'll be decent!"}
{"text":"Okay so I came across this place on yelp and thought it couldn't hurt to try. I love thai food and was excited thinking I had found a new place close to home. I ordered delivery that ended up costing me $40. I got two orders of pad see eiw , two orders of crab rangoons, egg rolls , egg drop soup and more... the noodles (pad see eiw) wasn't that bad but everything else was horrible ! Nothing tasted even close to good and I am very sure that it is not fresh food nor good quality. The worst part is the snotty owner. I called politely addressing my problem and all she proceeded to tell me was that she would not credit my money back nor replace the entire order due to the fact that I semi liked the noodles. She called me mam a million times and was just very unhelpful. If she really is the owner like she says than I feel bad for the business. No manners at all does this woman have and no customer service.  She even hung up on us ! I am disgusted woth the service provided and I will be sure to continue to speak poorly about theor place. Absolutely terrible !!! DONT GO THERE! GROSS!"}
{"text":"Service: Excellent. This a small establishment and our hostess/server took great care of us. If you have a second beverage already on the table before I finish my first, you are doing it right.
Food: Fantastic. I've only tried the Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Crab Wontons, but I was impressed, especially considering the price. The menu looks to be quite varied and interesting; all dishes can be served with beef, chicken or tofu and a side of steamed rice, fried rice or noodles. They are very vegetarian friendly.
Price: Excellent! I spent $8 and walked away very satisfied. At $6 an entree this is very affordable.
Appearance/Location: Meh. Now I don't really care about these sorts of things, with food as good as theirs, but it is in an awkward, aging strip mall facing away from the street. It's a good thing the QT is right next door, or I never would have seen the joint.
Summary: I will be going back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 star reviews, it has to be amazing & this was close! Cashew Chicken was great, lots of veggies & pineapple, not a ton of cashews, just the right amount. Kids loved the Yakisoba with shrimp! Fried rice with BBQ was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Here for a 3rd (maybe 4th cant remember) time.  food has always been awesome. service great. 
however, this time i got a beef teriyaki dish. the beef tasted like a dirty wet dog.  but i was hungry and in a hurry so i ate it anyway and an hour later i havent gotten sick so im assuming it was still good.  the waitress did mention to me that they dont grill the beef, but steam it.  maybe this made the taste funky?? not sure...but i wouldnt get it again.
im still giving 4 stars though because every other time has always been real good and service with a smile.  Overall recommended. I will be back"}
{"text":"Really good authentic Chinese and Thai! The portion size is huge and so worth your $! I got the Tom Yum noodle and my husband got basil chicken which was spicy and good! I had an egg roll and cucumber salad which both were fantastic! Totally recommend trying :)"}
{"text":"Will not be going back. The food itself wasn't bad, I liked the drunken noodles but my boyfriend had a curry dish with fried noodles that were clumped together, greasy and uncooked in the middle. What was bad was the actual running of the place.

After ordering our food we heard loud throat clearing and hacking coughing coming from the kitchen. I'm convinced the person cooking our food was back their spitting out phlegm, my boyfriend thinks it was the delivery guy in the restroom. Regardless, we were the only guests in the restaurant so it was definitely one of the employees which is disgusting- if you need to make those noises go out back where no one can hear you or better yet stay home, rest and come back well- you are working with food.

The other disappointing thing is that we were the only ones in the restaurant and it took almost a full hour to get two noodle dishes. 

So although the drunken noodles was good, we both agreed it was the better of the two; I felt uneasy eating it due to the phlegm noises coming from somewhere. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A couple of friends of mine took me here for the first time a couple of days ago.
It's a small restaurant, it may be seen as even a hole in the wall. 

But Seriously. This place is on my list of top favorite restaurants. 

Not only is the food freshly made and just ridiculously delicious.
It's also cheap! The first time I went here, my boyfriend and I ordered two appetizers, two entrees, and three drinks, and the total still came out to approximately $30 (not including tip).  Whereas other places would have charged us at least $40, for the the same quality of food.

They also practice wonderful customer service, and they're friendly. So that's always a plus as well!"}
{"text":"I admit I was a little hesitant about this place at first because of how cheap it is, but I was pleasantly. The food was surprisingly pretty good and portions rather large."}
{"text":"One of the greatest culinary triumphs in a big city is finding actual neighborhood restaurants that are incredible and well priced. We explored and found one such place. This is incredibly high end food done impeccably and moderately priced. I know one reviewer mentioned the wait for food. Not only i got great service but the little tome i waited made me realize i am not in a fast food joint. Start with the best non greasy and finely flaky egg roll and move to some of the best Chinese,  japanese and thai food in the valley at incredible prices."}
{"text":"OMG!! This was the worst thai food I ever had. We went there today because of all great yelp reviews, but was so disappointed in the thai beef noodles I ordered. It was so tasteless and horrible. There were no flavors to spicy beef broth that the noodles came in. We are never coming back. Thai house on shea is bit more pricey, but well worth the price for great food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant. It's so good that I had to go back 6 days after I first discovered it. The Drunken Noodles was particularly delicious dishes, but everything was great. Also, it's cheap! You can split many, many dishes for the table and stay under $15-20 per person."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I got the general tso's chicken and It was wonderful. Big portions for a great price. First time I've ever enjoyed a egg roll in my life and that's saying something! Wonderful food will return."}
{"text":"Three of us ate here for the first time. Massive portions and really inexpensive. We had pad prik, pad Thai, Anne Orange chicken. All three were stellar! My fiance said the chicken egg roll was really good, and my brother-in-law really liked the inari sushi. We'll be back SOON!"}
{"text":"Such a huge fan of this place! The lunch specials are insanely cheap and the food is amazing. I love that I can place orders online and when I walk in to pick it up they greet me by name. Little things like that (plus the amazing eats) are why we go back."}
{"text":"I can't be moved to write many reviews--seriously, incredibly lazy--but in this case I will absolutely make an exception. 

Noodles & Rice is a regular stop for me, which is saying something because I love going to new places all the time. I order something different just about every visit (though I have been known to re-order the pad ka prao--so perfect with white rice to tame the spice). I have yet to taste anything I didn't absolutely love. No exaggeration. I even eat off my boyfriend's plate when he orders his usuals, orange chicken or sesame chicken (amazing!).

Some other favorites: veggie spring rolls, panang noodles, drunken noodles, pad ki-mao, & green curry. Looking forward to trying some of the soup noodle dishes while it's still cold outside. By the way, the portions are pretty hefty and the prices are not.

To top it all off, the owners and staff are very friendly and welcoming, and I look forward to seeing them each week. I highly recommend trying this little restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Chinese food and didn't want to leave the house. Chinese food has been pretty bad in this area so when i saw Noodles & Rice, I was skeptical. When my food arrived at my doorstep, I was pleasantly surprised!

I tried the Garlic Noodles, Crab Rangoons, and Spring Rolls. The food looks like it came from a fusion type of restaurant. It was arranged in a way that looked very appetizing. The veggies were very fresh. The crab Rangoons were impressive and had a spicy kick to them. Loved it! Good eggrolls! They even cut a hole in the top of the box so the Rangoons and Rolls didn't get soggy from the steam (since they're fried) I feel as if I've gotten lucky. There is a badass asian food restaurant near my house and they deliver! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Lunch prices are great!  A lot of food for a low price.  I've ordered out a few times as the place is small and always packed at lunch time.  The red curry with chicken is pretty tasty.  The pieces of lime leaves give a strange sour,  grassy taste every now and then.  I avoided the rest of them.   My friends enjoyed their meals, however too sweet for me.  One friend really likes his food spicy. However his meal has never been spicy enough. I would much prefer this place for lunch over McDonald's or other fast food places. The taste and price is much better."}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant.  Family owned, clean and fast. We have been here two times before and each time we leave full and happy. This time we ordered the chicken and veggie fried rolls ( only .99 cents each and super yum) as an appetizer and then the General Tao chicken and Tempura udon noodle soup for a main course. Both portions were generous and we were departed with leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Our server is the same sweet girl we have every time and I believe it must be the owners daughter. She is very pleasant,courteous and seems to do everything from serving to busing to taking phone orders and cashiering.  
This is a the perfect mom and pop restaurant to come if your in the mood for good quality, delicious   Asian style food."}
{"text":"Text book \"Hole in the Wall\" Restaurant.

We started off with a appetizer of some delicious Crab Rangoons with sweet and sour sauce.

I ordered the Pad Tai on the premise that I was in the mood for something peanut-y, and while I discovered that Pad Tai isn't really my cup of tea, I could tell that this was probably a Pad Tai lover's dream dish.  Plenty of sprouts, big chunks of scrambled egg, large pieces of chicken, a pile of ground peanut stuff to mix in, and shredded cabbage and eggplant on the side to mix in as well.  It was also a literal mountain of noodles.  All for 7 dollars.

I tried a piece of my friend's Sesame Chicken and it was absolutely delicious.

Everything on the menu can be had with Chicken, Beef, Veggie, or Tofu, there might be Pork too, but I don't remember, sorry.

Also oddly enough, they have free WiFi.

Overall, prices on everything were great especially considering the heaping portion of cuisine you actually get.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are big fans of this place. We've been here many times and keep coming back for a reason.  The food is generally very good (the crab rangoon is the best I've ever had) and:

1. The portion sizes are well above average
2. The prices are well below average (so much so we order a bunch of food to just take home with us)
3. Our server (Theresa) is a blast once she gets to know you and you get her laughing.

I'll give them that fifth star because though I won't claim every dish is the best I've ever had, those other places cost about %50 more.  And if you can't tell already, I'm a big fan of value."}
{"text":"The panang curry was delicious! My roommate enjoyed the pad thai as well. Large portion sizes and easy on the wallet. Delivery was within the time window quoted. Take-out was ready within the promised time window as well. I have used the online ordering system and all went smoothly, and the food was ready when promised. I will definitely be going back again, and again. Can't wait to try out other options on the menu."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed by the quality , price and portion size here. I had no idea this place existed, But I will be back to keep sampling different things on the menu. The tom yum, and the orange chicken, and the egg drop soup were awesome."}
{"text":"To judge this establishment is difficult. The dining area is cramped and one quarter was taken up by one of the sleeping owners. The overall identity of this restaurant is confusing as they sell selfie sticks, as well as wall chargers and goggles. The mixture of different Asian dishes from chinese, japanese and thai cuisine was worrisome. I got the pangnang curry with beef. The dish was lacking in vegetables, had a medium-sized portion of beef but was mainly comprised of curry. All that said, as a take out restaurant, i loved it. The curry was phenomenal, not cluttered up with ingredients i would normally bypass like potatoes, and the curry was $2 cheaper than any of their competitors. I would definitely go back here as well as recommend this restaurant as a take out restaurant. This place knows what ingredients are supposed to star in a meal and completely delivered.  2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Just tried Noodle and Rice for lunch. I got the Teriyaki & Vegetables w/ chicken lunch special. The food was really good, the vegetables were crispy and seemed fresh, and you can't beat their prices.  

My only complaint was that it took about 20min to get my food to go, but that is an easy fix to simply call ahead next time. 

Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my initial review and this place just keeps impressing.  I've brought a bunch of my friends (which, bonus for me, allows me to taste even MORE dishes!!) and everything I've tried has been just great.  Their sushi is simple but delicious and fresh, soups are excellent, noodle dishes are hard to beat, and the staff is always friendly.
The lone(albeit tiny) gripe I have is with the Mongolian beef-I ordered this as part of their $3.95 lunch special menu and I'd probably call it Mongolian onions more than Mongolian beef.  What do you want for four bucks though...
I've not tried any dish here that wasn't delicious!!"}
{"text":"Always great service, always amazing food! Theresa is always friendly and willing to explain things or make substitutions. The garlic noodles are amazing as is the Hot & Sour soup! Try ordering things on the spicy side, go Thai hot or just under :)"}
{"text":"Love it! Friendly service, great prices and delicious food!!! I love Thai food and it's so hard to find any good places in az! I love the curry, pad Thai and egg rolls! Actually, I love everything I've tried!"}
{"text":"Other than the little drink incident, food was great. You really get a lot of food too!!! I was surprised how much they packed in those styrofoam boxes. Thanks yelpers! Will eat here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with great service and food! It's been hard trying to find a great Asian restaurant and this place meets all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian food places in town!  Food is fresh and delicious, and extremely reasonable prices!  My usual: potstickers, wontons, and general tao chicken.  Other favorites: panang curry, panang noodles, fried rice, cashew chicken, and most things I've eaten here :)

Service is also amazing, handled by Theresa!"}
{"text":"After complaining to my friend about the lack of decent Thai restaurants in the valley, he had told me about Noodle & Rice. After visiting Thailand this past spring, I thought that Thai food was forever ruined for me in the states, as it would never be as good. Noodle & Rice comes really close to the flavors I experienced in Thailand. They have some of the best Panang Curry, it's creamy and delicious and they use authentic flavors that include kaffir lime, Thai chilies, and galangal. The portions sizes are huge for the price, and the service is always friendly and attentive. If you're looking for authentic Thai food, I highly recommend Noodle & Rice."}
{"text":"Food is freshly-prepared, but not consistent.  After eating here numerous times, we also wearied of the uncomfortable seating, and the unsolicited \"disapproval\" advice for eating by the co-owner (i.e., \"No, you can't put that on the rice\", etc.)  We found another Thai restaurant not too far North on Cave Creek that is MUCH better and much more comfortable in every way."}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this small eatery is so popular: the food is inexpensive and tasty, the servings are more than ample, and the range of choices run the gamut of popular Asian cooking styes: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Mongolian. It's great to be able to order tonkatsu, pad thai, and General Tsao all in one place. While the place could use more light and perhaps a bit of touching up, you come here for the inexpensive, delicious food and not for the decor. I noticed while dining here that they have a very brisk take-out business so don't be surprised if there's a bit of a delay in getting your food if you dine here at peak hours."}
{"text":"Orderd shrimp fried rice to go for dinmer.  Got home and all the shrimp was raw.  Called back next day because they were closed and the owner tried to say that wasn't the case.  Then wanted me to bring the rice back to get another one.  Yeah right I am gonna leave seafood out all night and smell my house up for a refund.  I frequently ate here.  But not anymore. This business wanted to act funny over $9.  Well u lost a customer who spent well over that in a year.  Whats even scarier than raw shrimp what if it was chicken."}
{"text":"Still loving Noodle and Rice!  Great food - great people!  Get some!

My go to favorite is the Panang beef with white rice.  Really tasty!
Most of the family likes the Panang noodles (some with chicken, some with beef) - crispy noodles in the fabulous Panang.  

The pot stickers are a really good starter at Noodle and Rice - and try a Thai Ice Tea if you're looking for something sweet that can tone down the heat (order it +1 hotter than usual and you'll see :-))"}
{"text":"Great lunch combo portions, does not dissapoint! Do wish it had more meat. Prob would substitute rice for fried rice to eat later for only.50 more. Saving soup for later too.  Awesome egg rolls!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years and we've never been disappointed! The service and food are consistently great, and the portions are huge for the price! The Pad Thai and Katsudon are the best I've had anywhere. Definitely one of my favorite hole in the wall places and my go-to for a cheap meal with a friend."}
{"text":"The Panang curry and Panang noodles were one of the best dishes I've ever had.  I could come to this place daily!  And their prices are really cheap too!!"}
{"text":"We came on Christmas and the place was about half empty. We got our appetizers relatively fast. However, the Tom Yum soup had some suspect looking shrimp. They were very dry and chewy. Then, one of us got our food and finished it. 15 minuets after he was done( 35 min after it was received) we finally got our food. I got the Pad Thai and I'm sad to say it was not worth the wait. The beef was very dry and and the noodles were soggy. The high reviews were very deceiving. I would never come back"}
{"text":"Best. Eggrolls.  EVER!!  I love the sweet and sour sauce, I am sure it is homemade.  I found this place because of YELP actually.  I read all of the great reviews and decided to try it.  I am very picky about my Chinese food.  I have only gotten delivery and take out and they separate the sauce from the chicken do it doesn't get soggy. I was pleasantly surprised by that.  I am not a big fan of the noodles, but I love the chicken!!"}
{"text":"Still excellent to fantastic Thai & Chinese food with a wide variety of dishes. The appetizers are VERY good too. The eat-in area is not that large but is comfortable. They do carry-out and delivery orders very well also. Their coconut/pineapple/vanilla ice cream is the best in the valley. Keep up the great work Noodle & Rice folks!!"}
{"text":"Love the crap out of Noodle and Rice.  Best Thai around.  I have gotten several people as hooked on it as I am. Thai hot Panang noodles FTW."}
{"text":"Noodle & Rice remains the best Thai food in Phoenix, and by far the best value for real quality Thai food.  I am updating my review to comment on the service, which is done almost exclusively by the incredibly hardworking Theresa, who it seems is always at the restaurant.  Theresa is always pleasant and thoughtful. She knows our names and our usual orders.  She remembers that I am a vegetarian and makes helpful suggestions for vegetarian options (just about anything on the menu can be made vegetarian, even if the menu doesn't give that option).  Theresa makes my already great experience with Noodle & Rice even better.  Noodle & Rice is not a fancy white-tablecloth restaurant.  But if you like \"hole in the wall\" restaurants with great food where the staff know your name and make you feel comfortable, you won't be disappointed by Noodle & Rice."}
{"text":"Small but awesome. Prices are amazing they will substitute anything you want. Very small dining area but surprisingly never full. Go there!!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food, skip the rest of the menu. Pad Thai was really good but opt for tofu and stay away from anything that has beef or chicken in it.  I'm not sure where they get there meat from but its absolutely horrible with a very strong gamey/rotten taste. That is most likely why the food is really cheap. Aside from that the service is great and the thai iced coffee and tea are good."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Wontons EVER!!
We stopped in on a whim last weekend. It was raining and we were hungry. 

We weren't sure at first if we are to just have a seat, go to the counter to order or just stand by the door and wait. (You just seat yourself). 

We started off with chicken wontons which were fan-freaking-tastic. I wish there was more of a \"filling\" though. 

We both ordered the garlic chicken extra spicy...wow, spicy indeed. Often times we'll ask for something hot or thai hot and it's medium at best. But, they weren't messing around. I would suggest ordering medium and going from there if you don't want it over the top hot. It was served with rice and cucumbers/tomatoes on the side. I loved the side of raw veggies. 

This was the best Asian food I've had in quite sometime and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the simple name and pick up centric setup fool you, this place has some great food, at good prices and generous portions.

While this place may be west of the trendy side of the 51 and in an unassuming strip mall it still has some decent dining area that accommodated our party of 6 plus 2 kids.

The menu is full of Chinese, Thai and other Asian dishes. The pad se ew was a wonderful with a hint of char and wide noodles, tofu and broccoli. 

Adding to the great food is their wonderful chill oil. There is also a small selection of random Asian goods like chopstick helpers."}
{"text":"DH & I went to Noodle & Rice last night, and enjoyed it. We ordered the hot and sour soup, which was average, panang noodle, which were good, green curry fried rice, was good, and the pad prik, which was average. Overall, we had a great experience, service was wonderful! We had plenty leftover for lunch today. We used a $10 restaurant.com certificate and our total cost was $13 + plus tip. Great value, dinner and lunch."}
{"text":"The panang chicken curry was very good. I had it over crispy noodles which I think was a mistake. I will have it over white rice next time. Oh yes there will be a next time."}
{"text":"We happened upon this restaurant as we were pumping gas at the QT about 4 months ago, since then we have gone there at least once a week. We have tried almost everything on the menu and have been SUPER happy with all the food. We moved to this area about a year ago and  tried almost every Chinese food around looking for one that we liked, glad we stumbled on Noodles and Rice! 

Their soup, and really all the dishes, are fresh. No pre made wonton soup here. We also love their Thai food, the curry (coconut milk based) is amazing!

You have got to try it, it's WELL worth your money. Won't find anything as inexpensive and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best egg roils and sesame chicken in the world!"}
{"text":"This was a new try for us. Ordered delivery and it took the normal amount of time (abt an hour). WOW!!!  I was pleasantly pleased (even though I hoped I would be based on the great reviews). The food was great! We normally order from another place but wanted to try something new and this will definitely become our go to spot! Great flavor and portions for leftovers or a late snack. When you ask for spicy they deliver! While we expect to try their other dishes, for this first time the General Toa was a standout!  We also got the Basil rice dish with beef, mini egg rolls and potstickers all of which were great! But the boyfriend would've like a fortune cookie ;/ all in all I would recommend this place above all!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place ! Always start with the baby egg rolls, my husband gets orange chicken and fried rice but my personal favorite is the chicken noodle soup. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this review, because the people were so sweet and accommodating! The cashier helped me choose an entree and was so very nice. I waited outside for my food, to enjoy the nice weather. She stepped outside to give me my order status.

But the food is pretty bad. I ordered the lunch special, teriyaki chicken with rice and veggies. Pretty difficult to mess up in my opinion. I opened the tray and it reeked! Thought it might have been the cabbage so I proceeded to try the chicken and it was nearly unpalatable. It tasted... Old, I guess? Not fresh? 

The cuts were dark meat but really they appeared more greyish in color, not very appealing (I asked for light sauce, so it was easy to see the meat). I smelled the chicken and determined that it was the culprit of the horrrid smell. For a restaurant called 'Noodle & Rice', the rice left much to be desired. It tasted like they used water from Flint, MI to steam it, but it more or less stuck together. Meh. 

My Arnold Palmer was okay though. Ended up throwing the rest out. I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, they get the order right all the time and the lady who delivers is really nice. The food taste good enough when you need some food delivered. I only order veggie meals now because I'm not a fan on their chicken it has a funny after taste and is chewy."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten a dish so delicious that you didn't make the time to even Yelp it? I have = )

So we decided to call in an order, they closed in about an hour so we opted to pick up our food rather than have it delivered. We ordered the green curry, which is my favorite...Using noodles, hot and sour soup, a new spicy street styled basil chicken (which was recommended when I called). The wait time was 25 minutes,  which I didn't think was bad at all.

So I went to pick up our meal, and they were nice as usual and I brought it home. The food was still at a perfect temperature and after we had our first bites, it was silence until our plates were cleaned. We've probably discussed over 5 times now how our new choices turned out to be the best choices. Everything was delicious and spicy just like we like =)"}
{"text":"I used to live a very short drive to this restaurant and would frequently get their delivery or takeout.  I have since moved far enough away that this place is a rare treat now.   My favorite thing here is their basil chicken, which is just fab.  They also do very good chow mein, and excellent soups.  It's really affordable, and they serve large portions.  Lots of good food for a great price.  We would often order from here when we were having people over, and wanted family style dinner.  Recently I ordered similar food from a thai place closer to my new house, and the food was not as good, but the price was at least 50% more expensive.  Noodle and Rice, keep it up folks, you are rocking it."}
{"text":"This food spot is nothing out of the ordinary, when I think Thai food I think flavorful, seasoning, food cooked with love lol In this case the food I had lacked all of these things.

I ordered shrimp fried rice, miso soup, chicken teriyaki with chow mein to go, it took me about 30 minutes to get there and guess what my food wasn't cooked, they cook once you show up! so I suggest if you order online to call and let them know when you would like to expect the food to be ready. There were 2 other gentleman waiting on their take out orders as well and one guy got pretty antsy and started complaining because it took about 10 minutes or more for his soup.

They took so long making the food that I decided to eat some of it inside the place but the lady told me I can't eat the food without them putting it on a plate, never have I been somewhere and it wasn't ok to eat my food out the take out box.
I just told her I'm trying it out so she would gtfo my face.

The fried rice was ok the shrimp had no flavor and was cold, it seemed like it would have went better with cocktail sauce. The chicken teriyaki the sauce was pretty good the chicken itself was plain the only thing saving it is the sauce and the chow mein was very pale and way more veggie to noodle ratio plus I can taste the oil they toss it in it leaves a bad after taste.

I wouldn't come back even if it was across the street, it's not bad but it's not worth it,  the search for a better Asian food spot continues!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is a review for me and for another guest whom I do not know.

First this was my first and will be my only order placed. At 11:45 AM I placed and order for Chicken Fried Rice. This is always my first order when going to a new place for lunch. I was told my order would take 30 minutes. Thirty minutes for a simple dish at lunchtime on a Monday? When I arrived 30 minutes later the girl out front asked who I was and went to the kitchen. When she came back she said he had just started preparing it for me.

Before arriving I was expecting a well oiled machine that could just not keep up with the volume because their food was just so good. But I was wrong, it's a very small place and seems quite dysfunctional. There were only two other to-go orders packed and ready and a total of ten people dining inside.

While I was waiting a previous lunchtime customer came back in and was obviously very disappointed. She had had to wait 20 minutes to come pick up her order and when she got home it was cold. Cold enough to bring back the meal and ask for a refund.

She had ordered the $6.95 lunch special but had told them she didn't want the drink which was included in the price. But the counter girl wanted to refund her $3.95 and not the $6.95 she had paid. This was a quite bizarre ordeal to witness. The girl behind the counter arguing with the customer and trying to short change her refund.

Needless to say I will not be going back. My meal was plentiful but not well prepared nor flavorful."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Thai food offered by a pleasant server.  Ordered green curry with extra veggies and tofu and it was so yummy I ate the rest for dinner. My friend had the broccoli chicken and spring roll and she was really impressed. Ambiance is very hole-in-the-wall and kitschy, but that's not why you go. You go for the delicious food and good service, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for technology. I found this place by way of GPS and a desperate craving for Thai food while farting around near Paradise Valley. I've only gone once so far, but I plan on going back despite it being on the the opposite end of town from me. The price is cheap enough that the gas+the cost of food is well worth it rather than going to some of the local *cough* overpriced *cough* Thai places here in Tempe. 

I can confidently say it's the best Thai food that I have eaten in the Valley, and it was quite reminiscent of the delicious Thai food I've encountered in Thai Town in SoCal. 

The customer service was excellent, and although they were quite busy, the food came out piping hot in a reasonable amount of time. I would not hesitate to drive all that way just for a darn good meal."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Egg rolls small but good. Portions also on the smaller size but i did get the lunch special. Would eat there again, probably would skip on the soup."}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price!

We tried Noodles and Rice because a friend recommended it and I'm glad we did.  Everything we are was amazing (except for the fried tofu- it was too gooey) and the portions are huge!

My family of 4 was able to order drinks, appetizers, main course, and dessert, for less than $40."}
{"text":"Good food, service Ok, jasmine tea is good too. Thai tea good and ginger chicken is good."}
{"text":"This Thai food is sure to rock your world and you just can't beat the prices. The curry dishes are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This little place is so clean as friendly! I went here on a Saturday morning for lunch with my 3 kids. I'm on a mission to open their minds to other foods besides mc Donald's so this sounded good. The kids meals are so cheap and absolutely delish! 

I ordered the chicken soup, it was good but I guess I was expecting the pho style with a bunch of veggies on the side, but no. It's was still good and can't beat the price. I'm planning on going back to try other dishes, especially that coconut soup. Yum!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place more. It's in the neighborhood and has variety. The take out took for over 40 minutes to be ready. That is not a dealbreaker in and of it's self. I arrived early to pick it up and they said it was gonna be another 20 minutes. I went to the bar next-door and had a beer. When I came back and sat for five or 10 minutes and she wrapped up the food. When I got home the food wasn't hot. The pad Thai was very dry. The Katsu chicken was pretty good and the eggrolls are average at best. The panuang curry is delicious but that's dish out (already made) so that should be hard to screw up. Maybe dine in solves the challenges?"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch specials!  Cheap prices, good size portions, and really tasty and authentic. My family of four had a huge lunch for $20 including drinks."}
{"text":"Terrific food! Bountiful! Perhaps the best Chinese food we've eaten in the valley. My wife and I had read previous postings and walked in with great expectations which were not disappointed. With our vegetarian preference, we ordered the fried tofu -- crispy yet delicate with a peanut sauce that satisfied.  The vegetable platter with brown sauce was also satisfying as the vegetables were fresh and delicious.    We plan to return often."}
{"text":"Noodle and Rice was recommended to me by a friend whose taste I greatly admire. After my first experience here I became hooked. I've brought my family and many friends through the doors since then with no regrets. Great portions, friendly and quick service, reasonable prices and absolutely delicious meals. By far my favorite Chinese and Thai restaurant for sit down or takeout. I recommend the Orange Chicken!"}
{"text":"Love this place! From New York and found it tough to find some good Asian cuisine around these parts. This was it!! Definitely recommend trying it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Try this place! My 2 and 4 year old gobbled down sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls and Rangoon's! I had amazing drunken noodles with veggies.... An enormous plate. The place is small, but cheap! My family just found our new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best thai food! My friends and I go there about twice a week! 
Here is what we always get pad thai, red curry, garlic chicken and i think thats all... you put it all over white rice and it is to die for! 
The Chicken spring rolls are yummy too! Those I definately suggest.
The desserts are also delicious. Where else can you get pineapple coconut ice cream? 

The thai tea is also something great. It is not overly sweet like you get at other thai places. 

The service is also great. Pat is amazing! :) She is so sweet and works hard to make she you are taken care of while you are there. 

If you are in ther area it is a great place to go! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"No idea how this place has high ratings.  The food was terrible.  Tasted like every other chinese place in the valley.  They need to get fresh ingredients.  Wont ever go back."}
{"text":"Again, we were greeted and asked if we were eating in.  We enjoyed our previous dishes so much we ordered the same thing.  She said the Pad Ki Mao dish is spicy and I said fine.  My order came out first.  Wish they'd bring both dishes at once.  Anyway, this time my dish was super spicy, so much so, my eyes and nose were watering.  My lips were tingly and I had to drink plenty of water to digest.  I like spicy but the jalape√±o and chili was too much this time.  Hubby's meal, garlic noodles comes in a bowl.  He would like to see it served on a plate so that all the ingredients get mixed up without falling out of the bowl.  He said the flavor was rather bland.  The gal checked on us often but no water refills unless you ask.  I would still go back but would ask for mild and spice it up myself.  We brought home leftovers and even though I pulled out all the hot stuff, it was still spicy."}
{"text":"I feel weird about giving five stars to this tiny joint, but I can't give it 'only' four stars in good conscience. We live pretty close to this place, and have eaten here, easily, 30+ times over the past two years... possibly 40+. Not one time have we been less than happy as clams. The woman who runs the front (phone and restaurant... it's pretty impressive) always remembers us, is always nice and courteous, and super helpful. 

My favorites: 
- Thai Basil Beef with extra beef and medium spice. This is a dinner, a lunch and a midnight snack, easily. So, so much food, even without rice. I love that I can order as spicy (or not) as I want. When we followed paleo, this was my takeout go-to, and still is today. 
- Egg drop soup. It is so yummy! No weird stuff going on, either; fresh veggies and super-tasty broth, served piping hot. This is a great value, at $2.95 for a large. This easily serves four people as an appetizer... orrrr one really, really hungry person who is craving some comfort food. 
- Sweet & sour chicken. This is not your average S&S ck. The meat is completely identifiable and the breading is light enough to not weigh down the whole dish. Good sauce, too. 
- No longer on the menu, but the Thai roll with peanut sauce. I really wish they would bring sexy back. 
- BBQ pork fried rice, extra pork. Um. Yeah. Extra pork, because pork. Duh. This is a massive serving, too. 
- Online ordering. 
- The kid menu has pretty large servings, too. 
- Clean. 
- Great service, even if there may be a wait. (There's a wait for damn good reason, so relax.) 
- It's been a while since we have done it, but this place was BYOB. Suggest calling ahead to make sure this is still allowed. We quit bringing our own because beer just takes up room that is better filled with tasty, tasty food. 

My husband's list is undoubtedly even longer. We just love this place. Give it a try. DO IT!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Thai. DO NOT let the lackluster appearance scare you. THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!! $3.95 for lunch, really? Thailand prices in PHX! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the appearance. But I was there for ambiance. The food is bomb!"}
{"text":"On a whim, a few of us ordered lunch here last week.  With the prices of the lunch specials, we were not sure what to expect. And to our delight, the food was great! Definitely plan to eat here again. My only regret is that it took me so long to try their food."}
{"text":"Noodles and Rice hooked me with their Panang Curry.  They will serve it several ways, and will customize it any way you like.  My favorite is to get the Panang Curry with Noodles.  The beef is lean and tender.... never overcooked, but it is good with chicken too. 

I've tasted the Tom Ka and the Tom Gai, both excellent.  The crab rangoon is the best I have ever eaten.  It isn't like you will find anywhere else.  They add a liberal dose of pepper.  Edamame is a great starter.

On the heavier side (read that as fried) The lemon chicken and the orange chicken are fried in a light batter then served with the sauce.  Lemon is more tangy and is absolutely delicious.  I prefer the orange though because it is quite spicy.  They both tasted great.  The quality of the meat was excellent.

The fried rice is rather plain in contrast to the pungent flavors of the main courses.  That worked just fine for me.  The only thing I have tasted there that I would not order again was the hot and sour soup.  It was more vinegary than i expected.  I guess I need convention when it comes to my hot and sour.

I am so glad that I found this place.  They are very inexpensive (which earns a weekly visit from me) and the location is very convenient."}
{"text":"You just can't beat the lunch special. $5.95 gets you a rice entree (there's 22 choices), an eggroll, a soup, and a drink. I've read that the Thai is what this place is known for but the Mon-Fri deal just can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Been coming here for years and I honestly can't think of anything negative to say. Always staffed by the same friendly and familiar faces and the place is typically filled with regulars. The most negative things I can think of are that the dining room only has a few tables so getting a seat during peak hours could be tricky and when they are busy the order wait time can get a little long (but that just speaks to the demand) And they're closed on Sunday  The Food Quality:Price ratio is quite good. An easy one to recommend.
I'm no foodie but in my view the quality of the food and the quality of the preparation is at least a full step higher than what I would typically expect from typical Asian casual/takeouts. They punch well above their strip mall weight."}
{"text":"I'm giving only one star for the service because it was great.. I give no more stars because the food was absolutely horrible. There was no flavor in our food and it was greasy. Both my BF and I came home sick from the food."}
{"text":"We have been going to Noodle & Rice for the past 3 years and every time we come in, it just keeps going downhill. 

The location is a little bit hard to find because it is towards the end of a shopping center. Parking is not that hard. The restaurant itself was small, it can probably fit about 30-45 max people. Clean but nothing fancy.

Our favorite is the Katsudon, Yakisoba and Crab Puffs. The food is always served hot and fresh out of the kitchen AND really cheap. What frustrates me is the wait time. The past few visits we came here, we didn't get our appetizer until 40 minutes after we sat down. And had to wait another 30 minutes for our food. The server (the one who always wear an apron and eye glasses) was not so polite and seemed like she just wanted us out of there. 

I am not sure if I will comeback since we have experienced better service from other local Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Meh. This place needs love. Why did I let myself be swayed by the 4-star average? Why did I encourage my colleagues to join me in eating here? There was nowhere to sit comfortably. The \"best seat in the house\" is located next to a disturbingly noisy TV and radio. The Pad Thai is fine, except the chicken cleared my appetite. It had this gamey taste. I kept trying to disguise the flavor by continuously squeezing lime over the dish. You know, the people who work here seem very nice, and for their sake I hope they step it up a big fat notch. Noodle & Rice, it's time for an extreme makeover."}
{"text":"went with friends, it was small, awkward decor, friendly staff, but the food was not good at all.  don't waste your time. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Don't believe the ratings. No matter how long it takes, they will tell you forty minutes. Maybe you'll arrive to cold food or no food and 30 minute wait. 

This place is bad and they should feel bad. I've been to many a pan-asian joint, from american fusion to \"what in the hell language is that?\". I've never been to one where their english is perfect and yet they will clearly pretend to not understand you.

The food is sub par, but it is cheap, which immediately appeals to me. However it comes with a cost. Sure you'll have 7 days of diarrhea in 30 minutes, but I am okay with that.

The service. Oh, the service. Cacti have more hospitality. The manager, typically the one taking the orders, seems nice but is the very rude if you ask for anything not expressly on the menu. 

Save yourself the hospital trip and go anywhere else. Chino's, Super Dragon, Good Taste House.

Only good part is it's close. After having been, I wouldn't eat there if I lived upstairs.

Please other asian restaurants, move closer! We need you!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled we found this place. Don't judge this place by its appearance. The stripmall its located in is run down, and the interior is tiny and outdated. But the food is great! I ordered the green curry with tofu which was phenomenal. Perfectly spiced. My bf had the drunken noodles, extra hot, with chicken and shrimp. He loved it too despite the tears running down his face. We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were so fresh tasting and the peanut sauce was soooo good.
Our two entrees, two drinks, and appetizer only cost us $22. What an amazing value. And their lunch specials are only $3.
The service was great. They are very sweet. Also it is BYOB with no corkage fee. Next time we are taking a bottle of wine or picking up some Thai beer."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time and this hit the spot!  It took awhile but their website clearly states the longer wait during peak hours and they were nice enough to call and verify that I knew of the extended wait.   Best crab Rangoons, deliciously flavorful Tom yum, puffy orange shrimp with the sauce thoughtfully separate to preserve crispness,  and yummy stir-fried noodles with their house marinated roast pork.   Best quality delivered food! This place is always solid."}
{"text":"Noodle and Rice is an undiscovered gem.  We have an office nearby and have lunch here about twice a week.  We also have a son who lives in Tempe who loves red curry.  We entice him to visit  us on a weekly basis because he now will no longer order red curry anywhere else!  This is the real deal.  They use coconut milk, not watered down so it has the right consistency and he orders it Thai hot WITH Thai chilis.  He's a burn it to the ground guy and says he's never had it as hot anywhere else in town.  My husband is a fan of the bamee noodles (add beef, double shrimp) with a side of the best chow mein you've ever had to tone down the Thai hot way he orders it.   My standby is the Garlic Noodles, add shrimp and a little extra hot for an extra 2 bucks.  It makes 2 meals for me.  We always start with a chicken egg roll for a buck.  Best in town....they add a little hint of cinnamon that just sets it off.  I've also had the General Tao chicken and it is the best I've ever had.  Fresh and tender with light sauce.  Everything is cooked to order and FRESH FRESH FRESH!  I can't wait until the weather cools off because I have my eye on some of the soup bowl meals."}
{"text":"Jenky-looking, and small, but worth your time. I prefer take out, because the Panang Crisp Noodles seemed to have a better texture when I poured the sauce myself. Ive also done it with rice instead of noodles, which is pretty good too. The down side is that they will randomly charge me for subbing veggies for meat, but not always. Look past that though, and try the noidles. They are such an unusual and refreshing texture/ taste."}
{"text":"hidden gem. call in orders were ringing non stop, i believe its family run andt heres only a few employees but so worth the wait! i finally found my chinese spot since moving here!"}
{"text":"When I came on Yelp to review this place, I was surprised at its rating. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I had Kung Pao chicken. It was tasteless and had no spice even though it was marked on the menu as one of the spicy dishes (and should be). At least they offered brown rice. I had the lunch combo. The egg roll was average. I guess I'm just spoiled; I'm used to the little noodle and rice shops in Chicago. I was hoping  this was going to be like that because Phoenix could certainly use some. It's right next to my nail place so maybe I'll give it another try and order a dish that's mentioned under a high rating."}
{"text":"FYI, I'm trying to broaden my flavor horizons and order food I usual wouldn't, and I must say, the Panang Noodles (extra spicy) are delicious! The Tom Yum Noodles are great as well. The Hawaiian Fried Rice is a fave for me too. 
I'm honestly never disappointed with this place (there was actually only 1 time when they were out of crab rangoons, I opted for the fried won tons instead and was disappointed at the tiny amount of meat in there). Other than that one-off time, I really love this place. Their delivery time is pretty accurate as well.

P. S. They state no MSG on their menu, and indeed I have not found there to be any! Sooooo relieving. I'd have a horrible headache if there was any hint of it. So eat easy folks! ;)"}
{"text":"Took quite a while to get served, only had one person doing everything but cooking. They were backed up with delivery and take out orders."}
{"text":"Having to completely throw out two dishes you bought because neither of you were going to venture a second bite of orange(?) chicken, was that really orange I tasted?   Thats not a good sign.  The only palatable thing here was the coconut milk soup and I've had better versions at every other Thai place in town.....I should have known better when I saw the menu had Thai and Chinese dishes on it.  But I wanted Thai food....delivered.  So I used good ole Yelp. I'm starting to wonder about the tastebuds of the Phoenix Yelping community.  Does prolonged exposure to the sun and all those shots of Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo Tequila destroy your palates?   This restaurant has a 4 star average......shame on you yelpers....shame."}
{"text":"Really good. Had the hot and sour soup and the sesame chicken. The noodles were just ok otherwise i would say five stars! Nice place and very local and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and it got to my house within an hour, like they quoted me. I was pretty excited because I had been craving Pad Thai for weeks. When I opened it up, it LOOKED delicious. I went to take a portion from the to-go container and put it onto my plate, but the noodles were so dry that the ENTIRE serving of Pad Thai noodles stayed together in one big clump. I tried a bite to see if maybe it wasn't as dry as it seemed, and boy was it dry. And flavorless! I took a couple of bites and threw it away. It was like eating paper. Waste of my money."}
{"text":"Very good ! My boyfriend got the sesame chicken which was delicious and I got the yakisoba !!! Cheap and fast !"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here! Arrived within half an hour for delivery, had too wait to eat because it was still hot!! Very big servings for the price!! Delicious too! I had the baby egg rolls and the thai boat noodle soup! I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in the entire valley. If you like spicy the Thai Basil Fried Rice is my go to. Pad Thai is awesome as well, as I use that as a measuring stick on wether or not I go back to any Thai restaurant. The curries are pretty good as well. Again as some have reviewed the inside is kind of cramped but it's a great hole in the wall that I have been going to for the last 3 years, but when I want Thai I'll drive the 35 minutes from the West Valley to get my fix."}
{"text":"We go here often because the food is delicious!  It's a small restaurant in a strip mall next to QT.  It is a BYOB.  They also offer delivery.  Best Asian food and service in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Parang noodle is the best.  Mega heat, but even more flavor.  Get it once, you will be a fan for life."}
{"text":"This small hidden place is amazing! The great pricing and bold flavors really hit the spot. I have gotten great service while both dining there and grabbing to go. I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on Saturday evening, we went in and ordered take out.  They were pretty busy so it took about 25 minutes.  Miso soup was good, egg drop soup good, I didn't care for flavor of the hot and sour soup which was a bummer because I liked how much tofu etc was in it.  The orange chicken was fantastic!  Try it, the sauce has a good amount of kick to it.  I did not care for the pork fried rice, not a lot of flavor to it.  We will definitely give this place another to try though.  Give it a whirl.  There are only a few tables so take out is your best bet."}
{"text":"My favorite local Thai place. The green curry is amazing, love the panang noodles are awesome and you cannot go wrong with any of the soups."}
{"text":"Love this spot for takeout! Obsessed! I love how you can order online and pick it up!"}
{"text":"Noodle and Rice is my go-to Chinese delivery place. 

I've tried a number of items on their menu - sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, panang curry - and they've all been top-notch. The dishes served with battered meats are always crispy and flavorful, the vegetables are always fresh and have a good bite to them - and it's not just because they are always delivered (not dine-in, but delivery) with sauce on the side so that stuff doesn't have time to get soggy. 

The pad Thai and panang noodles are excellent. Crab puffs are tasty and (I'd guess) made in-store, since I've never seen a pre-made rangoon that has fresh diced peppers in it. The egg rolls are unusual but tasty, with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon.

The staff is always friendly, and delivery has always been right on the mark; generally it takes 45 minutes for delivery, but when they say 45 minutes, they have *always* been there 45 minutes or sooner.

To the person who rated a star because it took an extra 15 minutes to get the order, I can say that out of fifteen times ordering at this place I've *never* failed to receive the callback they mentioned; I would be more likely to believe that you misentered the telephone number.

Dining in can be a bit cramped, and if I were to consider this as a dine-in I'd probably give it more like 3.5 stars; it really is a hole-in-the-wall, and seating is a bit cramped, probably not a good decor or ambiance for 'date night'. But for Chinese take-out or delivery, this place tops everything else I've found."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast and friendly service and not pretentious or high priced. It's a little gem hidden in yet another shopping strip. Glad I found it, will be going back!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and delicious!!  Enough said.

If you don't go here, you will be missing out on a hidden gem.

{"text":"Solid 3.5. I desperately wanted to love this place. In terms of proximity to home and overall coziness, this seemed like an ideal Thai restaurant. I had the pad see eew and the girlfriend had the drunken noodles. We ordered the spring roll as well. Spring rolls were tasty, a great starter item per usual. Pad see eew was on point. I added baby corn, and lemme tell ya, they were liberal with the baby corn. No complaints about my favorite Thai dish! Flavor 100%. I was satisfied to the core. The drunken noodles were very, very spicy, but yummy nonetheless. We were warned by our server, but I only took a few bites and was done for. I would suggest ordering drunken noodles family style only...My girlfriend is a heat seeking fiend, and she struggled to eat her dish. She was warned twice that it was \"very spicy\" but agreed to it anyway. I found it odd that spice levels were not adjustable, but it is what it is. 

We dined in on a Wednesday night. It was indeed busy - plenty of dine in customers AND take out orders. Unfortunately, we had to wait 50 or so minutes for our food. This left us a tad hangry for a bit - small Asian place like this...I typically assume hot plates to come out quick.

*note for vegetarians* I was hoping to try the Tom Yum soup and the curries...(hence the reason we got two noodle dishes), but they all have a fish sauce already cooked into it. That was a big bummer, and the reason why this place loses an additional star. 

I don't think my girlfriend would return for the drunken noodles, but I'm not opposed to ordering the pad see eew again! ...I forgot to mention, the portions are HUGE! Plenty to take home. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed Noodle and Rice before so I know I'm duplicating efforts here. The first one was several years ago and I have been a regular customer for probably 10 years now. The food is always amazing. I've been working my way through the menu (I don't do seafood though) and everything I've ever gotten is wonderful. You just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Incredible food at great pricing.   Found this place by accident and boy am i glad.  I have eaten here twice n the last week."}
{"text":"Excellent little place!!  Friendky staff and GREAT food.  The drunken noodles were so good (and very spicy).  I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online from their website. This is the first time I've ever eaten here. I got the green curry with chicken and added tofu with chow mein. Food took an hour and 20 Minutes to be delivered, but their website warns of the time. The lady who delivered the food was very sweet. The food was amazing! I got the x spicy level, the spice is definitely there but not overpowering. I will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I meet here about once every other month and always enjoy the fresh, hot, tasty entries and a price nobody can complain about!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and great prices!

I won't say the food was quick, because we waited about 20 mins after ordering, BUT it was definitely some of the best chinese/thai I've had in the valley AND its cheap!!

As a first timer, first impressions are a must and I will definitely be back. We were greeted right away and the lady at the counter was prompt to take our orders.

I got the Panang curry with rice, small wonton soup, and gyoza, while my husband ordered the fried rice & mongolian beef. All of our food was great tasting and the portions were not skimpy.

If you're looking for asian food (because they have chinese, thai, & japanese dishes) this is a great place to go! Just make sure to call in your order first! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch recently and enjoyed it.  I sat down and was greeted promptly by a friendly server.  It's a small place with only 6 tables or so. They have lunch specials that are super cheap, so I had a difficult time deciding between ordering one of those or trying one of their Thai noodle dishes.  There were over 20 lunch special offers, but they all came with rice and were typical Chinese fare (Chicken Broccoli, General Tso's, etc.).  I decided I wanted to try the noodles, so I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken.  I also ordered a vegetable spring roll.  The service was quick and I liked how it was quiet in there.  The spring roll was really tasty with a good crunch and yummy dipping sauce.  My Thai dish consisted of wide flat noodles, chicken, broccoli, and egg in a sweet teriyaki type sauce.  The broccoli was cooked al dente, which I like.  It could have used more sauce because it did seem a bit dry.  I will check this place out again and try something different."}
{"text":"OK, seriously? The lunch portion sizes are huge for the price! I met some friends here for the $3.95 or $5.95 lunch special and we were shocked at what you got for that. We all ended up \"upgrading\" to the $5.95 with soup, roll and drink and were super happy. The interior is clean and yes, it's a total hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but what would expect being that it's next to a gas station? We loved it and will be back, especially because it fits within our lunch hour time frame. By the way, the crab rangoun appetizers - fabulous. We ordered two of them. Great deal and good food ;)"}
{"text":"Love this little spot. Love the prices. Love the food. 

I am guilty on occasion of being a bit of a cheapskate, so I'm tempted to just emphasize the low cost of dining at Noodle and Rice. That would be an injustice, however, since the food is great and equivalent to a much more expensive restaurant. I guess there's a lot to be said for low overhead, the benefit of an odd location facing a Quik Trip convenience store.

N & R is cozy. Not small. That would imply it's a problem. Cozy. There are just eight tables, each seating four, and a couple of stools. That's it. The d√©cor is fun. And the restaurant seems to do a thriving carryout and delivery business. Our recent visit was kind of late, just an hour before their 9:00 p.m. closing time. No problem getting a table, but it can be an issue at other times.

We love the Thai Iced Tea. The 99 cent chicken eggs rolls with sweet and sour sauce are tasty. We ordered and shared both Thai and Chinese offerings. I'm sure this is a violation of foodie purist code, but it works well for our taste buds. The Panang Curry is especially delicious. Despite the low prices, N & R is generous with the chicken in the dishes we ordered. And the menu is surprisingly diverse for such a tiny establishment.

The kids meals are amazingly affordable, just $2.95 including drink.  

Yes, I know I ended up emphasizing the restaurant's low prices, which I promised I wouldn't do. Oh well. 

If you are across the street at Carolina's and the crowd there is a hassle, try wandering over to Noodle & Rice. Whether you are a fan of Thai or Chinese food, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was sick and was craving miso soup,and it was almost as good as the one there servant  hibachi restaurant, Fixed my food Poisoning.also got a kids meal it of  teriyaki chicken and was delious had the right amount of food for me to be stuffed on."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite Thai place, but it has steadily declined in food quality. Tonight I had ordered the Panang Curry for take out, when I opened my food I had curry and only chicken. Nothing else. Since when did Panang Curry not consist of potatoes and Carrots???? Or at least some mixture of vegetables."}
{"text":"Whoa! Great little Thai & Chinese place. Great prices and quality. The waitress/hostess for the tiny place is super friendly and helpful. And they knew how to make a dish vegan!

Super hot dish I ordered called Drunken Noodles. Had Jalepenos and Thai chiles. My lips are burning / numb. What da."}
{"text":"Came in here today when I was looking for a quick and cheap late lunch. I drive by this location almost every day so I thought I would give it a try. We ordered the crab ragoons and tom yum soup to start. The ragoons were good, but they had an extra ingredient in them that I am not used to. The overall flavor was a little unfamiliar, and I order these at every Thai restaurant I go to. The soup was pretty good and even the regular size portion was enough for two people to share in an appetizer. 

I ordered pad Thai and it was good, but I needed something to add spice to it. I'm used to be asked what level of spice I want in the dish, but I was not asked here. Next time I will request a little extra spice in it. My friend ordered the Panang curry noodle dish. I tried a few bites of this and all I can say is wow. It was delicious! This was definitely the winning dish of the day. Overall, I would return for the Panang curry and pad Thai."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions the food is great atmosphere is always great food is very well priced once you go here you will come back"}
{"text":"I decided to order from N&R after wanting take out.while watching ASU football in sweats and seeing the high rating, which is not typical for asian take out. I was fairly skeptical as I'm high maintainance about my food, and distrusting of hole in the wall chinese food (except Chino Bandido). I cant speak for the inside, as I definitely sent my husband to get it. 

It took 15 minutes from order to the car, which is fine, but order ahead BY PHONE, if you can. For those complaining about the online ordering, grow up and learn to actually communicate with someone.

I ordered sesame chicken and an egg roll. First, it was an insane amount of food for $8. Second, it was SOOO good. The chicken and broccoli were so fresh and there were no pieces of chicken that were questionable. The sauce wasn't already on the chicken, so it wouldn't get slimy on the way home. I cannot speak highly enough. It was very, very good.

I will thoroughly enjoy the leftovers for lunch tomorrow while watching the Broncoa game. I'm one happy (and very full) lady."}
{"text":"Ordered hot and sour soup, sesame seed chicken with broccoli and house fried rice with shrimp, beef and chicken. Worst I've ever had even at an airport. Our family threw it out and went out to dinner. Even the delivery person was rude. Tipped $4.80 on a $25 bill."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, tooooo long a wait. With kids, seemed much. Worth the wait. Menu options are good, priced great, we will visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here not too long ago for dinner.  The prices are insanely low, I don't know how they make any profit at all.  The place was dead, so I sat by the tv.  I ordered a small hot and sour soup;  it was the biggest bowl of soup I've ever been given in any restaurant.  It was good, but there was no way I was going to eat it all.  The timing was pretty bad, since they brought my entree (sesame chicken) out about a minute and a half after the gargantuan bowl of soup.  The sesame chicken was alright.  The portion was also large.

Not long after I had been there, a woman (I'm assuming she was an owner/worked there) came into the restaurant and took a laptop from next to the tv and sat down at the booth right next to mine and got on the laptop.  I just felt a little awkward since she had chosen to sit right next to me while I was eating.  At least sit across the restaurant so that your guests don't feel weird :("}
{"text":"I recently discovered Noodle & Rice in my never ending quest to find good Asian cuisine in Phoenix. I have tried several items on the menu, but my absolute favorite is the Thai boat noodle soup, which is a bit like a Thai version of pho. The Noodle & Rice version of this soup is the best I have ever had. I have also tried some of the Japanese and Chinese dishes, and they are very good too. The curry is OK, but you can find better choices on the menu. Noodle & Rice is a small restaurant and dishes are made to order, so if you have a large party or are in a rush, you may want to do take out instead."}

{"text":"I read all the great reviews from this place so I was excited to try it. I ordered it online and it said it'll be ready in 30 minutes. When we got there 20 minutes later they said that they had technical difficulties with their printer apparently and it didn't print out so we had to wait another half an hour for the food. Finally an hour later we got home to eat it and honestly I wasn't impressed. The yakisomi noodles were very dry, there were very little vegetables and the beef was not good. The drunken noodles were also dry and not very hot although we did order medium so that could've been our part but they were still dry. The dumplings were over fried and very dry as well. The crab rangoons were okay. I'm not sure I will be returning but I guess I should've guessed with the low prices."}
{"text":"Great food!  Friendly staff that is helpful.  With every dish you can choose the protein you want (chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp).  It has a relaxed friendly atmosphere and authentic feel.  Plus it is locally owned and operated."}
