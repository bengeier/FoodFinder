{"text":"Tandul is super awesome. Food and staff are great.  Have been here once for dinner and once for lunch buffet. Both were delicious. Buffet had a nice variety."}
{"text":"Got to say I was looking forward to this, but Saturday night was miserable.  We had a table at 5:30 PM, earlier than we had expected and looking back on the evening we would've never made a later reservation.   It took over an hour to get our main orders in, over 35 minutes to get drinks, for just three of us, a new bartender who seem to have no appreciation of serving drinks in a timely manner-got us the wrong drinks the first time., a server who had zero previous experience working in a restaurant.   After almost 2 hours, we finally brought the owner over and explained how dissatisfied we were with our service. He admitted that he had no restaurant experience, currently runs a convenient store, and his partner runs a gas station. He was very nice, and did everything you could to improve our experience. While we were waiting several other couples ended up leaving, after waiting over an hour to be seated.  All in all, I'm sure this will turn out to be a nice Indian restaurant in the heart of Tremont. They are clearly not ready for prime time, cannot handle big crowds, and do not have a seasoned staff with restaurant experience.  I would however like to return in six months time to see how much has improved. The food was outstanding, and will be a nice addition to the Fremont area."}
{"text":"The food is good here but don't go for catering purposes. The trays were mostly sauce with few pieces of meat and veggies, it was kind of embarrassing how little substance is actually in the tray."}
{"text":"Epic fail... Was eager to try Tandul after reading favorable reviews but Saturday night was a disaster.  Made a  6:45 PM, reservation and arrived on time.   No one approached us when we walked in. Found a server and asked to be seated for our reservation. The server wandered away and the owner walked over shaking his head and said he had no table for our party of four. We said we could wait a bit but he said he had just seated the rest of the tables and that \"Indian food takes time.\" He said it probably would be impossible for us to be served even if he could seat us. I said but we had a reservation and he seemed to indicate that Yelp Reservations was the problem. He then proceeded to lecture us about when we should visit the restaurant and be able to actually get a meal. I was astonished and repeated that we had a reservation. He admitted that he had no restaurant experience, and currently runs a convenience store, and a gas station. We left hungry and with no reservation on a busy Saturday night we scrambled to find an alternative."}
{"text":"Great range of selections on menu, and everything that we ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. A bit out of the way, but service was exceptional and food delicious."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Cleveland and my favorite Indian restaurant ever!  I have spent a great deal of time traveling all over India and I can confidently say that the food here is truly authentic and the quality is exceptional!  They have the best chia and paneer in town!  I heard that there have been mixed reviews about this place but I belive that it is only because they got too popular too fast and just needed some time to properly staff and get into the groove of things. The owner is kind and conscientious and obviously takes great pride in what he is offering and makes you feel like an honored guest.."}
{"text":"I called them not knowing what to order because I didn't have the menu and the man I spoke to was so helpful and everything he suggested was delicious! It was prepared quickly and they are so friendly! We ate the chilly paneer which is cottage cheese cubes and I'm not normally a cheese person but it was so tasty. We also had the mushroom pepper fry and gobi 65...SO FRICKIN GOOD! So flavorful! We also had the madras chicken and veg chettinad...also absolutely delicious. The best Indian Curry I've had in Ohio. And don't forget to try the garlic Naan! We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place this lovely and cozy Indian Restaurant is. Had Mumbai Martini which was good although a bit sweet to my taste buds. They do have ton of wines/beers/hard liquor on the menu. Had their spicy Gobi for appetizer, it was delicious. Nice kick to it. Had the Goat Chettinad with Onion Kulcha, yumm. So so good. For dessert had the pistachio kulfi, which was okay. Hence 4 stars. But the main course and appetizer were finger licking good. One of the best Indian food I had in USA. I will for sure visit again."}
{"text":"The food was really rich, flavorful and delicious -- and my husband and I are pretty particular when it comes to Indian food. We ordered take out and the food was ready within 30 minutes and the server called to let us know.  My only tiny disappointment was that the main features of the dishes could have been a bit more substantial. For instance, while the Malai Kofta sauce was amazing, I was left wanting more than four smallish of the fried potato and cottage cheese balls. We will be back though, and I'm really hoping this restaurant is a success!"}
{"text":"Server was very nice but the place is so dirty. Had to leave and could not get past the filthy menu and cooks in kitchen coughing and sneezing."}
{"text":"Finally!  Great Indian food in Tremont. The food is impeccable. The service was outstanding.  The drinks were top notch. I can't say enough about this place. Their lunch buffet is better up there with the best I have ever been too. You won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love this place! If you plan to dine in, allot a decent amount of time. The service is great but the food does take a little longer than most are probably used to. It is 100% worth it! The food is fantastic. I've had 3 or 4 of the vegetarian dishes and would recommend all of them... the vegetable korma, paneer tikka masala, and especially the paneer pasanda. Definitely try one of their naans too! Also, if your sensitive to spicy make sure you emphasize that you want it very mild! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. There are plenty of better Indian restaurants in Cleveland (Cafe Tandoor, Choolah and Saffron Patch to name just a few).  Poor service made the entire experience worse. Considering how expensive Indian food generally is, we had hoped for more.   There was one woman taking orders for a large portion of the restaurant. Drinks took half-an-hour to arrive. The server did not seem to write down our appetizer order and dinner showed up and ended up just being so-so (the sauces were under-spiced and not very distinctive)."}
{"text":"Very welcomed addition to Tremont and such friendly staff! Andrei is wonderful and takes the time to get to know his customers by name and remembers our likes and dislikes. The chef was able to beautifully accommodate my nut allergy so I could enjoy the wonderful food!  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I want to give them a zero star.  We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had a very sub-par experience to say the least.  If they ever want to seat you in 'the room', please decline or wait for a different table. 'The room' itself is off on the side so you cannot wave anybody over if you need service. Also, there is a table for 2 where you enter the 'the room'. So if someone is seated there you cannot go in or out of 'the room' without having to ask the people there to move. Once you are in that room you are as good as forgotten when it comes to service. They will come in 5 minutes after you get your appetizer to get orders for your entrees and then forget about you. I had to call the restaurant twice while I was in 'the room' to get service. Then the manager shows up and said that the staff was over twice to take entree orders which had happenned  20 minutes before I had to call the front desk. We had just received our appetizers when they came over to ask for entrees. We had told them to give us some time while we worked on the appetizer. At this point they should have just apologized and comp-ed our meal. I got a 'we did our job' and 'do you want to order anything else before we get your check' kind or response.  The staff is clueless about what is on the menu. You will get answers like 'I do not know anything about the non-vegetrian options' or ' i do not know anything about alcohol or beer options'. Then you have to tell them to bring someone who can answer those questions for you. Am I running the restaurant or your staff is? For the prices they are charging they might as well hire someone with knowledge of what is on the menu or provide some training to the staff.   The scale of hotness for their food is rated from 1 to 10. We ordered the paneer which was supposed to be a 5 but turned out to be more of a 8. Our toddler spit out the food once and refused to eat it afterwards. We also ordered the 'malai chicken kebab' which was overdone for some pieces and ok for the others. I would suggest you skip this restaurant if you want any semblance of service. The ambiance is nice but you can go to the art museum to get a more authentic experience in the Indian exhibits."}
{"text":"I don't know if we went on an off night or if it's just growing pains, but I had an awful experience here. We felt like we waited forever for everything - a table, menus, drinks, silverware and napkins, and our food, which was okay but nothing particularly special. It was busy, and our server was nice - but it also seemed like they had never served a day in their life. Everything was off and off putting. Hoping the restaurant gets it together. A lot of potential there."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with their food.    Food is delicious, great addition to Tremont.    (There is a lunch buffet for a great value, if you are unsure of what to order.)    And their butter BREAD made in a Tandul Oven is worth the trip alone.   (and the garlic nan too)"}
{"text":"The  menu is complex for those who aren't familiar with Indian cuisine but our server Sara who was new on the job did a great job of answering our questions.  With no background in the cuisine I don't know how stack up against other Indian restaurants.  The food was flavorful and it was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Legit authentic Indian food that stays true to their word and menu. The staff is wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"Was thoroughly impressed! The food is fantastic and reasonably priced. A great representation of many Indian foods on the menu. Tried several things including their take on Aloo Gobi, Chana Masala and their house/traditional dal. Everything was delicious. Love that it's in Tremont and can easily walk to have a drink afterward. They also have a full bar."}
{"text":"The only legit Indian in cleveland. Have dined here a half dozen times. Always very good. Service is fine. They actually take your order for take out and have food ready when they say. See review on Taste of Kerala on chagrin - that place should spend some time learning from tandul."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place! Our server was extremely friendly and we totally loved her. The Samoas were excellent, so was the Chicken 65 & Chicken Manchurian. The 4 of us dining each got different entrees and loved everyone. The garlic naan was amazing and we can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"First of all we have to take into account that they are still new and trying to get all their ducks in a row... with that said... The food was very good.  The servers still need to learn the menu though. My husband specifically asked if the goat curry was boneless and the server assured him that it was... It wasn't... But the flavor was still good. But I got the Chicken Masala and it was excellent.  The other couple with us also enjoyed their meal.  The naan was also tasty. The down side is that if you want a decent sized table for more than 2 people you better get a reservation because the seating is really limited. And the one thing that both couples agreed on (especially the women) is that it can get super cold in there!  We had to sit in the front by the bar - and although the atmosphere is nice, we had to keep our coats on the whole time!  We heard other patrons complain also.  The main problem is that although they have a double door entryway, there is an open window between the two doors so the cold air just blasts in!  It is kinda hard to explain - just take my word for it : ) So anyway, the 3 stars is because the food is good - we are sure the servers will become more proficient - but the bad design for the doorway and the cold weather mean that we will probably not be back until springtime."}
{"text":"I'm a vegan and I don't care for spicy food so this place didn't work for me. There was only one vegan option (Chana masala) and the breads all had dairy, which is unusual for an Indian restaurant so I was disappointed. The wait staff was friendly but my lychee martini took a very long time to come out and didn't taste like lychee. The samosa was ok but the pappadams were very spicy (and both chutneys were very very spicy).  It was reasonably priced and the decor was nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian restaurant!  Attentive service, great selection, and the food is delicious. Our favorite Indian spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"An amazing meal ... some excellent standards but the best treat was experiencing Chettinad dishes.  This spice mixture was a unique and fabulously flavor filled combination. The service was attentive and friendly. Do stop by, it is a meal you will remember!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with two friends. Was excited to try it because of reviews. We were the only ones in the restaurant. 10 minutes later, a couple showed up for lunch. And that was it for the whole time we were there. Service was incredibly slow. We ordered a soda and it didn't show up until one of us got up to ask for it. Utensils were dirty. It took nearly an hour to get our food. The other table was served before ours. One of my friends ordered a shrimp dish. It came on a hot plate with salad as the base. Who puts fresh salad on a hot plate?? Shrimp with wilted salad...do you know how much it cost? $25! I ordered chickpeas and a veggie dish. Meh. Let me tell you, I adore Indian food and cook it myself. I will not eat here again nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"An unassuming gem of a restaurant. Went for a date on a Friday evening and was surprised to see the place barely half full.   The menu is extensive but the server was helpful in helping us choose. We got drinks, naan, and two entrees (one vegetarian and one meat). Everything was excellent!  The server was sweet and attentive. My only qualm, which is minor, is that the decor is a bit dated. That's the reason this place is not a 5/5 in my opinion.  Will definitely be back and would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking to try some great indian food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I had the same experience as Olwen C. when I tried to eat at Tandul last week.  Their website and even the hours on the front door said they should be open, but they were not.  Left very annoyed that I wasted my time driving there.    Make sure you call first!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night at 830.   All apps for a group of four were forgotten.  I expressed my love of spicy food to our server and I am an adventurous eater.  He recommended lamb masala.   It was Very bland even with eating all red peppers included.   Never offered a refill on our beers or cocktails. Lousy experience and will be looking elsewhere for Indian."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Their vegetarian fare is usually pretty flavorful, and I find their food comforting if not particularly interesting. I think that's how I'd describe it, comforting but not really compelling in a gourmet way. Their carryout is pretty trustworthy; I've had it 3-4 times -  sometimes their rice is bland and dry.  I don't particularly love dining in - it's cozy if you sit in the front, but in the back, you can see them packing up all the carryout orders, and the last two tables by the bathrooms can smell the bathrooms. I feel like the twinkle lights hide how much this place needs some TLC; the baseboards, once white, are black, the paint on the walls has nicks and smudges on it, as do the tv screens. The music is slightly too loud; we had to ask them to turn it down twice, and we had to repeat ourselves four times until they could hear us the second time. They push the drink menu, and seem disappointed when you don't order from it (the waitress asked us, \"So nothing to drink?!\" when she had just poured us water, the second comment we heard on that in an evening). The guy who brought our check very stereotypically brought my boyfriend the bill, and handed me the boxes to pack everything up. I think it's probably worth the drive/wait to order from Namaste India Garden instead. Their food is more reliably fresh and is solidly excellent, not average."}
{"text":"It's so great to see an Indian restaurant close to the downtown Cleveland area! The food here is phenomenal, and you can tell that they really take time to prepare the food, and don't load it up with cream like many other Indian restaurants I've been to. For the beer connoisseurs out there, their list is pretty amazing for an Indian restaurant. The local tavern-like atmosphere is pretty cool as well. The only complaint I would have is that sometimes service is a bit un-coordinated and tables are mixed up, however they get it right in the end and definitely make up for it if they do mess up."}
{"text":"I love Tremont, but the one complaint I have is that there isn't a whole lot of variety in the restaurants. Lots of typical american food, and your \"ethnic\" options are Barrio and Ginko. Tandul is an extremely welcome change.  The design choices really work in setting a nice atmosphere. The lights, serving bowls, and bar area all work together to make the aesthetic really work. It doesn't feel like it was just renovated, it feels like it's been there forever. Andrei (the main server) is quick to greet you and makes a real effort to learn your name. He welcomes any kind of feedback, from their unique cocktails (like an Indian take on the margarita) to the menu layout.  I've been there 3 times since they've opened, and have been trying to get different things each time. Each variety of naan I've gotten has been excellent, as well as all the main dishes. The servings are a decent size, and they're priced pretty well in line with the rest of Tremont.  If I had to offer criticisms, it would be 2 things:  1) Very little seating, and most of it for 2. They can maybe hold 40 people.  2) Not a lot of rice served with the meal when you have 2 people dining. I've had to ask for additional rice each time, but they've been happy to do so.  So, give the burgers and pizza a rest. Try some real, good indian food. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome food. My favorite so far is malabari chicken and chicken tandoor.  I have always looked for typical Indian street style tandoor in this country and I think I found it now."}
{"text":"Horrible service, buffet food was cold and seemed like leftovers from a previous day  Had to ask Caucasian waiter for my water and naan after 10 minutes of waiting, while manager just sat at the bar looking at his phone. Don't refer to me as \"guy\" or \"dude\" when bringing my water please.   Would not recommend this Indian restaurant. Bad service and bad food"}
{"text":"We had ordered Chilly Chicken, Angari Chicken, Goat Biriyani, Goat Curry, Onion Kulcha, Tandoori Roti and Butter Naan.  The tables are waited by warm waiters who really care for your needs. We were greeted by two baskets of variety of Papaddam and chutneys. Meat were well cooked. The dishes were flavorful. Angari Chicken takes away the 'best on the table' crown. I took off a star because the waiting time is a bit more than the average. But it might be because it was a busy day for them and the business is just 4 months old. I would like them to improve on this front though. I would surely go back when I crave for Indian food again and definitely going to recommend my friends to go and try out the new joint."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken tikka masala and saag paneer. I also liked the garlic naan. They also have this amazing mango purée type non-alcoholic drink that is super tasty and comes in a HUGE glass. Wait staff keeps your water glass full. And no wait on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is excellent....if it ever shows up at your table! They need to hire a front of house manager. They are newcomers who don't understand how to run a restaurant. Staff isn't trained. Although owner is a very nice guy, their service is executed miserably. Tandul - a great test of patience."}
{"text":"I thought their food was superb! A wonderful addition to Tremont. Their drinks are great as well and the staff are very friendly! We had the samosas and manchurian both excellent.  And the kofta which I thought was  delicious. The salmon tandoor was something I would go back for. Dessert with their COCONUT KULFI!! Best thing EVER! Tell me how good it is! The 4.5 is because of a slight mix up with the checks between three tables. All in all hilarious just part of growing pains. :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a Saturday afternoon brunch. Decided to try the lunch buffet. Couldn't be happier! Friendly staff, authentic delicious Indian food and the bar was plus!! Would recommend the naan, mughlai chicken, pepper mushrooms and the paneer!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands-down 100% my favorite Indian place in Cleveland ! Never disappoints, super friendly staff, great atmosphere, excellent service always. A must have! The Chana masala is personally my favorite but no one I've ever been with has regretted ordering something new. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious- for the soup to the Manchurian app, to the butter chicken and of course, the addictive garlic naan... Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying: this review is based on a takeout order only. I didn't dine in, I ordered and picked up at 8pm on a Saturday. I know that food can be COMPLETELY different when you dine in, and perhaps this review would take a different tone if so.   The staff was super pleasant, the atmosphere seemed decent. The prices are reasonably fair and my order was ready when I arrived.   As for the food, I was left wanting something a little different. I'm an east coast transplant, so I have a huge exposure to great food (and Indian food) to base this review on. Seeing that this place is sought after by the Tremont locals, I gave it a shot!   We ordered chicken tikka masala and paneer tikka masala with a side of garlic and cheese naan.  The curry lacked depth, and the chicken seemed like it was boiled/baked perhaps? It's sadly never seen the inside of a tandoor, or any grill/open flame/fire for that matter. The dish as a whole was extremely salty and it truly didn't even taste like tikka masala. No stand out traditional spices, no exotic and fun Indian flavors, just cubed chicken in a salty sauce. The paneer itself was excellent, but it also shared the aforementioned flavorless sauce. Bummer. The naan was puzzling. A super thin, very soggy dough that was slathered in butter, garlic and cheese. By cheese, I don't mean paneer. I mean shredded cheese. Imagine that Papa John's and an Indian street food place had a love child... That's the best I can do to describe it. It wasn't horrible, but it was by no means authentic naan. Note: this is the biggest piece of my review that would potential change with a dine-in experience. Wrapping hot things in foil almost ALWAYS translates into lost texture.  The rice was surprisingly the most impressive part of the meal. Light, not over cooked, fresh. It seems like a simple thing, but excellent white rice is deceptively difficult to accomplish.   Three stars for the rice, stand-alone paneer and the service."}
{"text":"Go here. Go here now!  We had such a fabulous time. Called ahead for reservations and they were adorably missed. Normally that would annoy me, but they were so nice and agreeable when we arrived that I quickly forgot.  They suggested the vegetable 555 as an appetizer and it was divine. Salty, smoky and spicy. We also got the butter chicken (classic and delicious) and the vegetable korma, followed by so much delicious naan I quickly forgot my name and slipped into a naan carb coma.  Lovely, fun and flavorful. Go!"}
{"text":"A pretty strong new addition to Tremont. I'm a huge fan of Indian food, and this stacks up well compared to the local competition. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"We really were excited to try this new restaurant, being new to Cleveland we were in search of our \"go-to\" Indian restaurant. When we walked in we were asked if we had a reservation.  unfortunately we didn't, so we asked how long the wait was (we gladly would have waited). We weren't given any wait times but instead were handed the take out menu and told we could order to go-and wait- to take it home. Which would have been fine but a party of three walked in behind us-without reservations and were immediately sat at a small table.  After that, we decided to leave and go to Namaste Indian garden instead."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food! The Chicken Tikka Masala is a safe (and delicious) bet, but everything I've tried, from the Goat Vindaloo, to the Afghani Lamb Chops, to the Tandoori Shimp are incredible. Don't be afraid to branch out here! Also, if you're looking for a happy hour snack, the Samosa and Gobi 65 appetizers are perfect with a cold beer. I get fierce cravings for Indian food on a weekly basis, and this place has blown me away each time.   However, since they're a new restaurant, there have been some issues with service. Never any rudeness - and this absolutely should NOT deter you from checking Tandul out - but in the few times I've been there, the kitchen and waitstaff have some communication issues, leading to some timing problems. For example, last time I was there, the shrimp and lamb were served first (both being quick cooking dishes), while the curries took considerably longer. Basic timing mistake, but I chalk it up to \"new restaurant\" issues. By the time you read this, they'll probably have many of these issues ironed out.  Go check Tandul out. If nothing else, it's a great changeup from the other options on Professor Ave."}
{"text":"Love this place so much!! I had the chicken tikka masala which is the perfect blend of tomatoes and cream with big chunks of high quality chicken. Also had the navratna korma which was just as good, filled with different vegetables and cheese which I've never had in that dish before and was very flavorful. Enjoyed it all with warm naan. Portions are a little small when you eat in the restaurant, but the food is fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've had in the Cleveland area. Period. Delicious. Big selection, good wine list, decent prices...what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Indian cuisine whatsoever, however my husband LOVES it. We went on a Saturday for the buffet so I could sample more items. Everything was tasty and they had a good selection including a garden salad with 3 dressings to choose from. My husband would like to come again!"}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant I have ever been to. Decent ambience, medium spicy and authentic Indian dishes, yummy gulab jamun (probably the best I have ever had) put together satisfy our desire for Indian food to a large extent. Will highly recommend to all Cleveland based Indians out there!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food, kind-but-unobtrusive service, Easy parking, no wait and great drinks.  5 stars definitely."}
{"text":"Food was very good, and the menus was extremely extensive.  The restaurant was clean but the wood floors make it very noisy when it gets full of people."}
{"text":"We went fr the dinner ala carte, nd chose the vegetarian menu fr the nyt.. bad evening maybe, bt the soup nd starters were on a minus note, nd the gravy fr the maincourse wasn't tht great eithr.. hwevr, the naan nd othr bread varieties wer aromatic nd tasted amazing.. Overall, ths place s too pricy, scores fine for the ambience, bt the flavors r jst Ok..! Definitely nt worth the tym nd money spent here.."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, overpriced mediocre food. Take your business somewhere to a more friendly restaurant. I wouldn't go other again"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet. The place is cute inside and the staff seemed happy to greet us and were very attentive during our time there. The food was fresh and the buffet area clean. There were two chicken dishes and several vegetarian options, as well as raita, naan, dal, and a green salad. The cilantro salad dressing was very tasty, indeed! All dishes were nicely seasoned and about medium heat level.  We would definitely go back as it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of time for lunch. Out of the two visits, I'll summarize the good, the bad and the average stuff separately:  The Good: - Indo-Chinese food (gobi manchurian, paneer chilly, chicken 555, veg fried rice)  The Average: - Tandoori Roti, White Rice  The Bad: - Garlic Naan (very thin unlike how it should be and how it is in USA and India) - Chicken Tikka Masala (chicken is cubed, not done in tandoor oven and tastes like frozen chicken with absolutely no curry taste soaked by the chicken) - Veg Manchow Soup (water like consistency, too tangy in taste) - Lachha Paratha (no layers in the paratha that can be called as lachha)  Service is good. Overall, the vegetarian food looks to be better. The Indo-Chinese food is certainly preferable over the North Indian Punjabi style food."}
{"text":"Kilt the game, I don't want to eat anywhere else ever again. The food was out of this world, best indian I've had."}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala was divine but I was shocked to find that the amount of chicken was equivalent to what you would get in half of a grilled chicken wrap! Not worth the $13.99"}
{"text":"Papad and Chutney served when you sit down. It's free.   I loved the Manchurian Gobi and hubby loved Apollo Fish as appetizers. I found the Manchurian Gobi to be more similar to the Gobi 65 I have had at other restaurants (Vancouver, NYC, Maryland) than the Gobi 65 they offer. Their Manchurian Gobi is sauced and has some bell pepper and onions also. Their Gobi 65 is fried spicy cauliflower without sauce. I've had both and prefer their Manchurian version.   Hubby loves the Afghani Lambchops. They looked good to me, and I'm a vegetarian!  I enjoyed my Paneer Butter Masala and a Black Currant Martini. They had 5 Indian beers on offer. Some restaurants skate by with just Taj Mahal and maybe 1 other. Husband appreciated the extra options.   I had Kashmiri Naan as my dessert. Yes, it wasn't listed as dessert, but it's sweet so why not. Hubby had Carrot Halwa. He said it was great.    Key point:  Be careful with the spice level you order. They ask you how much spice you want on a 1 to 10 scale. My husband likes \"Thai hot\" Thai food, atomic bomb wings, and full on hot Mexican peppers. I've seen him drink hot sauce (from the bottle).  He got a level 7 and said it was perfect. Go higher than that at your own risk. I suspect it will clear your sinuses. I had a medium level at 5.  Finding the right spice level might take trial and error and will be restaurant specific.   I would err on the mild side myself.  Just know if you order your food too spicy, you won't taste anything except hotness. Your eyes will water, and your nose won't stop running. Good luck and have fun with it!"}
{"text":"Mediocre.  I was really excited to have an Indian place in the neighborhood but my experience at Tandul last night left a lot to be desired. First, my friend, who is Indian, didn't see raita on the menu so she asked the waitress, who had to ask the chef... only after explaining that raita is that cucumber yogurt sauce did they chef say they had it but he called it tzatziki. Bad sign.  I ordered the malai kofta. The flavor was decent, nothing spectacular and the kofta didn't have much flavor of their own. The worst part was that there were only 4 tiny kofta in a huge bowl of sauce. I'm used to twice that many in a dish that costs the same at other places.  My friend ordered the biryani with chicken. It came with 2 tiny pieces of chicken. The rice was not seasoned, though it was served with two sauces. She was not impressed. The manager did bring her more chicken after a complaint.  I won't mention the service mistakes because they just opened a few weeks ago but the food is not worth going back for."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just spoiled off of the variety available to me in my years spent living out east, but this establishment didn't do it for me.  I had the Paneer Tikka Masala. The depth of flavor that I have come to expect out of that dish was not present in this restaurant's rendition.   The rest of the reviews have great things to say. Maybe I came in on an off day?"}
{"text":"After hearing about this restaurant for a while, we decided to give it a try on a Saturday afternoon. Thought we would go for the buffet but I guess it is not there on the weekend.  After being seated we ordered from the menu. The service was fast however not many tables were occupied. The prices are decent.  Mango lassi was fresh and sweet. They serve pappad on every table. Nice and crunchy.  For starters ordered the angaari chicken which was red and colorful barbecue chicken served sizzling hot. Had a nice spice but could have been a little moist.  The yellow dal tadka was flavorful and garlicky. The kids felt it was a little spicy. White rice is served with each dish.  The tandul special chicken biriyani was cooked to perfection. A little cinnamons and adequately spiced.  Now there are a lot of of indian options all over town but if you happen to be in tremont area would consider giving this restaurant a try if in the mood for indian flavors."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for great Indian food in my area, having grown up in a home that ate Indian meals nearly every day. Even more enjoyable is when I can share my love of Indian cuisine with a friend who is not as familiar with Indian food but enjoys it, or a friend that wants to try something new. Based on my first visit, Tandul seems to be that place where I can take such a friend and I would recommend it to anyone who mentions Indian food in the Cleveland area. I had the chance to try the chicken tikka masala (probably the best I've ever had in any American city), the madras chicken and the onion kulcha. Everything I had in this first visit was superb, and I would order it again...but I will most likely be torn between deciding what to sample next on the quite extensive menu."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience in this restaurant. The Gobi Manchuria we had was over salted amd then we asked for the change of the dish, they did some changes to the same dish and gave us which had no change in it. Same agin bad experience with chicken 555, looked like the chicken was old stock which I sensed it when eating. Followed by, chicken fried rice and veg. Biriyani which were really dry, did not feel like eating biriyani. Think twice when going to this restaurant, the service is really bad!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, worst service I've had in ages. She \"lost\" our order, had a rude attitude... the bill was all wrong. I ordered a glass of sparkling Cava and was served a cheap Pinot Grigio. When I questioned the waitress she proceeded to lie about it- I was shocked but I let it go because I didn't want to ruin the experience with friends. We had to wait an hour for food. It's unfortunate because the food was actually quite good. I won't be back. India Garden in Lakewood has great food with the service to match."}
{"text":"Great addition to the previous Cleveland desi food desert. Everything on the Sunday lunch buffet was very good. The chai is also excellent. Buffet plus chai is $15, which is a good deal. Fills in the void on Sunday when Bombay Chaat is closed."}
{"text":"Ordered take out.  Was impressed by the quality of the sauces as far as authenticity and spice balance in both the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Garlic Naan was pretty soggy from sitting in foil for 30+ minutes but what do you expect from takeout.  What I was dissapointed by was the chicken had a low quality to it, it was rubbery and not cooked right.  Luckily there was barely any in our meals even though  they were 17 bucks a piece, which is another concern.  I'm going to round 3.5 up to 4 stars and wait til I can dine in to give a follow up."}
{"text":"Every neighborhood needs to have within its confines a good Indian restaurant. It just has to, right? So I was pretty excited when I saw Tandul open its doors a few years back. Since then, we've dined here three times and every time we've left completely stuffed and satisfied. From the traditional music playing in the background to the friendly, albeit sometimes awkward service paired with some of the tastiest Indian food I've experienced in Northeast Ohio, Tandul is firing on all cylinders.  First, a couple of things that prevent me from bestowing the coveted 5-stars. As I mentioned above, the service, while friendly and prompt, can lean a bit toward the awkward side. I'm sure it's a combination of the language and culture barriers getting in the way, it's just that sometimes you're not sure if you understood your server and sometimes they're not sure if they understood you and you're both like - um, yeah, *nodding your head with a smile hoping for the best*. It's not a huge deal, just don't be shy and ask several times if necessary.  The service is really good, though. You're immediately greeted when you enter, as soon as you're seated you're brought over some complimentary papadum chips and dips to nosh and waters are always filled - almost obsessively so. They also do a nice job of pacing the dishes, which can be a big deal if you want to sample your way around the menu.  The other thing that bums me out a tad, and this is even more minor (mostly because they're a traditional Indian place) is the fact that they don't offer draught beer. They do have a decent bottled beer selection and they're really cheap. I'm talking $4.50 for a Dogfish Head Namaste or Victory Golden Monkey. They've also got a few Indian beers on the list, inexplicably priced at $8 each (they're pale, yellow lagers, so...). If wine is more your thing they also have a rather solid wine list and a full bar if you wanna booze it up. Now on to the food.  Among the half dozen or so Indian joints I've patronized in the Cleveland area, Tandul has to be the hottest. Seriously. Be prepared to have your tastebuds seared off. Even the samosas are blazing. While you can ask to have your food's heat level modified to suite your tastes (tell them from 1-10 how hot you want it), even my wife's level 1 dishes were considerably spicy. I enjoy hot wings and the occasional habanero salsa, so my level 5 was spot on for me. I'm just saying, these folks are not stingy with the hot peppers. If spicy food isn't your deal, you probably don't want to eat here.  The food really is the reason to come to Tandul. Everything we've had here - lentil soup, Manchurian paneer, samosa, pepper chicken, chicken vindaloo, alleppey vegetables - has been cooked perfectly and beautifully spiced. One of the things I love most about Indian food is the incredible depth of flavor they manage to get with relatively simple ingredients. The chef at Tandul cooks from the heart, you can taste it. Speaking of taste, you have to try really hard not to fill up on the naan bread at this place. We go a bit crazy every time we come here, ordering both the garlic butter and cheese naan, and it's ridiculously addictive. Chewy, crispy, hints of oven char. Perfect for sopping up sauces or wrapping 'round chunky bits. Just order some."}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent. They need to do something about their kitchen exhaust. You can't go and socialize once you have sat there for an hour! You will have to get your clothes dry cleaned"}
{"text":"Unique ambiance, extensive menu, courteous service. Highly recommend the paneer masakali, chilly cheese naan, paneer tikka masala, veg chettinad."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the best Indian food I can find in Cleveland and I've tried most of them. The restaurant is in a trendy part of Cleveland and is pretty clean. They always have a great beer selection and the food tastes authentic."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try after my first attempt last week when i arrived during posted business hours to find the place closed. I made sure to call first before driving there to verify that they had the buffet today. I brought my family who all love Indian food and everybody liked it pretty well. We all tried the buffet. There were several main dishes to choose from, including two chicken dishes, a lettuce salad, a vegetable dish, naan, dhal, and a few sauces to accompany. The jalapeño and cilantro sauce was very fresh and tasty. The raita was also very fresh.   I thought the service was good, too. During lunch when I came in, there were two servers who were both very friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed the food so much."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Legitimately authentic Indian, from a group of Indians. Good vegetarian choices as well. Would highly recommend and definitely come back! I recommend the Kaju Curry and the Chilli Cheese Naan."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, just to try it. We ended up eating at the lunch buffet - it was fantastic. I wish I remembered the names of the dishes... but I don't suppose it matters. Eat everything! The dishes had a nice subtle, growing heat. The naan was delicious and chewy. The staff was quietly attentive and extremely nice. Only downside to the buffet - I didn't have any leftovers to bring home :( And I'd really like to have it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Best food in the city unless you're a vegetarian, then they serve you vegetables that are not from the region and feels just fake. With that said, the vegetarian dishes are still quite good despite the lack in authenticity."}
{"text":"We went to a buffet but there weren't many options to choose from, so we switched to A la carte.   We ordered biryani which was not as authentic as everyone here claims. It was overloaded with spices.  The ambiance and service was decent. Parking is a hassale, if you are going during weekend, as you got to find you space by street."}
{"text":"The food is good - the service not so much. They charge an automatic 18% gratuity for a group of 4 or more! And they don't advertise this on the menu so beware."}
{"text":"Chicken tandoor, pepper goat, mango lassi really good. Nice ambience. Biryani is Southern style and amazing.  What stood out though was the great service: they provided us a free entree because they got the order wrong the first time!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a drink with a friend and decided to get some food to-go. Atmosphere at the bar was nice, very chill with dim lighting but a colorful glow from the holiday lights on the window. The bartender was soft-spoken but no issues with service; she helped me with picking out what food to get, kept our water glasses full, and brought us over some chips and dips to much on while we drank and waited. Some hoppin' Indian music was playing and after a couple more drinks we probably would have started shimmying and shaking.   As for food: *Table chips and Dip Free - Very light and crispy with a black pepper flavor. The dip is thin so you gotta let your chip sit for a minute to soak.  *Chicken Tikka Masala $14.99 - Very saucy. Usually I don't use all of the white rice they give you but with this version you need it. Also note that while some Indian places make this dish with coconut milk, Tandul does not. Large portion so you can definitely share or get a couple meals out of it.  *Garlic Cheese Naan $4.99 - A bit too soft so I think it could have used another minute or two to cook, but great flavor and perfect for tearing off chunks to scoop up your entree with.  *Samosa $5.99 - You get three large ones plus a green sauce and a brown sauce.  *Gobi Manchurian $10.99 - Cauliflower you don't mind eating.   The food here definitely has some heat to it so be warned, I asked for mild and still thought it was spicy, but I am also a wimp. Portions are generous. Prices seem a little high. But, I enjoyed my food and I am looking forward to leftovers. I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu! I just might need to ask for a side of yogurt sauce to cool down my mouth with.  Update: *Chilly Paneer $9.99 is good.  *Gulab Jamun $4.99 is good too."}
{"text":"One of the first Indian restaurants I've been in with a full bar with 2 pages of wine, lots of craft beer (at reasonable prices) and specialty mixed drinks. It's a small, quaint comfortable place with benches and seat cushions (plus regular chairs).  We had 2 martinis- I thought the mango lassi martini was a great idea and tasty! The menu had a great array of vegetarian options as well. Items in blue are chef specials I had a mushroom chef special which was so good.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Poor service. We were told it was happy hour when we walked in this evening. Once we sat and looked at the bar menu our server told us happy hour was over. He could have still honored the drinks. The food was just okay. Won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"Their Apollo fish and the chicken chettinaad are definitely worth trying. Get medium spicy if you like a little kick to your meal. Nans are really tender and the chicken biryani was excellent too."}
{"text":"Very authentic, everything was delicious. Loved the chicken tikka Marsala and garlic naan!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food and friendly helpful service, don't get the ice cream! We looooooooooooooooooooooooooove Tandul"}
{"text":"If you love Indian food, this is the place for you. Every item we ate was fresh. Service was 5 stars as was the food. Very extensive menu for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The hot and spicy soup was very flavorful. Our main entrees had very generous portions of delicious food. Save room for the homemade ice cream. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Since the normal Indian restaurant I go to on this side of town is closed on Tuesdays, I decided to give this new spot a try. Apparently they just opened in December. The location of this place is in a very unassuming area but don't let that fool you. As soon as I walked in I immediately like the layout and feel of the place. There aren't too many tables but it does also have a bar so there is additional seating there. I ordered take out and while I waited they gave me a brief appetizer on the house and also some water along with it. For my meal I ordered some samosas and Butter Chicken to go. I'm a big fan of spicy foods so I told them to make it spicy. And that they did! It was just the right amount of spice where I could taste it but I could also fully enjoy the flavor as well. The chicken , sauce and amount of the butter chicken dish was a great amount for the money spent. I will certainly try this place again to checkout a few other items on the menu  Also I gave the buffet a try. Not too much of a selection but the food was very well prepared and it was very good!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food. I've eaten here twice. The staff is always courteous and welcoming. The food is great! I love the chicken 65 for an appetizer, tandoor chicken, and the garlic naan with chicken vindaloo."}
{"text":"Tandul is the best Indian food I've ever had (and I've been to India).  There were some growing pains because it became popular quite quickly, but do not hesitate.  The owner is amazing, very kind and willing to try and make every customer happy if there is an issue.  If you love Mali Kofta, the same sauce is used for the Kaju Curry and it is absolutely the most amazing thing I've had Indian food wise.  The paneer is also amazing and homemade. I could go on and on about how much I love the food, please just go and support it!!"}
{"text":"I had the paneer pasanda with aloo parantha for takeout. Food was great. Worth the price. I cannot comment on dining in but the dining area looks nice and clean."}
{"text":"Love this place! Has a great patio and delicious food. I always go for the chicken tikka masala and am never disappointed. A bit pricey but worth it and in line with other Indian food venues."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better Indian food in the greater Cleveland area. We were greeted right away and there was no wait. We ordered and appetizer & our entrees at the same time. The appetizer never came out but dinners did. We didn't feel like asking for the appetizer since our entrees came out. We ordered items off the tandoori menu and a curry dish. All delicious. Definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"It's been 14 hours since I visited Tandul for the first time and I can't stop raving about it. When we tasted our food we both said oh my this is so delicious. We said it after we were done. We said it again driving home and when we woke up this morning. Seriously the most delicious, well prepared, true to the dish Indian I have ever had ....We chose Tandul based on the recent article in the CLE Scene. That said we had chicken 65 as an app, paneer butter masala - medium, chicken saagwala - medium, goat curry - hot. Did I mention it was delicious? Rice was perfectly cooked. Butter garlic naan was just right crisp light not too greasy and hot! The wine selections were good, we started with glasses at happy hour price. We were enjoying the atmosphere and food and pleasant service by Thomas so much we decided on a bottle. Thursday night and there was a steady flow of patrons the whole time. Warm and inviting casual perfect for comfort in the mid week doldrums if NEO winters or an intimate date night. Can't wait to go back and explore the menu!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Indian food in Cleveland! It took me a while to find a place that was great, not just ok, and this is it!  I order from here regularly -- their chicken tikka masala being my absolute favorite dish, from here or anywhere. Throw some naan in and it's a great night!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are not usually in this part of town - we live way east.  We were visiting this part of town and since we love Indian food, we thought we would try this restaurant.  We eat Indian food all the time. We're strict vegetarians and know top-notch Indian food.  We ordered the Navratan Korma and Alleppey Vegetables. Both were delicious - seasoned to perfection. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday, excellent kofta.  Creamy and full of flavor.  Had to order off the menu, buffet is only on Fridays and on the weekends.  If the food at the buffet is equal quality, I'll rate it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled to have this place in my neighborhood! It's a welcome addition to Tremont and I hope it's successful. It's been open a week and I've ordered out once and dined in once.   The good:  -the food is delicious. Half my family is Indian so I've had my fair share of authentic Indian cuisine. Tandul does not disappoint! Bold flavors & fresh food! Truly delicious.  -the people who work there are very nice and want their customers to have a good dining experience. When mistakes were made (which is bound to happen when any business first opens) Andrei (I'm assuming he's the owner or manager) apologized and comped items on our bill.  -takeout was ready within 10 minutes of ordering and everything we ordered was accounted for!  The not-so-good:  -the portions could be a bit larger. The prices are comparable to other Indian restaurants but the amount of chicken in the chicken vindaloo and the paneer in the saag paneer left something to be desired.  - this place needs to cultivate better communication among employees as well as clear job duties. When we dined in, (it was a Saturday night) we weren't sure who our server was and we'd ask one person for something and it would not be communicated to other staff, thus, we wouldn't be served something we ordered and waited a long time for our food, our drinks, and our bill and had to ask a few people each time. Andrei comped one round of our drinks and bought the whole restaurant (which was packed) a round of cocktail shooters, which we really appreciated-- it shows that they're trying and want to succeed.  I will definitely be going back and ordering out from this place again and I recommend you do the same. Just be patient as they work through the kinks. I would love to see this place flourish and stick around the neighborhood for years to come!"}
{"text":"We were travelling from San Jose California to Nigra, in between we though of hving some Indian Food. So we took stop in Cleveland and though of having lunch at this place. After seeing 4+ ratting. The ambiance is pethetic, some weird smell was coming. Food was very bad. No hygine mentained. Even the cook was waering dirty cloths. Very costly as well. Dont waster ur time money and health. Not at all advisable."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Tandul last week for the second time and could not find any fault with it whatsoever. The atmosphere is excellent, the menu is very large and well executed, the service is excellent as well and the overall experience warrants a five star rating"}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant I have ever been to, anywhere. And I have traveled around the country and abroad including India. Truly, this place has now spoiled my neighborhood Indian restaurants for me.   We started with the hot and sour soup with chicken for my husband, and the samosas for me. There is complimentary papadum to munch while you look at the menu. My husband was swooning over the soup. It was too spicy for me, but he couldn't stop talking about the blend of spices, and how the broth complimented the chicken and veggies. The samosas were good, but pretty much what you would expect. For me, the main courses were the stars. We had the malabar chicken and paneer pasanda. They were both delicious, with subtle spices and rich sauces. And the naan! Best naan ever. A little crusty on the bottom, soft on top, perfect for soaking up the sauces. Couldn't resist sharing the malai ice cream for dessert. It's house made saffron ice cream and Jeni's needs to make this flavor!  I almost forgot- drinks are reasonably priced and delicious too. I had the mojito and my husband had the margarita. They both have twists on indian ingredients and were potent and very tasty.   Service was fantastic. Friendly and informative and not overbearing.   We will be back, soon. I have to try the buffet- there's so much on this menu that I want to sample!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible every single time.  My personal favorite is the Malai Kofta. They also use an extra long rice grain which is fun and tasty. I can't find this rice in any ethnic food stores or other Indian restaurants. I think Tandul is the best Indian food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Tandul has probably the best Indian cuisine I have ever had. The service is also excellent! The prices are reasonable as well. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes great Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I ordered the Anghari Chicken and it was fantastic. It came out sizzling hot straight from the tandoor, soft and tender to the point it melts in your mouth. You could tell from the strong flavors that they took time to properly marinate the chicken in a variety of spices. It was great to eat by itself, but also tasted great nestled in the middle of an onion kulcha like a taco.  Aside from the food, the beer list is unexpectedly good for an indian restaurant with offerings from Deschutes, Fat Heads, Dogfish Head, etc. The only negative during my dining experience was the timing of when the dishes came out. The appetizer came out at nearly the exact same time as my main dish even though I ordered it earlier."}
{"text":"Fresh samosas, flavorful curries and friendly, relaxed service.  A much needed Indian restaurant in Tremont and it is a good one!!"}
{"text":"Why does Yelp force you to write a review? Just let me rate the place. Had the Chicken Biryani Special for a late breakfast after working until 4am. And it was great. Did you need to know that?   Did you?"}
{"text":"Although this review has been long over due(almost a year), it deserves to be submitted. My friend and I stumbled upon this place on our road trip from Detroit to NYC.   We love Indian food(duh, native country bro!!!). And this place does not disappoint. I would say that Tandul is one of the Indian restaurants in the United States trying to provide Indian food as authentic as possible.  Overall the ambience, layout, location, etc was perfect. The guys waiting on us were courteous and tried to fit in the modification to our order to the dot.   Must visit. And do not forget to try the Chilli Paneer !! Yummmmm..."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had Chicken Tikka Masala & Garlic Naan- if you like spicy, I'd ask for 7 or greater. My fiance asked for 5 and felt it wasn't spicy at all."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place quite a bit and never realized it. Tucked between two popular clothing boutiques, Tandul adds something special to Tremont.  This is one of the first Indian restaurants in CLE I've ever felt was truly authentic. In a hard decision, I ordered the chicken tikka masala, while my friend opted for the vegetarian paneer tikka. I was delightfully surprised by how hearty the portions were, and thought it was unique that the paneer tikka came on a skillet (i've always seen it on a skewer). Our food was all around colorful, flavorful and served with generous portions of white rice. I also recommend getting a side of their butter naan to round your meal out!  The front half of the restaurant is a bit dark. While there's some ambient twinkle lighting, the nob could be turned up a bit more to be well lit. Otherwise, the restaurant is comfortable with hybrid couch/chair tables and high tops. There also seems to be plentiful street parking near their block, especially in the evening when the surrounding boutiques are closed. Will definitely be coming back here again...and I loved how on our way out, the manager gave us a $10 coupon off our next delivery order! Nice work, Tandul."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner last night and everything was on point.  We had the mushroom appetizer again and the owner remembered that I like my food very spicy and he made the app super spicy.  It was fantastic!  Husband and I each had a chettinad, I had veggie and he had chicken.  Mine was made spicy (it could have used a bit more heat, but it was spicy nonetheless) and it was just delicious.  The husband liked mine so much that he kept eating it.  The Bells Two Hearted on draft was a perfect compliment to the heat.  We also shared the naan with green chilies in it and it was great as well.  Service here is excellent.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Far & away one of the best restaurants I've ever been to, & easily my favorite in Tremont. I wasn't even sure I liked Indian food, & now I can't stop thinking about it. I love their Paneer 65 appetizer (spicy fried cheese cubes), & their kaju curry is incredibly flavorful & well-spiced, especially considering that it has no meat OR veggies! I would eat this every day if I could afford it. Luckily, their servings are large, & dinner there usually leaves me with enough for lunch the next day.  They also have a great happy hour special: Draft beers are $3, including Great Lakes & Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. A steal!"}
{"text":"Really nice Indian place in the Tremont area. My favorite thing here is the Apollo Fish which is something I've never had at another Indian restaurant before. Ask for it extra spicy & it really makes it worth it. The naan has been fresh every time I've been & there's plenty of traditional vegetarian options as well. Would highly recommend it for Indian food lovers."}
{"text":"Good food a little pricey and no more buffet but still one of the best in the cleveland area"}
{"text":"Tandul provides wholesome, delectable Indian cuisine, but a few unusual choices, and a seemingly arbitrary happy hour policy keep it from attaining a perfect star rating in this reviewer's estimation. Firstly, the food is--for the most part--exceptional. The vegetarian paneer tikka masala was just as it should be: rich, velvety, soft, and soul-warming. An appetizer we ordered came with humungous slices of raw, pungent onion however, which weren't at all seasoned and made this reviewer's eyes water, and not in a pleasant way. Elsewhere, the happy hour menu promises heavily discounted drinks, but when the bill was received, we were charged full price for a couple of them on our last visit. Be sure to double check. It should be noted as well that the kitchen can be a little raucous so, if possible, request to be seated closer to the bar. Overall, however, Tandul is a fabulous place for an intimate dinner. The service is swift and pleasant, and the food is, by and large, incredible."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Cleveland period !! And I mean there is nothing that they haven't taken care off. Food flavorful Cocktails tasteful And service excellent. The whole vibe is awesome."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in Cleveland! Their service is prompt and the food is awesome. I am skeptical about ordering tandoori in Indian restaurants here but tandul's mix grill chicken was the best tandoori i have had here. Exceeded my expectations. The garlic naan was the second best thing, perfectly flavoured in butter garlic and soft. The owner and the whole staff was courteous and kind."}
{"text":"Wow. The Manchurian Gobi app is vegan but the entire time I was checking myself to make sure I wasn't eating actually eating meat. Reminded me a little of general tso's chicken, and we both agreed wed get that as a main dish too. Then CHEESE naan with cilantro, duh! This was also the first time I totally finished my order of chana masala. A little on the sweeter side than other places I've had. Medium spice level for everything was perfect. Service was stellar."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Being Indian I can say it's authentic.  The new dessert mango kulfi is out of this world.  The owners go out of there way to accommodate special food restrictions like food without onion and garlic.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in a restaurant I have ever had!!!  I grew up having a bunch of moms cook me amazing Indian food so my standards are really high.  This food was beyond amazing!  We had to force ourselves to stop eating.  I highly recommend the vegetarian items on the menu that are starred.  They were all amazing.  But the service.......  It was pretty bad.  My tea was brought out wrong twice.  We were left at the table without water for such long periods of time we considered getting up and finding the pitcher ourselves.  Come here with patience!  I would come back but maybe etch out more time to do it"}
{"text":"Really expected more from this place. The food was flavorless. I mean it had the heat just no flavor which is somewhat mind boggling. Really disappointed in the naan bread, for it was burnt and hard. Only decent thing I had was the mango lassi."}
{"text":"Go.... just go.... seriously though.... GO!!!  Ive had indian food in India... and this place is beyond true to their roots ans beyond delicious.  When we went they didnt have a yelp page or we would have left a review then!"}
{"text":"We ordered food from Tandul using Uber Eats, which almost took around 50mins to deliver. Wait was not the bad part once we started dining. We ordered Paneer butter masala, methi matar, tandoori rotis and garlic naan.  There was too much food color used in the paneer butter masala, our fingers got reddish due to that. Methi malai matar had no fenugreek flavor, just some random taste. Worst methi matar we have had.  Tandoori roti was very thick and undercooked. Only saving grace was the garlic naan which was soft and tasty but due to the way it was packed, it became soggy around the edges.    A big NO for us."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a Madras Chicken as good as a great family Indian restaurant I had grown to love when I lived in D.C. The search is over. The spice is perfect. The mild heat tantalizing. A perfect blend. I ordered the Madras, a Chicken Hot and Sour Soup and a Garlic Naan. A sprinkling of stardust must be in the Chef's spice cabinet."}
{"text":"This was delicious. Went a few times and have had awesome service and the food was tasty! Both times I went it was not to busy, but I'm sure once people hear about this place it will be packed!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times while exploring all the Indian restaurants in Cleveland. They serve good Indian food and can satiate your taste buds if you love hot food."}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian food in the Cleveland area. They're getting 4 stars not because their food isn't fantastic, but because sometimes the service is slow and I haven't ever had a great experience with their cocktails.  I recommend their samosas to start or the lentil soup. For entrees, any of the meats or vegetables in the saag or tikka masala sauces and you can't go wrong. Also, all types of naan are delicious."}
{"text":"Currently, in terms of Indian food in the Cleveland area, my go-to place is Indian Garden in Lakewood or Trader Joes, to be honest. Both of these places, as one knows if they love Indian food, are good but not incredible.   Tandul is my new favorite place to be. I heard of them through the Tremont House Tour and Taste of Tremont and decided to pay them a visit the other day. Absolutely amazing. From the start of a meal with a mango lassi and their complimentary papadum (thin crips made with seasoned dough). They were just the right amount of spicy and sweet, especially with the two sauces.   For an entrée, I had two very typical dishes that are my favorite: chicken tikka marsala and a form of palak paneer (they didn't have this exact dish, but something very similar to it). Both were amazing. Perfectly balances spices, moderate portions, and steaming soft basmati rice. The naan was rich and fluffy, complimenting the spices very well.   I have been back here three or four times and am completely hooked. The chicken is my favorite dish in Tremont. It fits in perfectly with the trendy, dinner-oriented neighborhood and provides a lot to our city we all love.   Three words to describe this: Comforting Rich  Delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent food and cozy atmosphere. Their Special Chicken Biryani was amazing."}
{"text":"Showed up late on Sat night without reservations and were able to score the \"private\" seating room with 4 people and a baby.  Everything is delicious and service is excellent. From the nice light crackers in the beginning (spiced really nicely), to the delicious buttery garlic naan (excellent, skip the roti which is a bit chewy), to the really spicy lamb curry (almost too spicy), buttery buttery vegetable filled veggie briyani (go for the biryani and skip the regular basmati rice, you won't regret), to really delicious paneer...just overall amazing. My only small complaint was the tandoori chicken was a little too much on the bone-heavy side (which they had more pieces of breast meat or maybe they shredded the chicken off the bone).   Overall, delicious food here."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Tremont neighborhood.  Although I do miss Istanbul and Dervish, the last two cohabitants of this space, I was quite happy to hear of the new Indian restaurant to join the restaurant scene.  As the Ohio City and Tremont neighborhoods lack an Indian restaurant- when I heard it was open, I came with a group of friends to try out the restaurant.  We got the lunch buffet- for a cheap 10 bucks. I thought it was a large portion of food including butter chicken, chicken milwa (sp)?, biryanis (which were quite spicy), other dishes I don't really know, carrot halwa, etcera. I thought all the flavors were strong and flavorful- it wasn't too spicy but also wasn't too mild- in addition, I liked the non ending supply of plain and butter naan that was coming to our table as well.  The service was good and I thought the food was cooked well. It's a nice addition to add to the Indian restaurants in the area- and you really can't beat that price.  Check out the newest addition to the Tremont neighborhood- it's a great place to stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"Just had Tandul for the 4th time but this time I got takeout. My fiancé and I sat in silence as we inhaled yet another amazing meal from this gem of a restaurant. The Chicken Tikka Masala is one of the best meals I've ever had in my life! It's spicy, it's creamy, the rice is so fluffy and compliments the dish so well. I will continue to be a devoted customer and keep spreading the word on how fabulous this place is."}
{"text":"Great food in a nice atmosphere.  Mango lassi and tandoor items were fantastic.  Really sweet server named Tom, as well as kindness from other hosts/servers.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had Indian food in almost all restaurants in the Cleveland area. This has been one of the best experiences. Gastronomic delight. The chef's specials are a must-try. So is the gulab jamun, which is a perfect end to a good meal. Will visit again soon. The alcohol selection is not as limited as most other Indian restaurants. The pricing is moderate."}
{"text":"Overall good food and the staff is friendly!!  Only thing not to tryout here is aaloo paratha!!  U will have to search for aaloo in the paratha  The worst one's I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time trying the buffet. They change the buffet menu daily! And it's only $9.99. Everything we tried was delicious. Buttered naan, lollipop chicken, paneer, spicy fried peppers. Service was great. So glad good Indian food has made it to Tremont."}
{"text":"I was there past weekend and as always the good was great. Writing this review to let the folks know that while the food was really great - didn't like the fact that I was lied to. Apparently the two dishes we ordered got swapped for curry. The items ordered were chicken tikka masala and paneer masakali and what we got was chicken tikka probably dipped in masakali curry (yellow) and paneer dipped in tikka masala curry (red). So, when confronted the waiter with the question - she very promptly denied it; while there are pictures right here on yelp for the tikka masala being red and masakali being yellow. Despite the gaffe, I will still continue going there for the taste!"}
{"text":"Large portions with tons of flavor, and very attentive service makes this a place to come back to. I recommend the samosas and Chicken Tikka Masala, along with some garlic naan to sop up all the creamy sauce. As other reviewers note, the naan is a bit on the undercooked side. It's dimly lit and pretty quiet on weeknights, which makes it a great choice for a low key date night."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Get a tikki masala of some kind if you've never been before. Order it spicey (8/10 or hotter) and then get some garlic or cheese naan and dig in.   You can order extra rice, two orders of naan and split one masala meal."}
{"text":"This Indian place took over the space of a former Turkish restaurant in Tremont.   The bread and two dips served to start the meal were amazing. They followed the same format as other Indian restaurants but were superb. The crackers alone were so flavorful.   I got the chicken tiki masala. It was served with  rice, of which I was offered more if necessary. I got my meal a 5 on the 1-10 heat scale and I certainly could have gone higher. I'll probably try for an 8 next time. The flavor in the sauce was spot on, but some of the chicken pieces had a bit of an over cooked edge.   The servers were very pleasant and service from the kitchen was fast.   Both the food and drink menus are very large. I will certainly check this place again."}
{"text":"Loved Tandul! I tried the Mushroom Pepper Fry with rice, Cholay Bhature ( Chickpea Masala with Bread) and Kulfi for dessert. They were all amazing! I am so glad I tried it out because this is now my favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland. They have so many atypical interesting authentic options on their menu that I still need to try. It was exciting just seeing that there was a place that served a lot more than your typical butter chicken and naan. Would recommend this place to everyone. :)"}
{"text":"If you're going be prepared for very slow service. I called in an order 20 min in advance and still waited another 20 minutes when I got there."}
{"text":"Came here to try Indian food for the first time before a trip to India. We loved everything!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Indian food no matter where I travel! Very nice service and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already and every experience has been positive. Delicious Indian food and great drinks! You can request your level of spice (1-10). The butter chicken and the Moscow Mule with cardamon are my favorites. Takeout was ready quickly and when I was there with a larger group everything went smoothly- even when unexpected people arrived, it was no problem pulling up chairs. Fantastic customer service and friendly staff. Welcome to Tremont Tandul!"}
{"text":"Tandul is a quaint, new Indian restaurant in Tremont. I recently went to try the lunch buffet and found it sparse compared to other Indian buffets in NEO. The main offerings were basmati rice, lemon rice, two chicken dishes, a vegetable dish, a dal, samosas, and gulab jamun. That's quite a few options, but one of the chicken dishes was essentially gone and was not refilled and there were only about three pieces of naan left when we arrived. There was still about an hour left for the posted buffet hours, so that was a bit disappointing.  What we did sample was tasty. The butter chicken had good flavor, the samosas were quite spicy (though oddly cut in half), the lemon rice had cashew bits, and the gulab jamun was perfect. I don't often see it at Indian buffets as the process to make it is time consuming, so I was happy to have it at Tandul.  I did order a mango lassi after sampling a samosa. I wanted something to tame the heat, and this lassi was ideal for that purpose. It was probably the thickest lassi I've ever had, with a pronounced yogurt flavor. I might not order it with the buffet again, but I think it would be an excellent choice for something like a fiery lamb vindaloo.  Toward the end of our meal, our server did come out with hot, fresh, buttery naan. That made my mouth happy; I just wish it had been presented at the beginning of the meal! However, our server was so genuinely kind and attentive. It seemed like he definitely cared about our experience and wanted to make sure that we left happy, and that carries a lot of clout with me.  My rating is somewhere between a 3 and a 4 as I was a little underwhelmed by the buffet, but the fresh, hot naan, the thick mango lassi, and the superb service from our waiter would give me reason to come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian restaurant in Tremont. Nice cozy place with a full bar. The food was delicious. We started out with chili paneer - which was probably my favorite dish of the evening. For our entree we ordered a variety of dishes including saag paneer, malai kofta, Dhaal makahni, garlic naan and chili cheese garlic naan. Everything was fantastic and hit the spot! One of the better Indian restaurants in the cleveland area!"}
{"text":"At the buffet. Service was good just didn't fill our water glasses when they were empty but everything else was fine.  Food very authentic and liked everything they put out."}
{"text":"They had a decent lunch buffet and I would gladly return but I have had better. Good mix of vegetarian and meat dishes. Would give 3.5 stars if I could. The people there were very nice."}
{"text":"The lambchops are outstanding, very nice service and inexpensive cocktails. We can't wait to go back."}
