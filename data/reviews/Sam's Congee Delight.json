{"text":"A friend referred me to try this congee place this evening.  Bought the Chinese century egg with salted pork congee and sweet fried dough (ngau lei sow) for take out.  The congee was absolutely delicious with a lot of thinly sliced pork, peanuts & century egg.  Definitely one of the best congees I've had in Toronto.  The sweet fried dough tasted fresh & tasty.  Definitely will go back to this place again."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with a bowl of hot and comforting congee here. I always try to come here for breakfast/lunch if I'm in the area.  The prices can't be beat, the ingredients are fresh and the service is super speedy - you will almost always get your food in less than 5 minutes! 

We usually order two bowls of congee and a steamed rice roll to share. The fried dough rice roll is delicious and the perfect companion to congee!"}
{"text":"As a person with food allergy,  it is always difficult to look for food.  I have not been Sam's congee for long long time.  I feel that they provide better service.   The congee tastes the same as before."}
{"text":"Short of flying to Hong Kong, this is the best restaurant made congee in the GTA. However, like any restaurant, the food is better when they're not as busy. Go on a week day for lunch before 11:30 and you'll appreciate their food better than going on a weekend when it's extremely busy."}
{"text":"Best congee I've ever had. That's a big statement because I've had some pretty good congee before.

My family decided to venture around Markham and the Pacific Mall/Market Village areas in our finals days in the GTA. This place was a pleasant surprise as we wandered around the mall. We quickly became quite invested in watching the people in the window make the congee, Chinese doughnuts, and steamed noodles. Very cool process.

Since we came around noon, it was considerably busy and we had to take a number. The wait was maybe 20-ish minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we started selecting various dishes off the menu, which all seemed to be in the $5-7 range. I can't remember what else I ordered beside the congee, but it was good. Food gets on the table pretty fast after ordering, service is straightforward. The wait staff did seem a little bit like they wanted our group to hustle though."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst congee place I have been to. Service was extremely poor and servers were so rude. I ordered congee with fish slides and pork but found hair in my congee. I can only find the very small piece of fish inside the congee and it was very watery. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good with the congee and rice crepes. Love the simpleness in food and decor. Almost makes you think you are in HK. Grabbed a bowl of pork with duck egg, which you can't go wrong with and ordered several plates of the piping hot rice crepes. Excellent in the thinness level of rice crepe standards and the ingredients are ample enough for you not to complain. Congee is the right amount of \"fluffiness\" of the rice and again, good amount of ingredients found in this order.

Note: There's a minimum $3 order per head in your table which is okay only cuz their food is just about $3 an order anyway. Come in hungry and leave with the itis :) Benches are around outside of the establishment so how about a quick nap?"}
{"text":"This place is my go to place for congee. I love how they have a lot of variety to choose from. I always get pork blood and chicken congee and bean sprout fried noodles. The food comes quickly but the downside is that this place is very packed in the morning."}
{"text":"Specializes in Cantonese Congee and other carb-filled delights!  Turnip cake and chinese fritters wrapped in rice noodle are a must try.  They do it right here.  Unbeatable prices."}
{"text":"Great congee, braised pork and simple fried noodles."}
{"text":"Thick congee with great small side dishes to go with. Always a good breakfast option or when you feel for a light meal."}
{"text":"What crappy service! I went there with my mom and my sons (3 and 1 year old) for a quick lunch and we ordered 3 dishes but the waitress told us there is a minimum charge per person...even my 1 year old!!!!!  Although i found that ridiculous but in a calm tone I told the waitress my 1 year old wont be eating we hv baby food for him. Instead of acknowledging that obvious fact, the waitress was rude and basically told us we have to \"make sure\" our 1 year old will not eat anything or they will impose a minimum charge! I told the waitress that was the most ridiculous thing I've heard and we walked out of the resturant! We were probably just couple of bucks away from minimum for 4 people and I cannot believe this is how they treat customers! Will for sure not go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Since Original Congee was closed, this is my only choice for deep fried dough. Unfortunatelyth, the deep fried dough is much smaller than before, though price isn't changed. I always prefer to take out than dining in, coz the place is so busy that a huge line waiting for a table."}
{"text":"The best lunch, every thing taste exactly the same from HK. Price is low. Fry breads are freshly fry. Rice roll is freshly roll."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place at about 3:00 on a Monday afternoon. It was quite full considering the time of day.

We didn't have the congee but had the rice roll with the fried dough, one with fungus and mushroom and the spicy tofu. With tax included it was $12. This place is very inexpensive which almost everyone likes.

This place had at each table peanut sauce and sesame seeds which my wife took advantage of. The spicy tofu was good, not great. The fried dough was pretty good by itself but drowned in peanut sauce and sesame, it was quite delicious.

It is quite good quality food at a great price. Though the taste was not superb, the value certainly was.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best congee place I've ever been too. Their food are just as good as the ones in Hong Kong, so delicious! Their congee are so smooth and tasty and large portion! Most importantly, their rice sheet rolls \"chun fun\" ( if you know what I'm saying ) is sooo good, they are all hand makes for you!"}
{"text":"I always come here whenever I come to Toronto. I love the congee, fried dough, and rice rolls (cherng fun) here. They make their cherng fun from scratch and by hand. You can see them making the cherng fun through the window at the front of the restaurant. The cherng funs have a nice soft silky texture. I also love the sauces they use for the cherng funs. The fried doughs are fresh too. It has a good bite to it. Not too soggy soft and not to crunchy. The congees have great texture where it has a thickness to it unlike most places where it gets watered down."}
{"text":"I arrived there at 9.50am and it's not ready yet (business hour only starts at 10am though) so I thought I would walk around and come back later. I went back at 10.05am and it was already FULL HOUSE! I had to share a table with others but I was given a choice not to as the server offered, so service was definitely good. The congee came in just the right portion for a person and generous toppings! All kinds of seasonings like pepper, soy sauce and etc were available on the table, for a person who's used to the teow chew style of congee (adding soy sauce and making it brownish) like me, that's perfect! The menu is not fancy yet offers a variety of congee, price is affordable. Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I remember standing at the window as a chubby little kid, completely mesmerized by the Chinese fried dough sticks (you tiao) being made, staring for 10-15 minutes at a time, probably drooling...but for whatever reason never actually ate at the darn place.

Fast forward 20 years and here we are yet again, still staring, still drooling. And this chubby little kid is going in to eat ALL the things this time around. From standing in the line extending out the door, you can enjoy the sight of exhibit B, where the master chef with fingertips of steel makes rice rolls (cheung fun) on a piping hot steamer with his literal bare hands, which was even more fun to watch than the frying you tiao. 

AND DAYUM. The cheung fun and you tiao DID NOT disappoint. To live up to an expectation 20 years in the making, you better bet that is some SOLID stuff. Definitely come for this.

...and stay for the excellent soymilk.

The congee was good. The fact that it was being brought out in vats to feed the hungry masses must speak to its demand. I personally prefer the Congee Queen congee over this one, but this has a more straightforward, simple, home-y flavor to it. I can see its appeal."}
{"text":"Definitely going back! Me and bf had two different congees and ordered two more things. All together for 17.50. The food was fresh and made right in front of you. Going back this weekend"}
{"text":"Good price and good place to go if we're alone & looking for a quick fix at lunch or dinner time. I always order the famous one-ingredient congee:  pork liver or pork blood cubes. My famous side dish includes either a bean curd with spicy dipping sauce (????)or plain rice flour roll? ??????If i live in toronto I would come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Located inside Market Village near the corner of the grocery store. This restaurant is very inexpensive and ideal to grab breakfast/ lunch. Food comes out quick and hot. Service is amazing although English may be limited to some servers, they're all happy to help. 

A bowl of congee is a serving for 1 so it's best that everyone order one for themselves and some small side dishes. I really recommend trying the shrimp rice noodle rolls, they're delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for you-tiao and congee so my bf took me to this place as it is famous for its youtiao. It's really crowded and we had to wait for our turn.

It was my first time trying the youtiao here and i fell in love with it on the first bite! 
So soft and crunchy at the same time. We ordered the ordinary youtiao and the sweeter crueller. I love the sweet one the most. It reminds me of the youtiao i had when I was a child in Malaysia. The congee is really good as well, one of the best I've had.

I wish they have a bigger portion tho.
Would definitely come back for the youtiao!"}
{"text":"Had the plain rice noodle ever since I was young. My other favorites include the pork blood minced meat congee, the bean sprout fried noodles and the fried dough. Whenever I got sick my parents would bring some back. The flavors are mild and the dishes are great for comfort food. The prices are very cheap compared to other restaurants in the area. 

They're always really busy due to their popularity, but you can order take out by phone or walk in. Otherwise it might take a while to get a seat in-store.

Really sad that Market Village is going to close down by the end of this year. I hope they relocate and continue the business!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience congee like how you may experience it in Hong Kong, this is the place.  straightforward and no frills, this is a must stop for us when in the area.   

the protocol... jot down the item number of your choices (pen and small piece of paper provided),  get your utensils in order and get ready to enjoy freshly prepared food in a matter of minutes.   congee, rice noodles, and stir fry noodles are our usuals."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade)
I REALLY liked the desserts they have here. Although presentation wasn't very appealing, the tastes were very authentic! Arguably, this was better than some of the places I've eaten in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Everything was fresh and perfectly seasoned :) 

Ambiance 3.5/5 (15% of final grade)
Not sure why, but this run-down-ish place makes me feel like I'm back in China, and that's what prompts me to give it 3.5 despite the fact that they use fluorescent lighting. The place is small and felt slightly icky, but that's why it felt like the authentic Chinese places back in Hong Kong and Guangzhou! Arguably, this might be highlight of the experience to get a feel of an authentic environment for congee and rice noodles.

Service 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)
Customer service was obviously not the main highlight here. Instead, they concentrated on their speedy service! Everyone was whizzing this way and that!

Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade)
For five people (though we DO eat quite a bit) it costed me $80. This is what I would consider expensive for the portion sizes and what it really was.

Brownie Points 4/5 (10% of final grade)
I LOVE the concept of having an observable distance. As a kid I always walked past the place and sometimes would just stare at the people making the foods. I thought it was really cool seeing them make the noodles! 

Final Grade = 65/100 = 3 authentic Chinese stars 

TLDR:  Worth a try for a light afternoon snack! Not much worth for lunch or any other major meal."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for lunch around noon on a week day and the store was busy. We were seated almost immediately as we agreed to share a large table with other customers. My mom ordered a minced beef congee ($4.05) and I got the beef slices congee ($4.25). We also shared plain rice rolls ($2.50) and rice rolls with dough stick ($3.0). Comparative to other restaurants, I find their congee at a good median between thick and watery, perfect for my liking. The food was great especially on a colder day so I'll definitely be back again! However, we definitely over ordered for two people."}
{"text":"Quite literally grew up with this restaurant and quality has been very consistent! I believe there was a slight dip in quality way back when, but it's back on top. Personal faves are the fried doughsticks, rice rolls, and fried noodles (not a big congee fan). This place has always given fast service, consistent good quality, and is wallet friendly. Two people can easily stuff themselves here for 20-25 bucks (and this will make you FULL). Since this is a part of my childhood, I can't imagine ever losing this restaurant! Best HK style breakfast joint in the area, possibly the country =).

NOTE: Be careful on weekends, they may get kind of packed. In addition, you may be asked to share a table which will shrink your wait time, but with the sacrifice of privacy."}
{"text":"Loved the freshly made congee and boodles!  It gets crowded fast but the wait is not too bad.  Liked watching the post Lee make the items in the window"}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

Excellent choice for simple and traditional Cantonese comfort food done right.

This place has been around for probably 15-20 years ever since I was a kid and I still frequent here from time to time whenever I want some plain simple congee, rice rolls and glutinous rice."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would because it is the best budget friendly congee you can find.

This place is literally the only place I go to for congee because literally every other place makes their congee either bland, watery, goopy, or gross or there's just something wrong overall with their toppings.

Sam's Congee makes THE BEST liver congee you can ever find and I would rather eat here than my mom's congee and my mom's congee WAS the best until my eyes were opened by a friend of mine. The congee has this perfect creamy texture and taste with the perfect amount of msg so it wont make your tongue all numb.

Ok but let's cut to the real reason why this place is the best. Nowhere makes liver like this place and its heavenly. It's not bitter, its not dry and hard, its not a rock which some places serve and have the audacity to call it liver, it's a whole new level of liver. If any place has perfected how to serve liver, its here. 

Go here, order anything that has liver in it, and melt in your chair. Do it.

I also ordered their JUST MADE FRESHLY FRIED HANDMADE DOUGHNUTS OMG. They're crispy texure with the sweet chewy fluff on the inside??? It's a dream. I'm eating the food of the gods. They have three sauces to go with it whichis Hoisin Sauce, Peanut Sauce, and Siracha Sauce. Do yourself a flavour and use all three and you get an EXPLOSION of just flavour and godly textures going on in your mouth. 

This place is not worth the amount you pay, it's worth so much more but that's the best part about this place. 

Cheap Heavenly Food."}
{"text":"I don't always eat congee, but when I do, I go to Sam's Congee! This is one of the best traditional Hong Kong style congee around! Fast and delicious is their motto!

The menu is quite simple. About 7-8 different kinds of congee, snacks, and rice rolls, it's never hard to make a decision. I always end up getting the same things: Minced Beef Congee, Rice Rolls with Dough Sticks, and Stir Fry Noodles. These 3 are the staples! I may get some other things from time to time depending on how many people I go with, but those 3 are almost always ordered. The Minced Beef Congee is definitely the best around, with the beef cooking in the congee when served! Most other places will give it to you cooked, then throw the congee on top. 

Service here is decent, as they are probably the quickest staff around. You can literally sit down, order, get your food, pay, and leave in 15 minutes! The staff know exactly what is on their menus, and recite out what you write down. However, with speed lacks quality. They don't spend enough time at your table to be all that friendly or check up on you. It's the Hong Kong 'Dai Pai Dong' style food, so service isn't exactly their emphasis. 

This is always a go-to choice for me as the food is good and you can be in and out in a flash! If you're into authentic congee, check this place out!"}
{"text":"During prime time, expect that there will be a queue.  This inexpensive breakfast joint inside Market Village is a favourite amongst locals as well.  To put your name down, walk to the front and tell them your party size.  They will then pass you a piece of paper for you to wait until your number is called.  The food is served to you pretty quickly so when you are waiting, take that time to think about what you would like to order.  Most items are reasonable for one person.

When you get a table, you will have to write down the items on the piece of paper.  I think listing the number of the item is fine.  The food comes extremely quick.  Order a bowl of congee and a side of fried dough(dough fritters).  You can't go wrong with those!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place for steamed rice rolls and congee but today was just not up to par!

I remember the rice rolls used to be light and thin, with a little bit of a chewy texture but was highly disappointed today cause the plain rice rolls were thick, gooey and soggy. They fell apart when I tried to pick up with chopsticks! Not sure if it's just a one time thing or a permanent change! If this is the case might as well get it at congee Wong or will need to go downtown for good ones!

The congee and bean sprout noodles are still great and the food is always piping hot! Service is okay, quick and fast and simple decor. It's definitely an in and out place. Real disappointed with the rice rolls, not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"A better one among all the congee places in Toronto.  They have a good assortment of congee.  The pig blood is very tender.  The rice paste (cheung fun) is a very soft, silky texture, delectable with the sesame and hoisin sauce (though my husband likes it a bit firmer). Our favorite is the ja leung, the fried dough rolled inside the rice paste.  Stir fried noodle is just okay."}
{"text":"Can't beat a congee joint like Sam's. This place offers a variety of congees, noodles, and certain dim sum plates for cheap. The portions are decent and the toppings are plentiful. There could be waits at times, but they go by pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Pacific mall was over crowded with no seating so we headed over to Market Village and randomly stumbled upon this great restaurant.  Wait time was about 25mins for 2 people during the lunch rush but was definitely worth it.  We had the porc and seafood congee along with the shrimp in rice noodle \"shrimp cheng fun\".  I can't wait to come here again and try out the other congee selections."}
{"text":"Congee is good like those found in NYC. Steam noodles were freshly made but too soft and mushy for my taste."}
{"text":"Authentic taste, quick service and good price. The only challenge is to get a seat, unless willing to share a table or coming before peak hours."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick eat, homey meal and very very affordable menu then definitely stop by Sam's Congee Delight if you're in the area! located right inside of Market Village near the corner of one of the grocery stores in the mall. This restuarant has been here since time! I remember coming to Market village as a kid to learn music theory (bleh) and always walking by and seeing how bustling this place was. Came here on a weekday for lunch and boy was the line crazy for a table! We waited a good 20 minutes to get a table for 2. There are about 20-25 tables in the resturant and all are small. Turn around time to get food is quick though so you will not be starving and waiting long for items. We shared a fresh shrimp rice noodle and a preservative egg and pork congee (my fav). the congee was about $4.75 and you get a good bowl size that can feed two people. The Fresh rice noodles were i believe 3.25 per plate.. but its made fresh!! They also make the chinese salty doughnuts and sweet doughnut here too and they are definitely made fresh to order. As you enter into the restuarant there is a window where you can view your meal being made. Very cool idea. Lots of sauces to choose from as all the sauces are located at the centre of the table. Hosion, hot sauce, soya sauce, peanut sauce, you name it, its there!

Very homey taste, not overly salty and the rice noodles are super silky and smooth. They also do take out, and probably recommends take out when it's this busy! Cash only though so be sure to bring cash.. though there is a TD bank across the street."}
{"text":"They have the best steamed rice rolls.  The skin of the rice rolls is incredibly thin; they use a piece of cloth to help solidify and shape it when they make it.  The result are incredibly soft and smooth rice rolls.

I've had their Plain Rice Roll (??) many times.  It goes best with peanut butter sauce, sweet soy sauce, and some spicy sauce.

The Rice Roll with Beef (???) here was a first for me.  To my surprise, it was just as smooth and silky as the plain rice roll but with some smooth beef too.  Yummy!

The Assorted Congee (???) was hot and velvety.  All of the assorted items were in the bottom of the bowl.  They make all of their congees by putting the main ingredients in the bottom of the bowl and then pouring hot plain congee on top of it.  Thus, after your bowl arrives to the table, you should let it set a bit for the inside ingredients to \"cook\" from the heat of the plain congee before mixing it all together to enjoy together.  What I loved the most is their minced beef!  Delicious.

The Sweet Crueller is made in-house and sweet and goes well with hot congee.

I'm glad we got to visit Sam's Congee Delight again.  Maybe I will squeeze in a few more visits if I'm in the area before they finally move.

After our lunch, we watched them prepare Sweet Cruellers and Fried Dough through the window.  They are so good at what they do.  We hope that they will have a similar window for customers to watch them make food again at the new location."}
{"text":"It's amazing how I never really got the opportunity to eat here after all my years living in Scarborough.  It's definitely a popular spot for breakfast and lunch with how you're inevitably going  to see throngs of hungry diners anxiously waiting outside. However, this usually occurs during the morning and early afternoon hours, so you should be safe mid-afternoon onward.  Nevertheless, if you crave a good Chinese breakfast like I do and will need to soldier through the waiting time, then it's a saving grace that the workers have developed an efficient system to go through the lineups. Specifically, you will get a number for your group and when a table with enough seats frees up, a worker will call out the number of the next group that best suits that table size. The numbers go in consecutive order, so it makes it easy to gauge how long you will have to wait for a table. Plus, the restaurant has an in and out type of atmosphere, so, even during peak hours, you should be able to get a table within 15 minutes.

The highlight for me here are the prices. They range from 1.5-6.5 dollars per dish, making Sam's Congee Delight even more affordable for breakfast/lunch than McDonald's.  If you're a light eater who can be satisfied with a 2 dollar rice roll dish or a heavy eater who loves ordering multiple dishes for variety, then this is a glorious hole in the wall for cheap eats.  

The caveat, however, is that the quality of the food is nothing outstanding.  Despite the fact that they make their rice rolls, dough sticks and congee in house to the point of even showcasing their cooking process through windowed screens, I felt that the depth of flavour was average.  These were my orders and my thoughts:

* Congee with Beef Slices and Congee with Pork and Preserved Egg: I combined these two because their base tasted the same. I believe they most likely use the same broth for all their congee varieties. There was not enough meat/egg for my liking, and you mostly taste the green onions and ginger bits. 3/5

* Chow Mein with Bean Sprouts: For just over two bucks, this dish was a steal as it was big enough to share. However, it was horribly dry since it was served without any sauce. 2.5/5

* Rice Roll with Shrimp: You get a standard plate of three rice rolls. They pre-add the soy sauce, which I didn't appreciate as I love adjusting the amount of soy sauce I use. These rice rolls were softer and thinner than what you get elsewhere, which complimented the chewy shrimp very well. There was nothing special, just your plain Jane shrimp rice rolls. 3.5/5

* Rice Roll with Beef and Dough Sticks: I was excited to try this dish beacuse it was heavily recommended on Yelp. However, much to my disappointment, there were barely any beef slices and it honestly felt like I was chewing on soggy dough sticks drenched in soy sauce. 2.5/5

* Sweet Dough Cruller and Red Bean Cruller: I combined these two because the crullers were almost identical. Unfortunately, the bean one wasn't filled with paste and instead only had a smidge of paste on the outside. As such, you could hardly tell them apart based on taste. They were crispy and fresh, so they had a good texture. They were also semi-sweet, so they didn't really cut it for me as I have a sweet tooth. Again, they were nothing special. 2.5/5

* Black Sesame and Meng Bean Soup and Black Sesame and Peanut Soup: Strangely enough, their sweet soups are on the thicker side. By that, I mean they were REALLY thick. It felt like cornstarch was dumped in during  the cooking  process. Unfortunately, this thickness resulted in a texture that was utterly off-putting and it seemed to have diluted the flavour. It was like eating bland ''goop''.  1/5

* Beef Brisket: This was one of the more expensive items at 6.50  dollars. The beef was tender and the sauce was flavourful. Portion-wise, you get a medium sized serving, so the price to portion ratio isn't exactly enticing. I would have loved it if it was cheaper because this was the best dish that my party tried. 3.5/5

Overall, Sam's Congee Delight is your average Joe taste-wise. You can't beat the price, so it's a great spot for those who are on a budget. However, don't expect to get a mind-blowing, gastric experience here."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with the fam and it was really solid! We ordered a ton of stuff and be bill came out to $30, not bad at all.  I like how you can watch the guy make the Cheung-Fen (rice paper rolls?!) in the front. I'm guessing this place normally has a wait cause there was constantly a bunch of people waiting today (it's a Friday). 

I wish they had a larger soy milk selection; you can only pick hot or cold and you can't adjust the sweetness. But the hot soy milk was really good either way. 

We ordered pork cheung-fen, shrimp cheung-fen, mixed jook, Chinese donut, soy milk, fried noodle and pork liver. The pork liver was probably the best dish we got. It was super tender and fresh (and not dry AT ALL) and basically melted in my mouth. Yum! 

I would definitely recommend Sam's if you're at Market Village looking for some chinese breakfast."}
{"text":"One of the only places I know that make their rice noodles rolls fresh with sesame, sweet hoisin, red chili and soy sauce at each table."}
{"text":"Extremely good rice rolls and congee!!!
We also loved the Chinese fried dough!
Very very authentic! Definitely satisfied my cravings !"}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick bite to eat today.  I used to come here quite often, but I've not been in 10 years. 

I used to find the food really excellent here but today's  food wasn't that great.  Back in the day, I was probably more impressed with the food because there wasn't as much choice as today.  None  of the congee queens, towns, etc existed then.  But with these places now open up everywhere, this place just doesn't offer much of a superior product. 

The congee today was a tad runny for me and there wasn't much meat in the congee either.   The steamed rice rolls weren't smooth and were quite small.  Two smallish bowls of congee and two small plates of rice rolls came to $16.70, so not much value for money either.  

It was a nice trip down memory lane because the place looks the same as it did all those years ago."}
{"text":"Although not exactly how congee is made in Hong Kong (or might I dare compare to how it's made at home),  but it is one of the best without having to jet off for a quick fix. The dough sticks are light, but just a touch on the thin side. Again, without having to fly off to China, I'm not going to complain too much. The other stuff are pretty darn good. 

Go early and especially early during holidays and weekends otherwise be prepared for a bit of a wait. 

Lastly, beware that they now add gratuity to the bill. Enjoy ."}
{"text":"So I finally went back here after not coming here  for a long time.  I didn't like the previous owners they had bad service and cheap when you asks for extra chopped onions for garish.  When I did ask they say they have to charge me for a spoon full of extra green onions for garnish.  Weird. Anyway so I'm back and now it's new ownership.  Not bad...  Ladies all speak English now or at least better English and they are not cheap to give extra chopped green onions.  I like their steamed turnip and the spicy tofu."}
{"text":"We got here at 10am exactly when they open and there was a wait already. So make you go early! The congee was delicious. The dough stick was the best I've ever had. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The rice flour noodles with all the sauce is a must! No complaints, fast service, great food, fair prices!"}
{"text":"Great place for variety of congee and fried dough sticks. This is like the Asian version of \"comfort food\". My fave is the jah-lurng, which you top with peanut, oyster, hot sauce and a sprinkle of sesame. It's sad that the lease for all restaurants and shops at Market Village will end soon, for demolition to accommodate the new Remington Centre project. Hopefully this place can find another location during the construction."}
{"text":"This little shop of the many at the Market Village/P-Mall area has been around for a long time. This place has a continuous line up from open till close. I mean that is a good sign of great a business. 

Food wise, I have never sat down at this place to eat because of the huge lines and the concept of \"split table with strangers\" just doesn't fly with me. On another note, I enjoy coming here for take out of their fried dough and rice rolls. These are their signature food.

The venue is quite clean, though it is packed and the tables don't offer much space. The entrance can be like a maze cause chairs line the corridor and there are people standing on the side. That being said, I only come for take outs. So this is their only drawback from earning a 5 star rating in my books."}
{"text":"I don't know who Sam is (or if there is a Sam), but he and his congee associates sure know how to run a shop. Sam's Congee Delight is simplicity at its absolute best. It has mastered exactly what it sets out to do, which is fast and delicious food at a good price. This no-frills, congee staple has been tucked inside Market Village for as long as I can remember. Weekend brunch here means waiting in line unless you get here early. 

As a kid (who am I kidding, as an adult too), I love watching them prepare the rice noodle rolls by hand and freshly fry up the Chinese fritters through the glass window at the front. You see them ladle congee out of large steaming pots and add fresh ingredients by hand. All the customers here look like they just woke up, and it's great. There are no false pretenses, people just want some Chinese food made right first thing in the morning.

When you order, you write down the number beside the menu items you want. When the server comes, they read the numbers and immediately list off exactly which food item it corresponds to. Clearly, superior memory is a requisite for working here. My must-haves are rice noodle with pork liver, sweet cruller, and pork and century egg congee. Bonus items include hollow sesame balls, plain rice noodle rolls that you can add sweet/sesame/hot sauce to, and fried noodles. 

Sorry I had to make up some of these English names as the Chinese ones don't translate very well sometimes. Bottom line is, order whatever, it'll probably taste good regardless! :)

{"text":"Very disappointed! We visited Toronto and friends highly recommended this place for Cantonese style breakfast. Our group tried 3 different congees and they were all very good. Dough sticks inside the crepes are not crispy. We also ordered fried doughsticks alone and still not as crispy as they should be. The fried noodles with soy sauce has good texture, but it smelled and tasted burned. The other 2 items we had were ok. Overall, it's above average but not great."}
{"text":"From nostalgic past, I remember my Parents waking me up near midnight to go to a back street in Hong Kong for a Midnight Congee.  A handful of people stood at an unassigned(to me at least) spot awaiting for something magical to arrive.  A mid-age Man carrying a portable Kitchen on his back arrives and cooks fresh sliced Fish Cantonese Congee bowl after bowl as we stood or SQUAT in enjoyment.

Obv Toronto doesn't have this experience available if anywhere in North America for that fact but there's still carb-licious soupy sludgy gruel o Congee available.  I usually go with Sampan Congees here although the ingredients aren't as complete, the personal love of the Beef/Crisp Rice Noodle mixture bites(small Meatballs) is what I always search for within to give me the addictive flavour.  Others look for other ingredients which varies from Squid Tentacles, fresh Pork Skin, Peanuts, etc...

I usually like to get plain Street-style steamed Rice Noodle Roll.  Fresh made and squeeze plenty of Condiments(Hot Sauce, Sesame Paste, Hoisin, Sesame Seeds) to complete the experience.  Why so much sauces?  Have you ever tasted plain Rice?  That's what plain Rice Noodle Roll taste like but it's a different format.

I agree this place is small, crowded, table-sharing, noisy, dirty, in-and-out and that's exactly what makes HK-ers love it so much because it reminds them of home(half way around the world).  You take any of those elements away, then you take the soul, history, memories away.  Even the prices are getting pricier while being served a small-ish portion sizes.  If it wasn't for the prices vs portion = value.  I would easily ask for 2 bowls everytime I visit."}
{"text":"Update: Still not opened yet. Just drove past it and they're still renovating. Their spot used to be the Hangover Bar"}
{"text":"My go to congee joint! The price is fairly reasonable for the amount you get and the flavour and quality is great too. It often gets super busy on weekends and mornings. I try to come after the rush around 1pm to avoid waiting in line. They do have take out as well for those that don't want to wait. There are so many combinations of congees you can choose from (preservative egg, salted egg, chicken slices, minced pork, fish fillet, pudding also known as porks blood, liver and so much more). I personally like the preservative egg with the pudding. I usually get the fried noddles and the dough fritter which is always fried fresh! I would also recommend the beef and enoki rice roll I love getting that and it comes with a soy sauce dip. It's a fast paced environment and Hong Kong style. If you sit in a big table you might have others squeeze in your table as well."}
{"text":"One of the closest congee shops I can find in Toronto that has the quality of Hong Kong congee stores. This place usually has a huge line when you go on weekends during breakfast (around 9:30am to 10am) till (1pm to 1:30pm). I usually avoid those massive lineups by coming in super early or super late. I came in at around 11:15am before and there was no lineup as well.

The staff are amazing as they basically repeat your order to confirm just by looking at the numbers you wrote. Also, the food comes super fast. Each food item isn't expensive as the portion sizes are small, but some dishes like the rice wrapped with leafs (zhong) can make you stuffed.

My personal favourites are the \"cheoung fun\", sweet fried dough and the chow mein. Remember to add their awesome sauces that they have on the table. The dark coloured one in a bottle is a sweet hoisin sauce and the light coloured one that looks like watered down peanut butter is a sesame paste (called ma jeung)."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall type of restaurants and especially Chinese breakfast food! Super straight forward and great comfort food. 

Quality seems to have gone down slightly over the years, but their food is still really good. I highly recommend ordering the Fish Slice Congee, it's a really nice thick congee full of generous toppings and they give you a good portion too. Their congee is so good though, you probably don't need to or even want to share a bowl of it. It's slightly salty, savoury, and has chives and ginger in the congee to spruce things up. Peanuts are also a great addition. 

The plain rice rolls are pretty good (love it when it's piping hot) but I wish they didn't water down their peanut sauce! I LOVE eating plain rice rolls with heaps of peanut and oyster sauce, but their peanut sauce was so watery it just rolled off the rolls. The bright side is that they give you a bottle to pour as much as you want (at restaurants I always end up asking multiple times for extra peanut sauce), but it's a real bummer that they watered it down because it would have been heavenly. A solid 5 stars if only they didn't water it down! 

I also got their soy milk to go with everything (soy milk and chinese breakfast food is so blessed) but mine was really sandy. At least I know it's home made, but it needs to be strained more! Fried Dough Stick was soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.

Overall, great place to eat and easily one of my favourite places to get my grub on. Highly recommend the congees, especially the fish slice. Prices are also super reasonable and the quality of the food is great! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for congee ever since I was a little girl. There's actually a window where you can watch the chefs make steamed rice noodle rolls and deep fried dough sticks and stuff. Very cool. Their minced beef congee is the best! There's a lot of minced beef, shredded lettuce and their peanuts take the cake. Prices are super reasonable too. My dad and I each had a congee tonight (his minced beef and mine minced beef and preserved egg) and a deep fried dough stick wrapped in rice noodle roll and the total came to $15 after tip!

One thing I'd suggest for next time though, is for the deep fried dough stick wrapped in rice noodle roll, I'd get the soy sauce on the side.

Ah. They also close at 8pm."}
{"text":"My all time super fave for a hang over cure or if I feel like I need to eat something 'clean'.

Congee, it's the remedy to all ailments, at least according to the Chinese.

This place become quite popular over the years so if it gets too busy, I would suggest getting take out and eating at the food court.

Service and food comes pretty quick. I go to selections are minced beef Congee, fried dough fritter, beef noodle wrap and soy sauce noodle."}
{"text":"Anytime I am sick or crave congee, Sam's is my ultimate favourite place! I'm actually sad this place will be gone when market village is gonna be closed down soon so hopefully they are going to relocate close by! 

Their menu is very cheap for their portion size which I love and their congee always tastes like what my grandma makes or even better! Every time I go there is it packed and waiting can be quite long. 

You can see them create the rice noodles and dough stickers with their open concept kitchen right in front of the store and they make them very quickly!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Congee restaurant in all of Toronto.

Every time I step foot into this restaurant I feel like I am in Hong Kong.

It has a very traditional vibe that makes me feel at home in a weird but good way.

The menu is geared towards Congee and all of the other Congee food goodies that you would expect from one of these type of restaurants.

My favorite that I always order is the plain steam rolls and a beef and preserved egg congee.   The plain steamrolls are perfectly steamed not too soft and not too overly deemed to the point of being too hard and thick to eat.  The Congee has the traditional beef that is mixed with rice and is rare so you would need mix it in with the congee to cook it once you get it.

I always come here whenever I feel like I need a bowl of good congee.

At certain times mainly lunch it gets pretty packed but the tables come and go pretty quickly so you'd normally don't have to wait that long for a table.

Try this place!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me this long to try out Sam's Congee when I have lived in Markham for all my life but I am so glad I finally went. The allure of this place have always intrigued me. You walk by and see them making and frying doughnuts by the windows, with the place being always packed. There is a reason afterall. 

Tasty, cheap, no nonsense food with quick service makes Sam's Congee a winner in my books. This place won't blow you away, but it's solid food.

You can't go wrong with a bowl of their congee, coming in at around $4-5, it's the perfect size. I went with the sliced fish one and they don't skimp out on toppings either, as there was just the right amount. I really liked the amount of ginger they had in my congee.

I was really impressed by their fried dough deliciaies. The fritters were surprisingly light, without much oil yet were still fairly crisp! I do recommend doubling up the order as they are on the small side.

I was initially disappointed when I first looked at the zhaliang (fried donut sticks wrapped in rice roll), but there's even sesame seeds, sesame paste, and hoisin sauce at the end of the table. It's important to note their rice roll is also freshly made. It was almost falling apart on the donut sticks. 

There was a $3 minimum per person. I came here for a 'snack with my family' and didn't even meet the criteria, so ordered some more to take back home."}
{"text":"I honestly love this congee place. The fried dough is very authentic and tastes just like the ones in Hong Kong. They are fried immediately so they always come out fresh. I like to eat my fried dough with minced beef congee. The taste is just too good. The congee is $4.25 and the fried dough is $1.35. I like the plain rice noodle ($2.75) as well, but I can eat this anywhere else. To me, I think their best items are the fried dough and minced beef congee. They open at 10, and tends to be quite busy on weekends. Wait times are fast though because their food comes out fast.


Hey guys, the plaza this restuarant is located in will be closed and taken down after 2017 summer so come before they close. But rumors are going around saying they will open in the plaza across from pacific mall."}
{"text":"this place is honestly one of the best restaurants out there and also, it rly reminds me of Hong Kong restaurants just a little bit  

so first off, this is pretty obvious already but this place is usually hella busy with long lineups (especially in the morning)

second, they have rly good congee and other little  dishes. for me, i usually just come here for their steamed radish cakes like LOOOOOOORD IT DOESNT LOOK THAT APPETIZING WHEN THEY SERVE IT (IT USED TO LOOK LIKE A PILE OF MUSH BUT THEY DONT SERVE IT THAT WAY ANYMORE. IT LOOKS MORE APPETIZING NOW) BUT IT HELLA GOOD like god diggity damn. also whenever i feel like it i would order their plain rice rolls as well (ain't too shabby)

congee wise, i normally can't finish a bowl myself since im busy chugging all dem steamed radish cakes down my throat so i share a bit with my mom (i believe she gets the fish cake congee which is pretty bomb) 

just saying don't get the plain congee (i made the grave mistake of doing that TWO TIMES and legit tastes like nothing. you would expect some salt or something but nope it's just boiled rice) 

so yeah, very good place. i just hate some of the waiter's attitude sometimes and also the fact that you might end up sharing a table with others (I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT CAUSE MAN ITS AWKWARD but ya know if u ain't got time or you have zero patience then that's what you would have to do)

**note: it's a better choice to come here RIGHT when it opens because the congee and other stuff are made fresh. it tastes way better"}
{"text":"Coming out from a fresh cut at Pmall, the wife and I were looking for a light bite to eat. I suggested this congee place because I haven't been back in almost 10 years.

As we reached the entrance, I could see that only one thing has changed: the wait time and line! Reluctant to line up, I looked through the window and was reminded by the orchestrated cooks and chefs what I would be missing out on. I grabbed a number and proceeded to wait outside looking into the lovely view of the kitchen from the window. I was delighted by the spectacle of one particular chef working his craft at his rice noodle  roll station. This stuff is made fresh and you can see him ladle rice flour mix into a rectangular steamer to create this crepe like sheet of rice paper, which is extremely delicate.

It was used to wrap various meats all made to order. Alright enough with the teaser sir, let's eat! We ordered minced beef congee with preserved egg and a lovely fish congee with ginger thinly julienned for a lovely accent. All this with fried noodles, sweet cruller and dough fritter in rich noodle roll for less than 20 dollars. 

Some tips:

- line moves fast so grab a number and a seat next to the window by the kitchen. It'll go by fast with the show they put on.

- bowls of congee are cheap! 4-5 bucks to be exact so I usually sample a few with the wifey"}
{"text":"Are you looking for some great juk (congee) along with some tasty dishes on the side? Well, if you said yes, this place in Markham has your answer. I arrived at Market Village (a shopping area in Markham) and met up with some really interesting people to get some lunch. 

I lost track on what kind of congee that we ate, but all of them were excellent. The thickness was just right, not too watery and it was almost rich. I really enjoyed the beef and chicken varieties of congee and the texture of the seafood is not bad. Even better was the Yau Zha Gwai, also known as the fried dough. It had a great crispness and a soft chewiness, and it was probably the best complement to the congee. It made the congee tastier. The fried noodles had a simple flavour, but were excellent. The Zha Leung Cheung Fun, also known as the Fried Dough Rice Noodle Roll was also pretty good here, especially with the sesame seeds and the sauce. The Lo Bak Go, also known as the turnip cakes were also great, and were prepared in a somewhat unique style. They did not look like cakes, but more like a small pile of mushed turnips. Despite that look, they were still tasty and even tastier with the sauce.  

Wait time is a little long, so make sure you have something to do while you wait. Eating here can be a little messy, so hopefully you will have a lot of napkins. Eating at this place did not give me the feeling that I was in Markham, but possibly somewhere in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The setting is a tiny bit gritty which gave the Hong Kong vibe, but it's definitely not a really gritty place to eat.

Overall, I thought I had some of the best congee and the best Yau Ja Gwai in Markham and possibly in the Toronto area so far. I think this place may become one of my favourite and primary choices for congee in Markham. I hope this place will stay in business and I hope to come back here again for some excellent congee with some Yau Zha Gwai."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this restaurant. They have an open windowed kitchen setup in the front so you can see them prepare pretty much everything that is ordered. The place is pretty popular but small in size, so the wait times can be pretty bad depending on when you go. I went with my family right after it opened, and we had to wait a decent amount of time to get a table.. plenty of time for me to awkwardly stare at the guy making rice noodle rolls. When we finally got a table, we wrote down the numbers of all of the dishes we wanted to order. The waitress saw the list and started reciting what each number was off the top of her head to confirm our order. I thought this was pretty impressive, and it showed just how well she knew the menu.

The food here is amazing. The rice noodle rolls here are my absolute favorite. They are so fresh (well, that's obvious since you can see the guy making it in the front) and absurdly soft. If they were any softer, I would probably have a really tough time eating it because the chopsticks would go right through the rice noodle rolls. They have a good amount of options for the rice noodle rolls. I tried a decent amount of them, and my favorite would have to be the dough stick one. The congee here is also great. I'm not huge on congee in general, but even I can appreciate a hot bowl of congee from this place. There are a lot of options available for the congee too.

The service is fast paced and very straightforward here. The prices are excellent and very worth it. I would come here for the rice noodle rolls all the time if I lived in the area. I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"As an asian kid, congee was always a dish that is served when you are sick or have a cold. Coming to Toronto from Montreal, I wanted to find some good congee to satisfy my cravings. 

First things first, during weekends, seats tend to fill up fairly quickly so I suggest you show up early (5-10 mins before opening) to secure a seat. Service is fairly quick with the food coming within 10 mins of ordering. The congee is rather basic but still delicious. I strongly recommend the rice roll/fried dough, which is one of my favorites. Will definitely come back and bring my parents there!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

I have probably pasted by this place a hundred times but somehow never tried the food here. 

I stopped by here on a Saturday morning around 11:30. I was surprised to see that there were quite a few tables available. No waiting for me! I love being able to be seated right away 

I tried their congee and a couple of their rice noodle rolls. Maybe my expectations were too high for this place but I honestly didn't think their congee or rice noodle rolls were all that special. It was still delicious, as rice noodle rolls always are, but it was just ordinary food to me. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but also wouldn't mind coming again if I was in the area. 

Also, I thought that the presentation could be improved. The rice noodle rolls were sloppily placed on the plate. It surely can't be that hard to place it neatly. 

The service here was very fast so they get points for that. You also write your own order on paper (write corresponding number to menu items) and I like how they confirm it when you give it to them so you know you never accidentally ordered the wrong thing.

Overall not a bad place to get your congee and rice noodle roll fix."}
{"text":"It's a tradition in my family to eat breakfast here every time we visit Toronto, and we've been doing so for over a decade. This is always the highlight of the trip, since all the food here is so fast and fresh!

It's crazy how well they run this place-- you write down your order by item number and your dishes are ready in minutes. The congee is good, but man the fried dough sticks are where it's at! We also love the rice noodles and chow mein. 

Last time we were there, they had a sign up that they were moving locations. I'll miss them in Market Village, but hope they are expanding and will have even more tasty food in the future!"}
{"text":"Finally!
I've pasted by this place for year but have never set foot in it.  Sam's Congee is popular for those who love simple yet hearty congee.  Beware this place does have line-ups during peak breakfast times.  Their portions are perfect for two and their price range is VERY reasonable, on average $5-7 per bowl.
We fortunately came here during the dinner hours and as a surprise it was quiet!
Taking advantage of the ample space we quickly ordered; 
*Fish congee, 
*Pork and egg congee
*Fried dough fritter wrapped in steam noodle.
The only drawback I found was their congee was quite thick, in a bad way.  You can tell they've added starch.  However aside from that, everything was delicious and their service is fast and efficient.

Overall bang for buck and the quality is descent"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing to rave about here. Decided to give this place a try b/c there were so many people lining up and I was impressed with how they made their rice noodle wraps fresh. Must admit that service is fast, food is cheap, and we actually had a server that smiled at us while taking our order (those that dine at Chinese restos know that this is a rarity). But the food was bland. Congee (mixed seafood) lacked seafood, the turnip cake was a pile of mashed turnips that resembled over cooked porridge more than any turnip cake I've had, and their supposedly \"known-for\" specialty rice rolls were really disappointing; they were bland, small and lacked filling (we had the beef one and the beef was a thin spread of over processed meat mush).  So if u are looking for a place that serves some resemblance of Cantonese congee and accompanying snacks I would avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Lots of screaming of numbers all around. Strong Hong Kong feel.

This spot was pretty to find. It's inside Pacific  mall.  You need to grab a number once you arrive in order to get a table. It seems to be a hole in the wall place that locals go to.

You write the number of what you want to order on a piece of paper. Pretty cool. Minimum interaction required. This way the servers can get the food to tables quickly. This place is packed so many people...parties of 1 or 2 get stuck sitting with strangers.  Worth it for the food?

The fried dough is pretty greasy. At first the saltiness was good, but as I ate my congee, the dough felt greasier and greasier. The seafood congee is good. Hard to find that near me so I just HAD to get congee here. Based in Yelp reviews, this place has the best rated congee all around.  We also got the shrimp and fried dough rice wraps. The rice wrap isn't  great."}
{"text":"For fresh and tasty congee and noodle rolls this is the place to go! Cheap, fast service and good portions! Weekends are busy with a line up out the door. Far better than on of the other congee chains by far!"}
{"text":"Sam's congee is one of my top places to visit for congee and rice rolls. It is a casual restaurant and it can get really loud especially in the morning since there is a lot of people going in and out during breakfast time. It is especially busy on weekends and you will most likely experience a wait time. One time I came a few minutes before the opening time and there were already a few people waiting outside the shop. I have never experienced a long wait though since it's not the type of restaurant for people to hang out at for a long time after they are finished eating. 

My must get items include: minced pork and preserved egg congee, plain rice rolls. I love their rice rolls here. The texture is very smooth. I enjoy most of the rice rolls with filling inside, but my go-to is the plain one. 

I recommend you trying this restaurant if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located inside Market Village. Go here soon before they tear it down. 

The food here is pretty decent, even for Markham standards. There's not a lot on the menu other than congee, so go here only if you're craving congee or fried doughsticks. 

Their sweet dough sticks are pretty delicious. But i would prefer more variety and better service. Not only did this place sigh every time we asked for an extra utensil, they also couldn't wait to kick us out because we were a big group. 

4 stars for the food
Taking a way one star for the service."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for Cantonese comfort food--congee and fried donut (??). Not only are they extremely cheap, but you can see them making the donut and frying them right there in the storefront. It's tasty and crispy, and went well with the congee. Very good for breakfast in particular."}
{"text":"I had to make a stop at Pacific Mall, and figured I might as well grab a quick bite while I'm there. I punch in congee on my trusty yelp app, and bam, Sam's Congee Delight pops up.

So, I walk over to Markham village and start my search. off topic: how do you find anything in Markham Village? I couldn't for the life of me find a mall directory or something. I had to scour through the whole place before I found Sam's Congee Delight or SCD as the kids call it (I don't know if the kids actually call it that. I'm just assuming they do cause they seem to love to abbreviate everything icydk)

ok, so after finding it, here's what you need to know. it's not very big and there was a lineup. However, it only took about 10 minutes before we were seated (at around 11:30 am on a Saturday).

The Congee dishes seemed reasonably priced. approx $4-$5 a bowl. I got the Fish congee with preserved egg, while my sister got the fish congee with minced beef, and my mom got the sticky rice. We also got the fried dough wrapped in a rice noodle (I have no idea what it's called in English. zha leung in chinese).

The congee came out minutes after they took our order. It was piping hot and tasted great. Couldn't ask for anything more. The real standout was the zha leung. We saw them frying the dough fresh, and wrapping it in the noodle in the window at the front, which is why we decided to order it in the first place. It was fantastic. It was fresh, and quite possible the best I've ever had. If nothing else, I would go back just for that alone.

SCD is definitely my go to congee spot now whenever I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Not the best congee or amazing rice noodle but for the price and location, it was a good quick fix to a good breakfast. Come before 11:30am as theres a line to form."}
{"text":"Came in here because we were observing from the outside that they were making fresh dough stick in there, from scratch, with real dough and all, not from frozen! So of course we had to go in and try it and their congee too! We ordered the pork and preserved egg congee and the assorted topping congee, along with the fresh fried dough stick (of course) and also the dough stick with rice roll around it. And everything was very good here, though I prefer the pork and preserved egg congee more.

Service was very quick here too. Once you come in, they hand you a piece of paper with the menu on it and they insist you to write down what you want with a pencil. The server comes back, checks what you want, head for the kitchen, and pretty instantly, comes back out with your food already. Wow!"}
{"text":"Sam's Congee is an institution in Market Village. You will discover long lineups during breakfast and lunch. You will be pointed to sit with random strangers on communal tables. The place while is clean (to Chinese standards) isn't exactly inviting and the staff are not particularly polite or rude.
However, people come here for the quick service and most importantly for the food. I will proclaim that Sam's makes the best congee in the city! Their prices are low and the portions are average I would say.
Fantastic food, fast service and affordable prices -- these are reasons' why Sam's is my go-to place for congee (just not during the weekend mornings when the lineups are out the door)."}
{"text":"Food is always great. Service is fast. This location is closing on February 28, 2018. 
New location opening in early Summer 2018. 7354 Woodbine Ave. (Northwest corner of Woodbine & Denison)"}
{"text":"This place give you a taste of HK breakfast.  Stuff I like the most, all their congee, friend dough roll, steam raddish cake, friend noodles, and fried dough to dunk into the congee.  The service is fast and pleasant.  You could look at the display in the front and see how they make the dishes too.  I visit this place everytime I visit Toronto.  They give you a piece of paper to write down what you want, either in chinese or the # of the dish."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem.  Congee is top notch.  They ran out of fried dough sticks though which apparently is world class :(  the fried football shaped dough thing was a bit chewy and stale as they were about 5 minutes to close I guess it's understandable.  Would have been 5 stars otherwise!"}
{"text":"Best rice noodle roll and chinese fried donut (you tiao) in town!! They make everything fresh on the spot - you can even watch them through the window at the front. My favourite is the rice noodle with fried donut inside (zha liang). Their congees are also super hearty and delicious."}
{"text":"Great snack location. Portions are just right. Not too much and not too little. I would say their congee bowls serves two people if you want to share. But also works well as individuals. I mean nothing best than silky congee for $5. The fried dough is fluffy and crispy. Very dense like a donut. I even spotted a European guy eating alone speaking Cantonese with staff as this place is still popular at all hours."}
{"text":"Good congee, variety of flavors. The liver and kidneys were perfectly cooked, that's when u know that the chef knows how to cook well!

They are famous for their fried cruellers, but I actually think it's a bit on the salty side. Their other fried breads are delicious. Their sesame ball is a giant chewy puff. Their frying station is right in front for u to see how they make em.

It's a crowded place, but it's what a good local gem would be like. So be prepared for quick in and out type of dining."}
{"text":"After a short, yet amazing trip to Hong Kong, I've actually been sick in the last few weeks.  Most people would point out that I'm always out and about trying new restaurants and quickly writing reviews on them, but I've actually slowed down my pace on eating out.  Well 1) I'm sick; 2) I'm starting to feel a hole eating through my wallet; and 3) I think the more you eat out, the less special your outings become.

So after three weeks or so of not going out to eat, two of my closest girl friends and I decide to go out for my friend's birthday.  Considering that my friend was on a time constraint, we were thinking of a place that was cheap and fast.  Considering that I was sick, we were thinking of a place that had a \"homier\" food.  Considering that my friend just did the Toronto Marathon in the morning, we were trying to think of something with carbs.  Then we figured it out.

Congee.

Considered a little hole-in-the-wall in Market Village, Sam's Congee Deilght certainly reminded me of the Hong Kong style restaurants.  It was a Sunday afternoon during lunch, and there was quite a line-up considering that most people come to this restaurant after church.  Surprisingly, we got in fairly quickly (about a 10 minute wait or so).  We got seated, and ordered the following: 

1) PORK LIVER & ASSORTED CONGEE:  Included a few pieces of liver, chicken, ground beef, vegetables, and peanuts in it.  It was definitely hitting the spot considering that I wasn't feeling so well.  And yes, I eat liver.  It's really good for anemic people.  Just sayin'.
2) GROUND BEEF CONGEE: Pretty much the same as the other congee, but was missing out on the liver.
3) ZHALIANG (Rice noodle roll wrapping a \"youtiao\" a.k.a. Chinese donut):  Absolutely delicious - add some hoisin sauce and sesame paste, and you're set.
4) VEGETABLES (choy sum): Typical vegetable dish - nothing really that special.
5) SPICY TOFU IN GARLIC SAUCE:  I've never actually had this dish before.  I've had fried tofu by its own, but never in a spicy sauce before.  It was actually fairly good.  I think I would've enjoyed it more if I wasn't so sick though.
6) STEAMED TURNIP CAKE: Oh my goodness.  This is a definite recommend!  I usually have fried turnip cake, and the steamed turnip cakes that I usually get are usually very \"clumpy.\"  This dish was so simple - it doesn't have meat or the usual dried shrimp, yet it was amazing.  I was tempted to order a second serving.

Service was very quick; yet like any other Asian restaurant - they want you in and out as fast as possible.  They don't want you to dolly around.  If you want to go chat for a while, go to a coffee shop.

All together: about $22 for three people, and six dishes that filled us up to the brim.  Obviously, incomparable to Hong Kong prices, but it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"I come here right on the next day when I was back from my trip, and then I realized that congee is what I'll strongly crave for after each trip.  This place has the best congee, fried dough stick and steamed rice noodle.   Their fried dough sticks are better than those in Hong Kong.  They are crispy, light, airy and incredibly yummmmm... You can dip it into congee and eat like Oreo dips in milk or tear it up into small chunks and put them in the congee a few chunks at a time.  Eating in both ways do give it a nice textual contrast for the congee.  I personally like their minced beef congee.  Some of the congee places just boil the grains for a while and then thicken it with corn starch, but this place makes the congee to perfection.  The grains are all broken down and the velvety congee has the perfect thickness.  If you haven't had congee here, then you haven't tried real congee.  Quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Really great congee in a non-descript location. I really like the thick, almost creamy congee that they serve. We got the fish with century egg and fish with pig liver congees, and cooked with the spring onion and ginger, both had great flavors. The creaminess might come from starch that they use to thicken the congee, otherwise they would have had to boil it like 24 hours to get consistency and for the rice grains to completely disappear.

The fried dough wrapped in rice flour is also great. Crunchy inside and soft on the outside (kinda like the opposite of a good loaf of bread where it's soft inside and crunchy outside?). The sauce - peanut, sweet and chili - are in squeeze jars on the table and so you can add whatever you want. I love adding the peanut to give it a nutty flavor.

No paying extra for take out (boxes), which is nice and rare in the Markham Chinese scene!

Knocking off a star because of how expensive the steamed greens are - it's a small plate for a vegetable (choi sum or lettuce) with oyster sauce.

Also be warned that it's not a particularly comfortable setting and they will ask you to sit at the same table with strangers if it gets busy."}
{"text":"It's good at a very reasonable price. I like their rolls- it's nice to see the people make it in the window.

Great fast dinner (closed at 8) or lunch.

If you go on a weekend for lunch be prepared to wait.
You also take out."}
{"text":"Our group of eight makes our annual trip to Toronto. Sam's is the highlight for us to be able to relive our childhood. The best comfort food we know and love! We start our morning every single day that we are at Markham with us standing in line at 9:45am
to wait for the 10am opening. Then we order all our favorites, four different kinds of congees, hand roll rice noodles, fried dough, Pork Liver, sticky rice(jung), soy stir fry noodles. We Always ordered too much foods, the eyes are bigger then our stomach. Although leaving the place like a stuffed pig,but oh so happy!
And ready to do it all over again in the morning. Just that thought makes me smile!"}
{"text":"Everything fresh and made right in front of your eyes. 
The place is very small and always busy but the turn around time to get a seat is fairly quick. At times you may even be seated with other customers on the same table. The menu is small and when you place the orders you just write the item # on a piece of paper and the staff will just read out what you ordered based on just the item # itself. They have a good memory or just the pure repetition of the same orders over and over again. Everything tasted very good very good. Rice rolls are as smooth as silk. Congee is packed with all kinds of goodies and the deep fried dough sticks are as good as they get. 

Good eats at what I consider Chinese fast food at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Best congee in town.

Plain rice roll - 5 thumbs up.
Spicy tofu could be more spicy.
Fried noodles are too dry.
Fried dough roll - sometimes perfect sometimes rock hard

Congee comes out quick and turnover is quick. Come on a weekend and prepare to wait if you have more than 2 people. Tip: Consider take out.

Service isnt always grest but that's just any other Chinese restaurant lol"}
{"text":"I am in no means someone who likes congee, and I still enjoyed this place.

Why? Their noodle rolls, that are prepared right at the front kitchen (which you can see outside or when you enter). The rice itself is not too thin, not too thick. The dough (if you're ordering the dough sticks) is crunchy, but not to the point that it breaks easily. Even the beef and enoki mushrooms one was quite good, and it's only $4.25! Didn't try the beef brisket since it's $5.75, but I bet that's tasty as well.

Some other things we had were the fish paste siu mai (I prefer the Richmond Court one) and the curry squid (not bad I must say).

Warning on the iced tea: It ain't sweetened."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 15 years... and I'm so sad this place is going to close because the mall is being redeveloped but hopefully they open up in a different location. This place truly brings you right back to Hong-Kong as soon as you step into the place. There's always a line from opening until maybe 3pm so choose your time to visit wisely. 

So a lot of people probably complain about the servers lol. There's a reason for the savageness of the servers because I've witnessed this so many times. It's because they have customers that are UNBELIEVABLY RUDE. They have no respect towards the servers what so ever to the point that I want to yell at the customers for them. 

As for the food~ no complaints what so ever. Their best sellers are obviously their congee, rice rolls and fried snacks (which is made in an open kitchen where customers can see). As for the other items on the menu... it's not the best out there but it's also pretty good. It's just extra variety on the menu for those that want a little more then just congee or rice rolls! 

Recommendations:
*DEFINITELY their beef brisket everything. If it has beef brisket, GET IT! 
*sesame balls (they make roughly around 100 of these only so get there early!) 
*pig blood pudding congee. This place has one of the better quality pig blood puddings."}
{"text":"This would be my go-to lunch place if I worked at the mall and somehow could skip the line every time. 

The food is outstanding. It's HK-style congee shop with freshly made products. Get the fried dough. It's incredible. Like, eat at the place and get one to go type amazing. Congee is good. Spicy tofu is good. It's a quick, no frills, small group size type restaurant. Lots of little snacks to order. Crazy line up and tiny amount of space (our group of 3 had to share a table with a party of 1) but it is what it is. Great prices ($8/person !!!!)

If not for the small area, long line up, and terrible parking situation at Market Village, not to mention the terrible commute, this would be a better catch. They should open more locations.

5 stars out of 5.

{"text":"Always the best place for comfort canto food with low price tag. Perfect for a small party with smaller and lower priced dishes, you can have many varieties but not hurt ur wallet nor over order. My fiance and I had congee and Hot Soy Milk plus three dishes on the side for only 20 bucks after everything, and all dishes are very tasty, just LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Sam's Congee is indeed a delight! Authentic and traditional Hong Kong meal found in Market Village mall.  Order a bunch of dishes as they are all small plates and fairly cheap, too. The congee and other food are all made fresh at the front. 

It gets quite busy for lunch time on weekends, though the wait usually isn't too bad since they are extremely fast at taking orders, serving, and handling your bill. You could also drop by for dinner, especially since it's pretty empty during that time of day, though they close fairly early at 8pm.

We love getting the minced meat w/ preserved egg congee, shrimp rice rolls, you tiao (fried bread), and fried noodles. The last 2 you can dip in the congee for the most spectacular mixture.

Craving this place again as I am writing this review. It is a must if you want an authentic meal."}
{"text":"Had a preserved egg and pork congee, it was a big bowl and incredibly filling for just $6. Family had pork's blood and other congees with crispy dough fritters. The eatery is old fashioned, usually with the door and kitchen open and reminds you of a restaurant in China. You can watch the cooks make the fresh food on the entrance panel.  Very good for a meal and to some a snack. They have noodle dim sum here and it is located in Market Village."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't been here yet because they have some of my favourite dishes here!

I was craving congee so I got the assorted congee ($4.25). I think that the amount of meat in it was fair. I don't think there was much (if any) MSG in the congee because I wasn't dying of thirst after my meal.

Next, was the braised beef brisket ($6.25). It tasted normal like any braised beef from any other restaurants but it was done well. However, for the price, it was quite expensive. I felt like they tried to make it look like there was more beef in the dish than there actually was but layering a lot of lettuce at the bottom. The lettuce was very delicious in the sauce but still!

The rice roll with dough stick ($3) was alright. I would probably tell them not to put soy sauce on it the next time I got because the bottom pieces got really soggy. I also really enjoyed the condiments on the table because I was able to overload the dish with sesame sauce. Also, the option of adding sesame seed was nice.

The beef and enoki mushroom ($4.75) was delicious! My mom said that the rice roll was very silky and I have to agree with her. No complaints on this dish! I would be ordering it again.

Lastly, we got the pig's blood ($4.25). I'm not a fan nor a hater of pig's blood so not much to comment on here. I think it's done alright. Again, it's a bit pricey for the amount you get.

Overall, I really like the food here and I think I'll be coming back here very soon!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious.   Rice noodle is made to ordered, it is soft and smooth.  The fried cruller is warm and crispy.   Congee is so tasty and smooth.  I wish I can eat this everyday.  I haven't had pig's blood for a long time.  It is not bad but it was a bit over cooked.   The staffs was friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Definitely worth 4 stars... maybe even 5..

Haven't been here in almost 10 years, place hasn't changed 1 bit.

This is a legit Hong Kong style congee restaurant.  Has one the best congee in town.  Now to think of it, it does deserve 5 stars because the congee is better then everyone else and it's cheaper then everyone else.

The Rice Rolls here and fried doe is also amazing, freshly made, this type of art isn't always available anymore with the world going more and more commercial.

We also had other items on their menu, which wasn't really all that good.. but this place is built upon their congee and Rice Rolls, so other items not tasting that great is ok...

Sadly, I heard that Remington Corporation has officially sent notices to the tenants that the mall will be taken down for reconstruction starting September 2017.. I wonder if this family tradition will continue after that?"}
{"text":"Update:  I wanted to increase my rating because this place does freshly fry their Chinese donut sticks AND makes their own rice noodle dishes.  And I can certainly appreciate that when both these items don't taste as fresh elsewhere!

YES, it does tend to get busy on the weekends, so just come early.  Line moves efficiently enough though.

Even though it's a busy place, I've never found servers rude or pushy.  Food arrives promptly after ordering.  

Note:  At least half the patrons in-line are waiting for takeout orders.  So don't be discouraged by the amount of people out in front.  Just take your # and listen to how many people are ahead of you!"}
{"text":"Small, cozy and fast paced restaurant. You order, inhale your food and go. 

Its as genuine and as authentic as you can get to Hong Kong Dai Pai Don without having to hop on a train. 

MUST GO."}
{"text":"A place me and my boyfriend will go when we need some comfort food!
Recommend for everyone! Their congee is so yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I call their food \"Chinese Comfort Food\". They have been around \"forever\" so you know they are good.
They tend to have a lineup around lunch time, so be prepare to wait.
Their service has improved over the years, they are less rough around the edge and you may actually feel \"at home\".
Food ordering is easy, just look for what you like, write down the menu number, and they will bring your food soon after they take the order from you.
I love this place."}
{"text":"It was 10am early in the morning, people already line up in front the restaurant before open, I like the liver cheong fun was so smooth and delicious, congee was good as this is a congee place , but other than that everything was alright only for me"}
{"text":"The service that I was given today, on a Monday, was extremely poor. I arrived here at around 11:50am and let the waitress at the front know that we are a group of three. As usual, the waitress asked if sharing a table would be fine, and we said no. We were perfectly fine with waiting until a table freed up that we could have to ourselves. At the time we were the only ones waiting to be seated.

We waited for about 2 minutes, a pair of guests were seated before us, and then the waitress at the front said we could have a seat at the table near the back of the restaurant which was a 5 seater table. We settled our things down and got into our chairs, and were looking through the menu, when a different waitress wizzed by and started asking us to move a seat down so that she could seat two people at our table. I informed her that we asked to not share a table, and said that the other waitress knew this. That waitress who seated us was present when I said this, and she did not say anything to that other waitress to acknowledge this, or to accept the blame/responsibility...She just walked off to the front of the restaurant. WTF. Next, the waitress who had just told us to move our seats over, rudely told us that we must share a table at this time (which was noon). The attitude and tone of her voice was so appalling. No apology whatsoever from either of the ladies. It was not like there was a queue of people waiting to be seated. Is it not first come first serve? Jesus. Or how about you try shooing away some of your customers who are still eating at their tables so you can seat some more people. Absolutely terrible customer service...

They just lost our business right there. As we left, the waitress at the front asked a pair of guests that just entered if sharing a table would be okay. Why are they bothering to ask such a question when they are forcing their customers to share tables? Servers at Sam's Congee Delight think they can treat their customers like shit, well so be it. Never coming back here again despite the food being good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves this place. Service is quick, servers are friendly and the food is spot on. The only thing is that on the weekends it could be quiet busy and you can expect to be waiting for about 15 minutes at least."}
{"text":"The place is a tucked inside a mall near pacific mall... The price is low for the food that is served. The food is really good.
We had congee + noodles + dough fritters+tofu+ Beef 
For all 4 of us we paid 28.00 Tax included...
The only thing we didnt like was the squid... was super rubbery and wouldnt recommend it ! 
Service is ok .... A bit difficult to communicate in english, but the service was quick and attentive!

Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite congee place in town! Sam's Congee Delight (???) is a small, cozy restaurant located inside Market Village that serves affordable Hong Kong styled comfort food.

This place opens 7 days a week. It has a very fast-paced environment... definitely reminds me of the breakfast joints in Hong Kong! It is ALWAYS busy, but people usually just eat and go. So the wait time is not long at all, even if you order take outs.

I come here often when I crave for congee or when I'm really sick - it is my kind of comfort food comparable to chicken noodle soup in our western culture. Not only are their congee served hot and taste good, all other items on the menu are delicious and made fresh to order!

Must order the steamed rice rolls (plain or with filling) and the deep fried dough stick... or get BOTH combined together :D All great items to go with your congee!

Please note: Don't be afraid to sit with strangers at a larger table! It is the norm in Hong Kong, so it is not weird at all lol. The staff often politely ask if you would opt to sit with other people at the same table - just say YES!!! Usually if the restaurant is busy, I tell them right away that I don't mind sitting with others at the same table. It just makes their job easier and you get to your food faster :)"}
{"text":"Bomb place. When we want Sam's Congee my partner drives to the Market Village entrance to drop me off so I can run to take a number while he parks because you bet it's always poppin'.

I have tried virtually everything on the menu but I'm gonna have to recommend the faves: minced beef congee, any steamed rice roll combination but namely the dough fritter drenched in sauce, and fried noodles. Theirs' is 1 level above the best you've had at another restaurant.

It is cramped and hectic with bodies moving behind your chair every second. If your party does not take up every chair at your table, expect to share it with other people. Staff are screaming things I don't understand. No problem. You get your food served in no time at all and once finished you don't even want to sit and digest. You want to pay and get out of there so you can say you survived Sam's Congee's morning rush. The staff are in perfect unison despite the high stress environment, like watching Olympic synchronized swimming. It's more than breakfast. It is a RUSH. EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Service here is average considering it's just a casual Chinese restaurant.  Its almost like fast food here because you always get your order within less than 5 minutes!

Their congee is freshly made and is not watery nor thick, this is the traditional type of congee.

Rice noodles and dough sticks are all made fresh as you can see through the window on the outside of the restaurant!

I always come here for congee, it's the best in town!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic.  It's a bit hard to find because it's INSIDE of one of the malls (just adjacent to Pacific Mall if I recall correctly).

Now, I'll admit I didn't explore every single restaurant in Markham and in Chinatown in downtown Toronto, but this is some of the best congee I've ever had.  It's full of flavor, and they put lots of good ingredients in there.  You can also order those Chinese fried breadsticks and those shrimp things wrapped in that rice noodle stuff (though that I got in Pacific Mall as well at some small restaurant and it tasted good too, so it's probably pretty easy to find that well made).

I think I had the congee with everything + the preserved duck egg.  It was fantastic, and my friend was hooked as well.  Quick and easy service.

While I was there, I forgot I had paid in cash, not with a card, and asked the server for a pen to sign my bill.  She seemed confused, and it was embarrassing.  That has nothing to do with the restaurant, but it's sort of funny.

It's about $5ish for a nice-sized bowl too, so it's a great value.  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Best congee place around. Its an open kitchen and you can see them make the food fresh. The only thing is their dishes has been getting smaller since I first had this place like 5-10 years ago.

Still a great place for some congee. The seating is kind of close together if you don't mind its ok. HK Style congee."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to come back here ever since we were in the area 2 years ago! We got here around 10 right after it opened so that we didn't have to wait on line. We ordered the sticky rice, fried sesame ball, fried fritter in rice noodle rolls, fish shu mai, and dried shrimp rice noodle rolls. The fried sesame ball was different than what I was used to. It didn't have the red bean fillings. It was pretty good, though. Everything was delicious and we love the fact that everything was freshly made. We were happy the rice noodle guy was still working there when we got there. Will definitely return when we go back to Toronto! I'm missing this place already!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast comfort food. It can get busy durinf core lunch time but service is fast. Came here more than 3 times and will def come back. Their congee portion is small so better one order per person. Must get their chinese donut with their congee."}
{"text":"Time to give Yelp a more thorough review. 

Sam's Congee will always remain as one of my faves but I've dropped a star due to a multitude of different factors.

Most of the food here can be seen when they're actually being made through the window in the front. Including congee, dough sticks, and rice rolls.  
The idea is that they have a bowl of plain congee and they drop whatever toppings you order into it and then serve you right away.  Therefore the food here is quite quick.  
BUT. DO NOT come here at night as when the amount of customers lessen, the quality decreases - they cook a lot to make up for the demand of dinner hour and then use the 'left-overs' from dinner hour to serve you until closing time.
The dough sticks are somewhat less expensive than other restaurants but they also come in smaller quantities (I think they give you 1 full one which splits into 4 pieces).

I love the banana-leaf wrapped rice.  I don't remember what it's called in English; but it is called a 'Jung' in Chinese.  I usually just eat the outer edges of rice and leave the core to my mom LOL and dip them into sugar :) 

The fried noodles here is a no-no.  It comes from the back of the restaurant and I try to avoid it at all costs.

I do enjoy the little rice rolls here with the yellow mustardish sauce and the hoi seen sauce.

This is a nice, cheap, quick dinner.

AND to prevent them from closing early - the owner put up a sign that gives you a number to call if the employees ever slack off and close before the time on the door (8PM)."}
{"text":"Excellent cheung fun, fried dough, and congee.  The wait is long, but definitely worth the wait.  The fried dough and cheung fun are made fresh, and while you are waiting for your table, make sure you observe the chefs making these.  The price is really affordable.  Highly recommended!  Cash only."}
{"text":"The best and most affordable place to get congee, rice rolls (cheung fun), and fried dough! 

I like to get their pork liver congee as I find that they make the organ itself very easy to consume/tender and it seems fresh. I know...pork liver sounds bleh (and I HATE pork liver) but for some reason it pairs so well with the congee. And, of course, I dip fried dough sticks in the congee which are always perfectly crunchy, doughy, and freshly fried!

My favourite dish of all from here is their rice rolls which (the only word to describe it) is SILK. They are soooo smooth and the peanut/hoisin/sriracha sauce combo goes so well with it that you won't even realize you have consumed an entire plate all by yourself! I would come here for the rice rolls alone. 

I think we ordered 2 fried dough sticks, 3 congee, 4 plates of rice rolls, sweet cruller (my favourite because I love sweet \"bread\"), sesame seed ball, and fried dough wrapped in rice rolls and it cost us  less than $40. They have been very consistent with the quality of their food, and with their cheap prices I'll be coming back forever!"}
{"text":"Freshly cooked food and congee was delicious. Got the sliced beef congee which was gender and tasty. Service was what you expect for a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. Will miss this place when I leave Canada !"}
{"text":"Love how you can watch them make the noodles and fried bread while you wait for a table or is just passing by. It was a busy Sunday morning but waited about half and hour for a table. 

Ordered the rice noodle (with dried shrimp/ with shrimp/ with mushroom), congee (assorted meats/ beef with preserved egg), sweet dough, fried noodle with bean sprout. Going to rank them: 1. Sweet dough but I kept thinking I would get a nice round ball and realized they cut it into four pieces so it wasn't round anymore..... 2. Congee with assorted meat (most flavorful) 3. Congee with beef and preserved egg (loved the egg) 4. Rice noodle with dried shrimp 5. Fried noodle with bean sprout 6. Rice noodle with mushrooms (lacked taste even with soy sauce

Would come back for congee but peanut allergies beware because the congee has nuts in it... also while waiting I notice a sign saying they will be relocating to Woodbine St"}
{"text":"After a so so lunch experience at Congee Queen, I thought I try and make it up w/ another Yelp suggestion.  This place in my opinion will be a much better place to try and experiment during daytime.  I could tell the strength in its freshness will be better reflected during the morning/lunch crowd than the dinner since the constant flow of people during daytime will keep things fresher and hotter.  With congee, fried ghost fritter, rice roll, you got to eat them \"steaming hot\", not luke warm.  I will try again and see if I can give this one a 4 star if I can under better circumstances but for tonight, it's just an ok, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Super cheap eats in Markham area.  They have a lot of variety of congees and delicious handmade fresh steamed noodles (aka rice rolls).  The chinese doughnuts were deep fried nicely with a nice golden colour.  It is definitely a legit HK style restaurant.  It's located inside the Market Village mall."}
{"text":"The old location at Market Village is permanently closed. The new location on Woodbine is not open yet.

Edit (2018 June 23): passed by the new location today. The restaurant sign is up but inside it's still under renovation. So not opened yet."}
{"text":"The BEST congee in town!!! It's cheap, has quick service, serves a good portion and delicious! What more can you ask for?

Every time I come here, I order congee with minced pork and Chinese century eggs. Their pork is very tender and the congee is just right. Everything is made fresh. There's a window right at the entrance where you can watch them make their rice noodle rolls. 

I believe a few new items were added to their menu. For my recent visit, I ordered the Rice Noodle Rolls with Enoki Mushroom and Beef. It was delicious. I don't know what else more I can say about this place besides repeating myself of how great this place is.

I walk out with a full belly and a smile every time. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Sam's Congee was packed as usual.  And unless you have enough people for a full table, you will be asked to share your table with others.  We were 4+baby, and we had to share a round table with a single diner.  I prefer not to share tables usually, it's just kind of awkward especially since i'm eating with friends to catch up with them.  But it seems you pretty much don't have a choice at Sam's.

The prices are low here, but that's because the dishes are small as well.  So be ready to order lots of dishes.  Our first round we ordered a beef and persevered egg congee, beef and fish congee, chow mien, beef and enoki rice roll, dough fritter and beef brisket on plain rice noodle (not in picture).  The food definitely arrives fast.  I guess it's not difficult to bring out the congee when they have a giant vat of congee cooking and they just ladle in whatever ingredients you want into a bowl and pour some boiling hot congee into that bowl.  We were quite hungry from waiting for the table, so we dug in before I remembered to take a picture.  Congee topping wise, there was a good amount of beef and preserved egg.  But the congee itself, just didn't hit the spot for me.  There were extra 'flavours' added in.  I was looking forward to rice noodle.  They make those in house.  Again, quite a bit of filling, but the rice noodle was too soft.  It couldn't hold up against the filling.  Same thing occurred with the brisket rice noodle.  It was super hard to pick up with chopsticks.  It was almost like mush.  At this point, I was losing hope.  So I didn't have much in terms of expectations for the chow mien or the dough fritter.  The dough fritter I don't know for sure if they make it in house, but for some reason I'm thinking they do.  It was so disappointing.  It should be crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  It was soft inside and out.  At least it was warm?  The chow mien, nothing to write about, its just soy sauce noodles.  We did place another order for rice noodles (because we were still hungry), but same as the first round, soft and mushy."}
{"text":"This place really reminds me the way it was when I was eating my congee and steamed rice noodle roll back in Hong Kong.


Pro
- quick fast service, if you in a hurry you will be seated and served right alright 
- simple menu with different kind of congees . These congees are made by placing the raw ingredients at the bottom of the bowel and then pour steaming hot congee on top!  my favourite is the minced  beef and pig blood (I think the pig blood is the best in the area, make sure you let the minced beef sit in the hot congee to has it cook properly)
- steamed rice noodle rolls : plain, with beef, with shrimp, with bbq pork, with deep fried dough freshly made in the open kitchen in the front,
- deep fried pastries to go with your congee.. all made fresh..their seasame ball is really popular and only has limited quantities
- steamed turnip cakes, spicy tofu in garlic sauce, noodle with bean sprouts all tasted great
- great condiments: hot sauce, seasame sauce, sweet sauce, seasame seeds (you need to drown your plain steam rice noodle roll in all these!)

Con
- Crowded during weekends, you may has to share a table if you don't want to wait too long
- inside Market Village, so parking maybe a problem during public holidays or weekends
- not the cleanliess place... the floor a little sticky.. the table a little dirty.. 
- tables are packed close to each other...so don't expect any privacy
- in and out, can't linger after you finished eating
- price is quite high for the quantity of food you getting..

CASH only!"}
{"text":"I've been to Market Village SO many times since I was a small child, but I only recently tried this place for the first time. It's just this small, slightly grungy-looking little restaurant in the mall, super casual and simple, and cheap. The food is pretty okay for the price you pay for it. I went with my parents and lunch for the three of us was roughly somewhere between $10-$12, which is a steal. We shared a bowl of congee, a fried cruller thing, and a plate of plain rice rolls. My only complaint about the food was that both my mother and I found the congee to be super salty. She was positive that they overdid the MSG or something. That being said, this is a pretty good option if you happen to be in the mall and just want to grab something quick and cheap."}
{"text":"Great tasting Hand made traditional chinese breakfast. We love it. Very long wait though. Both the food and price is great."}
{"text":"What can I say? You can't go wrong here. HK style brunch resturaunt. All the food is made in house. Congee is affordable, tasty, and has many choices. Za Leung is fresh, Cheung fun is fresh and has many choices in filling. 

Everything here is very very affordable, tastes good, and is fresh. You can even eat under $10 for two dishes if u tried, and you would be satisfied- that's difficult to do nowadays.

I don't know if the prices will stay the same when they move to their new location. Hope the quality will be the same or improve in the future."}
{"text":"My friends introduced me to it and it became our go to congee restaurant. They are very generous with their ingredients. Food is affordable and filling."}
{"text":"One of my favourite congee restaurants in Markham. 

Wait time: On weekends, it is PACKED but for good reason. Try to share a table with others in order to get a table faster. I usually wait around 15-30 minutes for a table of 4 (regardless of sharing a table or not). 

Food: I always get their seafood congee with fried noodles. It fills me up completely and I usually don't eat until dinner. Their rice rolls are fresh to order and are very tasty. The great thing is that you see them make it so you know that it is fresh to order. 

Service/environment: Being a busy chinese restaurant, it is very much a in and out restaurant. It is noisy as well so don't expect amazing customer service. 

Overall, I am a huge fan of this place for the food and the value. The only downfall for me is that it opens at 10am and I am an early bird that likes to eat breakfast at 8am. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm no longer enchanted. I used to love this place. I didn't go often, but this place was THE place for good, cheap eats. It's still really good, but there are other restaurants closer to me that I find equally as good.

Just so you know, there's a minimum requirement of how much each person needs to spend ($3.50). I hadn't remembered this rule in the past, but that's probably because I had ordered enough for them not to mention it. Not the case this time, but I wasn't put off by them telling me I needed to order more. 

As always, the rice rolls were brought fresh to the table. That's one of the best parts about this restaurant - you can see its employees making your food as you wait. I know it's probably not that exciting to most people, but I think it's interesting nonetheless. It gives this place charm. 

I think at a certain point I realized that rice rolls were just rice rolls, and I could get them at a variety of restaurants for relatively the same price/quality. This place is still good and has a special place in my heart, but it's no longer the place I eye as I walk around Market Village.

Solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I really like this place for congee and fried dough sticks. Almost every time we're in Toronto, I go here for a fix. Everything's so affordable and so delicious! The plaza that it's in is being torn down though and most the shops are already closing so hopefully they relocate somewhere else and keep it going!"}
{"text":"It is okay la, but not as good as Original Congee that was located in the food court of the T&T supermarket at Steeles and Middlefield which sadly closed."}
{"text":"Toronto is a popular destination for Chinese New Yorkers looking for better Cantonese food, and my family has visited every other year or so for some time.  Sam's Congee Delight has been a regular pit stop for breakfast at least once per visit.  Located inside the Market Village mall, its a brightly lit, clean, no-frills establishment with two major specialties: congee and steamed rice noodle rolls.

Their congee is excellent, with good consistency and flavorful.  My favorite is the pig's blood congee; the pig's blood (not legal and not available in the United States) bobbing in the congee as large cubes, tasty and very smooth.  Other congee (preserved egg, assorted seafood/meat) are also very good (since the base ingredient is very well prepared to begin with).  They also prepare the steamed rice rolls to order, so they're usually very fresh, smooth and just the right texture.  These can be had with a long list of fillings.  They're great without fillings, plain rolls doused with a mixture of hoisin sauce, peanut sauce, hot sauce, and sesame seeds (bottles at every table).  I like them with beef also.  Had them this past week with beef and enoki mushrooms, a combination that works although the rice rolls were not as good as I've had them in the past.  Another popular combo is with the fried crueller, especially if that was just freshly fried.

Their front window is fully glass so you can watch them make the steamed rice rolls (a pretty cool process) or frying cruellers.

For a quick, cheap, Chinese breakfast of congee and rice rolls, this place is a very good spot.  Can get quite crowded on wkends so expect a line during the morning; wkdays you'll walk right in."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite congee restaurant in Markham. Like others have mentioned it usually gets really packed during the weekends & be aware that you probably have to share a table with others. The service is super fast, literally all of my food arrived within 5 minutes and they were all steaming hot! 

Food: 5/5 
You MUST try the minced beef congee (#101 on the menu; $4.08) literally the best congee here! Like the description, there is chucks of minced beef (like mini meatballs) and some lettuce, green onions and peanuts to top it off. 

Any rice roll is amazing because they make it when you order it! 

Value: 4.5/5 
The quality of the food is great, but the portions are smaller than regular congee restaurants like Congee Queen. But this is reflected in the cheaper prices! Be warned though, the prices creep up since you'll probably order 2+ dishes."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl and it remains the go-to place for HK-style rice porridge, rice noodle rolls, and fried goodies.

Over the years there have been a few competitors that could almost give them a run for their money but for some reason, only Sam's has survived.  Sadly, this place is very far from where I live and parking at Market Village/Pacific Mall on weekends (only time I'm free to come here) is a nightmare, so I rarely get to have my minced beef rice porridge fix. :(

Iconic HK dishes to try include:
*minced beef rice porridge (SO good!)
*sliced fish rice porridge
*or, my favourite, a combo of the two
*kidney rice porridge
*kidney & beef meatball rice porridge (\"boat/junk rice porridge\")
*fried fritter sticks
*fried crueller (\"ox tongue pastry\")
*fried sesame balls (they are huge, thin, and have no filling - my favourite!)
*turnip pudding
*dried shrimp & green onion rice noodle rolls
*shrimp/bbq pork/beef/kidney/fritter stick rice noodle rolls"}
{"text":"There are only a few times in a year I feel like eating congee.(sick or hot/cold )The day I went here wasn't one of them. I was in Market Village one day running some errands when I realized I forgot to eat breakfast that morning. I was walking by some of the restaurants and the only one I saw that was busy that morning was this restaurant. 
I was intrigued, so I walked in and got a table. When I walked in it felt like I was in Hong Kong just due to the setup. 
I was quite hungry coming to this part of the day so I ordered some congee, fried noodles, and some dough fritters wrapped in rice roll. Honestly this is the best congee I've had in Toronto. I usually have trouble eating congee, but this one is that good.
The service is fast due to the fact that it is congee. Definitely worth a try for any congee enthusiast"}
