{"text":"Très bon ratio qualité prix.  La carte est assez simple mais tous les classiques sont là.  La salade à la mangue est excellente."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Toronto and looking for a place to eat close to our hotel. The outdoor patio caught our eye and we were able to snag a table.  The wait staff spoke English and we placed our order without any difficulty.  We shared the mango salad, shrimp roll appetizer, Madame Thai beef dish and pad Thai.  The food was excellent and the timing of the courses was impeccable and unhurried. The wait staff were very friendly and attentive.  Will definitely return if in the area again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, refined flavours, great variety of vegetarian options, very cool decor, nice patio. Great sangria too! Excellent service. We went as a family but it would be great for a date too."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant à déménager sur la rue Saint-Charles. C'est probablement le restaurant thaï le plus savoureux de la région de Montréal. Je recommande: général thaï et les légumes aux buf Madame thaï.  Les soupes sont ... à se rouler parterre!!!"}
{"text":"C'est simplement le restaurant Thaï le plus savoureux que je connaisse et le service est sympathique. Les prix sont correctes pour la qualité. Je le recommande chaudement! Je suis aller déjà trois fois et je suis toujours heureux de découvrir de nouveaux plats."}
{"text":"Pour souper vers 20h un soir de semaine, la place est remplie à 15% seulement. On m'assigne une place. Au bout de 5 minutes, la serveuse me donne le menu et prend ma consommation en commande. 10 minutes plus tard, pas de consommation, pas de prise de commande, pas de serveuses sur le plancher, le néant... J'ai quitté sur le champs craignant un interminable souper."}
{"text":"This was a spot my bf and I stumbled upon in the summer while we were waiting to go to the LaRonde fireworks and I'm so glad we stopped here! And we've been back since so that's what a great discovery it was.

I am a Thai food fan and I'm used to the rich, sweet/salty red curry sauces and spicy dry beef and Madame Thai didn't exactly offer what I was expecting but it was so delicious! I would say it's a lighter side of Thai that I didn't know existed.

For starters we tried the veggie dumplings one time, and the red curry dip another time and both were delicious. Without knowing what to expect I was very happy with the bright flavours.

Their Madame Thai beef bowl is incredible. It's savory but with sweet background notes it's a different flavour but it is just delicious! It's a great signature dish and the portions are great for the price. I've also had their pad thai which was decent but I think I would choose more out of the ordinary Thai dishes here because the flair they add to their dishes is just great.

The drinks are properly priced, I tried their iced tea with alcohol in it (a first for me) and it was really tasty.

Overall I think this is a great choice if you're looking for something different without going to Montreal city proper, the service was great and they really know their dishes so if you're not sure ask. They're very happy to help you pick one of their awesome dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there while on one of his business trips. Granted that we are from New York (which has so many amazing Thai restaurants) Madame Thai was definitely a great choice. The decor is very simple and clean cut. The customer service is amazing. Being that the main language spoken in Quebec is French we only spoke English. Our waiter was fluent in English which was a major plus.  The food is absolutely amazing. Very flavorful and cooked to perfection. If I was ever in Quebec again I would definitely stop in."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: I loved the aesthetic of this restaurant. It's a nice mix between a cafe-style and cozy restaurant ambiance. The place is not too small either which is nice.

FOOD: Flavour wise, this place was great. However, it was WAY too salty. They could have used half the salt amount that they put and it would have been fine. Both the soup and the main course was overly salty. I got the Madame Thai beef dish and it was delicious but portion could have been slightly bigger.

PRICE: Not too bad but definitely overpriced. Noodle dishes ranged from 14-16$ (you can get the same thing elsewhere for 10$ usually). I think the dishes should have been bigger for the price we paid but since its a \"bistro\" type, I guess this is normal.

SERVICE: The staff was very friendly. They were quick and efficient. No problems here."}
