{"text":"Great lunch food, very reasonably priced.  My colleagues and i eat there regularly. Im disappointed they don't offer all natural, grass fed, or organic meats.  As a smaller butcher, they should offer a selection for customers looking for a higher quality product.  The rest of the store is good though, lots of beers, sauces, rubs, wines, and other items.  I like it, just want higher quality meats!"}
{"text":"Gibbs offers barbecued ribs in the summer on Sundays. I called and inquired the day before, if I needed to place an order. I was told no, that was not necessary. If they were busy, I may need to wait a few minutes, but walk ups were fine. So, I prepped everything else for my dinner and drove over there to get the ribs. The gentleman that was grilling told me no, without an order I was not getting any ribs. I said what I had been told, and he just kept shaking his head. Thanks Gibbs, for ruining my Sunday dinner plans. I was obviously misinformed by your staff. I was very angry by the time I got home, so I called to talk to someone and voice my concerns. She could have cared less. Not good, folks. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. You are only as good as your customer service, and it is poor at best!"}
{"text":"It's a sausagefest Saturday.free samples of Gourmet sausages. Pu some up 4 the grill You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"High quality meat and friendly service. Stpped buying grocery store meat it was packed with water. Love this place."}
{"text":"I have never seen such a selection of sausage at one place.  This is a nice out of the way place in Columbia Station.  Their they know how to cut up an animal and they can do it at a very very reasonable price.    Love country stores, go here.  If you do not love them, then you don't deserve to taste their wonderful sausage"}
{"text":"Good meat.  However the  meat counter is always packed and there is no line.  Whoever is pushiest gets taken care of first.  Today  will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Sausage tasting Saturdays , Ribs on Sundays. I have never been disappointed in the 14+ years I've been going here. It's not the cheapest, but still reasonable, but more importantly it is SO worth it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a butchers shop outside of the grocery store. Great corner spot, even better what's on the inside. They sell quite a bit of different products. From beer to wine to sandwiches to the meat products. The sausages are a must have here. On Saturday from noon to 4; they Have sausage sampling, must try as well."}
{"text":"I have now been to Gibb's three times and deciding which sausages to get doesn't get any easier. I dare you to go to their web-site and check out their list of sausage flavors and then not travel all the way out there to try some of them.  I usually buy two different types of sausage each time and I have not been disappointed in any of them.  A couple of weeks ago I was at the West Side Market for lunch and decided to get some sausages for dinner.  I looked at the selection and began to think of the selection at Gibb's and had sausage envy.  So, I went home and grabbed my dog and took him for a ride through the Metro Parks down to Gibb's and got some delicious Reuben sausage and some Maryland crabcake sausage.  I was tempted by the black and bleu sausage (Guinness and blue cheese) but I am not a huge beer fan.  I also grabbed a couple of $2 steaks.  The steaks aren't very big and probably aren't the choicest cuts, but they're a good value for $2.  My favorite sausages so far are the huevos rancheros sausage and the honey habanero sausage."}
{"text":"Full service butcher...something you don't really see anymore. They also make a sausage for every palette, probably around 20 different varieties at any given time. Tonight I was in the mood for a steak and tried the garlic peppercorn strips and they were awesome. Gibb's is my go to for all of my sausage, steaks, and ribs. You can't get this quality or service in your local supermarket."}
{"text":"Stopped over on a Saturday because if I am going to buy some sausage, I want to taste it first.  The sausages were constantly being grilled up and there really wasn't time for them to get cold.  The service at the counter was fast and the person helping us didn't mind that we were asking for 2 sausages of everything. I will update this review once I try them all.   My only complaint is that some of the casings are not long enough and the filling was leaking out. Considering, that really isn't much of a complaint."}
{"text":"Gibbs is great. Not only for red meat, but it has the most tender chicken I've ever had. Service is quick and friendly even though the place is always busy. Always so many and unique sausage flavors to pick from. Parking can be tricky of you go during peak times. Reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Sounds like the sausages are a real treat.  Unfortunately I came to Gibbs for a Strip Steak.  The quality wasn't very good.  I would say the marbling was select at best.   It is getting more and more difficult to find quality cuts of meat these days.  Sadly the best cuts of meat I can find south of Cleveland are at Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"Gibbs has wonderful meats and other grocery needs.  They have the best beef jerky!!  Also they have great deals on steaks and sausage!  All the meat I have bought tasted wonderful thanks to my grill savy boyfriend!"}
{"text":"Love country mom and pop stores?! Gibbs is a very quaint little meat store in the small town of Columbia Station, Ohio. It is decorated with county paraphernalia like wagon wheels and farm tools! It is actually an old mill that was converted to a butcher block. It has tons of history and a real down to earth look and feel. They are a local favorite but gaining popularity due to their excellent meat offerings!  They have the best sausages I have ever had in my entire life. The chicken sausages and literally fat less and just rock! Even the pork and beef sausages are very lean and the flavors are endless. I had Conway's Irish Ale sausage and chicken broccoli sausage last night! There are so many flavors and they change them seasonally too. They also have seafood, beef, and all sorts of other goodies. Their BBQ and other sauces take up a whole wall and they offer many local sauces and concoctions! They even have some produce and other grocery items. Just a really cool store!"}
{"text":"I found Gibbs Butcher Block on the internet, and I was blown away by the number of sausages they make on a rotating basis.  I drove over 2 hours to Columbia Station to check it out.    I was a bit shocked when I saw the store exterior.  I thought that there was no way I'd find great food at a place that looks like every general store scattered throughout the outskirt towns of NE Ohio.  Well, I'm very glad I was wrong.  The meat counter is incredible.  I ended up buying the following sausages: -Korean Chili and Garlic -Blueberry -Loaded Baked Potato -Spinach and Feta -Hot Chicken Wing with White Cheddar  All of these sausages were perfectly amazing on their own.  No condiments needed.  I particularly enjoyed the Korean sausages over white rice, which allowed the juices to be collected in the fluffy rice.  The flavor combinations are creative and well executed.  The staff at Gibbs are nothing short of mad scientists of sausage.   Even better, I engaged in a 15 minute conversation with the staff.  They were knowledgeable, full of great suggestions, and amazingly pleasant.  The also informed me of upcoming flavors, which is sure to get me to make a return trip.    Keep it up, Gibbs Butcher Block.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The last Freezer Packs of meat I bought from them were obviously left out too long, turning rancid. Likely leftovers from the blackout that Northeast Ohio experienced  during Hurricane Sandy. I should have known something was up when they called me the day after I placed a large order and told me it was ready when it usually takes them 5 or so days to get it all together. While their selection is amazing, the disinterested sales staff and the bad quality of my last purchase mean I'll be taking my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bibbs for over 20 years and love their meat. What I don't like are the way Customers  behave that come there for the sausage tasting on Saturdays. These people behave like vultures that haven't eaten in weeks. They push and shove their way around the table and most of them won't move so that other people can get a sample. I doubt half of them even buy anything. I Stay away on Saturdays anymore don't want to see the worst in human behavior when offered free food."}
{"text":"Good selection of meats. Ask for special cuts and they'll cut to order. (Eg I get shoulder cut for pulled pork). Many sausages to try on Saturdays. Not all varieties work, but I like the fact that he'll try different combinations. Prices are reasonable and friendly folks at the counters."}
{"text":"Came here to get a take-out lunch on a Saturday.  I was able to place my order at the counter pretty quickly, and then had about 15 minutes to peruse the store while I waited for my order.  The amount and quality of food items in this cozy location is impressive.  Just looking around the store, it is easy to see why this place is so popular.  As for the food - very, very good.  Ordered a few sandwiches for the family, and everybody was happy with their order.  I had the beef and cheddar, which came with a plentiful amount of roast beef, nice sharp cheddar, and tasty white bread.  Also ordered some lobster bisque, which was incredible.  My only complaint was the wait time for the order (15 minutes), as you cannot see them making the sandwiches (they are in the back), and have no idea what is going on.  However, it was well worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest sausage fest in Northeast Ohio. Every kind of sausage imaginable. Incredibly creative with the meat. Go there for a tasting on Saturdays - can't be beat. Also, the filet mignon is unbeatable. I admit I'm not a fan of the ground sirloin, as it was not ground enough foe my taste, but anything else here is incredible. The pork chops stay juicy and tasty on the grill. The sandwiches are delicious (especially the chicken salad)."}
{"text":"Gibb's has never disappointed me! This place is such a gem. Whether I'm going to pick up steaks, sausage, ribs or simply going for lunch, I come back happy.  Gibb's situated in Olmsted Falls in a building that used to be a mill. It's such a quaint place and overlooks the river. On Saturday's, you can find sausage tastings outside from 12-4pm. On Sunday's, they often grill ribs outdoors. Both are amazing!!    I have been blown away by their varieties of sausage. Every time I go, I make sure to try a new flavor. Some of my favorites are the blueberry, chicken, maple, seafood, and Huevos. In addition, the ribs are unbeatable. They are loaded with meat unlike your ordinary grocery store ribs that barely have any meat on them. The steaks are great, too.   I absolutely love this place for lunch, as well. They have great sandwich options that you can order over the counter and take home or eat outside on the picnic tables. They are HUGE sandwiches.   Gibb's is very moderately priced. I would easily pay more for meats at the grocery store. In addition, there deli is priced better than the local stores as well. They have delicious potato salad and macaroni salad and I always make sure to pick up some great bakery items, too.  I will always continue to go to Gibb's for my grilling needs. I have never picked up poultry items from here, but I'm sure they're just as great."}
{"text":"What hasn't already been said?  Its worth the drive no matter where you live.  Get your ass here.  Buy sausages.  Buy beer.  Enjoy the fun staff.  Go home and grill...."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great butcher counter with steaks, ribs, craft sausages, jerky, smokies etc...  Bought the Chief Wahoo Brats today (Made with stadium mustard, beer and onions) some premade stuffed twice baked potatoes.  Have never got a bad cut of meat here."}
{"text":"Best place on in the Cleveland area for brats and sausages!  Homemade, with a huge variety of flavors--pork, chicken, even seafood!  They have open tasting from 12-4 on Saturdays.  The owner is wonderful and everyone in the store is incredibly helpful!  It is also a great place to stop and get lunch for a picnic on your way to Olmsted Falls!"}
{"text":"Gibbs is a great little country store in Columbia Station! I've stopped in on several occasions and am always greeted warmly by the staff. The deli counter serves boards head products, and has a nice variety of soups. Recently, I purchased the chicken paprikash and chicken noodle, both were yummy and perfect for a cold day! There's plenty of options for gifts, and lots of fun condiments and seasonings. They sell spices, homemade jams, spreads, popcorn and seasonings, ice cream, pies, meats, produce and so much more. Definitely stop in and check it out!"}
{"text":"So happy that I found Gibb's. I'm not a huge meal person, but I would never pass up a Gibb's sausage. I love the sweet ones and have never had a sweet one that I didn't like. The red, white and blue and blueberry are my favorites.it is nice to go on Saturdays when hey offer samples. They also offer tons of other deli products and even a small grocery store to make shopping super easy. Get there early for the best selection."}
{"text":"Gibbs Butcher Block is an excellent craft meat option in the Cleveland Suburbs if you don't want to make a trek all the way up to the West Side Market.  The shop has a very down-home, small town, welcoming feel to it as you drive up and walk in to it.  They have a nice selection of beer, wine, spices, and sauces, but you better have come here for the meat.  The offer veritably any cut of steak you could want, as well as many with nice combinations of spices such as their Bourbon Street Steak.  Also of note are their many awesome and delicious types of sausages and kielbasi from 'Extra Garlic' to 'Jack Daniels Cheddar'.  Their selections are very well priced and their meat is wonderfully tender - a great option if you're picking up something special to grill for the night or getting groceries for the week.  I'd be extremely remiss, however, if I didn't mention their Rib Sundays in the Summer.  Every Saturday from 12-4 they have grills out in front and the ribs and sauce flowing.  The prices are pretty decent and the ribs are absolutely amazing and fall-off-the-bone.  After getting one order last weekend, my fiancèe and I had no choice but to get seconds.  Seriously, they're that good.  If you find yourself having a relaxing Lazy Sunday sometime this summer, head up to Gibb's Butcher Block for a slab of finger-licking-good ribs for lunch and pick up some flavorful cuts of meat to grill out for dinner."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.  The employees are always quick to help and service customers. It feels like a family affair and a very well run shop. We've tried almost everything in their store. I recommend it to locals if they live in the area."}
{"text":"Great sausages. If you like spicy their honey habanero is the best but beware it will probably ruin other sausages for you since it's so good."}
{"text":"Quality foods (not just meats) plus free sausage tasting. I always come here during the summer and around holidays and the place is always packed. The one mistake I made is ordering the scorpion sausage which I did not have a tolerance for. Otherwise, the sausages, burgers, and fish are all succulent and I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"We drove by on a Saturday and the commotion was hard to miss!  Stopping in, Gibbs is the perfect small town butcher/grocery.  Situated along the river, it has the old world charm that the first settlers enjoyed.  Upon entering, I was drawn to the selections of cheeses, beer, and fresh produce, while not even knowing what was in store for me around the corner.    Gibbs on Saturday's offers sausage tastings.  This makes total sense because they have some UNIQUE sausages!  We ended up buying an Almond Chicken, the Cinnamon Whiskey and Banana Foster sausages.  They were incredible!  All the meat looked fresh and the selection is incredible!    There is just something about this small butcher, it makes me want to stop there for everything and anything and support a quality oriented small business!    Oh, and as we checked out, we also got an apple turnover.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been a Gibbs customer since I was a kid, but couldn't truly appreciate how great they were until adulthood.   Attached is a picture of what I think is the BEST steak deal in town. 8 sirloin steaks (pre-marinated!!) for ONLY $21. These are not cheap or petite cuts, either. You can get them in Santa Fe or Bourbon flavor. They also have 5 Garlic Parmesan strips for $35.   In addition to the steaks, there's a mind-boggling selection of sausages and top shelf deli meats.   The steak/bbq sauce selection is unreal. They even carry Yum-Yum sauce (which may or may not be my blood type) at times!!   Lastly, you don't try the broccoli salad in the deli counter, you're selling visit short."}
