{"text":"Great food and service. We have been for both brunch and dinner with our two young children and had great experiences."}
{"text":"Love love this place!! The owners are great and the food is even better! We live nearby and am so happy there is a great FAMILY OWNED restaurant so close. And now they have breakfast on Sundays.."}
{"text":"For all the five star reviews, I found this restaurant to be lacking.  The restaurant is average at best. The hummus appetizer was good, the salad weak, and the Cajun chicken pasta was extremely salty."}
{"text":"Great service awesome drinks. ...greeted by the owners. ...oh yeah great date night .. very intimate setting"}
{"text":"Was back again this past week and thought I'd write a follow up to an earlier post (which -- not sure why 12 of 13 posts for this place are hidden..?)  Anyway -- the food and service both were exceptional, again. The steak was out of this world -- and I am a bit of a steak-snob (right, you won't find me at Outback) and the sides were killer.    These folks have got a good thing going. And I'm on a mission ... to try everything on the menu.  Haven't had a bad (even a mediocre) dish yet.   Good for date night (which is usually us), business lunch (ok, have had a few of these there too) and family.  They are obviously working hard to adapt to what the community is wanting, and their willingness to be flexible (ie.. serving paninnis at dinner too, instead of just lunch as listed on their original menu) has not gone unnoticed.    Weather's cooling, and I'm looking forward to sharing a bottle of wine with friends out on their patio."}
