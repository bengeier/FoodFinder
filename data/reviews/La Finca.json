{"text":"They make a superb mocha. They grate the chocolate themselves, rather than use a pre-sugared mix."}
{"text":"This adorable little cafe was just a minute away from our airbnb during our stay in Montreal. We stepped in first thing after arriving in the city and already felt like this was the city for us. The servers and baristas were all lovely and truly bilingual, the beverages were proper for a French cafe, and the atmosphere (especially the back patio!!) made the 6 hour transit we had just taken well worth it. We never got the chance to try the proper food they serve but the croissants and pastries were well made. Highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Just down the street from the Palais de congress, I went here several times during a conference. Fantastic macchiato. Lovely atmosphere. Plenty of seating for impromptu meetings. Good wifi. Baristas seem to really know what they're doing. Checks all the boxes."}
{"text":"Loved that place! Great ambiance to study. I took an Americano along with their zucchini and spices cake, a perfect duo! And the staff was very nice and helpful. Definitely going back there again. :)"}
{"text":"La Finca is a charming space located in the region next to Chinatown between downtown Montreal and Old Port. It operates like many other workspaces where you can rent a room (comes with coffee for all) for $20 an hour. The rooms for rent are located in the back of the cafe with bright lighting and an open space with large tables. 

The other space at Finca is much smaller and more cramped. There is bar seating at the windows, a long table and quite a few smaller tables. It can get quite cold because despite the curtains they put up near the entrance so bundle up if you plan on staying for a few hours. 

I went on a Sunday afternoon and the cafe space was BUSY. There were people coming in constantly. 

The prices for La Finca are average for a cafe. The croissant I had was buttery and crisp which was ideal however the London Fog I was served was luke warm. 

At one point, I was studying with a laptop with 3 other friends and sharing 2 tables between us. The server kindly asked us to share one table instead. While I understand that it is busy and potentially possible to fit 4 people around a circular table enjoying a cup of coffee, it was not possible for four people working on laptops to take one tiny circular table so my friends had to work with their laptops on their lap. 
I understand there is a space squeeze in a small cafe but La Finca should reconsider their room policy considering there were 3 huge empty tables in the back that people could work at. Especially on a weekend when it is unlikely for work-mates to rent rooms in groups and most individuals are working alone. 

I would maybe come back when it was less busy but for now, I would avoid La Finca at peak times as you may not get enough space to do your work."}
{"text":"Super friendly people. Lovely, open, high ceiling, bright space and nice cute patio at the back. Will come back! So comfortable!"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese sandwich was delicious with roast beef and smoked meat. I wish I could have it every day. Americano was very good too -- bright tasting and very smooth."}
{"text":"J'aime ce petit café, car nous n'avons jamais l'impression d'être entassé les uns sur les autres! La décoration justifie pourquoi c'est l'un des endroits les plus Instagrammable à ce jour! La bouffe est bonne et abordable! Je recommande fortement! C'est l'endroit où j'aime venir prendre un chocolat chaud et lire mon livre!"}
{"text":"This is a great cafe to go to study or to hang out with a friend! Their coffee is delicious and they have amazing snacks and desserts. You can also grab some breakfast and something light to eat as well. There are rooms to the side that you can rent and there is a back space/porch where you can drink your coffee/tea. I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent quality coffee and attentive service. De Mello beans from Toronto expertly prepared. Tasty pastries and light lunch options (grilled cheese, tartine toasts). Bright and airy seating area with the option to rent private work rooms (20$ per hour and including coffee). I always feel well taken care of when I pop in-the baristas are always happy to chat about the coffee and seem genuinely happy to serve you! This is a must for coffee geeks and social café crawlers alike :D plus it's female owned-girl power! A+ every time!"}
{"text":"I ask the chef who was wearing a cap about wifi password on May 1 ,2018,and her attitude was so rude.maybe she was busy at that time ,but her attitude were so unprofessional. I asked her \"coud you type the password for me and she did .And after that,she throw my I phone on the counter strongly.
She need to lean about what is customer service and hospitality.
Thank you for your ruining my first trip to montreal."}
{"text":"Bon café, magnifique espace, et surtout, staff super sympa! Un de mes cafés préférés à Mtl."}
{"text":"Very cute, minimal cafe. The coffee is alright. I also had the cucumber tartine. Cucumber, nuts and onion topping over a spread of ricotta cheese on toast. The taste was refreshing and 5/5 for presentation."}
{"text":"Cest  vraiment un des plus beau café de montréal ! Par contre , j'ai commandé un café filtre et je n'ai même pas été capable de boire plus que la moitié parce qu'il n'était pas bon. 

Selon moi, un café qui sert du mauvais café c'est un  enorme probleme. 

Par contre, je donne la note de 3, car je n'ai pas essayé de latte !"}
{"text":"Très accueillant et place idéale pour travailler, discuter et prendre un bain de repos dans sa journée"}
{"text":"Cappuccino and croissant were both good, but I was very disappointed by the sandwich. In fact, we had one bite of the sandwich and threw the rest of it away. Wouldn't go back for the food but it's a great place to do work!"}
{"text":"Reasonable pricing.  Their sandwiches are delightful and their coffee is very good.  Cute decor.  I had the ham sandwich which was good, I'm a fan of pickled red onion.  The grilled cheese had some kind of balsamic on it and arugula.  It would be better with some tomato in it.  I wish I had a place like this closer to home!"}
{"text":"The Americano is fantastic. Up there with the best in Montreal like Differance and Monopole. Unlike a lot of coffee spots, this place has tasty food if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"My local coffee shop. They're so welcoming that I feel like it's an extension of my living room. High ceilings, big windows with lots of light. Tables with lots of places to plug in. They have 2 rooms where you can meet groups for meetings or study sessions, you pay by the hour but get unlimited coffee. The coffee is good and you feel like the owners are very knowledgable about what they offer. The food is all made in house and with the best of ingredients. My favourites are the yoghurt and granola or the PB toast. Husband loves his buttered chicken wrap. My only criticism? It can get a bit chilly in winter but I only notice it after I've spent hours studying in there."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful little place with really nice decor and a variety of sitting + working spaces. Enough outlets, good WiFi, and the dessert I had (the financier) was delicious. (Have not tried the food.) Overall a very comfortable place to get work done!"}
{"text":"I had the best smoked salmon tartine and hazelnut croissant at La Finca. Not to mention the cortado and the chemex!! AND the yogurt granola my friend got! Five stars! Definitely coming back again. The environment was cute and great for working and the staff was very nice. One of my favorite coffee shops in Montreal. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love! What an adorable cafe located in downtown Montreal. The decor is something you'd expect to see in Silicon Valley California, super chic and urban.  The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable of their coffees and food items and have something we've never had before- The Buttercino.  Taken from the Aussies don't let the \"butter\" deter you from trying this delicious and filling beverage.  Known to curb hunger and maintain your energy through the day the Buttercino is a delightful way to warm you up from the outdoors and satiate your taste buds. Enjoy alone or with one of their amazing pastries. The apple turnover and chocolate Croissant were absolute perfection and their flaky layers of pure goodness can not be understated.  5 stars for this coffee house based on stellar customer service, tasty coffees, fresh foods and ambience."}
{"text":"An absolute gem in the heart of downtown Montreal. Staffed by incredibly warm and friendly people, this place has excellent breakfast items, from the egg, bacon, and cheese tart to the amazing granola with yogurt. Everything is made in house, and everything we tried was never less than delicious.

I'm also a bit of an espresso enthusiast, and their single-origin shots were expertly pulled, full of bright flavor. Would return in a heartbeat the next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Cozy place for grabbing a bite, a coffee, and working on your laptop. The outdoor terrasse is a haven. Their restrooms are clean, and the water jar next to the counter is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I just had the coffee - it was good, 3rd wave. The baking smelled delicious. Everything is made on the premises. A lovely space - good for working, and they have small closed off meeting rooms to rent. Local, independent beautiful working spaces in this neighbourhood is hard to come by so this is a good shout! They have a small/ snack/ sandwich menu from what I could see - but didn't try anything. Once I try some food, I'm sure I'll be able to add that extra star ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome quaint little spot with friendly staff and a great atmosphere. I had the latte and pb & j, my husband had the cappuccino and danoise dejeuner; it didn't disappoint, all made fresh."}
{"text":"Second stop during la fête des croissants. 

I immediately liked the vibe of the place as I walked in. High ceiling, exposed brick wall, hanging plant, open kitchen, and relaxed minimalistic decor. Service was very friendly and attentive. 

They have various baked goods and sandwiches, but I went straight for the croissant. 

This one didn't disappoint. Hot off the press, the croissant had a crispy exterior and velvety thick layers. It was so buttery I overheard a gentleman on another table exclaim that there must be cheese in it. I debated getting another one to-go, but felt it best to leave on a high :)

The coffee looks good too, if their latte art is anything to go by. There will be a next time!"}
{"text":"The baristas are awesome and make a really good cup of coffee and espresso. It was my go to spot over my trip to Montreal to get my caffiene fix during grand Prix weekend.  Highly recommend going- they also offer rooms for rent if you need to have a conference room on the go"}
{"text":"Good no Great coffee. Pleasant service with great pastries to the start the day. Recommended for a light breakfast."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at Cafe Parvis we came to LA Finca. As soon as we walked it it smelled delicious and the staff were super friendly. Already we were having a great experience. Order a heavenly cream tea which literally tastes like heaven and we had an Americano, they use such aromatic beans. 

For food we order the peanut butter and jam sandwich and the granola. Everything in the granola was toasted which augmented the flavours. The sandwhich was very tastey and loaded with peanut butter and jam. 

Everything here is made fresh on the spot and in house. This place is a hidden gem and a must try. 

Thank you for everything mrs. La Finca it was a great experience and a delicious meal :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for coffee and a bite to eat. Food and atmosphere - light, airy and clean. Friendly staff. My favs were the gravlax and PB & B."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop, with amazing coffee! We also ordered croissant for breakfast, which was nice and  flakey. Nice people, nice food, nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee house.

Technically this is a \"shared office space\" so if you want to pay $10 an hour, you can rent a conference room with a projector and a big table.

Almost no one was taking them up on the deal when I was there.

Mostly it was an orthodox coffee house with a third of the customers working on line and the rest involved in groups in animated conversation.

(Being near the convention center increases the talkers and decreases the home-workers.)

The coffee is OUTSTANDING.

Net of a good base product, they have a number of high price ou-la-la brews that use elaborate technologies.

(Beakers like something out of high school chemistry class - obscure vintages from deepest darkest wherever.)

I would say fewer than 20% of places that offer \"expensive whiz-bang coffee\" have a product that justifies the price.

Here the Chemex top of the line brew really IS that good and really DOES justify the price.

Add a nice workplace, a young nerdy crowd and nice scenery on both the front and back views

And you have a first rate place to settle down to get some work done."}
{"text":"Came by to grab some hot chocolate and decided to try a grilled cheese. The hot chocolate was delicious. The grilled cheese was ok, it was a mushroom grilled cheese. All in all it was a cute intimate ambiance that I would come to again but I would stick to the drinks and not really the food."}
{"text":"I figured we couldn't go to Montreal without hitting at least one funky, trendy coffee shop and La Finca kept popping up as a recommendation. It was no less than John Catucci who finally convinced us that yes, we must try this place out.

It's a very cool and friendly little establishment. The folks behind the counter were extremely friendly and approachable, and, though I don't drink coffee, I'm told their brew is above average.

I knew going in that I absolutely had to get the Cucumber Tartine, as I'd seen pictures of it and it looked incredible.

It is.

For one thing, it's bigger than I was expecting. This is a fairly monstrous open-faced sandwich that's covered in artfully-prepared and presented cucumbers. They're lying on a bed of ricotta and the tartine also includes nuts and onions. It's a very simple yet very flavorful concoction, and had there been a patio, I know I would've enjoyed taking my time eating it in the fresh air. (The interior is very open and bright, at least.)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best coffee shops I've been to worldwide. It's in a very tastefully modern meets retro space. There is a small outside space in the back of the shop and small private meeting rooms in addition to a nice open space with a great vibe. 

But never mind the tasteful and hip space. The lattes rock and the scratch made pastries are even better. If you find yourself in Montreal, arena coffee aficionado and are anywhere near La Finca, you must go!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about La Finca! Great tasting coffee, sunny spaces to work or chat with friends and a decent but small menu if you wander in and are feeling munchy. The back deck is a bit small, so get there early if you want to claim a spot. The little work/meeting rooms are also hot spots - but totally worth the time to get one to hang out on.

Only issue perhaps is the price of coffee. Not cheap! If you are a princess about your coffee though (looking at you, Aussies!), you will probably really like the beans they use and they way they draw a proper cappuccino."}
{"text":"The rhubarb chausson and the sandwich poulet were amazing. They use coffee ice cubes for their iced coffee. Yummy and cozy place with unique items and great attention to detail. Everything just right."}
{"text":"Generally I won't go to this place again. The food is average and they don't allow customers to use laptops unless in specific area."}
{"text":"Great vibe, friendly staff and a good, strong cup of coffee, but the large cup size could be bigger!"}
{"text":"Vraiment sympathique comme café! 

L'accueil a été très chaleureux et enthousiaste. La dame à la caisse aurait des leçons à donner à bien des gens qui travaillent avec le public.  Gardez le sourire chère dame!

Tout ce que l'on a essayé était délicieux; croissant déjeuner, bol de granola et gâteau aux carottes. 

Le café est très bien aussi.

Il y a possibilité de louer des salles pour travailler à 20$/heure (café inclus pour tous). 

Avec le Café Différance (pas de faute d'orthographe ici, il s'écrit avec un \" a \"), c'est l'un des meilleurs cafés du coin. 

J'aime!"}
{"text":"Needed a place to catch a quick bite and follow up on some emails.  Good food, fast service, nice people.  Check it out if you are in the neighborhood and need a quick meal and meeting place."}
{"text":"Cute cafe right next to the Airbnb I stayed at. 

Great pastries, coffee, and decor! I loved everything about it!"}
{"text":"I went here to study and it was terrific. The London Fog was delicious and I highly recommend it. Additionally, they have rooms available for rent that make great work spaces. I also had the brownie pastry which was very good as well. Prices were reasonable and overall if you need a place to get some work done with great service, Finca is the place to be."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here as I was walking by to grab a quick cold brew to go. This place is straight out of Bohemian-Chic Instagram photos and well worth the stop to see a beautifully-designed space. The coffee was good and the pastries looked fantastic too. If I lived in Montreal I would come here to work and be inspired."}
{"text":"Great space with lots of light just off de Bleury. Had a solid cortado and an interesting grilled cheese with caramelized onions. Love the plants and decor, and the open concept kitchen. Definitely a happening place, great for getting some work done on a Sunday morning and participating in a bit of people watching.

Coffee prices seem reasonable for this neighborhood. Not somewhere I would cross the city to visit but definitely a solid place to grab a coffee and read."}
{"text":"Delicious Danoise Déjeuner and chocolate croissant  topped with a hot chai latte. 

Great atmosphere. Friendly courteous service. Clean and spacious. Reasonably priced. 

Overall, a great first experience."}
{"text":"This is my favourite cafe in Montreal! It's so quiet here (though it's getting busier now more people know about it) and you can book a meeting room if you want guaranteed seating (which costs a small fee). 

The tea comes in big teapots so you get great value for your money, and the selection of food they have is fresh, healthy and delicious. 

The wifi is really good too ;)"}
{"text":"very tasteful small café with good coffee and good options for breakfast.  it is simple and small, but it does a good job of feeding you with good food and coffee so that you are ready for the whole day! definitely wanted to go back again some day!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee shop with a delicious breakfast pastry and very fair prices."}
{"text":"I love the vibes at Finca and going there in summer is best because their terrace, um, rather a backyard (?) is really charming. I love how la Finca offers isolated workspaces for people to work quietly. The café has beautiful decor and provides a great ambiance for studying, working and relaxing. The staff there is also very friendly and the service is quick. I didn't try any of their food, but when I looked at other people having lunch there, seemingly they offer quite a variety of light lunches that are very appetizing. The coffee is good and not expensive, I loved this place so much!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu has a picture so you know what you're getting, the coffee was on point and adorable foam design."}
{"text":"Cozy and cute cafe!
I took an ice americano but it was quiet acidic which I wasn't quiet a fan of. Aside from the coffee, this place is a great place to study (which I did), or just chill. They have a stair area where you can just relax/read a book, office spaces and pretty good wifi as well. They offer some food items, and I heard they make there own delicious chocolate which I plan on getting next time. Definitely planning on coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Located just north of the Old Port, La Finca is just one of the many shared office spaces popping up around Montreal. There is great lighting, high-speed wifi, and good outlet access. Live/fresh plants are in every corner and on every table, and they even have cute reading steps with pillows!

The coffee is a tad expensive but the latte art was truly phenomenal. My friend enjoyed her chocolatine and the other aromas emanating from the kitchen were heavenly - I'll have to give it a shot the next time I go."}
{"text":"La Finca est ce genre de petit café à la mode ! On y retrouve une ambiance chaleureuse et on peut se poser seul pour travailler ou entre ami pour se raconter son week-end ! On apprécie la maîtrise du café ! Ils sont capables de vous faire tout les types de café en connaissant le bon dosage de l'expresso... un bon point pour le barista en place ! Le serveur est très gentil et on apprécierai l'accueil !

Propose divers petit déjeuner fait maison en passant par le traditionnel yaourt au fruit, la tartine au beurre de cacahuète et confiture! Moi j'ai apprécié un feuilleté fait maison au bacon, fromage et uf au plat ! 

Verdict j'aime beaucoup :)"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for the weekend and loved this place. The cappuccino was one of the best I've had and the tartine gravlax was so good I came back a second time for it. Everyone that worked there was really nice and we didn't have any issues getting the WiFi password like another reviewer did. I'll definitely be coming here again next time I visit."}
