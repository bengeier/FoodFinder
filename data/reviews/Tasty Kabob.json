{"text":"One of the best middle eastern restaurants in town, and the beef kobaidah kabob is extremely delicious and juicy that melts in your mouth. I could never have enough of it"}
{"text":"We went there with high hopes & but got disappointment.
Many of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice. Even meat items had no taste. We felt it too costly for the quality we got.
Desserts were okay."}
{"text":"I used to come here in the nineties, when Mike and Betsy owned it. They were Persian and the food was inexpensive, authentic and delicious. I went in after they sold the restaurant and after inquiring, found out that the owners were Lebanese but that it was still Persian food on the menu. The food was good but not great and the prices were higher. I went in again (for the last time) a couple of years ago and I was very unhappy with my visit. I ordered the food in Farci, the true names of the dishes but the very young waiter did not understand. He went back and a woman appeared and ask that we order the food as it appears on the menu. I had not even looked at the menu knowing what I wanted right down to the appetizers. I was embarrassed as I looked at the almost unrecognizable menu. I would have left but my adult kids were excited to eat here again. I brought them here all of the time when they were kids and it was more for memories sake that we stayed. The food was still only okay. The prices were ridiculously expensive. I'll stick with The Persian Room if I'm going to pay those kind of prices."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very nice service and awesome music and nice desert. We tried both chicken and lamb entries, they are cooked to perfection and very tasty. Joojeh kabob is my favorite and game hen tenderness is excellent for kabob. The homemade dough, which is a spiced butter milk is very tasty. Aash, Persian soup is excellent. There are lot of restaurant's in the valley should learn from these people how to serve the food, they are second to none. The Persian ice cream is a must try."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service.

I love their chicken kebab wrap (it comes with DELICIOUS tzatziki sauce, and the meat is soooooo moist and yummy). 

5/5 for the best Turkish/ Middle Eastern food in Tempe."}
{"text":"This private little Persian eatery serves up some fresh, albeit traditional, fare along with a healthy dose of friendly service. The hummus was good full of nutty, lemony goodness but was overshadowed by the garlicky goodness of the eggplant dip. I called it baba-ghanouj but the owners insisted on eggplant dip. I sat at the bar and the service was prompt and polite except that the conversation was steered political by the owner, a direct violation of bar stool rules and a slight affront to myself ,a former barman. Who isn't talking politics these days? Any way, they did gouge me on a couple rum and cokes for my friend at $8 a pop. The beers were OK. This was strictly an AA meeting- alcohol and appetizers.  Next, we tried the grape leaves, a straight-forward staple at places like this. We finished up with some tabbouleh and the special pickles which were really good dipped in the hummus.  I will say we went on a Friday and it was dead, Pita Jungle was way busier in the same shopping center so the price range might be a little high for students. However the meeting went as planned and I left happy.  Check it out then head over to the hookah bar across the parking lot."}
{"text":"one of the worst koubideh kabab I've ever had in my life..
I beg you not to even give it a shot
it is way overpriced (compare to what they serve!"}
{"text":"Of all the middle eastern restaurants we have tried this is the best.  The flavors of the food were great.  The meat and chicken were very high quality.  Try the special rice (polo) dishes, especially the one with barberries.  My favorite was the lamb kabobs.  If you get a plate with rice and salad (you can get all rice but it would be a lot of rice) ask for the salad on a separate plate.  It is a very good salad with excellent quality greens and an Italian type of dressing.
The Persian ice cream was great.  Baklava is different from other versions but really good.  The eggplant appetizer was also very good.
This is clearly a family run place and this is a very welcoming and gracious family.  Service was wonderful.  We had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great place.  Better than the more popular chain resto (PJ) next door."}
{"text":"Simply the best Persian food in town! I used to live in Los Angeles and frequented the many lovely Persian establishments in Westwood. My favorite dish has always been tahdig (crispy rice) with fesenjan (pomegranate stew). I tried tahdig at another Persian restaurant in town and it didn't meet my expectations. And then I found Tasty Kabob. The tahdig is absolutely legit and I regularly get take out (worth a 15 minute drive from another city, holla). The family that owns the restaurant are lovely and treat their regulars like family, as well. Support a great family-owned business and try their fabulous food and hospitality."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place to fulfill my Persian cravings since I moved to Arizona. It is a bit pricey unless you go for lunch but one thing I can say is that it is worth it. The joojeh kabob (cornish hen) and the bargs (chicken and filet) are always very well marinated, tender, and never dry or tough. Each dish comes with a great helping of hot rice which I also love. The cucmber yogurt dip is a must. Love this place, worth the extra dollar if you want a great Persian treat for yourself."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I may have given it a 5 star because I was hungry, but the food is just so good!  I couldn't try the ice cream since I am so stuffed!  I shall return when job takes me back to Tasty Kabob!"}
{"text":"Always greeted by the owners when I go in (I don't know them personally) service is friendly and the Persian food is exceptional.  Hand made Persian ice cream is the best way to end the meal.  Looking forward to my next visit there, I believe it will be my 5th."}
{"text":"This place has great food but the prices are a little on the expensive side and the wait staff stand around as though they're prison guards watching you."}
{"text":"I've been craving good old Persian Food---

The owners have always been very kind and generous-- genuinely inviting you into their restaurant to enjoy some great food. I got the koobideh plate to go alongside some grilled chicken and veggie skewers. The koobideh  for some reason was slightly dry this time around but the chicken was perfect...
I will miss this place when I move to chicago"}
{"text":"Came here to eat persian food with family. I was amazed how good and fresh the food tasted. Their kebabs and appetizers were delicious and they had friendly service."}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area, this is can't miss spot for me.  I have been eating here for about 10 years with no complaints.  I can't find something on the menu I haven't tried and loved.   I wish I liked closer to make this my go-to spot.  

This is a local family owned business, unlike most restaurants nowadays.  The couple works the kitchen and the dining room everyday they are open to bring traditional home cooked meals.  As I spend half my life in airports, it is a refreshing change.  I have spent many hours speaking to them as a solo diner and can't wait to see them next time I am in town.  

Make sure to leave plenty of room as the portions are large and you will want to devour all of it.  The \"barg\" is actually beef filet that is cut to small pieces, so it is super tender and flavorful.  So while the price might look high, its for top quality meat.  Leave room for Persian ice cream, as it is not like any flavor you have ever tried.  

I routinely bring customers here for dinner because of the inviting atmosphere, great food and excellent service.  I even have many of my customers returning without me and thanking me for introducing them to this restaurant and Persian food.  The only place I know to get better Persian food is in my mom's kitchen... but that is on the other side of the country.    

Stop by and say hello to the owners for me.  If you start a conversation with them, they will treat you like family!"}
{"text":"This isn't just middle eastern cuisine, it is the only Afghan place in town, and it is amazing!!!  I have only been to the lunch buffet, but it cannot be recommended enough.  They have lots of good food, and I really love the baked pumpkin dish and the baked eggplant dish.  It is similar to Indian, but different in a way that I cannot describe.  You must go!"}
{"text":"Clearly one of the best Persian restaurants in AZ. The food is fresh and quite delicious. The prices are great too.
The owners are really nice too!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranian / middle eastern food in the valley. Great menu, variety, great flavors, wonderful atmosphere, very reasonable prices  and you will feel at home with family. Coming from someone who knows authentic middle eastern food, this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week, more if I can possibly make it.  The chicken kabob is unmatched!  The food quality is always consistent, and always the highest quality.  Pita bread and hummus are a must."}
{"text":"A very cozy and nice place to have lunch or dinner. Highly recommended. Vrey friendly and kind host... :-)"}
{"text":"At the ripe old age of 22, I have literally been coming here for 15 years. Tasty Kabob has been an instrumental part of my childhood, and contrary to one particularly scathing review I saw around here regarding their pita pizza, it is DIVINE. I have been eating it since I was seven. You don't exercise that kind of loyalty lightly.

The owners are beautiful people. It's a wonderful space!! And if you're looking for some killer koobideh in the greater Phoenix area, go no farther. :)"}
{"text":"Tasty Kabob is a must see on any Hookah bar tour. They serve food, coffee and alcoholic beverages for those of age. In addition, the Hookahs are top notch. Now on to the food! Ever had Saffron Rice or Chargrilled Steak, Chicken or Pork? Try any of the Kabob platters, very good!  Also they have the best Persian Ice Cream which is only one flavor....what is the flavor??....(its a secret, you will have to go there and find out!) Prices are moderate for a dinner for two, atmosphere is casual enough to be a great first date place (attention cheesy guys) and they are rarely busy so cosy dates can become sweet and innocent. 
For persian cuisine in the East Valley this place is a must."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a whim for take out yesterday and am extremely impressed. The woman who greated me and took my order was very friendly and not at all concerned that I came in close to closing hours.

I ordered the beef kabob dinner plate with half salad and half rice. I also treated myself to an order of the Persian ice cream. When they prepared my order, the cook seperated my ice cream from the dinner plate (since the dinner plate was hot) and even put it on ice for me in a ziplock bag. They definitely went above my wildest expectations with their level of service.

When I got home the dinner plate was still steaming hot and obviously prepared fresh. I'm a huge steak fan and don't generally enjoy sirloin, but the preperation of the meat was perfect. It was tender, juicy, and extremely flavorful. The spices were great without overpowering the flavor of the cut of meat. It also had just the right amount of charbroiled flavor like it was cooked over a coal fire. Yum!

The rice was possibly the best long grain rice I've ever had. So good.

The salad wad tasty too.

Also? The Persian ice cream? It was like ambrosia. I'm not even exaggerating. 

The dinner portion was huge, which left me plenty for dinner tonight, though I must admit that it was difficult not to devour the whole plate on first taste. It was a struggle not to over eat, considering how amazingly yummy it was.

Yeah. I'll be back again, this time with friends!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten the food here, so this review is only for the ice cream.

Pistachio and rosewater ice cream. Come on. Yes.
There needn't be anything else said."}
{"text":"Excellent food at really reasonable prices. We were starving and I wasn't looking forward to a long wait, but the food came out super quickly. Good service and friendly owner."}
{"text":"Nice music, lighting. Indoors and outdoors seating. Waiters stood around like secret service agents. Food had slight char, but otherwise delicious. Would recommend my friends."}
{"text":"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent. 

What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob."}
{"text":"We went looking to have them cater to our party. I had not been there in years, and I remembered them to be good. But what they gave us did not taste anything like Persian food. The koobideh was very dry and I don't what kind of spices the put in there, but it definitely failed. The chicken was also fail. It is quite expensive too for what you get. Not going back."}
{"text":"I just had lunch with a friend at Tasty Kabob and did it ever deliver on taste!
We both had chicken kabobs with salad skipping the rice for the calorie savings. Honestly at $6.50 for the quality & quantity of food was amazing. The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning. Delish!! The service was excellent and there were only a hand full of tables being used. For some reason next door Pita Jungle was packed and I can't image why? There food is ok,very trendy tho. 
There is a menu outside, but it is so formal looking. They need to get a sign posted outside stating that \"lunch specials starting at $6.50\" that would get the folks in the door. If you truly like good food...get over to this place and give it a try....excellent!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Tasty Kabob for over 20 years.  It is, without question, my favorite restaurant in the Valley.  Homa and Hossein are wonderful and take great pride in what they do.  Over the past few years, I have invited several friends and co-workers to go with me and they all enjoy it as much as I do. 

As far as the food is concerned, I love the chicken kabob.  You will not find better chicken anywhere.  It is cooked to perfection, tender, and incredibly flavorful.  The lamb and filet are also phenomenal, cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  Their sandwiches are an amazing value and the hummus is amazing.  I have specific \"go to\" items usually involving chicken and rice (and I always get an extra rice to take home because it is that good).  After 20 years, and probably eating there at least once a week, I still crave Tasty Kabob.  

The restaurant is incredibly clean, well decorated, comfortable, but also classy.  The ambiance is perfect for a date.  They have a very nice patio, which you don't expect if you look at the front of the restaurant.  The staff is attentive and polite.  If you are looking for a unique restaurant, with a great atmosphere, impeccable food, and a good value, look no further.  Tasty Kabob is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I went here right off the train I was starving after work. I ordered their Pita pizza because their vegetarian selection was a joke. It was terrible and the marinara tasted like ketchup. Their cheese I'm certain was of the string variety. I also didn't enjoy the old cook judgmental watching as I ate, he probably owns the place and thinks he's amazing."}
{"text":"The food is below average and takes so long to finish, an OK location. Sometimes they don't do separate checks."}
{"text":"The food didn't worth the expensive price. Kebab was not tender and fresh. My first experience in a Persian restaurant in Phoenix was not good, compare to Persian restaurants in California."}
{"text":"Ordered lamb kabob rare-med rare, came our well done. Friend had chicken that was over cooked and very dry, was only one other person in restaurant so can't blame being busy on issues.  Too many other options in the area to bother trying again."}
{"text":"Simply asked for an itemized receipt for my order and apparently this was seen as disrespectful? I was given back the most snippy tone and still was not given an itemized receipt. Essentially saying the receipt I was given was adequate enough. Probably one of the worst customer service experiences. Owner should learn how to treat customers and people in general if she cares about her business. Would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Consistently high quality and fresh food with generous portions.  Family run and very engaged with customer service and quality of food.  Try the homemade ice cream!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! We've been coming here for years and the food quality has been consistent, along with the generous portion sizes as fair prices. My husband and I mainly order the kabob options, along with koobideh- always so flavorful! The basmati rice is delicious and always perfectly cooked. Their baklava is amaaaaaaazing- my only complaint is that I wish that portion side was bigger- it is addicting! Great place if you're looking for something casual, relaxing and with the feel of an authentic, home made meal!"}
{"text":"I should have come here every night this week! In Phoenix for work, I always try to sniff out a good Mediterranean restaurant and this one is it! I can't believe how good it was... Everything was perfect. Great service, meal came out within 10-15 minutes and I asked for the salad to not touch the rice or meat and they put it in a little bowl for me. Prices are very reasonable and the vegetables I ordered on the side were fantastic. The only recommendation is to make the salad taste more like greek salad. It was just plain. Other than that, nothing but compliments. I will definitely be back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.

An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.

For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.

For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.

For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.

So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not."}
{"text":"Average overpriced food, relatively slow service...  located next to pita jungle I give the owners credit for being there that long watching pita junle getting busier while tasty kabob is completely empty. Nerves of steel for sure lol  plenty of better options out there for med food just look on yelp....
Also if your vegieterrian good luck, litle to no options...
Lower you prices and improve your quality tasty kabob med food is not a novelty anymore like back in the 80'."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a little kid. Very clean on the inside and the wait staff is extremely attentive. Every thing I've ordered here has been off the walls. The Fensanjan, Tilapia, Mezza Platter, Vegetable Kabob, and Aash are all delicious. The basmati rice with saffron is to die for. Especially the pilaf with Lima beans and Dill. Consistently Exquisite food and service, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet place, servers are very polite & attentive.  Food is very good, although rice portions sometimes seem a bit excessive-don't like to waste food.  My favorite is the lamb shank, also the kebabs are quite good.  The Persian ice is a family favorite, but unfortunately they were out this night.  Only other negative was refilling my mother in laws Sprite w/ water, a simple mistake as all the glasses are the same-fixed promptly.

I would recommend this resturant to anyone seeking good, reasonably priced middle eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food!  If you've been to Pita Jungle and want something a little more authentic to middle eastern region, than you'll love Tasty Kabob.  My wife and I lived fairly close to the restaurant so we would take-out at least once a week.  My personal favorite is the beef and lamb kabob, and my wife would almost order the Greek Salad w/Gyro Meat.  The food tastes fresh, and they don't over do it with spices and salt.

The service is always great and you'll most likely have the owner of the restaurant serve you.  We liked this place so much that my wife and I did our rehearsal dinner there.  Oh yeah, did I mention that the food is very inexpensive!

If your in the mood for middle eastern cuisine and are on a budget, be sure to stop in!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restraunt in the valley! Koobideh with basmatti rice, tadig and must o mussier are my faves! The food is amazing it's a must that you try."}
{"text":"If only Tasty Kabob would relocate to the bay area and help fill the Persian food void! This is my type of place:

First and foremost, Tasty Kabob has good, well-executed food. We had shirazi salad, musto khiar, ghormeh sabzi, joojeh, koobideh, zereshk polo and the rose water laced Persian ice cream:
The shirazi had a slightly different spice combination that what I'm used to, and came with lime wedges so we could apply the citrus ourselves. I liked this fresh, slightly different version of the salad quite a bit. 
The musto khiar was generously portioned, well mixed and delightful (thrilling me to no end, as musto khiar is one of my absolute most favorite foodstuffs). 
My Ghormeh Sabzi was delightful-- tangy and flavorful with spices that were mixed in with a deft hand; ghormeh sabzi can, at times, be victim of overwhelming spices, but this version did not suffer. 
The kabobs were both well cooked and nicely seasoned, although I felt the koobideh could have used a little more spices. Regardless, both versions were moist and very appealing. The zereshk polo we ordered with the kabobs was also well cooked, and laced with a generous amount of barberries.
Finally, the rosewater ice cream, with pieces of pistachio, showcased the fragrant, delicate taste of rosewater exceedingly well. We were stuffed by the time the ice cream hit the table and downed the bowl all the same.

Second, the owners couldn't have been more charming. The party at the table next to us was at TK for an anniversary celebration, and TK's owners went out of their way to help the celebration along. TK's owner later told me that the couple being honored-- as well as their children-- had been coming to the restaurant for years. The owner was clearly very fond of her customers, and they reciprocated the feeling.

Finally, TK is located in a strip mall that includes Planned Parenthood, a vegan-friendly pizza place, gelato, and 24 hour drive-through Mexican. Perhaps you're the type that only likes fine dining. I personally have found that some of the best food around comes in unassuming strip malls with eclectic neighbors.

In all, I'm glad my impulse to seek out Persian food as soon as I leave the bay area guided me to Tasty Kabob. While I'm only in Phoenix once a year I'm sure I'll be back to this tasty eatery as many times as possible."}
{"text":"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best."}
{"text":"So i have some friends in AZ but none of them wanted to hang so I ended up hear . The pizza is like the size of Jacksonville ,Fl (largest city per sq ft. in the U.S.)it takes like 10 min to eat one slice ."}
{"text":"My friend Dean turned me on to Tasty Kabob.  Everything is great about this restaurant"}
{"text":"I asked the female owner for a recommendation or a suggestion of something popular and she replied that it is all good and that it didn't sound like we were ready to order. Dang. I really like recommendations and guidance when I have never been to a place before. And i really like friendliness when my sister and i are one of three tables occupied in the whole restaurant. 
I ended up getting the ground beef and onion koobidah. They were ok. I definitely wouldn't return for them. I liked the green salad a lot - yummy dressing and fresh cucumber!  Rice is rice. The hummus and pita were good. My sister liked her gyro plate."}
{"text":"Rude owner has alienated us as customers. I have frequented this establishment many times for lamb kabob or lamb shank, both of which are delicious. I have enjoyed this restaurant as a regular patron over the years. However, I will never visit again after my most recent experience. My husband and I, along with another couple, stopped in for a scoop of their delicious pistachio rose water ice cream. The owner was angry and dismissive once he realized we were not ordering a full meal, telling us that he is \"not an ice cream shop.\" We offered to leave, but he said he would \"allow us to order the ice cream,\" but told us that cost of the ice cream meant he was losing money on serving us. Let me be clear that a scoop of ice cream costs $7.00, which we were not complaining about. My friend (who was with us) is a chef and understands ingredient costs, but agreed that discussing this with customers is unheard of. We should be able to walk into a restaurant and order an item a la carte.

Also, the restaurant was empty except for one other party of four people. It was not as if we were taking a table from someone who was waiting to eat. After reluctantly serving the dessert, he continued to explain in a rude manner why he did not like serving dessert without an entree and how he was making an exception. It made  the entire experience extremely uncomfortable and unenjoyable for my husband, my friends, and me. He then gave us the check  ($30 for four scoops of ice cream, so not a small bill) and sarcastically thanked us for understanding and told us he would not make an exception next time. This will not be an issue since none of us plan on returning. We tipped the waiter, who looked extremely embarrassed. It was not his fault that the owner was so rude.

Other reviewers have written that the owner pays to remove negative reviews, so it will be interesting to see if this review is even published."}
{"text":"Three words: Persian Ice cream......   The best of the best and I don't even like typical ice cream but I CRAVE this one!  Staff is amazing they make you feel like you are right in their home cooking for just you!  Need I say more..."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch. Good Persian Food, great service, nice and clean restaurant. My chicken kabob was very tasty. Will go back for more!"}
{"text":"All the positive reviews are from the owner. Overpriced. My meal came with half of a raw onion. Seriously what I am going to do with a raw onion? I had a kabob dish which was mediocre but definitely not worth the price. Made my stomach turn 30 mins. after eating it. The place is a ghost town, I should have taken a hint. MedFresh off Mill is way better."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I am from Los Angeles where we have the best Persian food. Coming to AZ has been VERY disappointing. I guess because Persian restaurants here lack competition they can slack in flavor and quality. BUT NOT HERE. This ranks on the top of my list for Persian food here. The owners are so friendly and everything is fresh and tastes good. WAY BETTER than the Persian Room in Scottsdale. If you don't believe me, go try their food. Also they make homemade Persian ice cream that is phenomenal. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant is decent. I've not had a bad experience taste wise, but the service I experienced the last time was so bad, i would never want to go back there again. (This was around dec 09). I don't think the person serving me was a member of the serving staff; she was likely the owner or the manager, and treated me like some beggar who came asking for scraps from the street.

- I was seated and pretty much ignored for atleast 15 minutes, no water, no nothing. 
- When my order was taken, it was with such contempt, I thought I was being served by the queen of Iran . I ordered my entree, but before I could add a drink, she decided that she could only write so much on her piece of paper, so she walked off. 
- She was really nice to the 8 person table next to me, filled with well dressed old people. I presume she gauged my youth, my lack of a tuxedo, and solitary presence as a sign that I was not going to be a major contributor to her profit that evening. Of course, I decided to fulfil her expectations and did not tip her. 

That was a fearful dining experience, and God help those who work with her, especially the servers/kitchen staff.

One of piece of advice for the management of Tasty Kabob: if you are going to behave like Persian royalty, don't go into the 'service' sector, where you have to serve customers. Now I understand why the Shah of Iran was overthrown in '79. It was probably because he had siblings like you whose obnoxious behaviour drove the humble Iranian people into the arms of raving extremists in the Islamic Revolution. 

Friends, I would recommend Persian Room in North Scottsdale instead. Their clientele is also well to do, but they welcome every one, even folks like me, with kindness, good service and good food, and I happily pay the higher prices."}
{"text":"If your business says you are open until 9:30pm, then you should be taking customers.  If not, lock your doors.  We arrived at 9:15pm and asked if food was being served as we could sense a hesitation in the greeting.  She went to \"check\".  Afterwards, another woman came out (the head honcho) and told us, \"We can serve you, but you'd have to be out by 10:30 (with a straight face and looked us in the eye).  My friend looked at me to see what I was thinking.  I was already on my way out the door.  

That was highly disrespectful.  There is a way to talk to people.  Just say your kitchen is closed.  I don't tolerate ANY level of disrespect from ANY establishment.  So maybe your business is doing THAT well that you feel you don't need new customers.  (I don't think any business is is in that position, especially nowadays).  I don't care what you're serving up in there, no thanks.  There are way too many places to eat...pause."}
{"text":"Rude service. She actually told my Mother in law that she's going to eat what she brought out instead of what she ordered. There was confusion about chicken combo vs. Chicken. Rude comments throughout dinner. Food was good but not good enough to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here as a child & now I bring my own son here. I've had just about everything on the menu & have never been let down. The owners treat me like family so it makes the dining experience even better."}
{"text":"I've been there numerous times now, and I am always amazed at just how good the food is.  Huge portions, wonderfully seasoned.  I get the chicken barg soltani and it is amazing. It comes with rice and a salad (or just rice if you prefer).  We always start our meal with some tadiq with gheimeh bademjan.  Making good tadiq is an art form, one which this place has mastered.  The yogurt salad (yogurt with cucumbers and mint) is stand-alone delicious, but I prefer to have it on my food.  And for dessert try the Persian ice cream.

If you've never had Persian food you are missing out on some wonderful meals.  There are numerous vegetarian dishes, also.  Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Persian food is known for subtle, well crafted delicious  food. Tasty kabab fails off the bat. This place used to be one of the best in Phoenix when it opened. It has changed hands many times and getting worst. Besides the sub par food, the tired decor and bad service make a visit to this place a mistake. When I asked the owner for my tea, she even snarled and said when she gets done with her paperwork. By the way, the tea was never delivered. There are many better Persian restaurant choices"}
{"text":"Very nice food. All of freshly prepared. We tried tasty kabob special for myself and my daughter. It was a very big serving. 
My wife ordered the chicken polo that was also very nice. 
Starters of hummus and Baig an were ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Our favorite Persian food place! Always so tasty and fresh even at almost 10 pm in the evenings right before closings! Which is usually when we drop by lol. And it's still always a warm welcome! 
Everything we have tried was always delicious!
The owners and staff are always friendly and nice, and always open to chat when they are not busy with other customers! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"THE very best Persian food and service in Tempe! 

With 25 years experience this restaurant's reputation certainly speaks for itself! The care and attention to detail in food, service and customer satisfaction is above and beyond.  

Surely, a place that family and friends will love and a staple for Tempe's foodie culture as well.  There's not an item on the menu that isn't worth trying. And when you try something you;ll be sure to want to return soon, for more.  Especially the dessert....If you have a keen palate w/ a sweet tooth, then the homemade Persian ice cream or the homemade cheese cake awaits your inevitable order. 

Do yourself a favor and try it. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the menu either, the staff is very knowledgeable and the owners are very warm, friendly people as well!

P.S. Lunches are very busy so before arned &/or call ahead to reserve!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE TREATMENT OF MYSELF AND MY 70-YEAR-OLD MOTHER! DO NOT VISIT THIS BUSINESS!

As a businessman, I hate writing bad reviews for businesses and this is the second one I have ever written in my whole life! 

But I tell you with no hesitation that I would have given them not even one star if I could and I'll tell you why!

A friend recommended this place for having good food so I wanted to take my 70 year old mother there. I called on a Sunday at 1:00 P.M. An older man answered and said they were having a private party and if we went we had to sit in the balcony. I asked if it would be hot and he said that it was shaded. I asked whether I had to have a reservation. He asked when I wanted to go and I said 4:30 P.M. He said it is OK and that the later you come the better. His exact sentence was: \"I don't want to promise something I can keep.\" Thinking this man was so honorable and nice, I drove from North Scottsdale to Tempe, about 25 Miles one way. When we got there about 5:30 to have complied with his statement: \"The later the better\", an extremely arrogant woman who was in charge and seemed as if she was part owner assured me that they couldn't help us and we had to leave! I told her I specifically talked to someone but she kept saying: \"Who did you talk too? No one had promised anything to you.\" I told her I was not crazy but she kept saying sorry, no one promised anything to you. Suddenly, the man with whom I had spoken appeared. I asked him about it and after saying hello and asking me how I was doing, I asked him what the heck was up and he just stared at me!!!
 
Now, I am not expecting anything except some measure of humility and kindness to be apologetic about a mistake they made and to make me drive over 50 miles for nothing, but no! The arrogance was unbelievable!!! 

I understand that mistakes happen and all I wanted was some sincere apology which of course did not happen. Anyone else would have at least tried to make things better for their own ratings sake. Maybe just be nice and offer me a glass of water for all that driving but no!

Fair warning to smart readers of Yelp. I am a busy man. If I sit and take 10 minutes of my time to write this, you know how angry I am at their behavior today. 

DO NOT FREQUENT THIER ESTABLISHMENT!! 

MAYBE THEY LEARN SOMETHING!"}
{"text":"The restaurant atmosphere is peaceful and friendly. The owner was so friendly and helpful and polite answered questions about the food and it's contents. The food itself was amazing very flavorful and delicious all in all great place to eat 10/10."}
{"text":"A very cozy place. Excellent food :-) owner is very respectful and freindly. We orderes shish kabab and chicken with rice... 5 star service"}
{"text":"In search of similar and different cultured tastes, I came across this place. Walked in for a late lunch. Ordered the Chicken Shish Kabob Soltani with grilled onions, tomatoes and salad and a side of rice for $16.95 as a lunch price since it was a weekend. Plenty for leftovers. Another good dish is the Chicken and filet combo dish for $15.95."}
{"text":"The food here is really good here. The staff is friendly and the place has a nice ambiance. The Chicken Sish Kabob is recommended. You can have your food with saffron rice or salad or half and half (both). The salad is absolutely delicious!

A little warning about the Persian ice cream though. It is vanilla with pistachio bits, saffron and rose wash so it will taste like you're eating perfume. If you are not into unusual tasting food, then don't order this. 

If you have an adventurous side and want to try this, I can say that after 3-4 bites of this ice cream, the perfume taste gradually becomes less noticeable. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Tasy Kabob is awesome! Super fresh great food and wonderful customer service! If I lived near them I would be fat and happy eating there daily! Cant wait to go back! Thanks for the great food and service! You guys are a hidden treasure sort of speak ."}
{"text":"The pictures make it look much better than it is. The seating is very small and simple. Not a fancy setting. Their borani starter dish was not as good as others I have had elsewhere and it was very oily! Their meat tasted a bit funny as though it was not fresh. Overall I was not too impressed with this Persian restaurant. Also they were playing french music which totally put the mood off for Persian food! 
For me, I have had Persian food in London, Vancouver, LA, and authentic homemade Persian food and this does not come anywhere near a high standard :("}
{"text":"Bad service. Cold food. Not even a smile from the servant or the owner lady. We asked her to warm the food for us and she started complaining about our request saying \"don't you see how hot it is?\" OH HELLO it doesn't matter, coz we didn't like the way it feels when you provided it. Finally we had to wait for 15 minutes for the check even though we asked for it. The the ugly servant came with the check and just dropped it on the table without even being polite to some extends. 
Totally not recommended restaurant. You could find a better place for the price you gonna pay here with bad service.
Waste of mood. Waste of time. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Food is great. i had dinner once there. A little bit expensive."}
{"text":"I'm new to Persian cuisine but I truly enjoyed my visit and meal here! We ate dinner around 7:30PM so it was dark outside and the restaurant had mood lighting. The appetizer, Spicy Beans, was tasty and satisfying! The portions were generous and the service was first-rate! We didn't have room for the Persian ice cream so we will try that next time! The establishment was clean and they play Persian music.

They have a full bar and outdoor seating.

I will be back! A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Don't know why this place is 4stars when the lady who works here is the rudest person I ever encountered in a restaurant. We are not from the area but stopped by the nearby boba place and were hungry and wanted to get a quick bite to eat. No one else was in the restaurant and we were their only business at the time for a to-go order but they treated us like garbage after we asked for forks and she made a huge deal about it so then we offered to pay for It but she STILL gave us a nasty attitude. They are Plastic forks not forks made from gold lady!"}
{"text":"Great food!! The Tadiq is my fav. Love the Cornish Hen also. The kabob and steak kabob are awesome!! Yummy !!!"}
{"text":"Lamb and rice.  Not bad but surely nothing special.  Rice and lamb bland.  Onion mostly raw.  About $20 a piece.  Not sure that it doesn't deserve a mere two..."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Wonderful hosts. Ambience was great. Thumbs up  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This is a 5 star Persian  Restaurant  on Apache and Dorsey. I am lunching with a friend."}
{"text":"Family run, excellent meal, quiet restaurant, good wine.  Excellent hummus. Had the filet and lab kabobs. Meat was very tender and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just wonderful! The owner approached me and had a little chat when I told him how great his kabobs were. I am so picky with kabob places and this is definitely one of the better ones I've ate at! You can just taste the quality of their spices. The meat was tender and juicy and the veggies not too burnt or undercooked. The only other server there besides the owner was so attentive that the minute I finished eating he bussed my table. I just had the most perfect experience here and will be returning often to give them business! The owner is a great guy too and very hospitable!"}
{"text":"Sunday 3pm, seated immediately. We got the hummus, feta platter, chicken kabob platter and chicken/beef koobideh. Hot and delicious. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I thought this place was very good and its a nice change of pace from my usual eats which is mainly Italian food. It has a nice atmosphere and good service, the kabobs were delicious along with the rice. I will certainly go back again and leave with a happy full belly too."}
{"text":"While the name of the place which seems to imply that this is a run-of-the-mill Middle Eastern food place, its far from that. It's a cozy, elegant (not luxuriously elegant, but elegant nonetheless) restaurant with friendly service and tasty yet inexpensive food. It's definitely a place where I would bring visiting guests to eat when I show them around Tempe."}
{"text":"Came in from Toronto where we have lots of Persian restaurants. This place is hands down the best. Better than any Persian restaurant I've ever been to. The prices are amazing too. Under $10 for a hefty filling meal. Try the lamb shank. It's amazeballs."}
{"text":"we started with the cucumber, tomato, onion and parsley salad which was amazing. it was super fresh and so tasty. our waitress told us they don't chop the veggies until someone orders it. 

i had a chicken kabob (some of the best chicken i've had in...maybe ever) and an onion kabob. freaking so good. the onion was nice and charred and it was so much food.

my sister had the chicken kabob with the basmati rice that had the berries on top. she said it was ridiculously good.

by far some of the freshest food and most flavorful food i've had in awhile!"}
{"text":"Oh Tasty Kabob, I wish you were closer to where I live.  I have been going to this place since 2005, my husband and I used to be there at least twice a month.  Now with the twins, it is a lot harder to take such a long trip.  I cannot have enough of the Fesenjan, it is a delicious stew, the complexity of flavors is amazing, we always have it with chicken.  Another item we always order is the Tadig, ahh, its crunchiness is magnificent.  I am salivating just thinking about it.  And one item you should never miss is the persian ice cream.  My husband has to order his own, I won't share."}
{"text":"Ok so I had just arrived in Tempe and was staying at the Days Inn across the street. Someone recommended that Iunch at PJs. Well I, new and innocent, went to PJs where it was bustling! It took forever for someone to come to my table (actually I waited over 5 minutes and the waitress never came), so I left. And I walked the plaza and ran into the lovely Tasty Kabob. 

Let's just say I've never looked back. I've eaten here 4 times and all 4 times have been nothing but great! Hummus, saffron ice cream, bean soup, pitas, and I love the mom and popness of it all---truly gracious owners and down to earth wait staff. Really love the authentic Persian cuisine!!! I prefer to sit out on the patio and you know this place seems to attract a really friendly set of people! 

Seems to be a shared sentiment---sad that PJ's overflows while tables sit empty at this little gem. Give it a try for an authentic Persian dining experience. I miss independent restaurants like this and I'm happy to have found this one. I think I might go there now actually. Lunch?"}
{"text":"First off the name is a little fast foodish, and doesn't suit this place.  The place is very classy, aside from the name again and the small bag of lays chips they brought us. (more humorous than anything)

Otherwise the food was good, a little pricey, but big portions to match.  The Grape leaves were amazing, the meat seasoned and cooked well over that amazing rice.  The gyro, very filling and fresh.  I have grown to appreciate things that tend to not be greasy and leave you feeling great after the meal, and this restaurant definitely will have you leaving feeling great."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in Tempe we love to stop in at this place. Love the lamb and Everett loves the pizza. A little Turkish coffee and Persian ice cream makes everything perfect."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant, good food.  Our favourite - filet & chicken kabobs.  Patio seating with fans - great with a Blue Moon when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Coming from a Persian/Iranian guy, the food here is very exceptional. The grapeleaf and hummus is a must as appetizers. The kobideh or lamb kabob is where it's at.. they cooked the basmanti rice to perfection, the meat is marinated and cooked well. Get the yogurt sauce with your entree, amazing."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service, and nice owners!


Food- Chicken Kabab with saffron rice, hummus, salad, and bread.  All was excellent.  I heard the fish is outstanding, so I will be going back to order that.

Service- Server very attentive and friendly; owners came over to see how everything was, and were very nice. I wasn't sure if they had alcohol (they do), and he offered a delicious beer...from the Czech Republic!  How is that for service! 

Owners- I have been wanting to travel to Iran, and got some great info!  The owners took the time to talk and to be helpful.

My husband and I highly recommend Tasty Kabob!  Thank you..."}
{"text":"Great Persian food.   Good service and friendly too   Can't wait to go again     Try the fish"}
{"text":"Good barg kabob and lamb shish kabob. We came here 20 minutes before closing and the owner and his family were extremely nice and took our order and even gave us a free cucumber yogurt because we ordered quickly. Very good family and good food. Merci"}
{"text":"One of the ONLY Persian restaurants where the Rice to Kabob ratio is a very close 50/50 and they make the Maast-o-Moosir from real shallots, not diced white radishes and garlic powder.
On a mission to review every Persian restaurant in California and around it's borders, I discovered Tasty Kabob. I've eaten here many years ago but have forgotten about it untill I went back with a friend of mine who lives in Phoenix.
Tasty Kabob Is not a fancy restaurant, the owners spend their time and energy creating good quality, authentic food. The yogurt is thick & Maast-o-Moosir Is made fresh, daily. The quality of meat is always exceptional & the Barg Kabob always comes perfectly cooked. Juicy, tender, yet slightly crunchy on the upper 'crust'. It's just absolutely fantastic!
I had lunch here many times over the years and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Just went there this past Saturday and was impressed with the food and atmosphere. The only sad thing was how empty it was - both for the owners (who are very nice) and the people that are missing out on it. By comparison, Pita Jungle next door was packed and I seriously doubt the food is any cheaper or better, not to mention the atmosphere. We had a bunch of appetizers and ordered the koobideh as a side item - it was a lot of food. The persian salad and the hummus were both huge, enough for 3 people at least. It was fresh and delicious - try it, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and client of mine recommended this place. I'm from LA where there is a ton of good Persian food so I had tempered my expectations. Surprisingly, this place was very very good. I ordered chicken shish kabob and it was very very moist and tender. Portions were decent size and a fair price. Service was really friendly. All in all, a very solid place. Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Nice quite friendly atmosphere. We had the chicken and filet kabob and it was out of this world. Lamb shank was outstanding. The fish melted in your mouth. Best rice that I have ever eaten and the portions were huge. All 6 of us left happy and full. Wonderful staff, outstanding family owners. Love to go back again and again Thank You!!!"}
{"text":"We used to come here years ago when Mike and his wife owned and operated it. We continued visiting this place even after they sold it but it was never the same. Service was not as warm and friendly and the food was not the same. We stopped eating here and chose to drive quite a bit farther because we really like Persian food. A while back my wife insisted we try it again to avoid the long drive. The service was just barely OK at best. They had a very young wait staff that lacked training on how to treat guests. The food lacked flavor and the chicken was dry. Halfway through the meal my wife agreed with me that it had not gotten any better and we would continue to drive to The Persian Room or Pars in Scottsdale as we know the food and service is always consistently good and the entrees are almost the same price as Tasty Kabob. It's too bad this place changed things. When we first started coming here there was always a wait for a table because it really was great food."}
{"text":"We were there on Saturday 5/7/2016. The fish was no longer trout, now it's tilapia, the rice was yellow but with no saffron, quantity on plates were a lot smaller. We also ordered a sharazi salad not fresh at all. This place use to be my favorite. After Saturday I will never go back. Beside us there was only 2 other parties on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Anyone who is looking for authentic, Persian cuisine - stop looking! Tasty Kabob is by far the best establishment I've been to across the country. My fiancé ordered a dinner entree of lamb kabob skewers, basmati rice and salad. I ordered a chicken kabob and kufta kabob (koobideh in Farsi, minced ground beef in English) with basmati rice and salad. There is a nice lady who greets you and takes care of your order when you first arrive; I found out later she is the owner. So when I asked for the regular kufta kabob plate (2 skewers) - she recommended I try a mixed plate instead. She was right! The mix of chicken and kufta gave it such a better taste than kufta by itself. There is a short wait time (thank God) because we had just left the gym and we were famished. Happy as hell that we didn't have to wait a long time, we devoured our plates. It was absolutely delicious, and I cannot forget to mention how huge the portion is. I just wish I took my usual pictures for my fellow Elites and Yelpers so you all can run over here tomorrow. 

And whomever ends up coming here, send me notes and post the pictures! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with my wife, she gives it a 5, I give it a 3 so combined a 4.  Very good service, nice atmosphere.  I wanted a gyro sandwich, they don't make them on Friday and Saturday at dinner so I had the Gyro plate instead.  The meat was wonderful, the rice ok as was the salad.  My wife had the fescnjun which is roasted walnuts and pomegranate spread, she loved it.  The tazaki sauce was great just not much there.  We also had the humus appetizer which was very good and came with lots of sliced pita bread.  I should mention that my Gyro plate did not come with pita.  I had to ask and then it came sliced, not easy to make a pita with slices."}
{"text":"Their food is exactly what I would expect from a Persian Restaurant. It is authentic and done very well. I have been coming here for over 11 years and the owners have always been very friendly and open to my friends, family and coworkers. 

There are other Persian food restaurants in the valley but none match the \"Local Feel\" that you will get here. It is very quiet at times and they have a variety of music from french, spanish to of course persian playing the background. 

I must include that I am not of any Persian or Middle Eastern decent and they have always been willing to explain what the menu items are and are more than willing to share their wonderful culture with anyone.

Check out the pictures on the wall and you will also see a number of famous folk that eat here on a regular basis.

Thank you Tasty Kabob for being so wonderful! See you again soon."}
{"text":"Took the family for a middle eastern treat and wasn't disappointed. Ordered  Lamb, Beef and Chicken Kabobs served family style with some nice roasted vegetables and very fragrant Basmati rice. The Hummus appetizer was great as well. Ended the visit with a round of their Persian ice cream and it was great ! I believe we were served by the owner, a patient gentlemen took good care of us.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite!!! My fiancé and I have been desperately searching for authentic middle eastern kabob with real great quality ingredients and this is the one!!! We will always order the platter for two because it is the perfect amount for a couple and only $30!!! THe service was attentive and friendly and the restaurant was very clean and the decor was beautiful! Thank you for a wonderful evening out Tasty Kabob!! Oh ya did I say the food was great?!"}
{"text":"Ordered baba ghanoosh.ohhm missing in action was the yummy roasted eggplants.
Clean though student housing setting.
Off course a bit $"}
{"text":"For Persian food this place is my all time favorite for years. I love their acsh soup so soulful, textural tasty and warm, my choice for comfort food. My 2nd special must have is the garlicky eggplant briani which is just ........ orgasmic, what else could I say. 
The husband and wife team are always there. There staff changes often but as long as the food is consistent I'll keep returning. 

I also enjoy the Persian ice cream with saffron and rose water which voids the garlic taste a perfect ending.

It's always clean, lots of natural light and parking in the lot right outside the door."}
{"text":"Such a good place to eat.  Everything was phenomenal.  Highly recommend.  The kabob was super tender and flavorful, the saffron rice was outstanding.  Additionally the stews were the best part.  All in all, a good place to come for reasonably priced exotic food."}
{"text":"I never had persian food so I decide to try it so I want to tasty kabob restaurant! I ordered the chicken shish kabob soltani  it was very delicious the owner of the restaurant he's super nice, and the service it awesome."}
{"text":"great food. the service was good. the resaurant seating area was clean and well kept. I tried some of the beef kabobs and the rice. not bad.. even as leftovers we enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch spot.  Had the Chelo Kebab Koobideh plate and paid the upcharge to have Baghala Polo (a delicious rice pilaf with dill and lima beans) with it instead of plain white rice and wished I hadn't.  The dill rice tasted mediocre and the whole time I ate, I was hardcore eyeing the platters that went by with white rice and salad.  Would definitely order differently next time.  We also had the hummus, which was perfectly tasty, but nothing to write home about.  My lunch companions who ordered sandwiches received a side dish of bagged potato chips, which seemed both superfluous and budget.  The Frank Sinatra and Rat Pack-esque music playing in the background was also a little odd.  Although I did like my meal for the most part, I'd probably visit one of my other favorite Persian spots in the valley for dinner service instead of here."}
{"text":"It seems like everyone I know has been to this place, so it was my turn to try the tasty kabobs.  

All I can say is that I left this place utterly confused.  Service was all over the place ranging from ultra attentive to absolutely clueless.   Ordering was comical, our waiter had no idea what she was doing, and knew nothing about the menu.  They were out of multiple items including appetizer's and desserts.  The same goes for the food.  The chicken and beef were ok, yet the lamb was literally inedible.  The rice was delicious, but the pita bread was store bought and the grape leaves were from a can.  Prices are definitely on the higher end and not justified.  There are far too many better and less expensive Middle East places on  Apache Blvd as well as the Persian Room in Scottsdale for me to come back here."}
{"text":"The chicken kabob is the best by far. The seasoning is better than khaleessi rising from the ashes holding baby dragons. The hummus and pickles are the best appetizers the stuffed grape leafs aren't too bad like your feelings for queen Margery from game of thrones. Yeah so check it out!"}
{"text":"Where to start? I went with a friend. Half the tables were occupied, the others were open. We were met with stares, and the waitress rudely told us she did not have a table for us. Left us standing with our mouths open, really. Then she veered off other customers who walked behind us, and offered them patio seating. And.. again told us she had nothing available. I immediately wanted to leave. But my friend has more patience than I so... we asked if we could seat ourselves outside.
It was obvious she was stressed, And they needed another waitress. Maybe a replacement even.  Her words lacked tact, much less a friendly tone about anything. Simply rudeness with about 4 encounters before we seated ourselves.
The food was fabulous. Suppose my complaint is mostly service. Painful. Nice casual ambiance (patio), good food, good company. 
If I do return, trust that it will be takeout only. Such a shame bc the patio has a great vibe."}
{"text":"Tried this place from a party bus event. What a fun night!!! I want to do these more often. 
The owners are very friendly and welcoming. The food is fresh and delicious. If you like pita jungle and want the authentic food, then this is your place. 
They also offer Tuesday and Thursday all day house wine for $3.50. 
Will return to this place. 
My tour guide on the party bus was Ms. Cenestra Lemons. She is super fun and engaging."}
{"text":"Tuesday evening - pretty dead except for one couple already seated inside. There was 2 waiters (college kids) and the owner (she was running the cash register) and came to talk to the other couple about how her place might be closing down.  I am from out of town so I guess irrelevant but anyway, even though the food was okay - the service and atmosphere was horrendous. 

The British couple sitting in there were mid meal and the man with the heavy accent was clearly plastered. He was on some crazy rant about how \"STYUOOPID\" Americans were because they didn't support this business or Persian food in general. He kept telling the owner that Americans only like carbs, fat, and sugar and were very stupid people. He kept going on his rant and the owner, agreeing with him kept saying that she will probably go out of business  and it wouldn't be because of the food. 

Well let me tell you sweetheart, it might be a combo of both customer service and food. The chicken kebab was dry and obviously reheated. The rice was flavorless, and the onions were also old. The only good thing was the fire roasted tomato and the beef kebab. ($22)  Now, the reason you might lose business is because of drunk, annoying pricks like that man who came into rant about how much he hates American's and America and you agreeing with him. Funny how he claimed to have money and then drove off in his red 1998 Ford Fiesta. Maybe with all his money, he can invest in your business."}
{"text":"Excellent Persian cuisine!  From the tender, tasty and juicy flame broiled chicken to the creamy, sweet and aromatic Persian ice cream (homemade with rose water, pistachio pieces, and honey), this place does it right.  No complaints whatsoever, including the service, which others have had concerns about.  

Other dishes we tried included the lamb shank with basmati mixed with lima beans and dill weed and tadig (crispy rice) topped with sabzi (green vegetable and dried lime beef stew).  We got adventurous and tried the yogurt soda as well.  Everyone agreed this was a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"I have no measuring stick for what is, or isn't, good Persian food.  But, I do know that Tasty Kabob's food is DELICIOUS.  I had the fesenjan (slightly sweet and so good on the rice), aash (savory and rich, a side order portion is plenty), zereshk polo, and an onion kabob.  The kabob was a little too charred for my taste, but that's the only ding I have against the meal.  Overall, it was fantastic!  Lots of vegetarian options, which I appreciated.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For one single reason...attention was awesome!!! We were a group of more than 10 and they made a great job taking our orders and helping us to pay. 

Food tasted really good, every body left with a happy face and some, we had to ask a box as portions were a bit more than expected. I had a lamb kabob and it was really delicious!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, check! Good ambiance, check! Good service, check, check, check!  I love this Persian restaurant!!  Their meat is very juicy & flavorful.  Homa & Hossein are the best at what they do & what they do is serve delicious & tasty kabobs. I refuse to eat anywhere else that serves Persian food. You can't go wrong with chenje- the beef cut in cubes, with some sumac...yummy!"}
{"text":"Was craving Persian food for a week and I am new to Arizona. Yelped a couple of places and customer pictures of entrees got me tempted to try this place, in comparison to the few other places, on a Wednesday noon. Went for lunch special and had Sultani ( comb of kubideh- meat and chicken) and I was in heaven. It tasted amazing and it was surprisingly authentic. My taste buds are satisfied for another week or two and I ll have to visit again. Their ice cream is a must try too. I will definitely recommend this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food! It's nice not to have drive to N. Scottsdale for Persian. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Persian food. amazing food and service. try the ice cream!"}
{"text":"Tasty kabob is an authentic persian restaurant. It has a good vibe. I went there one night and we ordered Tasty kabob combo one. It had 3 different kabobs and we ordered half rice half salad. Rice and salad was plenty as it also had a pita bread. The kabobs were good. I have to try others and compare!! But I thought it was little expensive!!!
Later we ordered Bakhlava for dessert, however we were sad to see that the Bakhlava was taken out of refrigerator, so it was very bad. I have eaten many different Bakhlava in many states but it was the worst bacause it was hard and cold...:("}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Persian food but I have found anything besides Persian room in AZ that was worth going to. I was recently in the Tempe area and came across this place. 

Nice casual restaurant. Staff and owner were friendly. We got the Cornish hen, chicken and lamb kebob platter and a chicken shish sandwich. The platters were excellent. The rice seemed fresh and not like it was made two days ago and reheated. The meat was extremely moist and tender. The sandwich however wasn't that great so I would recommend staying with the platters. We also got the yogurt salad which was delicious.

Would definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"FIRST VISIT July 2016. My husband and I were very hungry after a long day out. I've never had Persian food before, and was very pleasantly surprised. He had a shish kabob chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed a lot, and I had the lamb shank. The lamb was delicately spiced but quite flavorful, reminiscent of Indian food but not overpowered by the heat of hot pepper that's so characteristic of Indian cooking. It's really hard to describe this meal because there's nothing like it. I loved the sauce that the lamb was cooked in, and the lamb was incredibly tasty. 

We also shared a salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and fresh mint. The vegetables were cut up very fine, which liberated the flavor. Everything was fresh, not just the mint. The rice that came with the lamb was loaded with dill and flavorful as well. There was a lot of it.

The owner and his son were very attentive. They gave us extra iced tea and let us linger at our patio table far into the afternoon (we were the only customers in the place). There was so much food, we took some home in a doggy bag.

Ordinarily, I'd give this restaurant 4.5 stars, only because I ate there only once and don't have a lot of experience with it. We plan to return and try other things on the menu. The owner is kind and capable, so I hope he gets lots more business.

SECOND VISIT May 11, 2017:  I downgraded my review to 3 stars after my second visit. The food was mediocre. The shish kabob was cooked too much, very tough and almost inedible. A young man (the son?), rather than the owner (the father, I believe), waited on us, and the difference in service heavily declined. The food was unremarkable. The salad, which I'd assumed would be a Persian staple of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and fresh mint, cut up small, consisted of a few leaves of iceberg lettuce and tomato slices. I don't need to spend big bucks eating out for what I can easily throw together at home. 

Also, this is an aside, but my dining companion, who ordered a sandwich, got a package of potato chips on the side (as he did the first time). This is cheap, reminiscent of vending machine fare. Surely a place that calls itself an authentic Persian restaurant can do better."}
{"text":"Took Mom and myself here twice, and it's always empty save one or two tables, each with one or two patrons seated.  We tried the lamb kabobs, with veggies and rice, and hummus; We were not impressed.  The atmosphere/decor is nice and it's quiet, so it's a good place to take a date or friends and family if comfort, pretty setting, and the ability to hear each other are important.  

One delicious treat that should not be missed is the homemade pistachio and rosewater ice cream!!  My mother, a very picky eater and hard to please, speaks of this not-too-sweet sweet treat often.  I'm actually feeling guilty that I haven't brought her back here.  We'll give the food another go- if it's another miss, we can always have our entrees at nearby Pita Jungle or the wonderful Haji-Baba, and then head over here for the delicious ice cream (it comes with these cute and tasty sugar cookies that add a nice crunch to the treat)!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for the first time sometime last week. I ordered a plate that said Gryros with a description saying \"beef and lamb\". I had asked the lady who seemed like the owner a few questions about other items on the menu like the filet mignon. She answered me like I was stupid. So I just decided on the Gyro plate that had beef and lamb on it. When my food came I was a little surprised to see that it was not a combination of beef and lamb . The gentlemen serving us were really nice while serving us our drinks and when I brought up the fact that I wanted something with lamb and beef separated. The woman (who seemed like the owner) came or shouting form the back \"what's he problem?\" While others were enjoying their meals nearby. I simply told the woman I thought the dish was something else. She automatically said I was paying for the dish while is disagreed. She got really upset saying that I only asked her about the filet mignon as if that was relevant or as if I was saying she mislead me into getting that dish. I responded I thought the dish had a side of beef and lamb and she responded like I was dumb and said that the dish said gyros and how could I mistaken that. I responded telling her I didn't know and she kept on saying that I never asked her about that dish. She didn't seem to retain anything I was saying. Anyways, I asked her to box the other dish we got and we'll be leaving. She kept on asking if I wanted another dosh and I just told her no and we'd be leaving right away due to the scene she made and and how RUDE this lady was. I seriously could not believe how she though it was proper etiquette to shout and argue with a customer. I don't believe the customer is always right, but the fact that I never yelled at her should be enough not yell at me. I will never ever go here nor recommend this. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Originally headed to Tempe to go to Haji Baba - but they only do takeout on Sundays and we were looking for a sit down lunch. Pulled out the trusty iPhone and found this place as an alternative. It's a shame that now I'll probably never have Haji Baba with this place being right up the street. 

My girlfriend and I each had the vegetarian platter with hummus, eggplant borany and tabbouleh. The hummus was average, the tabbouleh was above average, and the borany was OH MY GOD amazing! I don't know exactly what it is and I don't need to know - all that matters is that it's delicious. It's the perfect creamy texture with a garlicky eggplant flavor. It also came with a dollop of yogurt and figs (I think...it was some kind of creamy mayonnaise looking sauce and shreds of something tasty.) 

Service was attentive and polite - not a single eye roll or sigh when I repeatedly asked for cups of ice. One dining out pet peeve of mine - they have soda cans (seriously...my work cafeteria has a soda fountain - it can't be that difficult/expensive to maintain) and I couldn't quite get my drink cold enough. 

Portions were big enough to share (we know for next time) so we took our leftovers home and had a pita picnic for dinner that night. 

Worth the drive from downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The sabzi, chicken barg, chicken kabob, beef and lamb kabobs, yogurt salad and persian ice cream are all delicious!  Have introduced several friends to TK and they all love it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out, when we got there we were the only occupied table, the service we got did not fit that situation. But, the three stars is more about the food than the service, if it was including the service it would be more like 2 stars. 

Started out with hummus and was disappointed by the very small portion.  Not even enough for 4 people to share more than one dip. 
Which seemed strange  when the rest of their portions were too large.
 
But the meals were pretty tasty. The rice portions are huge, and so were the sandwiches. My eggplant plate tasted better the next day as leftovers. 

The cheesecake slice was also large enough to share with everyone, mango was a nice flavor, but it was frozen at some parts which didn't appeal to me."}
{"text":"The restaurant is superclean and the atmosphere is fantastic. 
The food is the real start here. I've been coming to this restaurant for number of years and the food is always great. 

Over the years I've tried number of different things on the menu and I've never been disappointed. My favorite is the Soltani."}
{"text":"The restaurant is one of the things I miss most about AZ. I used to eat there at least 3 to 4 times a week. Every single item on the menu is amazing. The owners are such nice people and go out of their way to make great food and speak to everyone who comes in to eat."}
{"text":"Raised in a Persian household, I know a good kabob when I eat one.

Tasty Kabob, while among the best Persian restaurants in Arizona, falls short of Famous Kabob in Sacramento and many Los Angeles joints. Still, it's better that any kabob I've had in New York, Chicago or London.

Still, if I have a hankerin for kabobs and rice, and don't feel like making them myself, Tasty Kabob does the trick.

If you go and have never tried Persian food, go with the kabob koobideh. Trust me."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable wait staff, a filet mignon skewer, and really nice music made for a wonderful first visit.  I'm guessing I'll start frequenting this place.  I noticed sabzi on the menu, which I haven't had in a long time...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley and I don't get here as often as I should ....but going there tomorrow with friends for dinner....I will eat light all day in anticipation of good service and great food!"}
{"text":"I just got a take out from here, the Beef Kabob. There is a reason I get take out,  I can't cook. But I darn sure could have cooked this one. I got white rice (Uncle Bens?), some meat that had been cooked on the grill straight from the cow, no spices / sauces or anything extravagant lke that, and a half onion that might have passed over the grill on the way to my takeout box.

A hint of yellow coloring that may have been either saffron or crayon, I'm not sure. It sure looked pretty but didn't taste like anything.

$18 bucks after take out tip, I wish I'd just gone to Wendy's."}
{"text":"Excellent food and consistent.   Very friendly owners.   They make you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food! Corny, Corny name!  But I forgive them. I could tell by the wonderful aroma of limu Omani (dried limes) that it would be good. I don't know if Tempe knows how good you have it, or maybe you do, but from the tadig and khoresh to the aash, Tasty Kabob is truly authentic Persian food.  If you're looking for good inexpensive thing to try, have the tadig and khoresh with ghormeh sabzi for only $6.50. It can be your meal. Plus the fun of tadig is that you can use it like chips to pick up your savory khoresh.

Why isn't this place in DC???  Aargh! Ah, well at least I found it and enjoyed it. Just like home cooking."}
{"text":"My new favorite Persian restaurant!! My mom, sister, and I came here for lunch and I'm glad we did. We were greeted by a nice older gentleman and we were seated outside. He warned us of bees, but my sister wanted to enjoy the weather since she is visiting from NY.

Onto the food. My mom ordered the lab kabab with half rice half salad, which was delicious! I don't really like lamb, but this didn't taste bad at all. My sister got the koobideh plate, which she loved. And I for the chicken kabab with koobideh plate. I don't usually like koobideh either because it has too many flavors but theirs was amazing. It has the perfect amount of spies and it's soooooo juicy! Yum! The chicken was amazing too. It was so tender and juicy. It was perfectly grilled too. The only thing that was \"eh\" was the rice. I'm picky about rice. The house doogh was excellent. I love doogh! 
And for dessert, we got the faloodeh, which we weren't charged for because they had run out of a full serving. But it was delicious! So sweet! So good. 
The service was great. The prices are good especially for how much food you are getting.
This place isn't as nice as Persian Room, but the food is much much better."}
{"text":"This place serves Iranian (Persian) style Middle Eastern food. The wife and I split the Tasty Kabob Combo...kind of pricey at around $30 bucks, but does serve 2. This combo allowed us to sample a little bit of 3 different types of meat: beef sirloin, chicken kabobs and Koobedieh (kind of like hamburger meat, but on a skewer).

This place was kind of dead on a Sunday night with just 2-3 other tables being occupied...kind of sad considering the excellent food. The atmosphere went along with the drab classical music soundtrack playing throughout the restaurant.

The only part of the experience that kind of killed the mood, the owner (who was also our waitress and cashier) was giving direction to a seemingly new bus boy and we could overhear her reprimanding him for doing something wrong. However, we could also hear her praise him when he did something right. Either way, this conversation should be out of earshot of the customers.

At the end of the day, the food is why we came here and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here after the fiasco and disappointment at the so-called \"Persian\" place Haji Baba.  Tasty Kabob is by far better than Haji Baba; it has a nice atmosphere and very good service.  This is an actual authentic Persian restaurant unlike Haji Baba; Haji Baba is an Arab grocery store with a side open as \"restaurant\".  

I had the Kubideh and Ash; Ash soup was excellent and Kubedih was good.  The rice was also good but not great and I think it can be better. 

Overall, my experience was great and will return here again for Persian food."}
{"text":"The name does not lie!! Super tasty & waaaay better than the Persian Room in Scottsdale. The food is super fresh & you definitely get your money's worth! The house wine is fantastic & the owners are super friendly...definitely worth a try if you've never been! (The picture is only a portion of what was served as I shared with a friend & we had leftovers!)"}
{"text":"+ Mango Juice | Portion Sizes

- Price | No Sauce for the combo dish | Had much better persian in bay area/cali

20 dollars for a very scantly seasoned combo dish and a juice is a bit much
Maybe I ordered wrong but I will be back to try the other stuff"}
{"text":"Seasoned well, but dry.  Take a kabob, go to Pita Jungle and drown it in tahini and taziki.  Now that's good inter-restaurant ideating."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, the manager was angry and screaming and was being very rude when we asked her about the meals, never going there again, she was screaming at all the waitresses."}
{"text":"Went to TK specifically to try the pistachio ice cream. They were out. Then I asked what other dessert I could try instead (read: I want to spend money in your establishment), I was told I could only get dessert if I ordered other food as well. 

And they promptly lost a potential customer for this inane rule."}
{"text":"Visited Tasty Kabob on the recommendation of a coworker and was pleasantly surprised.  Started the meal off with the stuffed grape leaves and some hummus.  The grape leaves were stuffed very plump and proved to be just as delicious as they looked.  There were 8 total and I definitely rank them a great \"bang for the buck\" as an appetizer.  The hummus was good, just good.  A little bland and a little thinner than my liking and I wasn't too overwhelmed with the portion size.  My lunch entree was the Gyro Platter, which was literally phenomenal.  The oversized plate seemed almost too small to contain the generous portion sizes provided.  The platter came loaded with a generous portion of fresh, dressed salad greens (more of a spring mix), a huge portion of long grain rice topped with some saffron infused rice.  The gyro meat was a mix of lamb and beef, shaved thinly and folded alongside some seasoned onions and tomatoes.  What impressed me the most is that, for once, the meat was NOT dried out, as I have found in most Middle Eastern restaurants.  All this for less than $25 (two appetizers and an entree).  The seating was good, the music was very good and the service was great (perfect timing and very accommodating).   Overall, this is an easy recommend if your looking for good food & good service at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Let me clarify, the 3 star rating is only because of the lack of too many vegetarian options. I say this bcs with the kind of food they serve they can easily pull off other good veggie options like their competitors. I was forced to order an appetizer for dinner when I was so hungry, for the lack of options and a side of saffron rice, which wasn't as good as say med fresh grill or Phoenician cafe! 

My friends absolutely loved their meat dishes, but love to c some better veggie options. Like the name suggests, I m sure u guys can make tasty veggie kabobs if u can :) the pistachio ice cream was good. Check the photos section for some pics I posted. 

But the service was good and the owners were very nice to us too, maybe bcs we were in a big group and seems like they felt we were from some review team, hence the extra love(maybe? :p). They were also keen on splitting the check without much fuss, even though they screwed up a few checks, maybe bcs we were in a big group.

One of my biggest pet peeves is when servers come to take away your bowl of food before you are done eating, agreed there were only some tiny scraps in there, but that is always uncalled for. Happened here but no biggie. As I said the rating is solely for lack of too many veggie options"}
{"text":"Found this tasty restaurant while searching for persian food. Loved the appetizers(maasto moseer, Shirazi salad, and kashke bademjoon). Also, tried their kabobs and stews. Everything was so tasty good! The best Persian restaurant outside of California!!!"}
{"text":"Had koobideh with basmati rice. Rice was flavorless. Koobideh also flavorless not enough spices. Family members said chicken was basic. Also ordered hummus, it was not good at all. Not the best middle eastern food, wouldn't recommend or come again."}
{"text":"Tasty Kabob is so very tasty!  If you thought you didn't like Persian food, this place will definitely make you think again.  They have the best hummus EVER.  EVER!!!! Just thinking about it makes me wish I had some right now with a warm pita. 

*Sigh*

And while I can't eat a lot of what's on the menu at Tasty Kabob since I'm a vegetarian, I do enjoy the pitas, vegetables, rice and that delicious Persian ice cream. 

The food isn't pricey, but it isn't super cheap either.  Depending on what you order, you'll probably spend $30-50 for two people."}
{"text":"Authentic Persian cuisine at very reasonable prices. After you have their saffron scented basmati rice, you'll realize how lousy the rice is at most middle Eastern restaurants. I love the tadig with a choice of three stews. My ex boyfriend's grandmother translated tadig as \"rice in the shape of a pot\". Basmati rice is partially cooked, taken out of the pot, then the pot is oiled and cooked at low heat so that the bottom layer of rice gets chewy, crisp and delicious. Pair this with a fragrant pomegranate walnut stew with chicken, or a beef stew with greens cooked with dried limes for just the right amount of tart. Finish it off with their rose water ice cream and tea with hard sugar cubes. Yum."}
{"text":"Persian Cuisine has a special place in my belly.  I love middle eastern food when it is done right.

Tasty Kabob is a paradise for vegetarians and carnivores, and I often visit this place in the unnatural company of each.  

It is a sit-down restaurant, the service is good, and they have take out if you are staying in.

All three of their stews are fantastic, and everything I have ever eaten there has been a delight."}
{"text":"This place sure is Tasty! I was introduced by some classmates with a big craving for Middle Eastern food! I really like their beef/lamb kabob combination with rice and salad on the side. It's fresh and I would absolutely eat here more often if I lived close by! The portions are big and I really enjoyed my meal and the service here!"}
{"text":"Apparently Haji Baba isn't open on Sundays, so we decided to hit up Tasty Kabob instead of calling it off and heading home. The little parking lot in a strip mall off Apache was bustling with activity, so I hoped we would be able to score a table easier than we had tried for a parking spot. I don't like waiting for the first meal of the day. I turn into the reckapotamus from Hell, whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld. 

But there wasn't a soul to be found enjoying a Tasty Kabob...it was a strange Twilight Zone of inactivity. Everyone and their mother was next door at Pita Jungle, but just because there are a lot of people there doesn't mean it's any good, just that they prefer to flock toward mediocrity, like sheep, or lemmings.

Halfway through the meal, I was thinking about flocking too. 

Although the hummus came with olives, chopped tomatoes and herbs, it was a bit bland overall. The pitas were warm and delicious though, and the combination of hummus and flat bread helped keep the reckapotamus banished to the depths. It was a generous portion for two, but I found myself munching on it just to pass the time until our lunches came, not because it was exceptionally well done.

So I wasn't ravenous when my meal arrived, but I was certainly looking forward to some good eats. Alas, the chicken schwarma pita sandwich delivered the same mediocre impression. The chicken was overly dry and not well seasoned, and again, the pita was the star of the dish. 

I didn't have the Persian ice cream this time, but I have in the past. It's fairly cheap and delicious, so if any of you out there are interested in trying a flavor that's certainly not of the 31 at Baskin Robbins, give it a whirl. I'm considering giving this place another star based on the ice cream alone...but I can't bring myself to. So consider it a 3.5 star experience overall.

I'm just glad the prices were reasonable for lunch, six or seven bucks for a sandwich. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit cheated. The ambiance was lacking as well, with generic cafeteria type seating (as stated before), and the service as attentive but awkward since we were the only people in there, so that leaves the food alone to shine. And the food isn't squeaking out any more stars from me."}
{"text":"Came with a group of people from a business seminar. The food and service was phenomenal.... definitely recommend the experience!"}
{"text":"THE BEST persian food in Tempe and maybe in phoenix area! the food is sooooooooo delicious. Owners are super nice. I recommend hummus, ash soup, all the kababs they have, geymah and the lamb shank. Also a cup of tea at the end!"}
{"text":"One of the best Kabob restaurant in AZ
I ordered Chicken Sulatani plate it so delicious. It is a chiken kabob and beef kofta with Basmati rice and union. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLATE
Great service
Great place

But its price is a little bit expensive"}
{"text":"This hidden away Persian restaurant has the most amazing chicken kebabs, paired with Persian berries."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here about once a month for a year and half now. The spicy beans and filet kabob are my go to. The salad dressing is amazing too. Pricing is perfect. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service in a down-to-earth setting.  The barberry rice, fesenjan and koobideh are all fantastic."}
{"text":"Tasty Kabob well surpassed my expectations!!  i walked in and it was exactly like the previous reviews had said about it...desolate and quiet and yes the almighty Pita Jungle (which is right next door) was much more busy. Not sure which one of these establishments was here first but these two places RIGHT next door to each other are for sure rivals. Tasty kabob is a family owned restaurant though, and the quality and taste of the food completely represents that. Everything was freaking delicious. Let me break it down for ya right quick folks::

ATMOSPHERE: place is decorated really nice inside, perfect place for an intimate dinner. They had Persian music playing as well which i loved. The decorations, music and food all flowed together wonderfully.
SERVICE: top notch. The owners are their walking around (i assume it's them..you know they give off that owner-y- vibe) and our waitress was just a little basket of knowledge and sunshine!
FOOD: hummus was one of the best i have had. Menu is fairly large and honestly everything looked good. We had the chicken kabob and steak kabob and the meat was REALLY tender and flavorful. Order came with a MASSIVE amt of yummy rice. (also have the option doing 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad if you desire). They also did a special order for me which was not on the menu. wanted a special vegetable Kabob and they whipped it up just to my liking.. gotta love that! didn't have room for the ice-cream but hear its delish!
DRINK: wine and beer- nice selection
PRICE: reasonable. Two people, $52. pretty good for apps, two drinks and two entrees. 

give this underrated place some of your time one day if you happen to be in the area, i highly doubt that you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first thing I'll remark upon is that Tasty Kabob has the most fabulous saffron ice cream ever!  I have tried several types of different ice creams like green tea and nattou (fermented soy bean) and have gotten close to lobster ice cream (in Bar Harbor), but have never tried the delicious freshness of this nutty, flavorful treat.

I am not really fond of the name of this restaurant but it is what it is-- a tasty kabob.  And so, that's we ate.  At the start of our meal, we had some wonderful caffeine-free tea (chamomile, I believe), which was brought out in a steaming pot and was perfect.  Lovely for two girlfriends who hadn't seen each in three years and needed a good chat.  We shared a stuffed grape leaf appetizer and I must say that I have never been disappointed by them.  The tzatiki type sauce was yummy, too.  For dinner, my friend had the lamb kabob and I enjoyed the cornish hen kabob.  I was a little saddened that her lamb was a bit tough and that mine came as hen on the bone, but the dinners were cooked farely well.  They also came with generous portions of rice and salad.  As I was eating my hens, I incessantly dipped the meat into the tzatiki; they needed something more.

The waitress was very attentive and the decor was attractive.  Again, I think the name and the huge sign out front were a little corny, but good Middle Eastern food is hard to find and I think Tasty Kabob does a fine attempt at it."}
{"text":"It looks like they don't have business and robbing customers money. I came here for Chicken kabob&lunch it's mentioned 10.95$ but they added extra 8$ for side salad and total it's comes to 20$. That's very expensive for chicken kabob. 

Food is ok but management sucks and they don't know how to improve business. I don't recommend anyone this place."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The iced tea is out of this world and I would come here just for that. Spicy beans for an appetizer always pleases my husband. The kabobs have been a little tough here and there
but not so tough you can't eat them. I love the Barg and the Gourmet Sobzy.
Persian basmati rice is one of the wonders of the world and Tasty Kabob makes it so well that even my husband the non rice eater cleans his plate here.
Topping things of with persian ice cream always ends the night with a smile.
You can also take a bag of tea home with you to brew your own which is awesome. Ask the owner what the chef mixes in it to make it taste so good. She told me but I can't remember beyond.. I love it.
There is rarely a wait here and always clean.
The more we go, the more I want to return.
This is a must try for those who like to try new types of food but great also if you bring a stick in the mud that likes meat and potatoes.  You will get rice instead but I gaurantee even a cowboy will love the Barg."}
{"text":"Went here with a huge group -- in fact, we may have had the entire restaurant for the night. Service was friendly. Eating family style they kept everyone happy and especially towards the end of the meal they made sure if anyone wanted anything that was left they had their chance to take it before it left the table. The meat we had was a bit on the tough side and the chicken, which I rarely eat if at all, was actually quite amazing."}
{"text":"Food and service overall very good. The hummus was one of the better ones I have had.
We ordered cornish hen and kobideh. 
My husband really liked his meal.
The rice was perfectly cooked it was delicious.
And ofcourse the persian ice cream was the perfect ending"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the service. Chicken kabob was tasty and basic but really good. Gyro plate super delish don't pass it up. Only regret we ate too much for dessert!"}
{"text":"I was driving by and decided to stop in, my first time here. What a pleasant surprise. I ordered the small humus plate and it was enough for two. The gyro sandwich was pilled high with meat. I'm guessing about twice that of a regular place I stop at. Pretty simple atmosphere but hell the food was so great I didn't need an atmosphere distraction. I can say that I've never had such fresh and tasty humus. If you try this place and don't like the food you need a new pallet."}
{"text":"Food was ok but my entire plate (beef and lamb combo plate) had two dinky pieces of each.  I guess they should rename the place tasty rice since my entire plate was rice, for $12 I expected a little more than that.  I would suggest that you go elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Almost 20 years ordering the same thing here, the veggie kabob, half salad half rice. It gets even better  Only wish I lived closer so I could eat here more often."}
{"text":"My family has been going to the Tasty Kabob since I was in middle school. This is my first time dining there since I've had a Yelp account so here we go! 

 First off, the quality of customer care and service here is wonderful.  It is very family like business and the owners are very sweet people. 
  The food here has always been delicious and still is. 
Last night, we started with hummus and grape leaves as appetizers. I love love love the grape leaves here . I could eat the appetizer by myself! The hummus is amazing too, don't get me wrong. 
  For drinks:  I got the traditional hot tea they brew and it is so warm and delightful. It was perfect for a cold winter night in the Az. 
   For entrees : In general, the portion sizes are quite large, so be prepared to eat a good amount or ask for a to go box. The quality of the food served is superb. I have gone to higher paying restaurants and have not gotten the same quality 
My father has always ordered the Lamb shank and devours it! He says it is amazing. I like getting the chicken and lamb kabobs. 
Recommendation: Ask for half rice and half salad , unless you want rice for days which is cool too . To finish I recommend there ice cream it is light and flavorful!
So thank you Tasty Kabob for treating us to another wonderful meal.!"}
{"text":"I had the Kabob Special $31 which comes with 3 different meats.. and lots of Rice.  My favorite kabob was the Chicken,  The other two were meat Barg and koobideh which I thought were a bit dry but still tasty.  The Rice was very good.  I had a side of Hummus that came with Pita, I felt this was bit generic in flavor.  I Also, ordered the BAGHLAVA sweet $2 which felt like a crispy funnel cake with pieces of churro topped with  maple syrup, not bad but a lil too sweet for my taste.  I Also tried the Persian Ice cream which came with a small wafer and was a unique flavor which I enjoyed..  Would not return as I had better Persian food but surely works for the local craving of Persian."}
{"text":"We usually go to Persian Room but decided to give this local restaurant a try because we like to support local. As soon as we entered inside the owner started barking at us \"that's it's going to be a wait!\" when half the restaurant was empty. We said it was alright and sat down. We waited for about 10 minutes and gave a gesture to the waitress for some water and the owner yelled \"I told you it's going to be a wait!\" I was honestly shocked by how she said this. We told her we just wanted water. She was silent and the waiter then brought us water...But honestly it totally ruined the vibe of the dinner. Have some respect for people who are supporting your business. She then proceeded to attend to all of the tables in the restaurant except ours, which she visited when we were leaving. She then told us she acted the way she did because she \"perceived\" our mom was giving her a \"mad look\" and began to justify her behavior. She ultimately compensated 1 appetizer because she knew she acted erratically. We ran out of there and will never be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for some years.  Middle Eastern is something I love outside of Mexican.  Healthy, delicious, and satisfying is why we go to Tasty Kabob.  Persian particularly puts out a great healthier choice.  Thank you Tasty Kabob for making Arizona your home."}
{"text":"This was a real find from my nephew and yelp.  The food was wonderful, served hot and very fresh.  I had a stew and so did my sister.  Hers had eggplant in a tomato sauce. Mine was ground walnut pomegranate sauce. I can't remember the names. It was very exotic.  Very yummy.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant thinking... Hmm... this is the place that doesn't have as much traffic coming and going as the neighboring Mediterranean restaurant that I enjoyed so much..... Something must be wrong with THIS place.  But, because I organize a monthly \"World Tour Lunch\" group, I wanted to go to this particular restaurant because it is an Iranian restaurant...  

Not a surprise,  it seems like each one of us ordered some form of a kabob/combination plate.  I also ordered the veggie soup, Aash, and the Baklava.  I was so surprised to find that the food in this restaurant tasted so good.  I enjoyed every bite of the tender and succulent chicken and the lamb.  And of course, the objective of most of us who are doing the tour is to also try each other's food, and I enjoyed the samplings of other folks food too.

So, I've come to this conclusion, this place has to be the best kept secret in Tempe!  I can't see how people will walk pass Tasty Kabob and go to the neighboring establishment  when this food is awesomely fantastic and prepared by a talented kitchen.  In addition to the the food, I was so very happy with the service!  Any place that willingly accommodates my strange requests for lettuce in place of rice/pasta in their dishes is generally okay with me."}
