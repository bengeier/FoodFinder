{"text":"Lina's is a Calgary institution offering authentic Italian housewares & foods and also includes a restaurant serving excellent Italian dishes prepared on the premises. The staff are wonderful especially the ladies working in the restaurant. They are truly special. Lina's is now under new ownership & hopefully the new owners will keep the Market as it is including the staff"}
{"text":"Best place to get cheese in town! Lovely selection of deli meats, cheese and antipasti!"}
{"text":"If you want to stock up on fine Italian foodstuffs or enjoy a European style café meal, then \"boot\" on over to Lina's Italian Market.  They have an abundance of fresh produce, an impressive selection of dried and canned goods, loads of deli meats and cheeses, and a wealth of fresh baked breads.  As well, they boast a surprisingly vast assortment of fairly high end housewares and cookware.   I always load up on Lina's homemade pizza dough, which is reasonably priced (around $3.50 for a bag that will make two large pies) and serves as a delicious base for homemade pizza pies.  If you're feeling especially lazy, right next to the dough are premade sauces too, so you just have to drop by the deli for your meat and you're set! If you prefer to have Lina's do the cooking, you can always opt to eat in the café.  You can choose from a half dozen foccacia pizza options, numerous sandwiches, or from a host of other hot entrée items.  You can also grab an espresso or a gelato if that's your thing.  So, for a slice of the Italian good life, head over to Lina's."}
{"text":"I've always loved this market. They have a huge selection of specialty food items like oils and vinegars. They also have a great bistro style restaurant. This is the only place in Calgary I know that sells squid ink for making pasta al nero di seppia."}
{"text":"Wonderful deli selections of cheeses and meats! All sorts of imported goodies (cookies, chocolates, gelato, sauces, pastas, olive oil, vinegars, spices, drinks) are stocked for your purchasing pleasure. A variety of fresh breads are available if you go early enough (they most popular focaccia and the like sell out fast).  There is also a small section where they keep frozen pre-prepared dishes they make in-house for sale such as pasta shells filled with ricotta, lasagna, cannelloni, salad dressings, and freshly made pasta sauces (all of which are brilliant).     Lina's has a small cafe to the far left of the entrance which is great for ordering a bite of lunch or a coffee (perhaps even both)."}
{"text":"I feel as if you could spend an hour in Lina's and still barely scratch the service of what they have here! An amazing selection of fresh cheeses and meats, along with anything you might need for eating cheese - they have an entire shelf of just various fruit spreads to accompany cheese. (Cheese is a big thing for me. CHEESE).  We picked up some amaretti and gelato and they were delicious! The bakery section had even more tempting morsels but we abstained for the time being. They have great bread, a whole aisle that looked like just olive oil, another aisle for packaged Italian goods (cookies etc) and of course an aisle that's exclusively dry pasta. I even found the tiny little tubettini pasta that my Mom is always on the lookout for.   Everyone who helped us was really friendly. I'll be heading back to see what delicious things they have to offer soon!"}
{"text":"For my tastes, I appreciate what they have to offer in the olive, cheese and meat realms. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Small Update - For those of you who are addicted to San Marzano tomatoes, the Italissma tomatoes are back on the shelves. Those who were disatisfied with the EMMA product can fret no longer; the Italissma delivers that coveted San Marzano flavour in bucket loads (wonderfully sweet with low acidity). I tasted them last night and they are right on the money. Please note that the EMMA tomato problem was NOT LINA'S or MARINO'S FAULT.  They have a newer and better Portuguese olive oil that is more stellar than the previous one I reviewed, it is $19.95 for 750ml. This again will definitely please those who like stronger flavoured nutty olive oils. I still do not know what the varietal of olive is but it is much stronger than nocarella or frantoia. It delivers the taste of a premium olive oil.  A recent addition to their shelves is the Mini Italia 12 year Balsamic Vinegar. It is not cheap being $29.95 for 250ml, but it is wonderfully bittersweet with a viscosity approaching an old Oloroso sherry. Try it on strawberries, slivers of aged parmesan cheese (Lina's has the best price in the city for parmesan), or in a very ripe tomato and bocconcini salad (maybe a tad extravagant). Heck, it is so wonderful one could drink it right out of the bottle. Be forewarned, in the future the six buck supermarket crap will just taste like that, crap. Your balsamic vinegar budget will have permanently quadrupled overnight. If you are billionaire, Lina has balsamico that will blow you away at about $200.00 for 50ml. Try the truffle pate which is right next to it. If you have to ask how much it costs, you cannot afford it.  Lina's is now using Fratello Godfather Blend Espresso (catchy name for an Italian coffee bar). Fratello is internationally recognized as one the best roasters and sourcers of coffee beans in the world. What is even better is that they are local. Fratello is my personal favourite for coffee (alongside Phil and Sebastian and 49th Parallel) and after lunch, where Lina provides the best and least expensive Italian lunch in the city, rejuvenate yourself before heading back to work with one of their excellent coffee concoctions.  Unfortunately, Yelp does not have a provision for six stars."}
{"text":"Whether you want a coffee, lunch, or stock up for the weeks groceries Lina's has top quality selections of all plus a full section of kitchen gadgetry.  My favorite thing to grab is their fresh made pizza dough along with some fresh cut toppings from the deli to make a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome! The prices are the best in the city (way better than Fresh kitchen and some other gourmet markets). Love love love the deli meats (got prosciutto, and speck, sampling them first against other contenders with the very Italian young male smiling with his eyes and saying very good when I made a choice...usually the more expensive one). Excellent olive oils (I bought a Sicilian one and a truffle flavor one). Just check expiration dates. Some stuff on the shelves and packaged meat section have expired."}
{"text":"We are fans of Lina's. Our favourite thing to do is stop by for a late breakfast/early lunch. My husband gets the anchovy and olive pizza, and I love the rice croquettes with a little tomato sauce on the side. Sometimes we add on a spicy Italian sausage. My husband drinks a cappuccino and I get a latte. I don't typically drink coffee and I avoid carbs, but these are exceptions I'm willing to make!   The lunch counter usually has Italian favourites such as soup, stews, pasta, sausage, sandwiches, pizza and pastries. It's always busy, but the turnover is pretty fast and you can usually get a table.   After you eat, make sure you pick up some deli cheeses, meats, olives, etc. and groceries to make some meals for yourself. There's also a great selection of gift and household items.  Lina's is the closest thing to \"real\" Italy for me. I prefer it to Scarpone's - partly because Lina's is more 'organized' The Italian Centre store is also great, but a bit too far from our home for regular trips. For some reason, I still don't like the Calgary market as much as the ones in Edmonton."}
{"text":"Since Lina's was sold the quality of the food  is not what it once was - change for the worse. It used to be worth the trip but not anymore. Much better choices out there."}
{"text":"I have shopped at Lina's for many years. Actually, since she was on the west side of Center street and my family and I have always loved it. The in store lunch counter and bakery were amazing or at least they used to be. We have continued to shop there since the store sold to new owners, and it appeared to be business as usual but, I am sad to say over the past 4 months, product quality, variety and the feel of the store is in a sad state of rapid decline. In the bakery area there is a shelf with a jumble of files, papers, messy, unkempt small equipment that resemble a garage sale table that nobody buys from.   I was really hopeful that things weren't going to change but it is obvious that isn't the case. Variety has declined as well as the quality as I have already mentioned, to the point where it is no longer interesting. Prices have increased to the point that the same pedestrian brands of ice cream and the more authentic gelato are $2-3 more expensive than they are at Safeway, a few blocks south of Lina's. I'd never have considered price checking before because Lina's had products you just couldn't get anywhere else. I am probably going to give Lina's a miss from now on and drive to the Italian Supermarket or over Scarpone. Maybe once the new owner drives their business into the ground, perhaps Lina will buy it back and restore it to its former impressive glory!!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Lina's since it opened. I love going there for lunch with friends and consider it a real treat. The cappa is the best I've had in the city and the double chocolate biscotti is outstanding - especially dipped in the cappa! Other favourites include their salads and the minestrone. Of course the best thing is talking to the ladies behind the counter - if they have time - and getting whatever they like that day. Definitely a great lunch destination"}
{"text":"I summarize my review in a few words: Best Sicilian canoli and capuccino in town. The biscotti are excellent and always fresh (I highly recommend the paradise biscotti)  There are also great specialty products from Italy, which makes this place a true taste of Italy in Calgary. Worth the trip up Centre street!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week with Terry L. for what I was told was the best tiramisu in the city.   With a promise like that, said tiramisu had a lot to live up to - but it rose to the challenge!  Fluffy, creamy, chocolatey, and delicious. Best of all, there wasn't an overpowering taste of either alcohol or coffee, which made my tastebuds extremely happy. Seriously, it was so good I completely forgot I'd promised to give some to Chuck B. until after the last bite.   We were only here to 'grab, pay, go', but I saw some bread I couldn't resist buying and also noticed a lot of intriguing household items while waiting to pay.   The bread I brought was a focaccia loaf with feta, herbs and black olives and it was absolutely terrific. As a person who usually doesn't enjoy olives, they were just the right addition with the feta to make this bread slightly salty, deliciously decadent and completely filling. The bread itself had just the right ratio of flour to olive oil for a nice flavour and texture without being oily.   Best of all, my entire bill was only $6. I'm used to grudgingly paying that for my very favourite gourmet bread, so I was delighted to find Lina's so affordable.   This is one place I'm thrilled to have tried (thanks Terry!) and that I'll certainly be back to!"}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker who grew up in Italian neighborhoods, my standards for Italian specialities are admittedly high, but the pre-made dishes are Lenas are nothing special. The desserts are dumbed down versions of the original. the cannolis are terrible (take the gun, definitely leave the cannoli). The bread is much better at a few local bakeries. I am happy to find groceries of pretty good quality, although the prices are outrageous!"}
{"text":"Great place to shop for Italian or other European ingredients.  This place has some obscure brands that dont even have English or French labels.    The grocery part of the market is nice, the deli is busy but efficient and the eat-in area is a bit limited in choice but high-quality and fresh tasting.   This place is way more authentic than other markets in town, and the prices are are decent"}
{"text":"Love love love.  We frequently shop here and just adore the place. Parking is crazy, this place is busy but people are always coming and going so you might get lucky and snag a spot. The store consists of a market, a deli and even has an area with kitchen supplies. Cookbooks? They have that. Lina's has it all.   Great selection of fresh produce, we love their herbs. They also usually have good choices for greens, if they have arugula we always get it. We have tried a variety of their meats in the deli - the prosciutto is so lovely. Feta is a must on most of our visits and we usually come away with a few other choices - buffalo mozza or maybe some asiago .  They have some other prepared items available in this area, I have tried the spanakopita and it was delish.   There is also a wide selection of prepared items and olives - we have tried a few kinds of olives, the sun dried tomatoes are heavenly, roasted red peppers ... so many choices. I have also witnessed many people buying the tomato, basil and boconccini salad, I can only imagine it's good based off the amazing ingredients in store.   This is a great place to pick up olive oil, there is usually one brand or another on sale, so you can get a quality olive oil on the cheap. Loads of balsamic choices as well. They also have a small bulk section, which is great for grabbing some pine nuts.    As for the kitchen supply area, this little section is great too. We have purchased a few different things from here over the past year, when we needed new wooden spoons, we came to Lina's. Rolling Pin? Lina's. Pan in which to make lasagna? Lina's.   You should go."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Half store half deli.   Love the pastry and goodies you can get for family gatherings or bbq."}
{"text":"Since it was sold i am not seeing a lot of the products i used to buy here anymore. I would say that its change to a more hipster Italian store and this is reflected in the prices. I would go somewhere else as the restaurant group that bought it do not know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found Lina's.  Being a recent transplant from Vancouver I was seriously missing the Commercial Drive shop experience - even though it is only one store it gave me the total feeling.  Great deli selection of meats and cheeses with knowledgeable friendly service.  Loved it and will return!"}
{"text":"Plenty of meats and cheeses available from the deli, plenty of dry pasta. Lots of olive oil and italian confectionaries. On site parking lot."}
{"text":"The cappuccino and gelato are to die for! The take home pastas are yummy. Otherwise they have a nice selection of eat in food and a good Italian market that is pleasant to shop in. I have been a fan for many years."}
{"text":"Best place to pick up pizza dough and focaccia. Some of the products are a little pricey, but they're all top notch ingredients."}
{"text":"Another favourite of mine. I still prefer the ambiance at the Italian Supermarket, because it is less crowded and smaller, but Lina's is better than the latter !mostly for its variety of Italian pastries and cakes all made on site, and most importantly its homemade porchetta! Their porchetta sandwich with roasted pepper on italian bread, is so simple yet so incredibly delicious, and on top of that, cheaper than any fast-food sandwiches or subs. They also have a great selection of cheeses and meats and salami and antipasto, and their store-made bruschetta is also deliciously garlicky and cheap. Lina's is on my daily commute to get my daily ciabatta and focaccia. Yes, daily!"}
{"text":"Lina's Italian Market & Cappuccino Bar is everything Italian, all jam-packed within 4 walls. From pizza cutters, to coffee makers, to fresh produce, all the way to an in-store restaurant that serves everything from paninis to gelato.  It's an understatement to say that Lina's is an Italian supermarket; More like an Italian mammoth-market.  If you have not yet visited Lina's, it's time you visited this treasure in our city. The Italian in you will forever thank you."}
{"text":"Lina's Italian Market is a great place to experience a little of Italy with wonderful bakery, Italian cuisine, meats, fresh pastas and cheeses.   My favourite is grabbing fresh pizza dough to make home made pizza. The pizza dough is a hand toss texture and makes absolutely awesome pizzas.   Fresh bread to make subs or other Italian dishes are also a great choice.  You'll find everything you need for a Italian dish, including kitchenware. Some ppl say their prices are higher then other Italian stores but this location has everything in one place and just makes life easier to shop here."}
{"text":"Great selection of everything from cheese, pasta, deli meats and pastries. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"oh man. i love this place. there are two things that are worth driving across the city for:  1) Lina's pasta special... that sauce is amazing. Used to ask for am extra container of sauce with a 2nd piece of bread for dipping... hmmm...  2) Porketta Sandwich... ask them to add a few hot peppers and that's all you need. you will be full. and satisfied."}
{"text":"I live near by and it's definitely my go to place. I've never been disappointed. You can get some real coffee with their fresh Bomboloni (to die for). And then of course the whole European style supermarket where they have a great variety of meat like jamon, prosciutto etc and cheese of all kinds and soooo much more."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of meats and cheeses and breads. I also love their bruschetta as well as their pre-made pizza dough they sell. The little restaurant is also delicious. Highly recommend eating there! The only downsides is that it can be hard to get a table to eat your food at as there is limited seating but the wait usually isn't too bad. Also parking can be tricky when it's busier as the parking lot isn't very large."}
{"text":"So we picked up a Spinach Lasagna from Lina's tonight. Absolutely delicious. No meat sauce witch was a little weird considering the price but it was amazing. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys tasty Italian."}
{"text":"First timers at Lina's, we had sure heard about it. We went at 6:30pm last night and this establishment closes at 7:00pm, at least on weekdays - not sure about weekends. We are night owls so we always drive by when the store is closed... The store is brightly lit and even larger inside than it looks. We went in to \"look\" but of course we came out with a big bag of things! (sliced almonds, dried pasta, white South American cheese, roasted pumpkin seeds, milk, pastries) The staff were quiet, looked like they all wanted to get home and were busy shutting down for the night. We did not eat at the little restaurant inside but we sure brought with us to go a couple of mini desserts. The tiramisu was to DIE FOR and the caramel cheesecake - well, what can you say about those 2 words - they just GO together. Delicious! I found the prices to be right on point, not over the top for any product. The meat and cheese area looked top notch, lots of variety and even the produce area was impressive looking. The store was well organized and clean, major pluses for me. Very happy that this is close to home for right now. Anxious to try the freshly made food, maybe on a lunch hour. Authentic, 4 stars. Next time I hope the staff will look up and smile a bit and warrant 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Omg! One of the best tiramisu & cream horn  I have ever had in Calgary =D! So lucky to have tried this place.  Made my mouth & taste buds happy with jumping for joys=D A must try place for desserts and deli"}
{"text":"My relationship with Lina began years ago when I used to work near the 32nd Ave area. I've yet to see Lina herself in person, but based on the experiences in this market, I imagine she looks like Giovanna Mezzogiorno ;)  Lina's carries a wide variety of Italian and european items that blows any Italian market I've been to out of the water. I've yet to see any store match Lina's selection of key top notch ingredients like Foie gras. Their pasta section is formidable, I get really difficult and picky with my pasta. Lina's is also a great place to stock up on christmas office gifts like Italian chocolates and cookies or the stuffing stocker italian kitchen ware. Their produce is small and quaint but every visit I found myself picking up something-tomatoes, brocollini, belgian endives.  Ah the deli...I think it really is the place to visit in Calgary. From my observation it divides into three key areas. The anti pasto/salad area carries amazing italian eats to go like tapenades, calamari anti pasto, and bruschetta. Grab a crusted bread with these to go and you have a five star meal later in the day. The dessert and bakery area, who I affectionally call \"Isabella\" because it offers beautiful desserts that sinful consumption often leads to regretful chest aches. Finally their lunch deli offers daily specials and has it's own coffee and gelato station. The large crowd that frequent Lina's dining area speaks for the quality of food the lunch deli serves. I've been to a lot of fancy pizza places that claim to be authentic and suck your wallet like a vampire, but I think Lina's pizza is the best. My favourite pizza is their asiago cheese and pickled artichoke pizza. They also serve one of the best pork sandwiches in the city (see photo). How's the coffee? Ask anyone drinking Lina's and you'll find yourself ignored not because your being a nuisance, but because they're probably in a serene trance."}
{"text":"Excellent espresso cafe! This is where you CAN get a decent cup of espresso, cappuccino, latte etc. Tops Starbucks hands down (not saying much really). The croissants are fabulous too! Biscotti ditto. Some of the brulees seem like they might have been there (in the cooler) for a few days??---they don't seem 'made-this-morning' fresh. Take it for what it's worth, and get what's good. The pizza's excellent, but not super fresh either (BUT top-notch pepperoni)! And the cannoli's nice too.   The rest of the store is full of imported Itallian goods (I love the treats). Lots of pasta, olive oils, espresso coffee grounds, spices, breads, produce---the full gamete---plus some inexpensive kitchenware made in China. It's a bit of a treat to grab a coffee, a pastry, and shop for a bit! Four stars!!"}
{"text":"Lina's is everything I've ever learned about about Italian Food crammed (very neatly, might I add) into one enjoyable market trip.  For crafting your own culinary creations, Lina's has anything and everything Italian. From rows of imported olive oils and sun-dried tomatoes, to a fantastic Italian Deli section filled with cheese and meat all the way to fresh produce selection with varieties of Italian tomatoes, onions and herbs - everything you could possibly need to take your Italian meal from start to finish. They've even got you covered if you are missing some of the cookware to get you there. There's a homeware and cooking gadget section that beats out any of the big-box grocers going.  If you want to skip all that prep-work and proceed to the \"stuff-your-face\" part of the meal, Lina's has plenty of piping-hot, home-made meals, complete with fresh Italian espresso to cap (-achino) it off.   Gift baskets galore! And you know what? Packed full of all kind of incredible imports - I think people would actually want these gift baskets!"}
{"text":"I could see myself getting Lina's take away dinners a lot if I lived near here."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It has everything you need from fresh-baked breads, a deli, and a bakery all in one location. It's amazing what they can fit in here. They even have a section in which they sell kitchenware. The coffee is delicious and their pecan rolls are rather intense. I loved the sausage roll and fresh deli meats.  I would never have walked in here and expected to find such a treasure trove of authentic goods. Size DOES NOT matter."}
{"text":"This is a great place on all levels.  If you're a morning person, good coffees and lattes.  Great selection of breakfast pastries.  Their lunch sandwich and pizza variety will satisfy anyone.  Decent sized sit down area, about 30 people.  The market itself provides any carnivore multiple ideas.  Fantastic selection of cured meats including Italian proscuitto and Spanish Serano ham.  Great cheese selection from Canadian cheddars to Italian provolone and mozarella.  Butcher selections include beef, pork, lamb, chicken.  Pricing for this seems a bit higher than some of the chain markets.  Good take home pastas and fantastic selection of olives and salads.  Usually go for the cured and take home pastas.  Also a nice selection of cooking/kitchen items.  Mostly imported from Italy and Europe, so expect a high price, but a very good quality."}
{"text":"I had a great time during my first visit to Lina's - I felt like I was back in Italy! They sell authentic Italian ingredients - both perishable and non-perishable. I was able to find a small package of Double Zero flour. My boyfriend and I had a great time practicing the homemade ravioli recipe we learned at cooking school in Florence!"}
{"text":"Judging by the parking lot it's always busy at Lina's and if you want to sit down and have a meal, getting a table might be a little problem. The food is delicious and you can get anything from a meat entree to salads to stuffed foccacias and more, not to mention the eye-catching desserts and gelato. I just bought a condo just around the corner from Lina's so parking will no longer be a problem for me! YEAH! It's like a little bit of Italy in the middle of Calgary and you can have a very enjoyable time browsing the aisles. There are kitchenware and gadgets and groceries that will do any Italian kitchen proud not to mention that you can get a good selection of cheeses and deli meats and baked goods."}
{"text":"Although the location is far for me, I grew up in the NE and relied on Lina's Italian Market for shopping, party ideas, and finding the best authentic fresh made pasta. deli salads, savoury Sauces and my favourite the BEST bruschetta in town.   I could go on about how ridiculously addictive the food is, so much so I craved their Tiramisu  during my pregnancy. However, theirs a few flaws to this great Italian Market for starters the place is a tad run-down and service can be hard to find if looking for something during their peak hours. The location is situated on a vary busy street, with plenty of Hustle & Bustle during week nights and weekends. The best time to go is morning or 1 hour after lunch. or else you will spend the next hour frantically searching for parking.  \"It's obvious that long-time loyal customers come for the food not the experience.\"  If your ever in the NE check out their wood-oven pizzas and fresh Tabouli, Lina's Market has everything especially for the most pickiest eaters around."}
{"text":"Parking can be a bit of a challenge, especially if there are big SUVs and trucks.  I love to browse in their kitchenware and gadgets section.  They also sell a few cookbooks.   Their grocery section has a wide variety of dry pastas, olive oils, balsamic vinegars, sun-dried tomatoes, deli meats, cheese and baked goods.  Gelato, desserts and espresso are excellent."}
{"text":"I asked the guys I was with to take me to get a good Italian sandwich and here's where we landed!  I have to say, it was indeed good.  This place is mainly a market/store.  Looks great.  I didn't buy anything at the store because I was travelling, just ate at the cafe/deli part.  Tables were not overly comfortable, but it worked for a quick bite.  Although the sandwich was good, I will admit that when I asked for an Italian sandwich, I sort of thought I'd be blown away by some little gem of a deli.  This was good, but I'll continue my search next time for lunch!"}
{"text":"Lina's is a 20 minute walk from my office but it is worth it, they always have something new and tasty to try for lunch and I haven't had a bad dessert yet. The grocery section of the story has lots of good things to try out too, their homemade baguettes and wide selection of olive oils are great."}
{"text":"I stopped by Lina's for a quick lunch at noon on a Friday. The line to order food was long, but moved quickly as all of the ladies behind the counter know exactly what they're doing. I ordered a mushroom pizza, which was pretty good.   I want to highlight that the four guys ahead of me ordered Italian sausages, potato wedges and mixed bell peppers - and it looked delicious!! There were also paninis, Italian subs, soup, salads and desserts, so, really something for everyone.  And this isn't just a place to order food to eat in or take out, it's also an amazing Italian store with a deli - lots of cheese and meats, a huge olive bar (behind glass, as an olive bars should be), dry goods, dairy, chocolate, bakery...and also a selection of kitchen supplies and bakeware.  I purchased a long baking pan for making mini Madeleines. I have a regular pan, but had never come across a mini one. I also took home a fresh focaccia with feta and olives - yum!"}
{"text":"The best cappuccino and panini in Calgary. Only make the trip her twice a year and always leave with a satisfied tummy"}
{"text":"Love going to this local shop!   Some time I can find new treasures and things to try and I'm always inspired with new dinner party dishes.  My one thing that I do get often is buy is the pre-made pizza dough. Tip: I make donuts with it! It's Supper easy! don't tell my coworkers ;)"}
{"text":"Lina's recently renovated but they're still awesome.  Whatever your Italian needs, Lina's has it. I come here for their deli where they serve sandwiches, pizzas, soups and even a roast chicken meal. I've never had anything bad at Lina's and everything is freshly made. Their desserts are to die for and their bakery even does cakes for special occasions!   They also have fresh housemade pastas, and fresh pizza dough for those who don't want to make a mess in their kitchen.  I think they're a bit more expensive than the Italian Store but they don't skimp on quality."}
{"text":"We usually go to Lina's for the gelato and desserts, but it has so much more to offer, as others have pointed out, so there's not much more I can add except to encourage you to visit! I bought a case of San Pellegrino; the discount was too big to resist."}
{"text":"Reminds me of visits to my Nana's.. I usually head over to Lina's for some fillicette and other Italian meats and cheese. But the best part of my visit? The cafeteria afterwards. The sauce in the cannelloni is the closest ANYONE has come to making a sauce similar to my Nana's.  Authentic Italian all around. Right down to the staff serving behind the counters.. Laughing and talking in Italian as they cook. I feel right at home :)"}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom. That is the sound of me after a visit to Lina's, stuffing myself full of tasty Italian foods. It's caaarbolicious!   They have a wonderful selection of imported goods, and the deli is well stocked and delicious. Prosciutto, prosciutto salami, Mortadella - there are a million different meats just waiting for you! And then the boccocini Mozarella, which is fabulous, along with all the other cheeses... Everything is tasty and unique.  Other things to look out for are their selection of fresh and frozen fresh pastas. Fresh pasta is a totally different experience than dried pasta, and you can get some tasty sauces for it (although I prefer to make my own).  The fresh bread is mm.mm. good. Try the braided jewish-style bread and the fresh foccacia, but bread from Lina's doesn't keep well so try to scarf it down in the first 24 hours. You'll find a ton of other Italian cooking items like olive oil and syrups and espresso and a limited selection of fresh fruits and veggies.   Lina's is a bit more expensive than your traditional grocery store, but it is well worth it for the imported specialty items and the foods that are made in store. To complete the experience they have a small cafe and store where you can get select italian dishes and desserts along with a decent espresso/cappucino. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Admittedly I have been haunting Lina's for years.  I try to drop in a minimum of 6 times a year sometimes more even though I do not live close by.  Time is always the challenge but even the quick coffee at Lina's makes you happy.  This time was very planned as one of my Italian Besties (BFF) was coming to visit for a couple days and I knew I wanted to impress her.  My boy and I picked her up at the airport late morning and our first stop was Lina's for an espresso & lunch.  It was a glorious outing as we went right in for lunch to try and beat the rush and ensure we got a table.  My boy ordered pizza (surprise surprise), my gf and I shared a panini and a salad.  Then she surprised us by bringing back a plate full of pastries (including cannelloni - drool) for a treat to go with our espresso.  Next was casually wandering the store...or as casual as you can be with a 4 year old who is full of energy.  We decided we would pick up some antipasti and have a feast that afternoon before our planned later dinner of chimichurri grilled steak!  So we picked some unique cheese to try, deli meats/salami's, stuffed peppers, olives, artichokes, fresh ciabatta...oh la la it was going to be fabulous!!  And an antipasti feast it was...following a delicious lunch....mmmmmm.  There is something for everyone at Lina's. Definitely. Visit. Lina's."}
{"text":"Lina's old skool sign is so huge you can see it from blocks away while driving down Centre Street.  The ample parking area is the perfect place for that quick turn that you are now going to take to try a new place to get something delicious to eat.    The cafe/deli doubles as a grocery store and kitchen accessory store as well.  It is quite large, well lit and has nice big windows that let the sun in.  You can get your average staples here, your pastas and your sauces plus the deli area is just loaded with goodies for you to buy. You can get your gelatos, cappuccinos, Panini's, pizza, baked goods, salads, fresh pasta, deli meats, all types of chesses, your fresh meat, and speciality prepared foods and produce.  But it just doesn't stop there, the kitchen accessories area is pretty thorough as well, kitchen accessories like ladles and strainers, ceramic ware for your different sizes of baked pasta, there is even jarring accessories, and tablecloths.  So why not shop before or after you eat, Lina's will set you up with a shopping cart just to make things easier."}
{"text":"How have I never been here before? For real, I even used to live a few blocks to the west... although anything on Centre St has never been a spot I'd frequent (excuse that semi-awkward sentence). My travels these days don't often take me up in that direction, but when lunchtime called one day last week, it was to Lina's to meet Joel S for a spot of lunch. Well, a spot was more like a plateful of sausage, veggies, a roll and a salad from the lunch counter.... ok, AND a piece of cheesecake for dessert... with a latte.  I had a tremendously hard time deciding exactly what I wanted to eat for lunch, and I fear I ate waaaay too much. But I'm not sorry... nope, not one bit! The spicy sausage I got was just spicy enough, although I'm not sure this prairie-born girl is the right spice-o-metre to go by. I enjoyed the tomato salad, but the tomatoes didn't taste quite as flavourful as I would have expected. The Roma tomatoes I ate in Italy all of those years ago have forever held up a very high bar for me and tomatoes though. The veggies were actually asparagus, pretty hard to mess up asparagus I think, but they worked. And the cheesecake, well, it was also a 4 star cheesecake. It was good and a healthy slice, but 5 star cheesecake would be a bit creamier.  I had a boo around the market and couldn't believe the selection of cheese and meat at the deli in the back. Nor the entire aisle full of noodles. And this is no short aisle. And olive oil? Well, you'd better know what kind your after, or you'll find yourself staring at the labels in front of you for far too long."}
{"text":"Got to stop in at Lina's for lunch with my husband and found it quite busy!  Almost no tables available until someone got up to leave.  I had the pasta entrée and my husband had a sandwich.  We both picked a dessert - a chocolate éclair for me and a round pastry for him.  They have a great deli section and lots of knick knacks and Italian things to buy for your kitchen as well as grocery items."}
{"text":"Love this store! They have an amazing selection of deli meats, cheese, a hot counter and more! I have been shopping here for the past 12 years and thanks to Yelp, recently discovered their monthly market dinner. I called a week in advance to advise of my lactose issue and they completely accommodated me with no cheese in my dishes served separately. The meal is served in platters.   Last night was incredible! My gf and I had a wonderful time sitting with 8 other people at a rectangular table. We began with a refreshing orange spritzer, artichoke and chickpea crostini. I could feel the fresh garlic oozing from my pores! A kale, potato and sausage soup was incredibly rich and filling. Next up was the phenomenal lamb bolognese with penne. I only ate a few bites and packed the rest so I could eat the osso bucco with risotto. Saffron Risotto was very smooth and I devoured the silky tender osso bucco with huge helpings of peppers, grilled asparagus and lightly charred rapini.  Totally fantasmic!!! Our server and chef were so helpful and we finally made it to dessert. Olive oil cake with rhubarb compote and fresh strawberries with a mascarpone cream. We were also given limoncello which I decided to pour on my cake vs drink.   I will definitely book into this event again although my stomach may suffer! I went home happy as could be with my packaged leftovers. Truly outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"If you ever crave some sympathy and want someone to feel sorry for you, simply go over to Lina's, and tell the adorable Italian matriarchal figure behind the counter at the lunch deli that you are vegetarian and also cannot have cheese.  This is what happened today. I'd initially popped in to surprise my (just vegetarian) brother with a foccacia pizza on my way over to visit, ,then decide I would try my luck and see if there were any cool vegan things I could have. I was assured that actually, Lina's margarita pizza is vegan- made on their delicious foccacia bread and slathered in bruschetta- no cheese! I also went home with a gorgeous side of roasted veggies, and some vanilla halva for good measure. Between these items I tried and their delicious salads, I hope to make Lina's a more frequent lunch spot when I need a break from work.   :)"}
{"text":"What is not to love.  This is one place that every time I go I say to myself - why am I not here more often.  The coffee, the food, the shopping are all off the charts.  Not a fancy place - but the quality is definitely in every food item presented."}
{"text":"Upon returning from my trip to Italy in 2006, I searched North Calgary for an Italian store or market that would best help to revitalize my experience and memories.  Lina's = jackpot!"}
{"text":"The deli here is fabulous.  But the grocery store, which used to be THE place to find Italian ingredients, has reduced their selection drastically.  It's still got some stuff, but the store feels half empty now.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Go to Lina's for groceries and grab a quick bite along the way. The food is good and the cappuccino is killer. Make sure you try the margherita pizza, a very authentic Italian restaurant style pizza experience.   Seating is limited and is often busy during lunch hours. I would advise taking food to go if you do plan on going."}
{"text":"Oh Lina's, I love you.  It's by far the best market made tiramisu in the city.  Fresh pastas, great deli, unique italian groceries. and a roast pork and roasted red pepper sandwich that I salivate like a dog to a dinner bell.  It's where I pick up my balsamic vinegar, the odd tiramisu every other month, and these really wicked little pastries for a dirt cheap price.  And that's not all... the fresh pasta and pizza dishes, the sandwich bar (a lot more than pork), and the espresso bar are all equally outstanding.  Always a great place for brunch or lunch in the day, and now after writing this, I just have to pick up another roast pork sandwich in the am. :)  PS: there's a great selection of kitchen toys too!"}
{"text":"Now this is a cool little deli/catering store.  They have a bunch of different groceries and foods to choose from, perfect for anything you are craving or might be cooking.  It is great for a quick lunch since they serve fresh, hot meals that change on a daily basis.  The menu usually consists of soups and salads, as well as some pasta dishes and panini's.  Whatever you're in the mood for, Lina's can give you a great lunch at a pretty fair price.  They also double as a mini grocery store.  You can get specialty foods for baking and cooking, as well as different sausages, which are all made in-store.    It has the classic Italian menu and everything you might need to make a meal at home.  It's reasonably priced for being a specialty store, too.  I find the workers at Lina's to vary from day to day.  Some days they are super friendly and pleasant, but other times they aren't as helpful.  Lina's is just a nice little place to visit, whether you're looking for a quick meal, or something to make for yourself at home.  Lina's can help in any Italian dish you want to create!"}
{"text":"I have a couple of friends who live nearby so when I drop by their place, I like to also check out Lina's Market. They have a lot of healthy-looking stuff, exotic Italian packaging and a nice gelato stand in-store :)  Also they offer some neat free gifts with purchase - the nylon bag she gave me, made a great beach bag for our trip to Punta Cana :D"}
