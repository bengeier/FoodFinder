{"text":"Not sure I agree with Mike's 5 rating, but the food was good.  Tucked out of the way, the place is impossible to casually stumble across.  But, the food was good. and the service was very good.  They do close early on Monday evenings, or so it seemed.  Might just be a summer schedule.  Noise level can be loud near the bar area, but there is a dining area off the main area that is quieter.  Well worth another visit.  Note:  I gave it a loud noise level because of loud golfers coming in and dinking and trying to outshout each other.  But, if you move to the other room I suspect it will be much quieter.  Just don't know how attentive the service will be out there (out of site, out of mind?)."}

{"text":"Links is our watering hole once a week. Lots of fun  Fish on Friday is excellent u can have it deep fried or baked either way is great.  Staff is friendly come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Very slow service, mediocre food.   Stopped in for lunch on a weekday.   Light crowd, maybe 6 tables.   Ordered and then proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait.   Everyone else seemed to be waiting too.  Food finally showed 45 minutes later.   I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with soup.   Brisket was dry, soaked in BBQ sauce and stuck on a hamburger bun.   Soup had the film on top from sitting under the heat lamp too long.   Both were bland and nothing special.   Add in drinks not being refilled and a missing in action waiter...Won't be returning.   On top of that, the people at the next table couldn't order some items because \"their delivery of vegetables hadn't come in\"."}
{"text":"Had the sunrise special breakfast today.  Amazing value, friendly staff, good atmosphere, slow service,  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The Links has great food and atmosphere overlooking the golf course at Westbrook Village. Prices are very reasonable and the management is awesome!  I've been holding networking events there for the past six months with The 101 Referral Network - West on the last Tuesday evening of every month. They've been very accomodating...my Members all love this place too.  I'd highly recommend them to anyone wanting a great meal for breakfast,  lunch  or dinner."}
{"text":"Had my husband's 50th Surprise Party at the Links Neighborhood Grill today. I can't say enough about Gabriel and Marco. They were so attentive and helpful. We had the chicken parm and spaghetti and it was very good. I highly recommend this venue for a party. Thank you for helping me make my husband's day so special."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, fresh food in a very relaxing atmosphere. The lunch specials are a nice sized portion and the staff is very friendly, personable, and accommodating. Love sitting on the patio and with a pool view and listening to the waterfall. Fun activities like Veterans Day lunch, Wednesday night Karaoke, and more. Full bar with modestly priced drinks and beer. What a great place to dine and unwind for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!  Cant wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch was miserable. We were not informed of the buffet only until we were seated - for an overpriced $30 each, drinks extra. What we got was terrible service, cold and dried out food that tasted more like leftovers. The only high point was the omelet bar and personable chef cooking them. Had to hunt down a waitress for water, champagne, glasses, flatware and beg for our bill so we could escape that awful place."}
{"text":"Decided to try this out for breakfast as we are new to the area and saw it driving by one day. Unfortunately, don't think we will bother going back. The price was as high as most places but the portions are very small and the food was very ordinary. Could have been because it was near retiree area but I felt like I needed to go have breakfast somewhere after I ate! Asked for biscuits instead of toast and got just one - tiny and tasted like it was probably from a can, There were a lot of people with groups so service was slow but that might have been more because of the number of people though didn't see very many servers either. Place did look clean and the views of the golf course were nice. Staff was nice as well."}
