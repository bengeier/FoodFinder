{"text":"Decided to check it out cause it was practically across the street from my boyfriends. Heard from another friend that it was good. Boy!! Were they wrong..for beverages we ordered half litre of wine. BBQ mixed set, tempura shrimp as appetizers and fly dragon rolls and Alaskan king crab rolls. So usually they come with drinks promptly or soon thereafter..nope! (Plus there is only one other couple in the restaurant) I decide to inquire after 15 minutes...where \"The Lady\" who I think May be owner snaps at me and says \"I know!\" Then walks away..I was completely guffawed at how rude and uncustomer service orientated she was. The white wine turns up 10 minutes later warm, sitting in a big bowl of water with a couple of ice cubes! Am pretty sure one of them ran across the street to purchase it. The rolls then show up before the appetizers, and we were never attended to or looked at again, no joke!! As my boyfriend and I sat there, we had observed where they were making their money. Through take out and delivery..this might not have been such a bad experience if the food was great, alas it was not. Rolls were tasteless, tempura weighed like bricks, appetizers were swimming in sauce, service a Complete disgrace..indeed I have nothing to rave about. It was $50 and experience I will never gain back! Passerby's beware..do not ever saunter in there!"}
{"text":"We got delivery and were impressed by the fast service and the quality of the sushi.   We ordered some special rolls as well as an ochinko roll and a riceless salmon roll with ginger and cucumber (really good!). Everything was delicious and very fresh tasting, from the rice to the veggies and fish. We also tried one of the black rice rolls and it was very tasty.  Would definitely order from them again and might stop by for lunch one day if we're in the area."}
{"text":"This one's a bit easy to miss, stuck in the little micro-plaza beside Nicholson's No Frills. It's not a standout as far as Japanese restaurants go, but there's nothing wrong with it either.   Sushi Villa does make for a nice getaway from some of the more gentrified or pseudo-hip Bloor West establishments. Good luck trying to park in the one space in front of it, there's usually a lot of pedestrian traffic even on the off chance that the spot isn't taken."}
{"text":"Definitely not the prettiest of dining rooms, could certainly benefit from a makeover. However, there is a reason why they've been there for well over a decade: the food is great quality.   The sushi is on the pricier side if you're used to Bloor/Annex pricing, but it's consistently of excellent quality.  The rolls and handrolls are always wrapped nicely.    Recently I've taken to ordering delivery or take-out from them instead of dining in to avoid the run down dining room and somewhat slow (but albeit always friendly) service."}
{"text":"Horrible quality.. I ordered two party trays and the tuna, salmon and everything else was not fresh at all,, taste is very poor. Will never deal with place again."}
{"text":"Since we moved into the neighbourhood back in 2007 l have gone to this place several times & have to say that I have truly enjoyed dining there.   My 2 year old daughter just loves the Edamame & whenever we pass by she always asks for Edamame that now I have resorted to walking on the other side of the street so that she doesn't make a big fuss if I don't go in & buy some for her!"}
{"text":"While my first experience with Sushi Villa was lacklustre I thought that everyone deserves a second chance so I've now been a total of 3 times....and will never be back. I don't know if I've been spoiled with competitive downtown prices but they seem incredibly overpriced for the quality/quantity. Especially considering I am a vegetarian and don't order any seafood/fish dishes.   Two out of the three times my (2 roll) order was wrong when I opened up the container. Both times they made me new rolls but there was never any offer to keep the incorrect ones or make some kind of restitution for the wait.   The sushi itself is pretty bland, with the exception of the brown/purple rice rolls. That rice is super tasty....part of the reason that I went back a 3rd time.   The staff is really friendly but unfortunately it doesn't make up for poor quality food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through just eats.ca. Took an hour and a half to get here. The sushi was awful and I didn't even get the order that I placed. I ordered 16 pieces of sushi, got 8 pieces, and a small salmon roll.  So I paid for twice as much as I got.  I do not suggest ordering from this place."}
{"text":"The place seemed nice and we were excited about eating here. We came here for lunch and they got our order completely wrong. It was even repeated. Ah well, we will give this place one more chance but the first impression was not good."}
{"text":"Sushi villa has consistent sushi that never seems to change. I've been going to this restaurant since it opened about 12 years ago and every time I'm in the neighbourhood and meet for Japanese I go here. Went here last night and it was still an excellent experience. I even turned my friend on to it who lives across the street and had never been. The fish is fresh, the portions are adequately bite sized. The miso soup is good but the salad is rather lacking. The wasabi is a good spicy as sometimes I find wasabi lacking in spice without a huge amount in the soy sauce. With various sized sushi and/or sashimi plates it gives one a good choice.  But I was stuffed with a shared tempura appetizer and a small sushi combo.   It is always a good stop when you go to the Bloor West neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I checked Sushi Villa while wandering Bloor West for a place to have lunch. The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff were pleasant.   I am always skeptical of sushi places that list mayonaise as an ingredient in their rolls. I asked for mine to have this excluded. Along with the tempura, I found the food to be great quality; better than most of the Japanese restaurants I  used to in the annex.  I definitely plan to return!"}
{"text":"This tiny place tucked behind the giant No Frills is the best sushi place in my opinion. Lots of people don' like it BUT I don't eat seafood so their veggie options are so tasty! Prices are good, service is great, free delivery, etc. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery from this restaurant and I will never give this restaurant another chance. The quality and quantity of assorted sashimi in my chirashi was definitely not worth $15.50. I've had way better chirashi for less elsewhere in Toronto. We thought perhaps the chef forgot to put more sashimi, so we called the restaurant. Well, they definitely knew what they were doing and basically told us that was the correct portion. Too bad that is the way they want to do business. Not to mention it took them about 1 hour to deliver."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is about sitting for two and a half hours during a taping of The Hour, but I'm always hungry for sushi and miso soup right afterward, so I decided it was time to go to Sushi Villa and try out the Queen Roll.  Their Queen Roll consists of tempura yam and salmon and after snacking on six pieces last night... it's not half bad.  It's not too sweet, which was something I had wondered about with the sweetest potato being a major part of the mix.  It is one of those creations that you need to have a certain craving for in order for it to hit that spot; definitely not one that I would be inclined to order *every-single-time*, but I know there will come a time in the future that I'll want this one again.  And things just got a little more curious last night.  I didn't think I went to Sushi Villa too often, but one of their chefs said, \"Ah! It's good to see you again!\" when I went to the back to pay for my take-out.  Either I've visited enough times to be recognized, or I look like someone they know.  Hmm...  I also somehow landed a 10% discount for my order, so I'm not complaining. XD  I was also shocked to realise that for the numerous occasions that I've frequented this restaurant (enough apparently for recognition from the chef *facepalm*), I had never tried their una-ju before.  This was disconcerting, because unagi in any form is my favourite dish.  Meg Ryan still didn't make an appearance last night, when I finally corrected this erroneous mistake, but I'd have to say that their una-ju is probably one of the better versions of this dish I've tried.  It was definitely a bigger proportion of not only the rice, but the unagi itself, than I've ever received before."}
{"text":"The vegetable tempura was good, but the maki was unimpressive. And delivery took forever."}
{"text":"Back some years ago, when I lived at Jane and Bloor, this was my go-to sushi joint.  Everything I tried was good.  They had a nice selection of those fancy rolls.  Extra care was made in the presentation.  Service was great--never rushed.  And prices were reasonable.  The ambiance was nice.  Good place for a first date!  Would I make a special trip out for sushi here?  Probably not.  But, if you are near Bloor, between Keele and Jane, and desire sushi, this is a good place for it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here through justeat couple nights ago after waking up hungover and craving sushi.  What an epic disappointment!  The rolls were packed upside down in the takeaway containers with all topping fallen off, the gyozas were gummy and cold, soba noodles were plain mush, sashimi... Less than fresh!  And whoever heard of a crispy roll with no \"crisp\" or Las Vegas roll not deep fried?!  This dinner went directly into the trash and when we called to complain, radio silence.  Actually we are still waiting for the \"manager\" to call us back...  Do yourself a favour and stay away."}
{"text":"Used to go a lot but then got food poisoning (I think from shrimp) Won't go again. MUCH prefer YAMA on Bloor near Armadale"}
{"text":"The sushi was warm and had me wanting to throw it out. The lettuce in the salad was squeaking against my teeth. This is so far the worst sushi I've had in the city. I'm sure there are worse but I've been lucky.   I even sat at my table for a while before anyone came to me, and it wasn't busy. They saw me and just ignored me for a bit."}
{"text":"Honestly, I want to give this a 1.5/5, but that's not an option.    TERRIBLE sushi.  I've had crap grocery store sushi with better flavor and at a better price than this place.  Also, should the restaurant wreak of fish?? Sushi should not smell fishy, this entire restaurant stinks.    And if you aren't getting sushi, completely skip the cooked menu items.  Way too greasy, salty, just absolute crap.    ASA sushi on Jane is 100 x's better than this, and I think they actually deliver as well.    The only reason why I do not give this restaurant a 1/1 is because the typical nigiri (sake and maguro) is decent. Otherwise, do yourself a favor, do not eat at this horrible, sad excuse for a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I love these very traditional sushi houses. We asked for a chirashi and some edamame. They serve very well, the food was great and the miso is awesome. I had to ask for some extra shrimp, because it was lovely.   Too bad I went there after eating some snacks, so I couldn't ask more food. I'd love to ask a bigger combo go further on their menu. But I live close and they can expect me to go back there soon.  Good food, nice for couples (they have those small tables closed by curtains) or small groups and free tea. What else would someone want? It's even close to the subway!"}
{"text":"We loved coming here for sushi and the soups.  Sadly it appears closed when we recently were in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the worst delivery sushi I've ever had. WAY too much rice in the maki and nigiri, 'meh' fish, small pieces. Poorly constructed rolls, mushy and unseasoned rice. The miso soup had a single piece of seaweed and a single piece of tofu. I won't be back."}
