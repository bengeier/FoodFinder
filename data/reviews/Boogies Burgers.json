{"text":"Burgers were alright, definitely would go back again, the fat elvis milkshake is definitely something to write home about though!  Peanut butter, banana and real bacon, may not sound that appealing but just works and is so good!"}
{"text":"We like Boogie's Burgers a lot! The last time I was there I had the vegetarian burger, which was OK. It definitely had peas in it - but I think I'll stick to the meaty burgers. My husband had a Grim Reaper burger for the first and last time  - it's something like 4 patties, a fried egg, bacon and two sliced hot dogs. The onion rings and fries are generously portioned.

Service has always been quick and friendly. The vintage arcade games are a nice touch too. All proceeds from the video games go to charity."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken burger. I was expecting a whole chicken breast, but was surprised to get 3 chicken fingers on a bun. Great flavour and portion. No sides came with meal. $17.50 for burger w/ cheese & bacon, side of small fries and a milkshake was about $4-$5 more than I would have expected to pay.

However, the vibe of the place was very old school. Street fighter, arkanoid, and pacman arcade games coupled with early '90's hip-hop/alt rock made this 29 year old fairly nostalgic.

3 stars for food/price & 5 stars for atmosphere."}
{"text":"I never believed anyone who said it was good, so I was surprised when it was actually quite good.  It's greasy food, but a better burger than most, and a decent size helping too.  Don't be confused by the name, it's not that bad, and actually a lot of fun."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite burger joint in Calgary now.

I had passed by numerous times and never considered going in until it was recommended that I try. Man was I missing out. Flavorful, awesome, filling. 

I will be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our first visit to Boogies. The impression I got was if we douse it with sauce that will hide the fact the burgers are tasteless. Really wanted our first experience there to be so much better."}
{"text":"When you're craving a burger head to Boogie's.

We like their varied burger menu & have always had a good experience there."}
{"text":"There is a science behind a good burger. Good buns are super key. Think about it, how many times have you made/ordered a burger, sure it was huge, but had a hard time eating it because the bun was total crap and way too small? Boogies does it right. Fresh buns, every day, big enough to actually fit their big sloppy patties.
I absolutely love Boogies. In fact, its one of the (very, very few) things I miss about Calgary. Number one is my mother, and a super close number two is Boogies. So what.
Anyways, these guys have been keeping it awesome for years, real simple and real delicious. Peters is a creepy joke, and Veras Burgers (in Vancouver) in no way stacks up to the more realistic sized, juicy and well crafted burgers Boogies slings. 
Might I suggest getting an \"Old Elvis\" milkshake? Yea. Bacon bits. 
And at the risk of picking on someone (which I love doing, but is usually not considered \"cool\" on the internet).. That Jordan L. probably just has a case of beef envy. 

Possibly the only time I will quote anything:
Frankie says relax."}
{"text":"Boogie's has changed a lot, and in a good way, since I went 5 years ago. Apparently its the Tubby Dog people who took this little place over. It has expanded, is  bright, clean and has a good size menu. The burgers always include lettuce, tomato and red sauce. We ordered a single patty with cheese and a Sam's (a fried egg on top of the burger) with cheese. 
We realized that the people after us had gotten their food before us,so when we inquired about it, turns out they lost the order slip. 
One of the gentlemen behind the counter promptly took our order again, and they gave us a FULL REFUND! 
This is a suprise, because most places would comp. your drinks or one meal, but we received it all back..very impressive.
Our food followed quickly along with a million apologies from another gentleman who worked behind the counter. We thanked them again and told them not to worry, mistakes happen.
Back to the food, when it came out, the burgers were so big they had a knife sticking upright inside, so you can cut it in half. They were very good,  especially for the price, and fresh. I dont think I saw a menu item over $9 and that was for the ginormous specialty burgers.
I will definately be coming back, I like the food so far, the way they went over and above service wise, and its a funky, casual little place open AFTER 3 pm on Sunday."}
{"text":"landmark definition

landmark (-m√§rk)

noun

   1. any fixed object used to mark the boundary of a piece of land
   2. any prominent feature of the landscape, as a tree or building, serving to identify a particular locality
   3. an event, discovery, etc. considered as a high point or turning point in the history or development of something.

What's this, you say?

You're 'old-fashioned' AND 'neighbourly'?

You have been known to dispense in generous quantities?

You've been open since 1969 and were formerly owned by Gus Pieters (previous owner of Peter's Drive-In)?

Then, come on down!

Spin the wheel and roast in the collective embers of this city's historic culinary mediocrity! 

Here's the formula for your GUARANTEED success:

1) As aforementioned, once MUST place an emphasis on being called a 'landmark.' That's it! Just tell em' you've been around a LONG time! The longer the better! How bad could a place be if it's been around 40 plus years?!

2) Create a small, albeit unremarkable kitsch appeal that will somehow add to that 'old fashioned' charm we talked about earlier. Not too fancy now. Maybe an arcade machine? Or two? How about frogger? I loved frogger as a kid! Who didn't?! They don't make games like they used to...

3) Create an environment for staff that is almost laid back enough to the point where seeming like you are 'trying' would be off-putting. C'mon. Sometimes a chap just wants to coddle his beef. It's been a long day!

4) Pick a supplier, any supplier. Sysco? Get in there, bad boy! Come up with a 'homemade' sauce. Remember, it's a secret! Now, feed those hungry masses! Big portions! No discerning palates here!

The first, and possibly only time a Genesis song will be quoted.:

You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end up with a whistle and end with a bang
and all of us fit in our places."}
{"text":"Since moving to Alberta from Manitoba several years ago, I have been trying to find a burger that comes close to one of the Fat Boys you can find at any number of burger joints in Winnipeg. I had high hopes after seeing the enthusiasm for this place on You Gotta Eat Here. 

I was happy to find this place has a parking lot, and there were only a few people ahead of me in line at the counter on the weekday evening of my visit. Everyone ordered a milkshake, so I figured I had to. The pineapple milkshake I chose was absolutely delicious. Smooth and creamy, with tiny pieces of pineapple throughout.

Then, there was the burger. I get that it's novel to have a burger topped with fried mac and cheese bites or a hotdog, but I felt that the burger itself was lacking. Rather than complementing the patty, the toppings and the red sauce overwhelmed what little flavour the burger had on its own. I could have tossed the patty and it would have tasted the same. 

I would have given Boogies 5 stars for the milkshake and cool 80s decor, but I came for the burger... so 3 it is. 

Bottom line: I'm still on the hunt for anything as good as a Winnipeg Fat Boy in Alberta."}
{"text":"Of course the food is good, I don't think I can add anything to the previous reviews.  I did want to add my rating though, after my experience tonight.

We ordered their chicken burgers (can't remember the name), and last time we got it it was a little spicy, so I asked them to do less spice this time.  When they brought the burgers out, instead of less spice, they had put more spice on!  (My husband had added bacon, etc., etc. to his, so I couldn't just trade burgers)  I mentioned the extra spice to them, they rushed to make me a new burger, both the waitress who brought me my food and the one who took my order came and apologized, they refunded the cost of my burger, and sent my husband home with the extra spice burger (since he doesn't mind!)

Customer service like that is what will keep you in service.  I wish I knew the two waitress' names because they were amazing.  Thanks!  We will of course be back."}
{"text":"This is a must stop for burger lovers. Whenever I have guests in from out of town, this is one of the places I take them. Portions are huge and the burgers can get a little messy but it is well worth it. The parking lot is also a little small. It is sometimes easier to park in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Top. Notch. Just moved back to Calgary and am stoked to know that 10 years later Boogies is still just as awesome as I remembered. I was having the toughest time choosing what to have and the rock star behind the counter helped steer me the right way. I had a \"boog mac\" which was all things a burger should be: messy, a spot on bun to patty ratio, and so many amazing pickles. Seriously get extra pickles. She told me to go with the yam fries and offered a lemon garlic dip to go with. This? STELLAR choice! Had a hard time deciding if the fries or the dip was the star of that show and will have to try it again to know for sure ;) Great burgers, parking, awesome service, and arcade games for while you wait, which was not very long at all."}
{"text":"The absolute best burger joint in the world. Every single time I go there I'm blown away with how good their hamburgers are. Try the Keith's burger..... get an extra patty or two.....mmmmmmmmmmm....i'm just waiting till noon so I can go get one. Love this place"}
{"text":"Well this place definitely surprised me.. burgers were really good but what got me was the milkshake i tried the Young Elvis and words cannot describe the joy i felt while drinking that i could barely form words let alone speak to my cousin! That is one dam good milkshake!! As for the burgers i tried the Boog-Mak and thought it was really good definitely above average but not the best burger ive ever eaten. My cousin had the poutine as well and said it was awesome and shes like the poutine queen so try that one!"}
{"text":"I got a Huge burger. You will not leave hungry after eating here. Came here after reading the reviews and it's really good. All the protein you need for a week in one burger."}
{"text":"Boogies is a great burger place.   My kids always ask to go there.   The veggie burger is great and the shakes are great.   Portions are very large.

Love the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Boogie's rocks (!) and this not just from me but my teenagers...
Word is that the owner used to own Peter's Drive In -- so for you unaware folks still doin the big lineup over at Peter's , the quality has moved over to Boogie's! 
The variety and creativity of the burgers is amazing, and the vibe (with old video game consoles and what you'll see on the walls) is cool. 
Ask for their special hot sauce, costs extra but it will knock your socks off.  Not for the wimps but worth it! 
The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I notice the patties getting a little thinner than before... Just sayin. 
We keep coming back though... can't help it! ;-)"}
{"text":"Dear Boogie's Burgers,

I visited you quite a few weeks ago and was quite impressed by your Jerk Chicken burger.  The patty was a little small but it was full of flavour and had just the right amount of spice.  

I returned recently to indulge in my burger cravings and I have to say my second visit left an even deeper impression than the first.  I enjoyed the Sam's Burger this time around and shared a large portion of Spicy Fries and a Bacon Maple milkshake with my significant other.  For someone who doesn't usually like fries as my side, I enjoyed your Spicy Fries and would actually order them again.  It tasted a little like Onion Rings in the form of fries.  Delicious!  The highlight of the meal (besides the fried egg on my burger) was definitely the Bacon Maple milkshake.  A yummy maple milkshake with salty bacon bits in it.  The sweet and salty mixture works really well.  That is something I have recommended to my peers.  Your generous portion sizes left me reliving the awesome meal when I had leftover burger for lunch the next day.  

The service I experienced at your joint was awesome.  Everyone was genuinely friendly and seemed really relax.  The ambiance and decor of your place suited the food perfectly.  I will definitely be back!

Sincerely,
T"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. If you want to try something new, try \"Fat Elvis\"..lol. Staffs are amazing and made me feel at home."}
{"text":"I tried the mushroom burger with cheese and it was awesome. I will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"My husband I came here in the midafternoon, which was less busy, and something I would recommend. I tried the chicken and the veggie patties.  The chicken was very moist, but the veggieburger was nothing to brag about. My husband had a traditional burger, the blazing saddles, which he thoroughly enjoyed.

We also tried the poutine, which was excellent!

The mac & cheese fritters were piping hot and worth a try.

To finish off, we tried both the fat Elvis and the mini donut shakes. The fat Elvis was wonderful, and the mini donut was good.

This is a really neat place to try out!"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've had in Calgary. That red sauce is crazy good! Love the Jebb's and gotta have a fat Elvis shake."}
{"text":"Big homemade burgies with a unique selection of them to choose from. I'm a bigmac lover so their version of it was definitely tasty.  Love the old video games and old-school feel of the place."}
{"text":"Funky decor, unique, flavourful and massive burgers, amazing onion rings, great service! Definitely somewhere to go when you're craving a big burger in a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was in for work and had to give this spot a try, I had the peanut butter cup shake and it was amazing!

I also tried one of the burgers with the hotdogs as topping and it was great, beef was full of flavor. 

I asked the staff for some advice and they were not super helpful. Spicy fries were great.  

Atmosphere of the restaurant was great and also clean."}
{"text":"They really do amazing burgers here. 
Classic, flavorful beef with an amazing house sauce... 

Definitely a step above Peters Drive In!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Boogies Burgers that hasn't already been said? 

This place is just pure awesome. Order anything and you won't be sorry. 
I'm still waiting for the day I can try Doug's \"Don't Fear the Reaper\" Burger. Definitely saving that for a lazy Sunday when someone can drive me home after cause I expect to slip into a coma the second I finish it."}
{"text":"After seeing Boogies on..You Gotta Eat Here .. I had to give it a go. I am surprised this place made it on the show !  I  had a Fays Burger and my hubby had a pizza burger . We were both disappointed with the lack of taste. I had to add salt  with hopes of putting some flavour into the burger. The burger patties were very thin ...  Wheres the beef came to  mind.  the fries were ok .very small bowl  for a large order.. 
The time it took to get our meal was an eternity ... the thin burger should have cooked in a shorter time. The bun was huge and overtook the meat....VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Will never be going back."}
{"text":"Best cheap burger in town. Skip Peters and try this place instead!"}
{"text":"I'm slow. Slow in that it has taken me 8 years of living in Calgary and 8 months of living 2 blocks away to come here. Good things come to those who wait? I think so.

I stopped in for a \"to go\" order mid afternoon on a Sunday after a driving adventure with my hounds. It was busy but there was a spot right in front, despite the teeny lot.

So many burgers to choose from. I couldn't find a named one that matched what I wanted so I just asked for the combo of toppings. No problem! She quickly confirmed what would normally be on the burger most like what I picked - appreciated. I got fries with gravy as a side. Go big or go home, I say.

I was getting it  to go so I found a little nook to stand in. There seemed to be a non stop stream of people coming and going but everything flowed well. Everyone seemed super friendly and there was a welcoming vibe to the place. Where else are their families with young kids, bikers, exchange students, punks, preps and hipsters happily intermingling? And everything in between?

Food was fantastic. Good old greasy spoon delicious. Portions were large and price was decent. Everything was still warm when I got it home. Perfect. I'm glad I finally got around to coming here."}
{"text":"The original owner where fantastic then came along new owners......they look like our am rica cousin from Alabama attitude..."}
{"text":"I can't say I have ever been to a restaurant in Calgary that evokes such deep nostalgic feelings within me. It's the embodiment of the retro-style burger place. In fact, sitting inside eating my Blazing Saddles burger with Yam Fries on top of a Donkey Kong table arcade game made me pause and think about how I was doing this exact same thing over 20 years ago. I had to smile because in those days it was just a single burger hold the onions (my mouth wasn't near as big as it is now) and I smashed buttons to 1942 rather than DK. A number of quarters were lost in the process!

The burgers were stellar. Not just from a taste perspective, but I found them lighter and cleaner than say a Peter's burger. The yam fries had a really deep flavour. I was almost shocked at how much I enjoyed them because you just don't expect too much from burger joints these days. 

To top it all off, the service is amazing. The staff actually checked up on us twice to see if we were enjoying our meal and if everything was ok.  

It isn't cheap. $8 for a Blazing Saddles burger, $4.75 for a single, $2.50 for yam fries which puts it on par with Burger Inn territory. Given the choice of the two, I'd take Boogies over the Inn even though it's farther away for me. It's worth the ride!

I love it here! One of my favourites in Calgary!"}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty, and you can't beat the funky retro decor.

reasonably priced, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Blazin' Saddles is the best spicy burger ever.  Great for a sit down diner burger experience.  Old school arcade game and punk ambiance.  Shakes are tasty.  They're licensed too if you want a cold one."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and helpful, our food came out quickly and was AMAZING. The mac and cheese burger caused me to inhale my food at an alarming and somewhat disgusting rate!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow!
I either just ate you, or the best burger ever!
I've never been to this place and didn't know anything about it till today.
The burger I had was the best burger I've ever had!
I loved the atmosphere and the pictures and paintings on the wall.
The prices were awesome, and the quality of the food was really good.
Very helpful and funny and polite staff.
I had Keith's burger and I finished my experience with mint chocolate chips milkshake!
I think I consumed a lot of calories for lunch but I don't even care!!!!!
I'll definitely go back there and this place is already one of my favourite places!"}
{"text":"Peek-a-boo Boogies, I found another burger joint for myself. The 80's old school theme including video games: Pac-man, and street-fighter totally classic memory as childhood. Boogies staff was friendly and always walk around to do a quality check on each tables. Oh the burgers, I order Frey's Burger; single huge flatted beef patty with 2 slice of bacon, fried mushroom and onion topped with tomato, lettuce and mushroom sauce cover by extra-large sesame hamburger bun plus I order additional fried egg on top of patty. It was humongous burger I saw in Cow-town. Beside the burger, I also order a side of deep fried onion rings and bottle of classic Coca-Cola (Just to be 80's mood at Boogies). And my friend order a Book-Mak burger as their own parody of McD's Big-Mac, and a peanut-butter milkshake. As conclusion analyst at Boogies Burger: classic old school theme, awesome staff and, oversize delicious burger and other American Classic food menu items. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Boogies regularly for more than 5 years. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Boogies Burgers. Tons of selection and the food is so good and comforting (also their milkshakes are  the bomb - forget Peters). 

The staff are ALWAYS super friendly, and clearly enjoy their jobs.. making for a great atmosphere throughout. 

The diner vibe is on point and the outside patio is chill. The space is full of fun colorful wall art and there also a few arcade games inside for your entertainment.

Always excited to see what they've got set up for the tip jar challenge, and I still get a kick out of the picture of Ice T on the Ice Tea fountain pop. 

#iloveboogies"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burgers especially the double patty, and the bread seems to be egg bread which is delicious, and the onion rings were spectacular however the chairs and tables are very squished together and very cheap plastic and unfortunately even though I was very clear when I ordered, they screwed up my order. I wanted two burgers and a set of fries and a side of onion rings, one burger and one onion ring was for takeout and I was going to bring to a friend, and the rest I was eating in because I was starving.....I got my meal within 15 minutes but it took over an hour for the rest of my food which was take out. Why would that take so much time, I had to talk to three different staff and nobody knew what I was talking about even though I had paid already for everything. Rather frustrating ....but great quality beef patties, clearly never been frozen, very delicious."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Always packed Everytime  I go there. I try to come here whenever i visit Calgary. Food is awesome, burgers are always so tasty and juicy. The buns are so fresh and soft. I had the Jebbs doggie burger and it was phenomenal!!! Has patty, bacon and hot dog, how can u go wrong??? Also got a fat Elvis milkshake, a must try! 
Can't wait to have another boogie burger when i go to Calgary!!"}
{"text":"4-1/2 stars, actually.

I'd heard a lot about this place, as it always appears at the top, or close-to-the-top, in my \"Best Burgers of Calgary\" queries. So, I absolutely *had* to check them out next opportunity I got, and check them out I did.

First, let me say that the environment was very cool: Ms. Pac Man arcade game reminded me of my childhood in the '80s (yes, I know I just dated myself!) and the tables and chairs were reminiscent of the era, too! I simply loved it.

The people behind the counter were helpful, fun, engaged, and very accommodating to me, and they were able to suggest a great burger and accompanying shake (I chose the Doggie Burger and Chocolate shake).

The most important thing here is this: Both were *absolutely fantastic* !!! The burger was the best I've had in Calgary (top 5 or maybe top 3 best burger EVER for me!) and the shake was excellent. My only quibble (and why they lose 1/2 a star here) was that the spicy fries just didn't quite work for me; I didn't like the extra bite the fries provided. I should've stuck with traditional fries. OK. Live and learn. I ate a few of them anyway, with little problem.

It's a fairly small hole-in-the-wall operation just off Edmonton Trail in the NE with limited parking, that nevertheless serves life-changing experience in the form of burgers. I heartily recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is based off my recent vacation to Banff/Calgary.

Location/Service:
The restaurant is relatively close to the airport, so it was a good grab before boarding the plane.  Parking is very limited as it was in a very small plaza.  It may look a little sketchy on the outside, but inside is very retro with a 1990s theme.  

Staff were all nice, attentive and friendly/easy to talk to.


Food:
Ordered the mushroom burger - they make the burgers fresh so the patty was well done and juicy.  The mushroom sauce also added a kick to the burger along with fried onions.  Portion was also enough for a quick meal - if you want to add fries/milkshake to that, would make a perfect lunch/dinner.

There are a few burger joints around town and this unexpectedly was above my expectations - would definitely come back again if I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great burger. The service was friendly and the atmosphere fun and relaxed. I'm somewhat of a burger snob, so I wish the paties were just a little bit bigger. I would recommend getting two patties. 

The beef had a juicy rich flavor, so I recommend not overdoing it on the toppings. 

Voted the best burger in Calgary and I can see why. Don't skip this place if you love a good burger."}
{"text":"old fashioned, with PAC man,street fighter all kinds of old game machine. Ordered the huge Doug $18, small mini donut milkshake. About 25 in total. The decor is so adorable"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Calgary, Boogies is a must. Great burgers, super fries and delicious milk shakes. My wife calls the butterscotch shake, sipalicious. Seriously, the burgers are the best. If you like a big burger, Shawns is the best in its class. It is not for the timid eater, 3 patties, two slices of bacon, fried egg, lettuce, onion, tomato, and cheese on request. The only warning is that you may need to see a cardiologist afterwards."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - cool old arcade tables and games to enjoy. The burgers are pretty good, the sides (yam fries, spicy fries, onion rings), are great and the milkshakes are AWESOME."}
{"text":"This place will become a staple of my visits to Calgary. Push up your sleeves, make sure you get extra napkins and open wide. Our burger cravings were satisfied after a long day and it came with a side of sweet video games, and milk shakes so good your eyes will bug outta your head."}
{"text":"This place is classic -- straight up 1980's burger joint. From the old-school diner feel to the Powell/Peralta poster on the wall to the Arkanoid arcade game stashed in a corner it screams \"burgerama.\" And the menu matches 100%. Think huge, gut-busting burgers served up in all sorts of artery-clogging abominations that range from single- to triple-patty complete with iceburg lettuce, thousand island, fries, onion rings and milkshakes. 

If you're in the mood for a fancy, grilled-to-order house-ground chuck burger on a brioche bun, Boogies is not the place for you. No, these are order-'em-up-and-chow-'em-down classics... some with a fancied up twist. My burger choice was a Boog-Mac - their take on the McD's classic - two patties with cheese, special sauce and a giant bun. It was tasty and HUGE. Add in some insanely good seasoned fries (with gravy, of course, it's Canada!) and you have yourself a meal that packs an entire day's worth of calories on one plate. 

Friendly folks ready to school you on the Boogies way of doing things complete the whole picture. It's down home in every way. I can definitely dig it."}
{"text":"The burgers are 2/5.  The sweet potato fries, the service, and the look and feel are more like 4/5.  But since this is a burger place and since the burgers let me down, I'm going to give them the lower score.

I ordered a burger with a single patty and a fried egg on top.  The patty was about half as thick as a typical burger, and the egg was... well I'm not sure how they did it, but it seemed like a large but thin flat slice of egg white covering the burger.

I was hoping for a standard fried egg thrown on top of a burger thicker than you'd get at McDonald's, yolk leaking out and all.  One that's a little hard to get into your mouth.  I think if they can get that going, they'll really be onto something."}
{"text":"3 stars! Burgers are piping hot, very well garnished and delishishness. Served fairly quickly with much friendliness. 
Poutine is wellllllllll below average, few curds, store bought gravy and obvious mccain fries. Also was sitting awhile, served barely warm :("}
{"text":"Some of the 'whole in the wall' places tend to be the best. Boogies is a perfect example. Doesn't seem like anything special at first glance but it was awesome. Great menu. Lots of options you wouldn't find anywhere else (like crushed Dorito's on your burger). Maple bacon milkshake had real pieces of bacon throughout!"}
{"text":"I HAD to go to Boogie's. I drive past it every day and know they are not open late so today was a day I could take advantage and go try their food for my first time. I had heard good things and also read some good reviews. I am not as much of a burger person as my husband so I had to bring him along too for an added opinion! We arrived, got one of the last parking spots (just a small little plaza, be prepped to park on the road) and in we went - greeted nicely and promptly. The place was cheery and bright, brought me back to the 80's with the Ms Pacman and Donkey Kong video games! We perused the menu at the counter and we made our first mistakes. When you find a place known to serve a good, fresh burger, why mess it up by ordering a \"novelty\" burger? I wanted to have a special burger for some reason and strayed from my tried and true lettuce, tomato, extra onion and ketchup. Sigh. So, starving and my eyes wild from the ample choices, I ordered the Fay burger that had 1 patty, fried mushrooms, fried onion, the regular fixins' and mushroom sauce. Did I NOT think that this would be a mushy burger? Sigh... so when the burger came, I had to eat it as fast as I could and any thoughts I had of taking half of it home with me were dashed. Just too messy and the lettuce in the burger would not have lasted the trip home due to the mushroom sauce. It was not a bad burger - at all - but as I was eating, I was craving fresh, crisp onions, crunchy lettuce and tomato and would have liked to have tasted the patty more. I messed up! The size of the burger was good, knife through the centre to keep it together. The sesame bun, just OK. I like mine a little softer. Boogie's boasts that they have 100% fresh burgers, Alberta beef to boot, this is a good thing. My husband had a Sam's burger that had 2 patties, signature red sauce, fried egg and the fixins'. He was not keen on the red sauce which was a mix of ketchup and relish. He wishes too that he would have kept the burger simple. We each ordered a small fry and we could have easily split one. I very rarely eat fries - when I do I want them to be very good but they were just average. We had a nice booth and the restaurant was not that busy so it was an enjoyable place to have a late lunch. I give this visit 2 stars but I am going to try it again another time, keeping it simple by ordering a burger I know I want in the first place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this burger place for a year and we finally did about a month ago. The place is nostalgic, where there's old video games. The burger was okay. The patty alone was tasty, but it wasn't served warm to us. The milkshakes were great, and the chili fries that we ordered was good too."}
{"text":"A through and through calgary jewel. The best burger under $10 anywhere in the world! These people know how to make a burger. The only thing that requires improvement is the fries! However that shouldnt take away from the fact that the burgers are perhaps the best in the world and hence get a 5 star rating from me."}
{"text":"Way better burgers then peters!!!!awsome milkshakes too don't let what the outside looks like fool you its well worth the stop."}
{"text":"I went here with my bf and I ordered the Deep Fried Mac 'n' Cheese burger and he got the Keith's burger. We also got a chocolate milkshake and pumpkin pie milkshake, as well as the spicy fries. 

My burger was delicious, although the bun didn't have much substance. The party was good and the deep fried mac and cheese wedges were to die for! The spicy fries were just regular fries covered in cayenne pepper, and not really anything to write home about. The milkshakes were nice and thick and full of flavour! The pumpkin pie shake even had graham crackers blended into it. 

The place was fairly clean and had lots of cool artwork on the walls, as well as some old school arcade games. Service was also great. 

I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Went with the family, had a great time. Burgers are worth it, considering they are big and filling. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I have a burger-loving husband but going to a burger joint for a non-beef eater like me is typically not terribly enticing. Boogies has several options for pesco pollo vegetarians so we have found a place that works for both of us. 

My husband loves their burgers although he finds them messy. I have had their Buffalo Chicken burger and their National Lampoon Hawaiian Vacation burger - both very tasty but messy too. Even being served with a huge steak knife which allows you to cut the beast in half, it still requires eating near a steady supply of napkins! They would earn a fifth star if they used unprocessed chicken breasts for their chicken burgers. 

Boogie's milkshakes are outstanding. I have had the mochaccino both times I have been and it is bliss in a cup. The first time we went we also split a small order of spicy fries, which tasted okay, but it was just too much food. We now forgo sides and just go for a burger and small milkshake. 

The decor with vintage arcade games and luchador masks is fun, the employees nice and the food really good so definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"It takes CRAZY MEN to run Boogies. Word on the street is one of them has to fend off the crazies by taking it out on his unsuspecting victims as a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Blue Belt. Somebody get this guy a TV show, I didn't even notice John Catucci. Actually somebody get the Don't Fear the Reaper burger because that thing was a BEAUT.

Great atmosphere. Then again to me a vintage street fighter console would make a construction sight feel like home.

The burgers? What can I say...WHAT CAN I SAY? Stellar embed within every molecule of its very being. I'm not kidding. It's meat on everything that makes my calorie tracker app have a heart attack.

In my recent visit I had their burger, fries, and a milkshake. Plain? YOUR FACE IS PLAIN because I could tell you what lies in between. Maybe a lil bacon (on the milkshake), a lil fancy cheese, a lil produce, a lil berimbolo... ce....la....vie..."}
{"text":"Bright colours, retro show posters, Ms. Pacman and that satisfying feeling you get when they clip your receipt to the line and zing it into the kitchen, make this one of my favourite burger spots in town! 

Wait, even if you forget about all that awesome, the fan-freakin-tastic burgers make this one of my favourite burger spots in town! 

They don't aim to give you the thickest fattest burger you've ever had. They're actually kind of thin but they go on forever!  Instead of serving a giant meatball, a Boogies burger is all about circumference and they dwarf the plate they arrive on. You will make a mess and you will have a good time doing it. By having a thinner , wider burger, they nail the bun to topping to meat ratio with every bite! Well, almost. Doing this perfectly is an impossibility. This ratio is the pi of burger building, but Boogies has it accurate to approximately 3261 digits.

I've been working my way through the menu the last couple years and I haven't really found an absolute favourite. Jebb's Doggy Burger is a crafty concoction, with a filleted and fried hot dog adorning the top. A fantastic choice. 

I'd also be pretty quick to recommend the Deep Fried Mac 'n' Cheese Burger. Instead of a cheese slice, this monster has deep fried mac 'n' cheese wedges keeping your burger hot and gooey in the best kind of way.

I guess what I'm really trying to say is: Go here for much yum!!!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this gem a while back. I have been multiple times since. I cant remember all the different burgers I have had, but I can tell you I have never been disappointed(or walked away hungry).

The experience starts when you walk in. Greeted by a smiling face, handed a menu and they will answer any questions. They have a good sized menu, and everything is reasonably priced.

They are a licensed restaurant, so you can enjoy a beer with supper. 

The spicy fries are ok, but really just covered in a bunch of spices that make them less desirable than the regular fries."}
{"text":"THE SHAKES ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! And the portion to price ratio is also very fair, it's great for a pickier eater because of the variety. Which also helps to please the adventurous diners who want to try the craziest concoctions."}
{"text":"Had higher expectations - very casual spot for a quick bite, but bun was dry and place didn't feel terribly clean. Burger flavour was lacklustre."}
{"text":"We made two trips to Boogies, the first to try timed there was a death in the family so the store was closed. That spoke to the family aspect of the business

We undesrtood when we were watching folks get their food, that a lot of  the regulars were known by name at Boogies.

I loved my Blazin' Saddles  burger.  But I really, really needed my shake to take the heat out of my mouth and it was late coming.  It was small, but thick and cold.

I'll be more adventuresome next time.  I think I'll try an Angry Aztec.   

My son loved his Sam's burger with the egg on it and fries and shake.   My husband, watching the dollars add up to a whopping $64.00 for four burgers, large and small fries and three shakes and a soft drink (he gave a tip, though) was not so impressed.

But this is a Born Calgarian man who loved Bob's Burgers (Gus Peters' brother) and Willy's when they were around.  For him Boogies is a 'new' place.

Boogies has great atmosphere,  good service,  and some interesting attitude.  Their two line advertisement for a part time cook warned \"Flakes and Cat-People need not apply\".  The painted trash can in the washroom was gorgeous!  

it was easy to see that Gus Peters did start out in the location way back in 'the day' when Cowtown was more cow than oil.   But Boogies has its own style, its own flavour and it's own following.

That is has regulars and a family feel speaks volumes about the kind of place it is."}
{"text":"Oh Boogies, you're sooooo close to being perfect!

First of all I have to say the second I walked into Boogies for the first time, I fell in love. From the vintage arcade games (that still only cost a quarter! I didn't know such a thing was still possible!) to the bright colored, semi-artsy (with a touch of child-like craziness) decor, to the fact that they have luchadore (mexican wrestler) masks across the top of one wall, everything about this place just screamed \"FUN\" - and that just gets better when you look at the menu that's filled with humorously named burger descriptions I would never have thought of in a million years. I mean, where else could you get the burger my friend had which had what I believe was 4 paddies (could have been more), more bacon and cheese then could possibly be necessary... and HOT DOGS on top of it? I felt like I was looking at the Burger equivilent of Tubby Dog.

The staff were all great, and incredibly friendly (even remembered my friends order from two days prior) and made the whole experience even better.

Now for the couple things I wasn't too crazy about. The first couple times I eat at a place I like to try not to play around with ingredients too much, to see what they put together - so I went for the two-patty version of their standard burger, hold the tomatoes... which meant I tried their \"signature red sauce\". Normally I don't get too adventurous when it comes to things so generically described, and this was a perfect example of why. It definitely had a distinctive taste to it, but I really wasn't a fan and there was WAAAAAAAAY too much of it, to the point that my whole burger was basically falling apart by the fourth bite.

The other negative point is that this place can be a little pricey, especially if you order one of the bigger burgers. For the one my friend ordered (I believe it was \"Doug's Burger\" or something similar) and a milk shake it ran up to over 15 bucks, which is nothing compared to an actual formal restaurant meal, but for a burger (esp. with no sides or anything) seems a bit steap.

Now, I've since discovered that the same thing, when ordered with barbecue sauce instead is a little slice of heaven... but that could just be my own preference... so by all means, if you're feeling adventurous, give it a try.

Also, definitely try their milkshakes! I can't even remember what I had the couple previous times (though I know I've never had a bad one here) last time I went I tried the Pina Calada and... WHOA! First of all, this isn't one of those cheap places where they add a scoop of artificial flavoring. This shake was loaded with shredded coconut and little chunks of pineapple that made every suck on the straw into a slightly different, yet always amazing experience.... well, except for the couple times when I'd get too much of these little fruit chunks too quickly and the straw would get blocked... but it was MORE than worth it.

At it's core, Boogies is one of the greatest Burger joints I'd ever been too... had it not been for the \"red sauce\" experience, it would be a spotless record, but I guess you're probably better off not taking such nitpicky advice from a picky eater such as myself. My only advice would be GO.... NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Boogies has a classic and retro feel all the way from the lighting fixtures, yellow chairs, blue tables, to the arcade games(Ms. PacMan, Robocop, Burger Time and Street Fighter).   The boys and I were wanting to give this place a try for a while now but haven't gotten around to doing so until today.   Though there was a steady stream of customers, our friendly server Angela took the time to fill us in on the family history of Boogies (established in 1969).

I ordered a Fay's Burger and it was super juicy and packed with flavour.  The combination of the single beef patty with fried mushrooms with sauce, bacon, fried (not raw) onions, lettuce and tomato was a match made in heaven (and I'm crazy about mushrooms!).   Hubby seemed impressed with Sam's Burger (single patty, Cheddar, fried egg, Boogies' signature red sauce, added bacon, lettuce, tomato).

Don't be fooled by the thin burger patty, folks--it's so moist and juicy that you can see steam coming out of it after one bite!  Our teenage son ordered Doug's \"Don't Fear the Reaper\" burger (four beef patties, four bacon slices, butterflied beef wieners, Cheddar, fried egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, and topped off with a mini corn dog).  There was steam rising from the remnants of his beef patties even when he was down to his last four bites.  Be warned, this burger is not for the faint of heart...

Our side of yam fries were delightfully crispy and seasoned perfectly.  There was not a single soggy fry in our order.   My coconut milkshake was thick, rich, and topped generously with toasted coconut.  I only wish that I had a wider straw.

Boogies is definitely our favourite burger joint from now on!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Small homey feel with great burgers ! Tried two of the veggie burgers and the hot tots and have nothing to complain about.  Next time will try a milkshake !"}
{"text":"Very fun environment located closed to downtown. The price is reasonable and the portion is big enough! Very kind people working there and the service is good. I like this place and always recommend to my friends. One thing I don't like about this place is the working hour. Open until 9 pm on Sturdays!!!"}
{"text":"As an American, I have issues with many Canadian burgers. The ones that taste as if they were made with actual ground meat tend to be more well done than I like. The only time I can get a medium well burger is when the place i'm ordering from makes a mistake.

And then you have a number of fast food burgers with rubbery textures (Harvey's).

And while the patty served at Boogie's is thinner than even the average fast food patty, this is ok when you need to serve your burgers well done anyway. The thin patty leads a better mouthfeel in this circumstance, especially when the burger comes with deep fried macaroni and cheese wedges on top! The combination of the creamy mac and cheese, Boogies' signature red sauce, made for something juicy and delicious.

The \"spicy fries\" were not only well seasoned, but perfectly crisp.

Boogies' buns are fresh, springy, and shaped in squares.

And the only topping that Boogies is missing is Chili!"}
{"text":"Wow what a place. If you can't find it here, you don't need it. Great vibe from the fabulous people who prepare your meal. Video games and pinball machines. Yes! Mmm yes!! Milkshakes are worth trying. I think they have a flavour for everyone? Oh yeah did I mention that they serve burgers?"}
{"text":"I came to Boogies mostly because I'd heard it on TV (You Gotta Eat Here), but also because it was really easy to find. Like really easy, and considering I get lost in Calgary whenever I go there that was a good thing. 

Moving on (because I know you don't care about my directionally challengedness) Boogies Burgers was awesome. I loved the decor, the bright orange, early 80's throwback. And I loved that they had arcade games. Donkey Kong, Pac Man, StreetFighter - oh hells yeah. 

This is a burger place, and so the burgers are what really matter, and luckily the burger I had (Sam's burger) was delicious. This burger had a burger patty, cheddar, a fried egg, lettuce,tomato, and onion. The burger is also served with Boogie's homemade red sauce (ketchup). The burger was huge, and while the patty wasn't super thick it was moist and delicious. The red sauce was a great alternate (less sweet) ketchup. I also ordered some onion rings, which had the perfect batter to onion ratio and was cooked perfectly. There was a spicy jelly, kind of like a Thai chili sauce on the table that went great with the onion rings. Service was great, and pretty quick (not fast food quick, but my meal was out within 10mins). 
 
For about $15 I got a filling and delicious meal (including a drink). I'll be back to Boogies Burgers again."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm booooooogies ! I have passed by boogies so many times in my life but I won't be again . I had a Boog Mac burger with bacon , it was cooked to perfection ! The burger meat was very tasty and cooked the way a burger should be . We also shared some onion rings , fries and the deep fried  mac and cheese wedges . The rings were classic and crispy , the fries were thin on size but big on taste ! The wedges were fun and different but I would recommend giving them a try ! The only item that wasn't top of the line would have been the shake I had , it was a chocolate banana that really didn't have enough banana to it . I will be happy to go back and will not be Cruisin by any longer :D"}
{"text":"In my family,  Boogies was a legend my dad would talk about from \"before I was born\".  However,  Boogies is different (much to his lamenting) and I assume it's because it's now a place for funky toppings and my dad is very much meat in bun when it comes to such things. 

I hadn't given Boogies much pause because I'm a vegetarian but I was eventually curious to check out the menu and discovered veggie patties (woot) and upon visiting I discovered I could make any burger with a veggie pattie which is just awesome to me. 

I've tried the mac and cheese burger this time, the spicy fries and a milk shake.   I have to say I'm not a fan of the mac and cheese burger -  the burger is good and the mac and cheese wedges are good but I don't really taste the wedges on the burger.   Next time I'll have a burger and maybe wedges on the side.    The fries are ok,  but I didn't need a large as that was way too much of a good thing.   The star of the trip was the milkshakes.  Way better than a nearby iconic milk shake place -  I made chocolate mango oreo and there were real bits of fruit and oreo in there that needed some chewing (this might be weird but I was pro chewing delicious shake bits). 

All and all I would go back."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall restaurant left us disappointed after driving across town based on a recommendation. We passed by Peter's Drive In to try the shakes here and left feeling like we missed our turn. 

The restaurant equivalent to a dive bar, it is small, cramped and dated to the early 80's. Some might call it quaint and nostalgic, but it feels more like no updates have been made since the 80's rather than an intentional choice. The clientele were as rough as the surroundings and the milkshakes were soupy in texture and syrupy in flavor. 

I'd recommend Smashburger over this experience."}
{"text":"Elvis is in the house yes besides great burgers they also have a young Elvis and a old Elvis milkshake both are great.

ALL burgers are made while you wait so it's not what you would call fast food but it certainly good food.

Well worth a visit"}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a diner that serves vegetarian burgers in this city that isn't a total rip off. Reasonably priced and delicious for those that want their veggie burger fill. Delicious onion rings as well."}
{"text":"Over the last couple of years my SO kept talking about Boogies Burgers and how he would visit whenever he was in the area at lunch hour. This, however, never helps me because I am NEVER in the area at lunch hour. Which is why we made a special trip last night to check it out.

Boogies Burgers is delicious! I had the veggie burger, and the patty was delicious, a great texture, and even stood up well over the course of my meal. WELL DONE! These are all incredibly challenging things to accomplish with a veggie burger. Believe me. Patties can be difficult when made of beans that spread and separate rather than stick together. 

Also enjoyed a PB and J milkshake. Don't knock it till you've tried it! The strawberry jam and peanut butter was actually delicious and not at all weird as a milkshake."}
{"text":"A single cheese burger is a meal.  Soft tasty bun with a great meaty burger and interesting sause.  Loved the burger."}
{"text":"Our first meal after landing in Calgary. We were in need of some good burgers after a 3 hour flight.

PARKING: Very tiny lot, about 12 cars max. We were lucky to get one of the last spots, but it was a bit difficult to park since the spaces were cramped as well. 

RESTAURANT: Very small, casual sit-down kind of restaurant, you order at the counter and they bring out the food to you. Restaurant is very family friendly with arcade games scattered throughout the restaurant for you to try. 

MENU: Huge menu full of interesting burgers, as well as burger alternatives. All decently priced, around $6 - $9 a burger. Here's what I ended up ordering:

Regular Burger (4/5): Huge portion, definitely enough to share. The patty was a bit dry for me, since I prefer mine to be more medium. It was still pretty good, I also wish they didn't add too much mustard into my burger. Overall it wasn't bad. 

Large Spicy Fries (5/5): These are basically cajun fries and they are delicious. The larger order is a bit bigger than the small so I recommend the upgrade.

Strawberry Milkshake (5/5): We ordered the kid size and it was the perfect size. The shake itself is very creamy, not too thick where you can't suck the shake out of the straw. Recommend!

Overall experience at Boogies was good. The food was definitely comforting after a long flight. Service was outstanding here, the servers came to our table at least 3 times to check on us despite how crowded the small restaurant was. I would recommend it to anyone who is in the area!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint! 

Don't come in here with your dainty salad-eating, I-may-or-may-not-have-an-eating-disorder friend. Their burgers are big, filling and will leave you thinking you should skip dinner because you said, \"yes\" to the milkshake.

I had the \"boog-mac\" which is their take on the McDonald's Big Mac. Because of my previous statement, I ordered the single patty! It was not exactly a \"Mac Jr\" more like a backyard grilled quarter pounder with lettuce, onions, tomatoes and thousand island dressing. It was really filling.

The fried mac and cheese bites were okay. It looks like it was made with Kraft Dinner Mac and Cheese because of the tiny macaroni noodles. It's yummy if you like Kraft Mac & Cheese.

As for the milkshakes, They're great! Mostly because they give you those thick bubble tea straws to drink out of. Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"We saw them featured on You Gotta Eat Here, and finally got to try them on a snowy Thanksgiving Monday. My mint chocolate chip milkshake was loaded with chocolate chips and really needed a bigger straw - it was that thick and creamy. I tried a Sam's Burger (named after one of the original owners) with two added strips of bacon and a side of yam fries. The burger was juicy and flavourful, among the best I've ever had. Now, unless you're really starving, order one of the smaller (single- or two-patty) burgers and a small milkshake, or else you'll be stuffed silly. My wife and son were happy with their burgers and shakes as well, so it was two thumbs up all around. Our server was friendly and upbeat, which just made dining here an even bigger treat. Retro kitsch decor? Bonus!"}
{"text":"Wow - Amazing burger! Plain and simple.
Everyone I had is great and my favourite shake is the fat Elvis."}
{"text":"By far my favourite burger joint in YYC. There is a reason they are always jam packed at lunch! Awesome decor inside with a street fighter arcade! 

I love the Boog Mac. It's their take on the Big Mac and it's stellar. Spicy fries, milkshakes, it's all good! Forget Peters, give Boogies a try, you won't regret it! 

The only reason why it's a four star review is because they seem short staffed at lunch. Waiting around 20-30 for lunch leaves less time to enjoy it on my 45 minute lunch break. Keep in my though, you can order ahead, I'm just not that organized..."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. When I crave a burger, I need it to be amazing.... Or else? 

Anyway. This place is amazing. The burger was fresh and flavourful. I opted for the deep fried mac and cheese burger. The mac and cheese bits were the perfect crunch outside and good mac inside. We ordered the spicy fries for 3 of us to share. They were spicy. Not overbearing but a good amount of heat. 

The dining area is clean. A good selection of tables. You counter order and they bring you your food. Every one is friendly and welcoming. I felt like a regular even though it was my first visit. 

They have videos games!!! I wish I had more time to spend there. 

Next time, milkshakes."}
{"text":"A classic and local favourite in Calgary. I'm glad Boogies haven't increased the price all that much over the years despite its popularity. You still get the best value at Boogies compared to other burger joints in this city.

I ordered a Blazin' Saddles recently and loved at how many toppings you get with two patties for only $8.50! The patties didn't seem to be frozen either and they were not dry. Add a small fries, which should be enough for one person, and it's only $11 for the meal. The burger was massive too! The Blazin' Saddles was messy but I liked the sweet and spicy bbq sauce. I suggest adding a pineapple ring. It goes well with the bbq sauce. Fries were skinny and crispy, but they added a little bit too much salt.

With a bunch of new burger joints popping up in recent years, Boogies is still better than most of them in quality and especially in value. My second favourite place behind Naina's Kitchen."}
{"text":"If you look up \"character in Calgary\" in the dictionary, Boogie's Burgers would be right beside it. As one of Calgary's older and more authentic burger joints, it also happens to be delicious. This place has history, and the food and interior to entice people back.

The selection of giant burgers has a bunch of odd names and interesting toppings - things like the \"pizza burger\" and the \"National Lampoon's Hawaiian Holiday burger\". I've tried a grand total of three because I'm picky, but every one so far has been delicious.

The milkshake I had was pretty tiny, but came with a decent sized price tag. I appreciated the smallness of the shake considering I have never been able to finish a burger, but I do think you should get what you pay for. Fries were delish and I liked their spin on yam fries.

The interior is painted neon blue, and their are kitschy old videogames everywhere. Throw in the staff characters, and this is a place I always look forward to coming back to. No fake McDonald's smiles here, just quality service to go with quality food."}
{"text":"Came in again for my milkshake craving; somehow I wondered off my usual, guy sold me on the Key Lime pie, but didnt' make the grade...yet he offered to get me my chocolate back--at no extra charge!

that's treating customer like a king ;)"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Sweet old school vibe, great games and interesting crap on the walls. The food is no joke! Tons of different burgers. I had the Sam's burger, no truffle, no wagyu, no bullshit. It was easily one of the best burgs I've had. Milkshakes are top shelf, don't miss out on them. Chill laid back spot to hangout for a few games and stuff your face. My favorite food dispensary in Calgary."}
{"text":"Hello! We drive by this place so much and I've never once thought of trying it out until my sis told me about it. Best friggin poutine ever! Whoever thought a random little house-looking building on Edmonton Trail would serve the best French-fries-gravy-cheese-curds in the city? It is not salty. The gravy is tasty. The fries are crisp. The burgers are massive!!! Of course as I am writing this review I am starving and I seriously believe it makes my review even more credible.  Edmonton Trail is just full of tasty hidden treasures. Come hither. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited so long to try this place! 
I'm fairly certain this is the last mom-n-pop burger joint in the city that I haven't visited - what a mistake!
Milkshakes - best in town. Anyone who thinks Peter's has good shakes needs to try one of Boogie's inventive shakes and then tell me which is better.  
My daughter ordered the Peanut Butter Cup shake, and I was trying to be good so I didn't order one and asked if I could have just one sip of hers.
Long story short, we ordered a second milkshake.  Cuz I drank it all.
Thick, real ice cream, real peanut butter, real nuts on top - they nailed it.
I ordered the jerk chicken burger, and though I liked it, I got sick of the flavor part way through, and there was a bit too much sauce.
My daughter had the mac n cheese burger and amazingly she ate nearly the entire thing! Pretty sure she loved it, cuz she didn't even look up, and I wasn't getting any bites this time after what I did to her shake!
My husband ordered the BBQ burger and liked it, but he loved the spicy tots - they were super flavorful."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Bit of a wait and on the higher priced side for fancy fast food."}
{"text":"I'd heard soo much about this Burger place I was chomping at the bit to try it out.  I loves me a good burger and with so many Yelpers and friends recommending it, well it was a meeting meant to be.

Funny though I'd driven past it so many times over the years and it never stood out.  My daughter and I had some errands to run after swimming lessons and so (finally) I was able to stop in for a quick bite.  She wasn't all that interested in having a burger...or fries for that matter.  So I did what a good mommy would do and ordered extra fries just in case she changed her mind.  She did have snacks in the truck.

I pondered over the menu for awhile.  With so many delicious sounding options it was hard to narrow it down to just one.  I asked about the jerk chicken burger.  The very friendly dude behind the counter told me it's his favourite and on a heat scale probably about 8/10.  Loving all things spicy I just knew I wanted to try it.

And so I ordered the \"chicken burger\" following our conversation...just like that.  And what came was a chicken burger minus the jerk.  Only I didn't get this at first...taking a few bites and thinking \"wow this is an 8/10 spicy chicken burger?!!\"  In the end the plain burger was juicy deliciousness and I guess I didn't make my desire for the jerk chicken clear enough...oh well another reason to go back and perhaps bring the boys this time!

In the meantime the kid (who doesn't eat at McDonald's and as such not used to a thinner, crispier fry), devoured all the french fries.  I did manage to steal a few and can attest to the fact they are just that darn good.  We also had some onion rings.  Mmmm crispy, crunchy and perfectly cooked.

I'm committed.  See ya again soon Boogies Burgers!"}
{"text":"Boogies have been around since the 70s; in fact they still have their original menu posted on their very blue walls. Can you imagine paying $1.10 for a burger, $1.25 for a banana split, 40 cents and 60 cents for an ice cream cone and one dollar for a milkshake?  

So here we are forty years later and inflation didn't really take much of its toll on Boogies.  Assorted burgers for fewer than 8 bucks and a great selection of milkshakes at $3.75.  I personally have problems with the name Boogies but for the sake of my review and for your appetites I will keep this problem to myself.

The interior is so fun, there are vintage gaming machines spread around the store, there is a tacky kitschy mural of a beach on its one wall and of course we can't forget the \"Employee of the Month wall\". Man these dudes are handsome, David Hasselhoff, Beef Supreme, a mug shot of James Brown, Forest Gump.  Dammnn...Some really good looking hunks up there (see photos)

The waitress was also an added decoration to Boogies with her great tattoos and purple hair, she was really attentive and totally laid back. 

And just like the scene the Menu was totally laid back as well; in fact your can add anything to your burger, mozza or cheddar, a fried egg, wieners, an extra chicken breast, pickles, or banana peppers.  You can add any of these fixings to their plus 20 burger selections.  

What I found most interesting however were the shake flavours, bubblegum, creamsicle, banana tiger, root beer, macaroon, peanut butter and banana which is the young Elvis and the Fat Elvis which is peanut butter, banana, and bacon.  Hilarious!

I myself indulged in a mushroom burger with mozzarella cheese and a butterscotch milkshake and my total bill came to a whopping $11.  This is a 100% grade A burger folks with a big bun, I digress by saying it would be great if they had a whole wheat bun option, I am not really a white bread fan.  At first I started eating it with a fork and knife and later dove into it with my hands, and l don't know what it is about a burger but it tastes so much better when you eat it in your hands.

It was definitely tasty, not the best burgers I have ever had mind you but nonetheless good.

All around 4 stars from the reviewer, I promise to come back Boogies to try out your yam fries and to gaze lovingly at your Employee of the Month wall once again."}
{"text":"Peter's? What's Peter's?

Atmosphere is chill. No ridiculous drive thru line up, and the old school hip hop makes it absolutely perfect. 

You can order a layer of Doritos on your burger. It's as amazing as it sounds."}
{"text":"The place is busy, needs to be cleaned and needs better buns. Worth a try.

The burger are good, but the buns fall apart in mid-bite.   They remind me of the cheap buns you get at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Choosing a favourite burger joint in Calgary is like picking a great sushi spot in Vancouver.

It's a tough and personal choice.

But I'm going to put this out there. Boogies Burgers is one of the best, if not, the best that I've tried in Calgary so far.

First, the prices are super reasonable.
Second, great selection of toppings to add on.
Last, the beef is so incredibly good

From a cost benefit standpoint, Boogies' Burgers takes the cake any day. Sure, there are $15-$20 burgers out there (re Black Betty, Loungeburger) but if you're looking for a wholesome burger spot, come here."}
{"text":"The milkshakes here are amazing! I had the cappucino flavour and loved it. It is a sweet drink and very rich, but I loved it. I also ordered the Keith's burger (which I definitely recommend) and the fried mac and cheese. The fried mac and cheese wasn't as good as expected, so I do recommend other things on the menu that are seemingly better. 

All in all, the milkshakes are a must and burgers are definitely worth the cost!"}
{"text":"Every time I pop into Boogies, the sign outside makes me giggle. Go and have a looksee, you'll get what I'm talking about.

The menu doesn't change daily, there's no current trend of biodegradable plates and cups or fries cooked up in duck fat. It's just good, giant burgers done up the way they've always been done... Served with a big steak knife sticking out of it because its too big to eat whole!

There are no combos here either. You order your burger, add a side if you want. Milkshakes come in more than one size (the maple bacon one comes with real chunks of bacon in it) with is helpful when you just don't have the inner capacity to down a large one AND polish off that burger!

My go to burger choices:
Fay's burger
Mushroom burger
Buffalo chicken burger

Last visit I tried the pizza burger. While the idea was novel, I'd enjoy it more if it used a spicy pepperoni or had a Hawaiian twist to it or something.

No matter. Boogies still rocks my burger world! And vintage video games in the decor never get old either :)."}
{"text":"Loved the burger except one huge problem...I elected to get the boog-mak which is $8.50. No fries, no bacon, no drink. Somehow the waitress rang my bill to 10.50...I don't understand why I was overcharged an extra $2...afraid that I maybe sabotaged if I didn't tip (Bc you have to pay before getting your burger...weird....) I tipped...so my bill came out to nearly $12 for a burger...wow...I could have gone to original Joe's if I wanted to pay that. So fyi be aware that they will overcharged you...pretty shady...I would love to come back , but bc your waitress did that to me I cannot, without a bad taste in my mouth return. Gave you one shot and you guys blew it"}
{"text":"Second time coming in for shakes while in town and it didn't disappoint. They have fun flavors and a great atmosphere for everybody! A bit on the expensive side but not too much so that we won't come again. Also parking is a nightmare, especially on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Months ago I decided I was going to go vegetarian for a month, just to see if I could.

As my last will and testament to beef, I decided to eat my final meaty meal at Boogie's. But not just any meaty meal - THE meaty meal - the fabled \"Don't fear the reaper\" burger. 

This burger is an absolute monster. 4 patties. 4 slices of bacon. An all-beef weiner. 2 slices of cheddar. A fried egg. A mini corn dog. This thing is literally the worst thing you could possibly do for your health, and yet it was everything I dreamed of and more.

After consuming enough calories to sustain an entire African village for a week, I had to lay down. I slipped into my first-ever food coma, in which the ghost of Elvis appeared to me and sang \"Blue suede shoes\", playing a banana as a guitar. I feel like not too many foods can do this sort of thing to you, so I'd qualify it as  a \"special experience\".

When I awoke it was like the beautiful denizens of Calgary could tell I'd eaten this thing. Women looked at me with love in their eyes. Men looked at me with envy. Doctors looked at me with concern.

But in truth I've been to Boogies multiple times on days I felt like being skinny and being able to run up a flight of steps was overrated. My old office was right by this place and we'd often drop in here instead of waiting a year in line at Peter's.

The bottom line: This is a place with burgers that don't mess around. They're big, they're delicious and they make no apologies for what they are. These burgers are INSPIRED. 

The bread is fresh. The patties are thick. Your hands are going to get greasy and your face is going to get messy, but you are going to love every minute of punishment and you'll probably go back for more."}
{"text":"Yum!!! 

This place always has a line! It can be drafty inside during winter months from the door being opened.

The staff are amazing! The tater tots... well They're delicious AF! Gotta love them little tasty taters.

Burgers are incredible but only if you order in. Take out their quality decreases substantially. The gluten free bun was dry!! Don't go there for gluten free."}
{"text":"Let's cut the to chase, Boogie Burgers has legitimately amazing burgers.  My final score is a 4, so those with the attention of a ferret on a double expresso in front of a McDonalds salad bar can move on while I rant about how this location is a foodie paradise in disguise, and that anyone that thumbs their nose at Boogie Burgers is an uncultured barbarian.  Because don't let the fact that the bathroom smells like a skunk died in the septic tank of slaughterhouse fool you.  Don't be confused by the retro 80's arcade machines or the colorful chairs lifted from a foreclosed elementary school, this place is foodie heaven.  

Here's where readers are obviously confused--a lot of people's assumptions regarding foodies are endorsed by that asinine Boston Pizza commercial from a few years ago, the image of conceited, self-absorbed, judgmental, verbose (hey!), and condescending trend-groupies.  You know, people with food blogs (cough), vegans who explain to everyone why they're vegan, people who constantly drop names of great chefs they know like Ryan Cyre, Wayne Kitchen, or Vikram Vij, people who boast about their eating habits and share every meal on Instagram.  All they care about is rambling on and on in a masturbatory prose about various culinary techniques and flavor profiles.  

Totally not me (maybe a little); I don't write that way for one--I just attempt to entertain as well as educate.  And a true foodie is one that enjoys food.  That's it; that's all there is.  Just enjoy food.  We need food like we need air, but there's no reason why we can't appreciate the experience.  My friend thought that after three days of sushi, tapas, and Brazilians barbecue (where food is delivered via sword), that I would turn my nose up at the idea of a great burger spot.  The point is, a burger can be amazing.  It doesn't require truffle mayonnaise or bison meat, and it doesn't need to be delivered on the back of a mule towed by Juan Valdez to be good.  The greatest meals I've ever had were simple, not requiring foreign ingredients or molecular gastronomy.  Invest your passion in scrambled eggs and I'll extol said qualities to the sub-200 followers I have on Tumblr.  

And I'm confused by images of a brawny muscle-woman and Michael Jackson on the bathroom doors.  Which one do I use?  There's also a picture of a toilet over the actual toilet as well as a framed painting customers are apparently welcome to deface.  The menu features a caricature of a slightly redacted Ronald McDonald fleeing from Boogie Burgers' iconic all-star--the \"Fear the Reaper\", four beef patties, four slices of bacon, a fried egg, two slices of cheddar, a 100% all-beef wiener with all the toppings and skewered with a corndog.  

Holy Mary mother of God.  

Don't look at me; I didn't order that.  I have some dignity, thank you very much, a small measure of self-respect.  

I ordered the Red Dawg Clogger with a Cookie Monster milkshake.  

What?  It was on special.  

That wasn't even all of it, fringing those blubber-factories was the basic Fay's Burger and a bowl of spicy fries.  The prices were insanely low, but I really should have exercised some measure of restraint.  Said burgers were delivered on a basic checkerboard butcher paper and stabbed aggressively through the top by a steak knife, like the meal had to be killed before being served.  And as stated at the beginning, they were amazing.  The staff were efficient and agreeable, and given the impressive crowds cramming it at lunch time, calm and professional.  Of course, this is nothing new.  Boogie Burgers has amassed considerable popularity before I came around, claiming it an institution, a landmark even.  It's garnered attention in various media, so I'm not lending much weight in this campaign.  I'm just confirming the apparent obvious.  It's not pretty; it's most definitely rough around the edges, and it just might have some of the best burgers that don't require taking a mortgage out on my house.

Yes, it's a foodie destination, just like those places where every employee looks like a hobo from the 1930s, places with the words \"brick\", \"oak\", \"rustic\", or \"gastro\" in its name.  It's worthy of visit, just...avoid the bathroom.

{"text":"I lived in Bridgeland for about 8 months, and never once got the chance to visit Boogie's. It was always something that I meant to do, but I was never convinced enough to make it a top priority. Just a week or two ago, I found myself in the area hungry and exhausted from a day of cupcake baking. Accompanied by a friend who had never been either, I decided to cruise up Edmonton Trail to this lovely little joint. 
Upon arriving, it was very difficult to find a parking spot which indicated it was pretty popular. In fact, there was barely even a place to sit, so we decided to take our food to go. While waiting for our order, I wished we were able to stay. The setting in Boogies is rad as hell, not so unlike a Quentin Tarantino film or something. While sitting at the bar, the gentleman who took our order engaged in friendly conversation while multitasking, and all the other staff were charming as well. Crammed into a corner were old school videogames. 
I wanted to dig into our food right away upon reaching my car but waited til we arrived at my friend's place. My veggie burger was absolutely gigantic, to a point where many \"that's what she said\" jokes ensued. The yam chips were tasty, and my friend's food I was told was delicious as well. 
Definitely worth stopping in when you're in the area. Adorable little place."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to have an excuse to return to Boogies so soon after my first visit.  Thank-you, Saskatchewan visitors!  

I tried June's Jerk Chicken Burger and holy crackerjacks, that is one spicy piece of meat.  I'm certain it's the spiciest burger I've ever eaten in my life.  In between water and fries to douse the fire, I did enjoy it.  Again, everything was very fresh.  I also tried the yam fries and Amazinaise dip, which disappeared quickly because they were so good.

I sampled my friend's licorice milkshake, which had a mild sambuca flavor.  Not bad, but could I handle an entire serving?  Not sure.  And even if I could, I don't know that I'd want to mix it with my meal.  Maybe just a milkshake run sometime is in order.

One of my friends had a good laugh because she dropped a \"P\" word and they made her contribute $.25 to the swear jar.

Another great outing and meal at Boogies.  I even did some head bobbing to the groovy reggae type music they were playing.  The bonus was that my friends were also impressed.  I may be regressing to adolescence and falling back in love with fast food!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of hamburgers and milkshakes. In my opinion they definitely beat out Peter's Drive In for quality of food and service. Also their location is super cool with all the retro decorations and select arcade games. Very similar style to Tubby Dog on 17th Ave. The pizza burger will forever be my all time favourite."}
{"text":"Boogies Burgers has a wicked house sauce for their burgers. It's divine with the usual toppings, and you can try some exotic ones as well. If a custom burger is what you're looking for, go to Boogies."}
{"text":"This place was seriously YUM.  We happened upon it by accident on a road trip, and were really glad we found it.  Service was quick and friendly, they even brought us a bowl of water for the dogs, and the fries and milkshakes were super-YUM.  

We would definitely go back.  And maybe even eat inside next time."}
{"text":"I pass by Boogies burgers daily and it never really appeased to me. I decided to check it out on Yelp and was pleased with the reviews. I checked out the menu online and was super exited to see the veggie burger and even better...the peanut butter cup milkshake  needless to say I'll be back, it's my new favourite cheat meal go to! The staff is super friendly and welcoming... Way to go guys! Thanks for filling my belly with deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Those familiar with Calgary know about Peter's Drive-in.  It has become an icon of Calgary.  Until recently, it was the only \"burger and shake\" type of place I knew about.

A friend told me a few months ago about Boogie's Burger.  We decided to go there one night for dinner.  Good thing we were hungry!  The burgers are massive!  I decided on the \"Boog Mac,\" their take on the Big Mac.  It was amazing!  In fact, we went back two weeks later and I ordered the same thing.  One of these days I'll have to try on of the many other unique burgers they offer.

The fries were good, too.  Although my shake was made fresh, it wasn't as \"chunky\" with fruit as I would have liked (Peter's still wins in that category).

The atmosphere was very nostalgic.  It was littered with old posters and archaic video games.  Unlike many other places that sell burgers and fries, it didn't smell greasy.

I still have to try Rocky's Burger Bus, but until then, Boogie's is my favorite burger joint in the city."}
{"text":"In summary, all I can say is sub-par. The jalapeno burger was bland and the chicken tasteless. The fries were also close to inedible. The d√©cor was interesting. Two stars for having an arcade street fighter in the store."}
{"text":"First off don't let the name fool you I know some people might be put off by eating at a place called boogies period. But they have been around for many many many years now. All I can say is the food here is absolutely amazing great burgers and if you're looking for something really big that's definitely going to fill you up I would definitely suggest the Don't Fear the Reaper Burger there's no way you're going to leave hungry after eating that. Tuesdays are also free Friday when you order a burger you get a small thing of fries for free. It's not a very big place so it does fill up pretty easily during the lunch time but the women that work there are extremely nice and will take care of you if they can. So if you're looking for a new burger place to try I would definitely say give these yummy burgers a try"}
{"text":"I wouldn't be surprised if someone said their milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard. 

Apparently this has been a long-time fixture in the Calgary area and it really seems that way. Their retro diner decor and menu appears like a good ol' time. I loved all the arcade games and pinball machines (and it works!) set up in this joint.

Their menu may seem long but it's very simple with burgers, milkshakes, and a sprinkling of a few other things. Their burgers are cooked up and fresh. A very nice balance of toppings and meat. I got the deep fried Mac n' cheese burger - an excellent choice! The spicy fries are so so worth it. If you get a milkshake you'll be struggling to finish, but you might as well! I got the one that was a liquid PB&J sandwich."}
{"text":"\"Boogies milk shakes brings all the people to the yard, and there like, it's better than yours. Damn right its better than yours.\" 

First off I want to say that any place the plays Gogol Bordello is an A-OK place to me. Seriously you don't understand how happy I was to hear that crazy gypsy punk. Good music selection. 

Secondly the decor, freaking amazing!! Okay I love all the posters, if I didn't like this place so much I would have swiped a few of the vintage band posters a long time ago. Oh and the functional Mario and Donkey Kong video game table is so cool, lets just say I lost a roll of quarters to it but I aint even mad. 

Okay now on to the food. Nobody really knows how much I love Mac and Cheese, it may very well be one of my favorite things. So to add that to a burger well be still my beating heart. Marry me Boogies. 

Now on to the milkshakes. Okay I'm going to play devils advocate here and bring up the fact that Boogies is mighty close to Peters Drive In. I won't lie the first time I came to Boogies I was told the milkshakes where better than Peters, shocked I was!! But you know what upon ordering the Angry Aztec I was quickly on board.  It's a neat blend of chocolate, cayenne pepper and cinnamon. I'm really digging the whole hot and sweet thing. I don't normally venture to far from things I really like but you all know I also have a thing for bacon and Mr.Elvis Presley. So I tried the Fat Elvis Milkshake. It's peanut butter, banana and BACON. And you know what ELVIS = LIVES (get it it's an anagram)  he lives in this shake. It was surprisingly really good. 

So keep on keeping on Boogies. I can guarantee that I will be back many of times."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place and tried the blazin saddles burger. GARBAGE to be quite honest. The buns were soggy and the actual burger was bland and flavourless. The place looks old and dirty and small. Peters drive in has WAY better burgers at a way cheaper price, not recommended."}
{"text":"You have to get a burger AND a milkshake. I can never finish both but I always take the other half of the burger home and eat it later because it's so good! Very friendly staff definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've tried in the city! Today was my first time going here, and it was a great experiance. The service was very good, and the food was even better. I had the regular burger and onion rings. It's not too expensive either which is a bonus, definately will recommend to my friends/family & I will come back very soon, next I want to try the burger with pineapple on it :)"}
{"text":"One of only a handful of such places in Calgary, Boogies Burgers was quite unique when we went. It was very, very casual and a tad retro. My husband even pointed out there were 1980s-style arcade games built-in to the tables. The fries are very good (I'm super critical when it comes to fries) so when I say they're good, I mean it!
Great for a Saturday afternoon with some friends or as a casual date. Warning: the burgers are fair-sized ;)"}
{"text":"Boogie's is classic in every way.

Good burgers, fantastic fries, amazing shakes.

The burgers are not the best I've ever had, but the sauce is good, they are succulent and the bun is delicious (home-made?). Fully satisfying.

The fries are some of my favourite that I can think of. Fully crispy, dark and seasoned well.

The shakes are awesome. Creative flavours and the best compliment you can ask for to your already fatty combination of burgers and fries.

Colourful and funky, the interior is similar to Tubby Dog in terms of it's sense of dingy  retro.

My favourite thing about Boogie's? They have a \"P\"-word swear jar if you mention the unholiest of unholy name of the significantly less-amazing burger joint around the corner. Boogie's, you are right up my alley."}
{"text":"Love the staff here! Love their high standards for great tasting burger and fry goodness; and their enthusiasm and knowledge of the menu; and the food is outta this world!!!! They make a lot of their sauces and other items in house. I typically get the made in house mushroom black bean burger with pickles! The regular fries and yam fries are hand cut and some of the best fries in Calgary - no lie! Onion rings are great and you can even top off a burger with a mini corn dog:) People love their shakes and the flavours this time of year don't disappoint: candy cane, gingerbread, honey ham and pineapple, rum ball, and fruitcake. Wowza! There's a lot to love about this unique burger joint! If you have time stick around and play a game of Pac-Man:)"}
{"text":"I only recently had the opportunity to experience the gem that is Boogies.  Upon entering the place I was super skeptical because it looked like a major hole on the outside.  The inside is super retro and a great environment for a beer and a burger or a burger and a shake!

I fortunately ordered a single because I had NO idea how large the burger would be!   I really loved the bun and the \"special\" sauce as well.   I ordered an orange shake and it was spectacular!

I would love to go back there for one of their specialty burgers."}
{"text":"I only had onion rings (which were pretty good!) and RJ had the double burger which he said was ok. what was outstanding was the service!"}
{"text":"Blast from the past in the Boogies Burgers joint.  The service was friendly, the music was hopping and the food was creative!  Hey, if you are looking for a quick shake - forget it!  They are so thick you can stand on it, so be prepared to take your time;)  Looking forward to trying more of Boogies vast selection of fast food choices."}
{"text":"Love Boogies...I drag everyone I know to this place. All burgers are amazing...the fries are hand cut and taste like POTATOES!!! MMMMM"}
