{"text":"Fantastic Gibraltar! Hard to find one this good anywhere. A great spot along Rue Saint Denis."}
{"text":"The most important point: delicious coffee.  Other important points: Excellent service in a very hip and modern third wave cafe. Barista discussed the different roasting notes even within a bean; this is the coffee culture that one looks for at a place like this. Upgraded to a bag of beans to take back home from our trip."}
{"text":"I spent an awesome morning at this cafe! The barista was nice enough to humor my broken French, and I managed to order a latte and a croissant with no problems. Prices seem about standard for Montreal, but the latte was much more than standard! It was perfect, and really didn't need anything (often I find I need to add sugar to counter bitterness, but not in this case!). The atmosphere was nice, and there's free wifi and plenty of seating, so you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Very cute and cozy cafe! The hot chocolate and London fog was delicious! And their pastries look Devine! Good wifi connection! Close to many other restos since it's right in the center of the street St Denis! They even have a little corner store/depaneur that's on the side of the cafe, which carries things like kambucha,granola bars, candy machine etc. Love the little designs they make on the drinks and the cashier is really friendly and welcoming! Definitely a good place for University student to go study! And it's close to the metro!"}
{"text":"A small yet spacious cafe tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Saint Denis. Friendly barista, well made latte and very clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to work with delicious baked goods and very good coffee. Having bought filter beans from them a few times, my only complaint is that Saint-Henri's beans are over-roasted, too dark, and lose brightness and fullness of flavor as a result. This seems to be a common problem in Montreal."}
{"text":"Meilleur café dans le coin. La barista était super sympathique et le décor est super! Des cafés de qualité dans le quartier latin, enfin!"}
{"text":"Ambiance et deco super dans ce café. J'adore tout particulièrement les graffitis sur un des murs ainsi qu'aux toilettes! Funky et jovials   Le café est bon et les baristas gentils, vraiment une bonne expérience!  L'endroit est aussi parfait pour travailler et se poser avec son ordinateur sur une de leurs grandes tables."}
{"text":"J'adore ce café de la famille Café Saint-Henri Micro torréfacteur!  Design complètement refait.  On y retrouve maintenant un dépanneur appartenant au même proprio, la porte à côté. Plein de petites gâteries originales.  Je vous le recommande. Le café est toujours aussi bon. Torréfié à Montréal par un jeune entrepreneur dynamique."}
