{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for brunch.  Crepes and waffle sandwich were delicious, as were the Bloody Mary's.  Lilly the bartender/waitress was terrific.  Looking forward to going back next weekend!"}
{"text":"I gave it 1 star because of the beer.  We walked in and waited 10 minutes for the waitress to take our drink orders, meanwhile the male bartender was busy talking to other customer  laughing, and joking, no acknowledgement.   We ordered the chicken and cheddar stuffed jalapenos and when they came, the jalepenos were raw and we bit into them and immediately my mouth was uncomfortably hot, no, on fire.  I only took a bite and was done.  I have a pretty high tolerance for hot foods, but this was way too hot.  It was   Do they not know you're supposed to cook the jalepenos to release some of the heat to make them edible?  I also ordered the crabcake sliders, they were mostly breading and were put on the grille and had a burnt char.  They tasted like they were old, and the slaw did too. The fries were soggy, and way over salted. Overall very disappointed with the food, in fact, I'd have to say it was horrible.  Obviously, someone invested a lot of money to get this place together.  Why not invest in a good cook and customer service?"}
{"text":"Went to bar 3 for dinner because we live right by and are always excited to try new places in the area - started out ok- beer was good. Vibe was nice. Decor was great. Menu looked good.  Ordered a Reuben- it came and was very small on regular tiny white bread with maybe one slice of meat- told the bartender I thought it was on rye bread - he said no it's not; they don't have it - i looked at the menu again and it said the (as any Reuben is) sandwich was on rye- i told him The menu said it as a heads up and then the response was \" oh they change it up\" - I  told him the reason I ordered it was because I think of a Reuben as a big sandwich on good thick marble rye. He said sorry.   We were still billed for everything.  If you are starting a business to locals- don't lie. Just take ownership."}
{"text":"What a gem. Great service, friendly, nice atmosphere. We stayed for a few hours and ended up ordering the portabella mushroom sandwich TWICE because it was so delicious. Kylie at the bar was awesome. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Phenomenal new bar. It's truly a hidden gem. The chef is always making new food to bring out and try. The dishes are simply delicious- from a wide variety on the menu you won't be disappointed for a yummy dinner.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and beer selection...worth a stop... sausage ravioli is amazing.."}
{"text":"Bar 3 is a great bar with Incredible food. We started with the Buffalo mac and cheese and  the firecracker shrimp.  They were both amazing. My wife and I then split the bar 3 Burger. This burger is one of the best in Pittsburgh. The ham BBQ topping it is an incredible touch. All of their food is unique and delicious. The bartenders are super friendly and the owners are just as nice. They want to make sure that you're having a great experience at their establishment ."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Big portions. Perfectly poached eggs for the Eggs Benedict. I loved the atmosphere. People stand in line at other establishments for a breakfast that is mediocre in comparison. I've also been there in the afternoon/evening. Great beer selection. Excellent flatbread.  I look forward to trying other items on their menu. I plan on becoming a regular at this new and upcoming establishment."}
{"text":"I go there often since I live in Millvale.  By far the best atmosphere for a bar and always clean.  The staff is wonderful and very friendly.  Glad it came to Millvale and not Lawrenceville!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here for dinner - REALLY like this place!  3 different dinners, all good.  Nice atmosphere, great staff - we'll definitely be back, many more things to try!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Bar 3 in millvale after a grueling Saturday. Myself and my 2 friends spent the day moving furniture, boxes and all manner of heavy things as I relocated from Beaver, PA to Millvale. We were tired and hungry, and we wanted a drink.  The place is well designed, having something for everybody. Tons of TVs, a nice bar area and a dining area for those hoping to avoid the fray, and free, functional wi-fi. The design on (almost) everything is modern and nice.   The exception bring the menu. It was all one font, one weight and very little thought to layout. I don't know if they change the menu frequently, but if that's not the case, it's gotta be laziness. Only 2 employees were visible, one being the bartender who was, surprise, busy tending bar, and the other being the cook, who was wandering the dining area just kind of looking around.  Both looked at us like we were on very annoying fire when we walked in, but we were hungry so we took our seats in the dining area.  Eventually, the bartender made his way over and we ordered drinks (3 waters and 2 beers) waited forever for those, then waited for him to take our order, then waited for the food. We were there longer than it took to unpack the u haul and move furniture, and it isn't because we were lingering. The service was bad. No way around it.  Now, something positive. The food. The food was phenomenal. I ordered a Ham bbq sandwich with sauteed zucchini on the side, and my friends got burgers with fries. The ham bbq was exactly what I was hoping for. Comfort food with an upgrade. The balance of the flavors was spot on, the pickles were just right, and they even got that little hint of cinnamon that is critical in good Ham bbq. Top notch. Both of my friends greatly enjoyed their burgers and fries. Everything was perfectly cooked (they both ordered medium) and, for the most part, we all left happy.  Bar 3 Millvale has a long way to go. There is a lot of room for improvement, but the food is stellar. Seeing as I'm now a local, I will definitely be returning to see how they grow."}
{"text":"Growing up in Shaler, Millvale was never a desirable hangout for me and I certainly never trekked over to eat or once I was of age, to drink.  Over the past 5 or so years, though, it seems things have started to pick up in the area.  Between the dog-friendly brewery down the street and a couple other new, fun spots, I find myself here more and more often.    Bar 3 opened in mid March(?) and it seems to do a really good business!!  I've stopped in on three occasions - twice to just have a drink and the second during happy hour for a couple appetizers.  It is clean with clean, neutral d√©cor.  The bar is roomy and there are a few high-top tables lining the wall.  The upstairs bar just opened this May, although I have not been in recently enough to experience it in person!  The bar is fully stocked and they have a nice beer list - mostly, if not all, beers from local breweries.  The food is good - fresh.  Nice happy hour deal ($5 appetizers).  I had the boneless wings when I was here (YUM - still thinking about them) and my friend and I split the nachos.  All three times I've been here, it's been scattered with a mix of people - definitely a nice crowd.   Nice atmosphere, great bartenders, good food and drinks with decent prices and specials. Couldn't ask for anything more and I think it will do well here.  Glad to have it nearby!"}
{"text":"I went with kids for Sunday brunch. There is no kids menu, but the kids split the order of pancakes with leftovers. They even did 2 different preps - one kid wanted regular pancakes and the other chocolate chip - no extra charge. They said the pancakes were delicious. I had the caprese chicken sandwich. It was also very good.   Our server was friendly but slammed - she was by herself and was bartender and the only server. Overall, we liked it and will go back. I knocked off one star only because the server really could have used some help at the height of the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful vibe, good service and excellent beer list.  We were pleased by the food, which is heavy on the burgers. They could add a veggie burger, which would add lots of options for vegetarians.   We met the chef, and we complemented him on his creative ideas, for example blue cheese on the roasrted Brussels Sprouts, which addded lots of flavor.   I was happy to see several beers from Grist House on their draft list (which was heavily IPA).   Our food arrived quickly and it was cooked to perfection.   There are lots of TV screens if you want to watch a game."}
{"text":"This place was a great little meeting spot! We had 8 people in our party and arrived just before 4 on a weekday. Happy hour is 4 - 6pm and they have about 10 food options for $6. Our group ordered a variety of the options - Buffalo Mac & Cheese, boneless wings, fish tacos, pulled pork sandwich, chili, and soft pretzels. The Mac & Cheese was good - light on the chicken, but had good flavor and dense spiral noodles. I'd get it again on the happy hour menu! The portion looked small when it came out, but I was hungry and it was enough to fill me up over happy hour.   The beer list is written on the chalkboard when you enter. There is a good variety of draft beers and bottle options. There were ~6 options from Grist House and plenty of other options.  The dining area is a up two steps from the bar area and is spacious - our party and another party of 8-10 were there at once and there were still plenty of seats available. The only server was the bartender at the time - I'm guessing they didn't expect 2 larger parties to come in before 5 on a weekday. She was very friendly and as attentive as she could be for us and the many people at the bar."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch to try it out, got a burger and my friend got wings. We split the pretzels and fries as an appetizer and it was all amazing! The restaurant itself is very clean and cute and located in a nice area. Service was great, will definitely be adding this to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Exactly what Millvale needed!! The food is creative and absolutely delicious! Highly recommend the Angry Burger! Yum!! The servers and bartenders and chef are awesome! SMOKE FREE TOO!! Love that they have Trivia on Thursdays too!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Bar 3 and am always really happy to learn about great businesses coming into the Millvale community. With that being said, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at Bar 3.   I went to Bar 3 on Sunday for dinner with some friends. We sat at a high top in the bar area and were approached right away for our drink orders. However, once we received drinks it took a very long time for the bartender to come back over for our food orders. He was at the bar talking with a group of friends while we just sat and waited. Once our food arrived, it was pretty tasty and the service was not terrible, it was really just that minor detail.  I feel bad only rating two stars because honestly, it wasn't the bartender or the staff or the food. What I really did not like about Bar 3 was the vibe. There was a group of guys next to us screaming the worst country music I could imagine. I understand...it was after a Penguins game...we were getting it in too...but it was obnoxious and partially directed towards us at points. On top of the awful men singing horrendous music...the jukebox fully supported their decision. It was around 6 on a Sunday and was so loud that I couldn't really even relax to enjoy my food. I'd like to give this place another try because I really want to like it but I was just not into anything that was going on. So unless you want to feel like you are at Tequila Cowboys on a Saturday night at umm...midnight, I probably would not suggest this place after a game/before a show...etc."}
{"text":"We love Bar 3! The food is amazing and always fresh- the chef does an incredible job with such a wide menu. The only issue we came across was the drinks can be a little pricy and service can be slow sometimes, but we've never left unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink after work during the week. Place is really nice, did a great job remodeling it ordered a steak salad and crab dip both were good! Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"This is the only bar I regularly enjoy coming to with friends to drink, eat, and hang out. There are plenty of TVs at the bar if you want to watch a game, too. They have a great beer list filled with local craft brews. The menu is classic Pittsburgh and Western PA inspired, but it's definitely more elevated than a simple ham BBQ sandwich would lead you to believe. Love the food, love the drinks, love the atmosphere, and love the employees!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the waitress was very rude. I ordered a burger and it was raw. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The crowd was all locals drinking at the local bar. The place looks nicer than it actually is. I had stopped here before a show at Mr. Smalls looking for a quick place to eat before the show and was supposed disappointed with my whole experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab some beers before axe throwing with friends! It was very clean and they had a great selection of beer. We both got tacos (I had the pork and my fianc√© had the catfish) and they were awesome! Very casual, cool, and modern. It's a great spot for a dinner date or to grab some beers. I'd recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you need to go. The restaurant/bar is a very clean and fresh updated space. There are exposed brick walls and cool fixtures. We stopped in for brunch and we came out Happy Campers. I ordered the Blueberry and Cream Cheese Stuffed French Toast. I also ordered a side of bacon. The side order had three strips of crunchy bacon. I can't have breakfast without bacon. YUM!  . I'll be honest. I expected canned blueberry filling in the middle of the French Toast. Much to my surprise it was real blueberries. Even with the cream cheese it wasn't overly sweet. It tasted like real blueberries. The outside was cooked perfectly. No syrup was needed. It was delightful. It came with a side of Home Fries. They are cut smaller than normal home fries and I liked them a lot. However it didn't stop there. My husband ordered Eggs Benedict. Oh My Word!  A good Hollandaise sauce is hard to find, but I found it. AND they serve the Eggs Benedict with chorizo. Let's get a little spicy. Again, YUM!!!!  Not only will we go back but we'll bring friends! For an added surprise they have a party room upstairs!!!  It has separate bathrooms, a full bar, tables, and a couch area. It's fun!  It's Hip!!  It's very cool!  If you need a venue for a wedding or baby shower or charity event. . . Maybe a birthday or anniversary party, you need to check this space out."}
{"text":"Came in from Western New York to visit friends and the area where I grew up. What a great revelation in Millvale this bar restaurant is!  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. Not your average \"neighborhood bar\" but everyone made us feel at home. Lindsey was great and we enjoyed a great variety of tunes from Todd on the guitar. The food was exceptional. Not \"bar food\" by any means. It was a great experience!  Bar 3 makes Millvale a destination worth visiting. We hope to return soon."}
{"text":"We experienced a fantastic 70th birthday party for my mother in bar 3's upstairs event space. The room was elegantly decorated before we had even brought in our own birthday decor. They even went out and bought us black tablecloths the day of the event. The space easily accommodated our group of 35. They offered the jukebox or a hook up that a dj can easily plug in to play music over their system. We selected a buffet option for a very reasonable price that included chicken Parmesan, vegetables, pasta, salad, and potatoes. The chicken Parmesan exceeded my expectations and would definitely recommend it for a party. The bartender and owner were very accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. Although, I only drank miller lite at the party, I can attest to their wide variety of craft beers and my mom raves about the blue Hawaiian drink. It's a great, classy addition to the millvale scene. Worth a try if you're in the area or looking to host an event at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a bar in millvale sell food. It looks nice, the menu looks good but the execution of the chef just wasn't there. I'd much rather have slightly plainer food well executed than spend the money on over price fancy food which was a little blah."}
{"text":"On my first visit I learned I arrived way to early for it to open so I decided to return on the weekend. I had a wonderful waitress and basically had the whole place to myself! The seating area is small with TVs blasting everywhere and your bar is in the front. I sat towards the back so I could enjoy something off the Sunday brunch menu.  Since it was early afternoon I decided to try a lunch sandwich of chicken. All brunch items come with a side of hash browns. I was hot so I just asked for ice tea and they brewed some up just for me! I was grateful. I got my food fairly fast and she even gave me some ketchup for my hash browns. Both the sandwich and the hash browns were delicious! I was afraid the hash browns would be overly greasy but they weren't.  I learned that on weekends they switch over to the regular menu after 2 and now they have added Friday earlier hours so they can serve lunch. Normally with the major hockey playoffs going on this place will get jammed later and parking is free on Sunday.  They do offer free WiFi here since reception is very bad.My only slight problem was that my table seemed a bit high from my chair but I was able to manage. Located only a few doors down from Jean-Marc Chattilier's French bakery, metered street parking is available. This place has a nice decor to it and is reasonably priced. I learned they had opened in March so they are relatively new to area. It is a simple drive back to Rt 28 where you can get to some of the more known neighborhoods in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the heart of Millvale. Really a beautiful spot. Updated, modern and smoke-free. This is an establishment you'd expect to find in Lawrenceville or Brooklyn. Prices are fair and they come up with some really fun drink ideas and specials. Didn't get a chance to eat but can't wait to come back for a bite. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I was starving and my partner and I went here on a whim. The atmosphere was nice and modern, particularly in the bar area. The service was great and very attentive.   The menu selection wasn't huge but had a nice selection of pub and comfort foods. I had the shrimp po boy. The shrimp and sauce were a great combo of flavors, and the bun and tomatoes were super fresh and delicious. The slaw it came with left a little to be desired in the flavor department , but there were other sides to choose from.   This place is relatively new, but I definitely think it's worth a visit if pub or comfort food is your thing. They also seemed to have a great beer selection from the local Grist House."}
{"text":"We popped in for the May Days in Millvale, and we were pleasantly greeted by the bartender, Lily. She was attentive and kind, and she gave us descriptions of some of the brunch options that were listed.   I love a good crepe, especially when savory, and let me tell you, this was delicious! On the thicker side for a crepe, this sweet pastry wrapped around perfectly cooked eggs and juicy bacon, and was every breakfast lover's dream come true! To the side, perfectly cooked hash browns with a delectable herb flavor.   My friend decided to be adventurous and ordered the Cap'n Crunch French toast, over which he rolled his eyes with delight!  I don't think the population of Pittsburgh knows about this gem yet...no problem getting a seat at the bar. Pair that with the welcoming atmosphere, and Millvale has a hot new brunch spot!  Highly recommended! Cheers to Bill and Lily, and thanks for a great visit!"}
