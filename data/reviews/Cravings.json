{"text":"This is the tastiest Chinese food on campus (note, Golden Harbor is not on campus). It is also the cheapest, and they give large portions -- for me, easily enough for 2 meals usually. Most dishes are $6-8. Some more special ones are $9-12. The more American orange/General Tso's/sweet and sour/etc. chicken dishes are $5.25. The owner guy behind the counter most of the time is one of the friendliest restaurant workers I have ever met.   Tips: -They make Chinese food the best. If you're unsure of what to get, your best bet is to get something Chinese instead of Japanese/Thai/etc.  -Be sure to look at the white board on the floor to the left of the counter!  -Explore the Chinese menu sitting on the counter (it has English translations)   These are some of my favorites:  Basil pork egg rice, Jakarta fried rice, Pork with preserved vegetables, Crispy beef, Fried fish fillets with bok choy, Beef stew eggplant pot, Spicy fried chicken, Mapo tofu, Sizzling chicken pot."}
{"text":"Good memories have attached to this place. I enjoy their beef and broccoli, as well as their chicken dishes. A classic grungy Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you're looking for a local joint for the Chinese Cuisine. I would highly recommend Bean Curd with Vegetables (Tofu). It is my go-to place and option anytime I am looking for a quick bite. Also, their soups are just $1.55 - great for when you're a little under the weather."}
{"text":"Cravings is hands down my favorite Chinese place on campus. While it is typically heavily crowded during peak lunch/dinner hours, the food is great and definitely worth what you pay for. Portions are generous and the seasoning is not overdone (as opposed to many other Chinese food places which flood their dishes in sauce). My personal favorites are the Jakarta fried rice, braised beef noodle bowl, and hot n' spicy chicken."}
{"text":"I wish I could import this restaurant to Hyde Park so I can have Cravings whenever I don't feel like cooking. Its the cheap but great Chinese eatery brought to life with low, low prices, order at counter, big, heaping portions, free tea in styrofoam cups, etc. Staff is really friendly and the dishes we tried were pretty good too. Try the chili chicken and the eggplant."}
{"text":"Ah, Cravings.  My old stand-by Chinese place.  Good food at a good price.  They have both the typical Chinese fare that most Americans are used to and a pretty full true Chinese menu.    Orange chicken is really good, so is the Mongolian beef.  The only thing I've been disappointed in there is the veggie egg rolls."}
{"text":"I really like the food, price and the atmosphere (+the friendly Cravings man).  Fried rice with shrimp and omlet on top? is very good : )"}
{"text":"Great food, Great variety, Cheap, Crowded, and  great portions.  True it is a little greasy but soo good. You don't have to order a greasy dish...  Try the whole menu devoted to green beans!  The soups are my favorite.  I eat there at least once a week.  The hardest thing is settling on one dish."}
{"text":"Large portions, friendly staff, cheap prices, and delicious food.  The atmosphere is strictly dive - but the food is good enough that no one cares (nor should they."}
{"text":"I know everyone loves cravings...maybe I havent ordered the right things.    I have ordered maybe 1/2 dozen times from there over the past few years and have found most of their food to be too heavy. My favorite dish from there that Ive ordered is the Jakarta fried rice, which is heavy but has good flavour.   On the other hand the price is right and its convenient."}
{"text":"I have an issue with the menu. I often go back in remembering I had something really tasty but I forget how to navigate back to it. The very approachable gentleman behind the counter explained that he and his daughter help out. They are Malaysian if I remember correctly. The cuisine is Indo-Chinese and richly  diverse. You will see a healthy mix in student clientele. Always a good sign. The food is reasonably prized and the quality is fairly consistent. You are going to bus your own table in the end. Hot tea & water are self serve. . It is casual and unpretentious. You will not walk away hungry. ......It is real food really fast."}
{"text":"Easily the best spot to eat on the Foothills Medical Campus.  A large selection of fresh baked goods, savoury pastries, donairs, salads, and a sizeable rotating set of daily lunch specials such as butter chicken with naan (the owners are Indian, I believe).  Everything I've had here is tasty (especially compared to the cafeteria!). The only downfalls are Cash Only, a limited number of tables, and it's a bit hard to find the first time.  Go to the North Tower, across from the helipad, and head to the second floor."}
{"text":"Not too pricey. Taste good but a little bit salty. Fired rice is the cheapest one. Shredded pork with bamboo and three cups chicken taste great. Beef & cilantro with chili sauce is really spicy."}
{"text":"The dishes are mostly salty or oily. One could still go there if he/she doesn't mind the salt and oil. Their used-to-be signature dish, i.e. Hot and spicy chicken, is going downhill. The last time I ate that dish, it was cold, oily and not crispy. I complaint to them and they just simply refried the chicken so that it is warm.."}
{"text":"So many options that all taste so good. Reasonable prices. The staff is very friendly too. If your knowledge of Asian food doesn't go much further than orange chicken, I recommend you try something new each time you go. You might be pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"This is the best chinese food on campus. Super greasy, full of flavor, and about a 5% chance you get food poisoning from it. Its amazing!"}
{"text":"OK.  First I need to say that I'm not a Chinese food fan. But, I like some kinds of it.  Ambient of this restaurant is very bad. There is always a smell and smoke inside. Because of that you may start coughing. This is a very bad thing!  Food is OK. But I had better experiences about Chinese restaurants, so this is not my first option in C-U.  And, price is reasonable, actually cheap. However, service is so slow. So many people order by phone before they're coming to this restaurant.   To sum up, if you wanna have a Chinese food, Cravings wouldn't be your first option, as long as you're not specifically try the food of \"South China\". I recommend Evo, in C-U area."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and if I had a million hours to waste I would walk my lazy self across campus and pick up some sweet and sour chicken and have a free Styrofoam cup of green tea every day of my life. Unfortunately they do not deliver and I don't even think they know how to use a phone. The last time I was there the man was so busy he picked up the phone and put them on hold and never picked it back up. I found it funny, but I'm sure that customer did not.  And, you know, if they opt out of delivery they should really clean the place up a bit. I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle).  I love the food, but this place is great to go to maybe a few times per semester. It's just too crowded for my liking."}
{"text":"One sentence to sum up this place: The Jack of all trades, master of none. This restaurant has 2 things going for it. Location close to campus and a large student population that values abundance over quality. Ninja doesn't need a lot of so so food. He likes tasty food. Sometimes too much so so food weigh binds down before sword fight."}
{"text":"Wonderful place on U of I campus to eat and take home the leftovers for the next meal. Service is always great and quick. Food is flavorful and yummy. Something to please everyone's palate. We stop here every time we are here to visit."}
{"text":"There are really better options, both in Champaign and on campus.  I don't really want to say that, because I used to love Cravings.  Like many of the people writing 5 star reviews, I was impressed by the large menu, the frequently cheerful staff, and the mostly reasonable prices.    But as I went to other Chinese places in town, my opinion began to change.  I noticed that most of the dishes at Cravings were really heavy and oily.  And that most of the specials were very similar to one another.  And that some of the menu options .. didn't really match what was being described.  I don't mind some innovation, and I know you can't really get a Japanese style bowl of Ramen anywhere in Champaign, but Cravings' offering is nowhere close.  The last three times I went I ended up throwing out my leftovers.  I absolutely hate wasting food, but I couldn't finish them.  One was a squid special; the squid was extremely chewy and seemed overcooked.  The plate was mostly green peppers in a salty sauce, in any case.  Another was a \"coconut shrimp\" plate.  This translated to fried shrimp with (very sweet) uncooked coconut milk simply poured over them.  Unhealthy and not even tasty.  The last was Gado Gado Fish, which I remembered getting and enjoying in the past.  It was still really heavy - lots of breading with an oily, thick sauce.    If you want to spend a little more money, I highly recommend Golden Harbor instead.  But the food is much better. If you want to spend about the same or just a little more, I'd check out Lai Lai Wok instead - which I think is overrated, too, but is a bit better than Cravings.  Or you could get take-out from Rainbow Garden, which is pretty solid.   If you want to spend less, you could try out Empire or Bo Bo China.  (Bo Bo China is all you can eat if you really want to maximize your calories/dollar.)"}
{"text":"I will admit that I am not the most adventurous eater. I am especially wary of Chinese restaurants. Good Chinese food is awesome; bad Chinese food is one of the nastiest things on earth. So I rarely go to a new Chinese place without someone telling me that it's worth trying.  A couple of my husband's co-workers (who were very in-the-know about Chinese food) told him that Cravings was one of the best in town. We tried it, and it became one of our mainstays. We usually order the crispy beef, which is lightly breaded and fried (I think) and then tossed in this incredible sweet-spicy sauce. One order is enough for both of us, and unlike other places that do not use the best part of the cow when they are breading and frying it and tossing it in a delicious sauce, the beef is usually really good--not tough and stringy and fatty and gross.  The man who owns Cravings is very nice, and I'm always happy to see crowds eating there. They seem to have authentic dishes along with the Americanized stuff, so if you want a steamed whole fish, you can get one here.   I would try other things, but I am too addicted to the crispy beef to move on."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get food on hospital (Foothills Medical Centre) grounds. The second best place is On The Go by the Teaching Research and Wellness building, but it's run by UofC's catering company, Chartwells. I usually like supporting small businesses, so that's why it's #1 in my books.  This little mom and pop shop is tucked away in the Women's Health Centre, main floor. They have a variety of western, middle eastern and Indian style foods. Eg: falafel wraps , donairs, chicken shawrma, Jamaican beef patties, sausage rolls, samosas, Greek salad, Caesar salad, bagels, coffee, baked goods, baklava, sandwiches, etc.  Sometimes they have lunch specials such as butter chicken, but I come here for the samosas and donairs. They have chicken, beef, vegetable and potato samosas - all delicious! Their wraps and sandwiches are made on the spot. But avoid the chai latte. It's not very good.  If you're looking for a snack or a full lunch, they have it. They have a few refrigerators with all kinds of bottled, cartoned and canned drinks. They also have packaged ice cream, protein bars, chocolate bars, gum, chips, you name it. It's a perfect one stop shop for food! They even have full-sugar, full-fat stuff that you can't find at the hospital cafeteria!  One last tip: they only take cash, and make sure you leave a tip in the \"Good Karma\" dish!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Cravings for 5 years now and every time I go, I can't wait to go again.    I always go with a group for friends and order family style.  All the dishes are large enough to accommodate it.  The Spicy Chilli Chicken is awesome as well as the Salt and Pepper Squid (a version of calamari).    I have yet to try a dish I did not enjoy...expect for when I accidentally ordered cows stomach.  The owner was nice enough to take it back and give me another dish free of charge."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, my review probably doesn't hold as much weight for this restaurant as it does for omnivores, but I'm going to review it anyway. The options are pretty limited for vegetarians, but I loved the cheap price and large portions(unlimited rice!) as well as the complimentary hot tea. The ma po tofu is the classic vegetarian option that everyone orders here, but in my opinion, the real gem is the tofu in chili oil sauce. The ma po tofu was certainly good, but it was not spicy enough for me, and wasn't layered enough in various flavors. The tofu in chili oil sauce on the other hand, has the classic bite of the Sichuan peppercorn, and is actually spicy, with the varied flavor profile I look for in spicy dishes. Overall, it's definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant on campus."}
{"text":"Very cheap and authentic Chinese food. The owner is very nice and the portion is very large."}
{"text":"The name says it all. I had to go here at least once a week to satisfy my craving. spicy chicken/beef Ho Fun my my favorite dish. There was a beef noodle stew which I also enjoyed. It gets packed there around lunch and dinner time so sometimes get take out."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food on campus if not in champaign. The food has a home cooked feel to it and does not look like it came out of a can or a pre-cooked frozen package like most Chinese food.  Dishes to try: General Tso's Chicken, Chicken Gado Gado, Beef Ho-Fun"}
{"text":"Homie, this place is great but sometimes it's just closed unexpectedly. Sometimes I'll go by and it's just not open when it usually is and other times it's closed for a \"health violation\" or something like that."}
{"text":"my friends hate me for loving cravings but it is just so cheap for so much food. I've heard the tofu is horribly bad, so don't get that. Really hit or miss menu so be aware (not surprising given that there are about 60 things on the menu). I like the orange chicken (because I am not used to authentic chinese food, so I don't know any better) and the chicken lo mein (order it spicy)."}
{"text":"i dont get the hype. It's cheap chinese food."}
{"text":"not the best chinese restaurant around, HOWEVER - unbelievable bang for your buck. make no mistake people - this really is as good as it gets.    chicken fried rice (4.73$ cash 4.98$ card), those numbers should tell you that i go to this place like its selling grades. hot and spicy chicken 6.99$ ( apparently it's the best seller ).   The reason i quote the prices is to tell you that you're getting an incredible amount of food for the cheapest price on campus. You can actually make two meals out of those 6.99$ deals (there's plenty of em - chicken with chilli bean sauce is pretty good)."}
{"text":"Free seaming hot tea. Love the crispy beef. Very large portions. Best chinese food out there."}
{"text":"Overrated, clap, clap, clap, clap.  Overrated.  Yelpers, I usually trust your judgment, but you didn't get this one right.  Since I love small hole-in-the-wall places with friendly owners (this place meets those criteria), this review is kind of hard to write, but I have to do it.  The Mongolian beef that I ordered was cold.    Additionally, it wasn't sweet, and there were a lot of onions in the dish.  A lot!  The ingredients (rice, beef and onions) were fine, but I can't eat something that has been sitting around for awhile and isn't fresh and hot.  I'll try this place again because the owner is a nice guy, but my first experience wasn't a good one."}
{"text":"A little bit of home away from home.  A wide selection, healthy portions, cheap prices, and consistently yummy Chinese food is why I really like it here.  Cravings reminds me of my mom's cooking which is always a great treat when I'm feeling homesick or just get ridiculously sick of dorm food (which is often).  They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone, they have lunch specials for even cheaper chow, and the owner is very friendly (yay for discounts, especially if you go often).  I would recommend any of their noodle or rice dishes (I frequently go with Ma Po Tofu or anything with chicken ^^) and they cater all people from those on special diets, vegetarians, Americanized Chinese food (think orange chicken), to the more traditional dishes.  You can take-out as with most Chinese restaurants, but I've always sat down with friends when I eat here.  Good eats."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Not only does it have fond memories in my heart of high school and college, it has great food and great staff.  The man that owns it is super nice. When I used to go with my sister a lot in high school, he always gave us a huge smile and said, 'Hi twins!'  The Indonesian fried rice, Crispy beef, Crunchy Chicken, and basically anything on the menu is amazing.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Ate a lot from this place while I went to school at UIUC. This place was super busy at lunch/dinner times but still very efficient. There masala fish was very delicious. Although it was sometimes difficult to find spots to sit."}
{"text":"This is my \"secret spot\" I like to go to if I am looking for a coffee and a snack at Foothills. They have sandwiches and stuff too but I am usually there in the mornings.  The coffee is great and they offer a range of lattes as well. They have a lot of baked goods individually wrapped for sale. Don't let the saran wrap fool you -  the items are very fresh and excellent quality. My favourite item is the cranberry or raspberry scone. It has a bit of white chocolate added in and is really delicious.  The service is super friendly and quick, even with a morning coffee line.   My only complaint is the cash only option. I get that it saves them money and makes things faster but sometimes I've had to walk on by despite my scone craving because of this (I rarely have cash). There also isn't much seating so you'll have to buy and find a spot to sit elsewhere or take it to go.  Cravings is a few short steps outside from the Emergency are of the hospital and a bit further from the main entrance but it's worth the walk over if you are at Foothills."}
{"text":"Yum! This hit the spot for some weary travelers. Beware very large portions and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Cravings used to be our go-to lunch spot for Chinese food on campus. Food are not exactly authentic nor delicate, but there are some nice choices (e.g., eggplant beef stew, fish fillets with spicy tofu sauce); portions are big and price is cheap; and the owner is super funny. However, their food is not always fresh, and like another reviewer said,  they had failed food safety inspections so many times that they were close to being shut down.  One star because my husband went there again this evening and got food poisoning and got VERY SICK. Lesson learned and just wanted to caution everybody. Would be three stars for the good memories..."}
{"text":"Ok, Cravings is an interesting experience. There is no atmosphere. The food is sketchy. The line is usually long, it's crowded, and the huge menu is scattered in about 5 different places, making it a little weird the first time you go. But you will be back. I don't know what they put in their food here, but everything is just really, really tasty. It's not going to win any culinary awards any time soon, but for the cheap price, you get a lot of downright delicious chinese food. I've probably been here at least a hundred times over my years on campus, so I'll try to keep this review condensed. Go to Cravings. Order the hot and spicy diced chicken. And never look back."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars..  every time I pass by this place, I want to eat here. .. Only problem is their same dishes taste differently each time... so one need to make sure what he wants..  The owner speaks many languages, hence is pretty funny..."}
{"text":"I haven't been adventurous here so I'm not sure about the more exotic dishes on the menu but this is the place on campus for cheap, yet pretty good, Asian food. I rated it four-stars because, while the food is not amazing, it is good considering how cheap it is.   The decor could be nicer, but it is nice enough for a place on campus But, it tends to fill with smoke so expect to leave smelling like chinese food. Finally, the owner is extremely nice and often throws in sides for free or for nominal cost."}
{"text":"I heard Cravings is the official ECE restaurant. I can dig it.  I've come many times and so far my favorite dishes are the singapore rice noodles and the fish masala. They are spiced pretty heavily, so only order if you know you can handle it. Additionally I find their food a tad salty. for around 7 bucks a meal. Actually like many said the portions are enough for two meals. Cravings definitely has great value. Make sure to ask for more rice after you finish your first bowl, and pack it go to!  I'll be back here many times."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have lunch when I come to visit my son.  Don't expect fine dining it is very divey but you can't beat the value or flavor.  Every time I have come the same man is at the counter taking orders.  He write in beautiful Chinese lettering.  He knows his business and works hard at it.  Some favorite dishes are the dumplings which come with a very nice sweet and spicy sauce, the egg drop soup and the Jakarta fried rice which has a whole fried egg perched on top.  Recently a friend got the chicken curry which is serve with noodles.  It was way too spicy so I would skip that one.  The portions are huge.  The complimentary chrysanthemum or jasmine teas are terrific so make sure to take advantage of them."}
{"text":"Cravings really caters to poor college students--the prices are cheap and the portions are decently sized. And it also helps that the food is actually good here."}
{"text":"Between 6 hungry people, we ordered:  1) Indonesian Fried Rice 2) Crispy Beef 3) Crispy Tofu 4) Chicken Lo Mein 5) MaPo Tofu  Platters are around $7 each and everything is cooked fresh to order. The flavors are amazing here and the service is amazing, the food comes out quickly.  It's feel-good, home-away-from-home cooking.  It's no wonder there's always a lot of international students and a few home-grown midwesterners eating here - they've discovered one of the best spots for Asian food in Champaign.  (And the engineering quad is also right across the street!)  It's not a fancy place.  You'll clean your own plates when you're finished and when you order, you'll be given a number which they will call out from the counter.  You can grab your own silverware, napkins and cups of water/tea from the big kettles near the cash register and clear your own dishes when you're finished.  But what they lack in pomp and panache they make up for with good food and cheerful service.  Simple as that.  If I had to choose to order one thing consistenlty, it would be their crispy tofu.  Hefty wedges of soft tofu are lightly breaded and fried.  It's served topped with strings of fresh green onion and this incredible thick garlic dipping sauce, which I would eat with plain rice.  It's that good!  And it's my favorite.  The Indonesian Fried Rice comes with a fried egg on top and their MaPo Tofu comes spicy (chilis bring it on), in a very sharable portion.  Our dishes also came with the soup of the day, something along the lines of egg drop soup with tomotoes.  Here you will get an affordable meal with amazing Taiwanese-Indonesian-Chinese flavors.  When i was a student here, I would mostly order take-out and the portions would last me at least two meals.  Come here if you want a filling, hearty meal that will nourish your heart and soul.  Dining in is great to eat family style since the dishes are shareable.  If you come consistently enough, I think you'll find your favorite dish that you'll want to order every time.  The owners are incredible people who take great pride in their restaurant.  They know they are a beloved spot on campus and treat their patrons in the same way."}
{"text":"What is this concept of paying cash and not having to pay tax? Hrm...  Takeaways: - Crispy sesame chicken covered in just the right amount of sauce (as in, not doused) - Good size - Incredible price - Free hot tea - Bus your own plates and garbage - If you need a takeout container, just grab it from behind the counter. No fuss.  No wonder Cravings is crowded and busy all of the time. Warning though, expect takeout and not to eat in. There's also no delivery."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cravings for lunch about 2-3 times a month for the last 1.5 years, and have had a whole bunch of items on their menu. Most items on their American menu and Chinese menu are just fine (wouldn't get more than a 3-star ranking), but their ma la fish and Singapore chow fun are absolutely amazing!!! And the best part is that you get a lot of food for ~$8!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. It's very homey, the owners are super friendly. Our favorite dish is the hot and spicy chicken, which we haven't found made the same way at any other Chinese restaurant. Whenever we visit CU, we stop by for the chicken before hitting the road again.  Update: We stopped by again this past weekend, we were impressed that they greeted customers by name and offered Pokemon Go advice to students. That's something we don't see that much anymore in restaurants and was heartwarming to see."}
{"text":"Cravings is the best Chinese restaurant on campus (Golden Harbor is off campus).  Hot and spicy chicken, Jakarta fried rice, Yangzhou fried rice... whatever you get off the Chinese menu... it'll all be really good.  The owners remember their regulars and are always so enthusiastic when they see you come in.  I've been here way too many times than I can count because the food is really good, the portions are huge, and the price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and the owner is super friendly. I am a senior on campus and I would argue that this is the best Chinese restaurant on campus.  What should you eat? Jakarta fried rice, Spicy Chicken, and Crispy Beef. I literally came here 2 or 3 times a week this past summer and I never regretted it."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! These people aren't goofing around! Although this restaurant is lacking in atmosphere, this is fully made up for in quality and quantity of food. It is by far the best tasting Chinese I have had on campus, for a bargain deal too!   Bang for your buck, get some takeout and give it  a try."}
{"text":"We stopped in Cravings for take out. We are only in the area a handful of times a year and have managed to go when they were closed (every time). We were excited to see that they were open and didn't mind too much walking a distance due to no available close parking spots. Many parking spots that we found on campus were metered spots. It's about $1.25 for an hour parking.   Overall I enjoyed my experience (it was a carry out order). Our order was quickly taken and we sat down and waited for 10-15 minutes. It was slightly after lunch time and the restaurant was still busy with carry out and dine in business. We were greeted by a friendly, older gentleman that was extremely helpful and patient with us. I was overwhelmed with the menu selection. This was my first time trying Malaysian cuisine and did not know what flavor profile to expect from the dishes. We ordered the Jakarta fried rice, salt and peppered squid, spicy diced chicken, and fish in chili oil. Our order came with four little containers of steamed white rice. I have to mention that this rice was nicely cooked. It wasn't mushy nor was it under cooked. All  of the food was nicely cooked and packed. Thank you for not using staples! My favorite dish out of the four was the fish in chili oil. It wasn't what I expected. It was more like a fish stew than a stir fry dish. It was packed in a soup container. The squid was perfectly cooked. By the time I got to the chicken I was full. The portions were HUGE. We have leftover for days.   I will definitely return the next time I am in the area. I want to try the various noodle dishes."}
{"text":"My daughter had masala fish at this restaurant last night and it had so much MSG in it that she still has palpitation and headache. This place needs to shut down for feeding such chemical laden food to the students!"}
{"text":"The Spicy Fish Masala is pure awesomeness. Shrimp Fried Rice is my next favorite. The flavor is unique. Will be a fan forever!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious. from the way they speak to the atmosphere of the entire place, I can tell I was getting some authentic food. my friends brought me here and I was instantly hooked. cannot wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"You get a but load of food for around 5 dollars. Try their Jakarta fried rice if you want a new spin on fried rice!"}
{"text":"The food here is cheap and has large portions. Also the quality is decent for the price. I go here often with my Korean friend that lived in China, and he thinks the food here is pretty authentic."}
{"text":"First time in Champaign, IL and I went to my trusty Yelp app to find a tasty place for dinner. After reading the reviews for Craving, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the summer hours aren't updated on Yelp and the place was closed early on Sunday night. Oh well, Monday night, I returned and boy, was I glad I did.  This place is about as dive as you can get. But we all know, good Chinese restaurants are all about the food...so I dove into the menu. I was happy to see they had a \"Chinese\" menu for the real authentic dishes. I ordered the mushroom and tofu curry. It came with a small bowl of seaweed soup and rice. Extra rice was free (which is always should be!) as was the hot tea and ice cold water. The curry and the soup were both delicious.  I returned the next time to try their famous hot and spicy chicken. WOW! The servings are enormous. There is a reason why this is the most popular dish...it was amazing.  Cravings is a must try for Asian food lovers. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Holy Mapo Tofu!  I ordered this the first time going and I was blown away.  There was no fuss in \"holding the meat\", so I think this place is pretty veg-friendly.  It was packed when I went to pick up my food, but it was ready in the short walk it took me to get there (less than 15 min).  I will sample much more from the menu but based on their Mapo tofu alone I will easily award 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I go here probably at least once a week and each time I always get the Jakarta Fried Rice with whatever I'm getting. I could live off their Jakarta Fried Rice.  Everything else is also amazing. I've made it a goal to try everything they offer by the time I leave Champaign and so far of the dozens and dozens of things I've tried the only thing I didn't love is their Gado Gado.  The man behind the counter is super friendly and recognizes me everytime I go.  They give you as much rice as you like when you eat in. The only downside is as far as I know they don't have any duck on the menu."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the most affordable lunch options on campus.  One can't go wrong with Chinese cuisine  - the food is delicious, the menu offers quite a bit to select from."}
{"text":"This is my go to Asian in campus-town. Very deep menu, you could eat here 45 days in row and have something different. Portions are HUGE, kitchen is fast, owner is great. Tip - get there before 11:30 when class is in session or you will need to carry-out or troll a table.   There are plenty other similar places close, but none this good at this price point for me!"}
{"text":"Hot and spicy Chicken is a must try! It is the best tasting, authentic Chinese. However, not the cleanest inside, take it to go so that the cleanliness doesn't bother you."}
{"text":"Why is the food so good??! I literally can't get enough of the food here. Coming from a Chinese family, this place really reminds me of home with the Asian ladies peeling peas, the numerous voices chatting in different languages, and sometimes the owner's children? running around. It's a very lively place and I really like the owner - he's fluent in multiple languages and is overall a pretty cool guy. The food is really cheap and you get a lot for what you pay. One nuisance is the long lines and crowds because they're so popular, but they have a good ticket system to make sure you get your order.  My favorite item is the Jakarta fried rice! I've also ordered the wonton noodles in miso soup which have lasted me for lunch, dinner, and impromptu midnight snack. Their menu is really diverse and offers home-made meals from China, India, Indonesia, and many more Asian countries. If you're from outside of the U.S. and missing home, a meal here will soothe your aching heart like chicken lo mein for the soul."}
{"text":"THE BEST.      . This is my soul food now and im not even Chinese. Please eat sesame chicken, hot and spicy chicken, mapa tofu and Jakarta fried rice."}
{"text":"Owner is quietly friendly thought the good quality wasn't that good. I ordered the indonesian fried rice which  is their speciality however was rather disappointed by the taste. The veg food was even worse."}
{"text":"Can't be in UIUC without eating here at least once. Stuff is spicy, since they are doused with chili oil. But shit, it's addicting"}
{"text":"The person taking the order does not understand English and was very rude. I took tofu and rice togo. And asked her to pack the tofu and rice in 2 different togo boxes cause many times the one togo box leaks and breaks. She said 'NO'. I asked why not. She just started mumbling and shouting something I couldn't understand. And just went away."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place whenever I get carry-out. The food never falls short of my expectations of authentic Asian food. I usually get a lunch box with white rice with broccoli and beef. Even when I had food poisoning from eating at the dining halls, my go-to place for carry-out was Cravings. The employees there are always attentive, and greet me whenever I enter. Some of them also speaks decent to fluent English in case you're wondering."}
{"text":"There are so many options, yet I find myself ordering the same two things (with a few exceptions here and there):  -Hunan Chicken: Mixed veggies and white chicken meat. Flavorful salty sauce. Sometimes get it with less salt, other times I get it extra spicy (not very spicy to start).  -Jakarta Fried Rice: Special ordered with chicken and mixed veggies in place of shrimp. A slightly sweet fried rice with an over-hard egg on top.  The place is busy, crowded, gives great quantities for the money (~6/dish that is much better in quality and quantity than what you'd get at somewhere like the inferior Panda Express), and has friendly staff.  Ozito (sp?) is a boss."}
{"text":"Good food, if you know what you are looking for. Large portions. The menu has good dishes and bad dishes.  I recommend sizzling chicken hot pot, eggplant with Szechuan garlic sauce, and twice cooked pork.    Never go for their 'most popular' dishes or you will never find the actually good dishes!   Bad, free tea. Chairs and tables sticky/smell like hot chili oil, do not leave your jacket on them.    Overall slightly above average chinese place, definitely different (better) than your run of the mill takeout. Go here to figure out what irresponsible students actually eat."}
{"text":"the gado gado sauce was great but the chicken was overly fried. the sauce in the mixed veggies was just way too thick, way too salty and probably loaded with msg."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite restaurant on campus. The service is amazing, and the man who runs the place is the most interesting guy I've met on campus. Hot and Spicy Chicken, Jakarta Fried Rice, Crispy Chicken Slice, Tofu Dry Curry, Tofu Masala and Todu Gado Gado are my go to items. Come for the food, stay for the service."}
{"text":"More Authentic, cheaper prices. I'd have to say this place is a better priced for portion Chinese place while still maintaining a high quality sense of food. I've been here multiple times and my friends extremely love this place (their favorite being the Jakarta fried rice). I've tried a plethora of their menu and enjoyed every single one.   Don't think you will be disappointed if you come here, the only complaint is that, it is quite small during busy hours, it might be difficult finding a spot to eat in the restaurant with a group"}
{"text":"Probably not the freshest Chinese (most of it is probably frozen) in town. But it's still delicious. I've been a fan for years. Prices have gone up over the past few years but that's inflation, I guess. The Chinese American woman is always friendly and helpful when she's at the front taking orders. The older man and woman are fine, as well, although not quite as chatty (but I suppose this is understandable). Food tends to be a bit on the greasy and salty side, but it's never overboard and tends to be right on the mark for good Chinese American food. Had a friend from Hong Kong come with me here and he said it was \"legit.\" They used to give free soup with any order but they stopped, which is a shame. Still a great place to get a great, filling meal without breaking the bank. Interiors are super divey, but that might be part of the appeal. On a side note: another reviewer wrote: \"The owners remember their regulars and are always so enthusiastic when they see you come in.\" I have noticed this, too, but it appeared to apply mostly only to the white, non-Chinese/Chinese American or Chinese/Chinese American patrons. Alas, I have been coming here since 2009 but have never experienced this. Maybe I'm not enough of either :) Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but still an observation."}
{"text":"On a college students budget, this place is a mecca for getting a full stomach.  For about six bucks, I can get orange chicken with rice, at excellent quality, not to mention that the portions are huge which is a fantastic quality.  Only downside is a long wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"I love this place and would give it 5 stars for what it is.  It is great low priced ($5-$8) Asian food that will feed you for at least two meals.  To put that into perspective I am 260 lbs and yes, there servings feed me for two meals, so if you're a 120 lb female you could probably get a weeks worth of food from one meal here.  Large portions are one thing, but the food is also amazing.  I have ordered countless authentic and Americanized items off of their menu and all of it was great.  As far as campus Chinese restaurants are concerned this is the place to go.  Golden Harbor might be a bit better as far as quality, but it isn't on campus and isn't nearly as cheap."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. I really really enjoy the food. That being said, you are eating it with the risk of getting food poisoning. If Cravings does not pass their next inspection, they will be shut down because they time and time again have violated many food safety laws."}
{"text":"The menu is enormous.  They have four: the menu above the register, the English paper menu, the Chinese menu on the back, and the specials menu to the side of the register.  The food is dirt cheap and very good.  The Jakarta Fried Rice is some of the best fried rice I have ever had, and their more authentic dishes are just as good.  The complimentary tea is also a nice touch.  To top it all off, the staff are so friendly! If you want excellent pan Asian food on a budget, Cravings is where you need to be."}
{"text":"After my fifth time ordering off the \"American\" menu, the man taking orders gave me the Chinese menu. I got the hint. So now I've ordered from both menus and I've never been disappointed. It's not the best food, but it's good, and it's very convenient, and it's fast, and it's not expensive. I haven't ordered something I didn't like."}
{"text":"I was recommended to eat at this place by my friend and I was not dissapointed. It is one of the best place to eat for college students. A lot of their food is under 10 bucks. They prepare their food fast. Try out their chicken gado gado, fried rice (jakarta or house)."}
{"text":"Great takeout options. The food was fine. I got Chinese food, but there are so many other cuisines available on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is a family owned restaurant with a rapport that is unmatched in Champaign. My dining experience was exceptional, due to the family friendly vibes and the hospitable staff. I had a spicy, curry chicken dish that was recommended by the owner. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of my dish but believe me when I say it was delicious. The spice was not overpowering and the flavors were very robust. The price was very affordable, there are very few things on the menu over $10. After receiving my food, the owner personally came over to my table and asked if I liked the food. He stated that he wanted to be sure that I enjoyed it. This was very nice of him and it made me feel appreciated that I decided to dine here with my friends.   I went during peak dinner times, so the place was packed. I did find the overcrowded dining area to be a bit overwhelming, but the food made up for that. This is also indicative of just how good the food is! One thing that I don't like is that fact that you have to stand in line and place your order at the register before being seated. I would've preferred a waiter. For your first time, be sure to review the menu before going for this very reason. I lucked up and trusted the owner's recommendation.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised. If you are in the mood for some good Chinese food you must try this place out."}
{"text":"Well, almost exactly one year later, I've revisited Cravings as my first lunch after coming back to CU. While the points I made last time about the interior still stand, I did try the Jakarta fried rice, and it was quite good! Good enough to bump this up to 4 stars, but alas, I had some bad service this time around. A mistake was made when putting in my order, so I ended up having to wait 20 minutes for my food. I couldn't even sit down to wait since all the tables were full. Ack! Just 3 stars then...  P.S. Excessive use of styrofoam - cups, takeaway boxes, and bowls for small soups, all in styrofoam."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout with a friend, after he said this place was really good.  I got a vegetable - udon noodle dish, since my spot in line came up before I was ready and I had to make a snap decision.  I also got fried rice and crab rangoon.  I wish I had more time to decide, but we were in a hurry.  The menu was much larger than I was expecting, divided into different regions, and I would love to come back and try something else.  Total, including tax, came to around $13, which is pretty good for the amount of food I got.  Even though I was warned to be ready for a wait, and it was the dinner rush, we got out in probably about 15 minutes.    My udon ended up being good, if a bit plain.  The crab rangoon was good, and I wish I had more of it, but it was not spectacular.  I was told the fried rice was very good, though a bit on the salty side.  Looking at the other reviews, I suspect I will have to give this place another try and order something different.  Maybe it will blow me away next time."}
{"text":"the dirtiest resturant on campus! More than often, you'll see the owner cleaning beans right in front of you on one of the tables. Despite being dirty, they cook amazing food.  some of the best chineese dishes I ever ate."}
{"text":"Cravings is like that one ex you keep going back to because \"it will be different this time\" but on the other hand you know that she's terrible for you and she will lead you to your demise. Eating here is playing Chinese Roulette. Will eating here kill me this time? Woo, free adrenaline rush!  Boasting negative food safety scores every single time they get inspected (yes, you can score negative points / 100), this place has been shut down more times than I can count. Even so, like a majestic phoenix, it never fails to come roaring back to life. On day 1 of reopening you can bet your bottom dollar I will be there along with all the other people.... (wait for it) CRAVING for Cravings despite all the times I've gotten food poisoning from here.  I've been coming here for 10 years now since I was a freshman. Having graduated, when I visit Champaign I will go out of my way to eat a steaming hot plate of crispy General Tso's Chicken made extra spicy. If I really want to flirt with danger, I get Jakarta Fried Rice. Want something lighter? Sorry but you're SOL.  It's a great place to go for a first date. If your date is hesitant about Cravings because of its grungy exterior, alt + f4 and gtfo because that person is a judgmental prick that's only there for your looks and money, instead of fawning over your beautiful gorgeous personality. Frankly speaking, you don't need that kind of negativity in your life.  If your date is willing to try it out (or better yet, already a fan of Cravings), you know you've got a winner winner General Tso's chicken dinner. As an extra bonus, you'll get to enjoy the rest of your day / night together with the scent of greasy Chinese food emanating from your newly perfumed bodies.  This restaurant is a Champaign-Urbana staple and I pray that it will exist for a- all day long forever... all a - a hundred days Cravings! Forever a hundred times.... OVER and over eat at Cravings dot com.. W W W dot at Cravings dot com w..w..w... eat at Cravings.. ah- hundred years..... every minute Cravings dot com.... w w w a hundred times... Cravings dot com......."}
{"text":"Cravings is one of the things I miss most about Champaign...  Some menu items are more authentic than others.  Service is very friendly-- the owner is great!"}
{"text":"Twice-cooked pork is pretty good. But it's super oily as well. Actually most of the dishes are a little too oily and salty. Also it's very welcomed by engineering students given the location. Overall a solid restaurant suitable for quick weekday lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Worst one ever in U of I. They said a beef dish  actually served after 40 mins. Nasty tables and sticky ground. Will give zero if possible."}
{"text":"I am hesitant to give out 5 stars on Yelp, but Cravings earns mine without a doubt.  This is not only the best Chinese food in Champaign-Urbana, but also some of the best Chinese fast food I've had anywhere. I'm from Los Angeles, where we claim Monterrey Park and Alhambra as the official China Town of America, at least cuisine-wise, but I find that Cravings beats out most of the places I've eaten at out here.  During the year I spent living in Urbana, I frequented Cravings almost every week, and during that time I have tasted almost half the items on the menu.  Most students coming grab a lunch-sized dish for $5 or $6, but ordering the $8 or $9 full dishes pays off if you plan to be out studying all day. You get so much food that you can easily take half of it with you to go, so you can finish it later while studying at the library or wherever.  Menu highlights include the Mongolian Beef, the Marsala Fish (careful, very spicy!), the spicy crunch chicken, or if you want healthy, the seaweed seafood dishes.  If you're just a beginner, you might want to just stick with the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, or Kung Pao just to experience how they do the classics so well and full of flavor, then move on to other items in subsequent visits.  My biggest regret in leaving Urbana is being able to taste the food that this wonderful Malaysian family has brought to corn-field country!"}
{"text":"Simple but good chinese food. Recommend sezchuan or hunan chicken dishes. However, very busy at peak meal times so plan wisely."}
{"text":"Very good Asian food just off Green St. My new favorite place for sure. The chicken was tender and soft unlike other places where it can be a little rubbery. The portions were also huge and it's such a low price. The service was fast and friendly as well. Would definitely recommend and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get Chinese food on campus! They are really fast and the food is delicious. The owners are extremely nice and accommodating and best of all, the food is very inexpensive. Every time family comes into town or I have friends over, we make our way to cravings for a great meal. You order at the counter and they call your number when you food is ready and all you do is go and pick it up yourself. No fuss dining. There is also free water, hot tea and plastic utensils in the front - server yourself.  Here are some dishes I love: -spicy fried chili chicken: fried chicken pieces that are stir fried with scallions, spicy chili and sweet yellow onions (spicy and delicious! - all time fav!)  -salt an pepper squid: fried strips of squid stir fried with green peppers and onions (crispy and irresistible)  -masala fish: battered fish stir fried with masala spice and veggies  -eggplant with ground pork: the eggplant is soft and tender, which is well balanced with the rice ground pork -pork belly -clams with black bean sauce -mapo tofu  The staff is super friendly and have great recommendations if you're not sure what to get. Overall, great food! This place gets packed pretty quickly so make sure you snag a table!"}
{"text":"I go at least 1 every 2 weeks. I LOVE THIS PLACE.   I am addicted to there Jakarta Fried Rice. I always look for it when I go to other places but they don't have it. If they do have it they don't come close to Cravings' version. Their menu is really big. Everything that I have tried I liked. I like that people speak Chinese it gives it an authentic feel."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Cravings every couple weeks for the last two years or so.  It is the best Asian restaurant in Champaign County, bar none. Golden Harbor is a close second.  The two workers who deal with customers are the friendliest restaurant workers I think I have ever encountered. After fifty visits here, I have never seen either one in an apparent bad mood. They're just happy people, and happy people make great food.   FYI: Whilst observing the magic behind the curtain one day, I did see them cooking the vegetables by blanching them in a deep fat fryer along with the egg rolls. -- And that's why Chinese food tastes good, folks!"}
{"text":"Only complaint is my clothes usually smell after I come out of the restaurant. Otherwise great place for the price."}
{"text":"Got here at 9:20pm on a Sunday night but got turned away because the owner said they were closed. We informed them the door said they were open till 9:30pm. Bummer because I really wanted to try this!"}
{"text":"Love this place for cheap and pretty tasty chinese-ish food.  Went there the other day, and my boyfriend and i split the fish masala (crispy and spicy) and pork hofun (noodly with mild brown sauce).  2 very different meals, both delicious and very filling.    Food is very reasonably priced,.  Restaurant does look a bit dingy and generally smells a bit funky, maybe a greasy-smell.  Still recommend the food."}
{"text":"Fair price for the food. The owner is fun to chat with, and they have good service. A great place to eat on campus town. Like their Uno w/spicy noodle soup! It's like tom yum!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, if you can get over the bugs in your rice. I had no idea this place has been shut down so many times for health code violations, but now I can't say that I'm surprised. Eat with caution."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck. I live on Hot n Spicy Chicken. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Not even a question about it, this is the best chinese food you can get in urbana, possibly in the entire midwest. I went to school in Champaign for a year, and I ate at Cravings at least once a week, it was my comfort food, my go to for when friends visited, and the thing I miss most. If you are in champaign and like food, this hole in the wall is a must. I recommend the Mongolian Beef!"}
{"text":"After hours of contemplations, we finally decided on chinese for dinner. We have seen the reviews for cravings but never made our way through their doors. What a big mistake, we have been missing out on some pretty amazing Chinese food. This review was for our take out dinner a couple nights ago. I was scrolling through my pictures today, and stubbled upon the delicious dishes we shared that night.   Service: The people working here are super friendly, down to earth, and kind!!! After ordering three dishes and an appetizers, we were shocked to hear that our order would be prepared and ready to pick up in 10 minutes. We didn't hesitate and made our way down town. When we arrived our food was waiting for us. The cashier that rang us up was funny, and sooo damn nice. Our total was $31.32, I paid $31 and was scrambling through my purse looking for change when the the cashier told me not to worry about the extra 32 cents. SERIOUSLY???? Who does that???   Food: All the dishes were hot and delicious, even with takeout. We ordered the orange chicken, which was superb! The orange chicken actually had a hint of orange flavor from the orange peels. In addition, we had the happy family and that was pretty good too! There was lots of meat and shrimp with their special sauce. The veggies were also fresh and delightful. Lastly, we tried their beef lo mein, which was interesting because we've never had it this way before. Lots of beef and chili flakes but it wasn't spicy like we ordered. However it still satisfied our cravings for the night.   Price: The prices are way cheaper than fast food Chinese takeout. Three dinner dishes and an appetizer for $31, what a steal. You could feed a family of 4 because the portions are so big.   Ambiance: Simple layout, not much decor but the place looked cleaned. I am looking forward to dinning-in next time.   Overall: Looking forward to trying more dishes at this hidden gem, can't wait to be back for more delicious goodness! Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"I've been living off Cravings these past 2 years, literally.  They have a big menu so the tip is you know what to order. Don't just try something randomly as you might have a negative experience.  The owner is very nice and every time I ran into him in Champaign, he always remembered me and said hi to me.  Dishes that I recommend include  -hot & spicy chicken (my go-to dish. I had this like everyday last spring);  -mapo tofu (really good, spicy, and only 6.50 for a very generous portion);  -gado gado chicken (nutty and sweet); -masala fish (crispy and spicy fish fillet);  -beef pan fried chow fun (stir-fried beef with large noodle, really good); -Sizzling chicken pot (I have to stress it. it's SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion); -Pepper and Salt Squid (apparently everything starts with \"Pepper and Salt ___\" is really good. Try pepper and salt fish also).  Some more Chinese dishes that I like: -black mush room & tofu w/ groundpork; -basil pork with rice; -bean noodles with ground pork (a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish); -hot & sour seafood noodle soup (tom yum based, with LOTS of seafood, perfectly for a cold day); (these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter).  The Mongolian beef is good but it's not consistent. I like it to be a bit overcooked, but sometimes it's still a little rare to my liking, especially during peak hours.  These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i'm not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general."}
{"text":"This place has the best orange chicken I have ever tasted. My only regret is that I discovered it so late in my undergrad. The food is made in a respectable amount of time and the owner is so friendly. Call ahead because this place is always packed around dinner time. The free hot tea is fantastic. I like everything about this place and can't wait for the next time I am able to go. Five stars are well deserved."}
{"text":"Having been an Engineering student of UIUC, it is almost inevitable coming into contact with Cravings. At first, I was skeptical about this place, mainly because of its outer appearance and about some hearsay. However, I finally decided to go there a few month ago, and let me make it short - I have been coming back there almost every day from back then.  To start off, I have to say that the atmosphere there is not really the best you can find around campus - and that is already said quite nicely. Saying that, I mean that you should get used to people lining up right behind your table, a lot of walking around and loud talking. But since you most likely do not go there for the atmosphere, let's talk about their food.  First off, they have an American and a Chinese menu. While most of the customers tend to the first one and decide to go for dishes such as Fried Rice or Noodles, the real good things lie beyond.   Admittedly, I was disappointed about this place when first going there a couple of times. I had several versions of the fried rice including the \"famous\" Jakarta fried rice. Characteristic for those dishes is the huge amount of cooking oil being used and not much more.  Shortly after being introduced to some more alternative choices, I really came to appreciate this place. Especially the Chinese menu holds a great amount of diverse dishes that really come with a great taste - let it be seafood, beef or tofu. I have to admit that I do not really like the chicken there and the pork is even a level below that. I mainly stuck with beef and seafood and I could never complain about the taste and quality of those. The Beef or Tofu with Mixed Vegetable was one of my favorite dishes there, mainly because they actually serve a huge portion of vegetables and beef that will never make you leave unsatisfied.  The Braised Beef with Noodles and Bean Casserole is also really good in terms of that it offers a unique taste. The Sizzling Chicken Pot is also really good if you are more in the mood for a hearty and more greasy dish - and in contrast to the usual Fried Rice it actually comes with a different facet of taste.  As for the main noodle dishes, I can recommend Seafood or Beef Angle Hair and, one of my favorite dishes there, Seafood or Beef Chow Fen. This dish consists of stir-fried wide rice noodles which, admittedly, are quite greasy. However, you can tell them to make it a little less greasy when ordering.  Also, with every main dish you get a bowl of Miso Soup. The soup itself is nothing special, but actually quite O.K. for coming at no extra cost. Also you get as much hot urn tea as you want.  Generally speaking, I would always order the small alternative when giving the option between Large and Small since the small portion is already more than big enough for one single person. In general, every dish being served is more than enough in terms of size.   And the best about it is that it actually is crazily cheap to eat there. The Tofu with Mixed Vegetable, for example, comes for a little less than 6$. Generally, it is a good idea to go there with a friend and share a large portion of something and you come out at around 6 $ each also. You will hardly find any restaurant around campus that beats their pricing. I admit that the dishes there are certainly not top-notch - for their prices, however, you cannot ask for more.   If you are an Engineering student (and even if you are not), you should have checked this place out at least once in your UIUC student career, and please do not leave it at ordering only some variation of Fried Rice - go ahead and try some of their other stuff, too. At some point of time, you will  eventually find \"your\" dish that makes you always come back for more, even if it might be their Fried Rice ;-)."}
{"text":"Outstanding....i usually get the american \"chinese\" like general tsos, sesame chicken, etc.  The jakarta fried rice with tofu and veggies is also amazing.  Really cheap (about 6 bucks) for a d-lish hot meal.  I usually try not to eat the whole plate because it is definitely more than one healthy person should eat, but i usually can't stop myself.  couple of types of tea for free while you eat in...  gets packed during peak times around noon and dinner time, so seating can get hard to find, but getting it to go and eating at home or outside somewhere works just as well.  cravings is the go to place for us ae students in the area...someone always has it in the lab, and always makes me want some...  actually, in all honesty, after writing all of this, i am walking straight there."}
{"text":"2 things to order- Jakarta fried rice and hot and spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Having spent 5 years at the University of Illinois, Cravings was far and away the hot spot for the college of engineering (across the street from the engineering campus) students for lunch or dinner. I must have been to this place over 50 times. The staff is extremely friendly. Every time I go there I ask G' Tao (owner) for a new dish based on my preferences, he never disappoints. Only knock on this place the food is a little oily and I wouldn't consider it healthy eating haha. But when the food is this good who cares!  Long Story Short: There have been several times where I was bashing my head at the computer lab working on an engineering project and just said \"Screw this, I'm going to Cravings\". Nothing saved the day like food from Cravings.   Shop Notes: Pretty small shop and gets packed pretty quickly around lunch and dinner. Service is very quick and efficient, take out is always a good option. Very reasonably priced with pretty large portions.  Sentence Summary: Is the food entirely healthy? Not really. Is it delicious and authentic? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Cravings has fed me throughout my 4 years as an undergrad and now I really miss it. Chicken teriyaki with lots of onion was my favorite. I have a feeling I might take a three hours car ride just to have some of that goodness. There is nothing worst than a craving for Cravings."}
{"text":"I haven't even tried the food yet, but the service is more than enough to bring me back again. They've got a wide variety of cuisines here, but they're mainly a Chinese restaurant. For their Chinese food, they have separate English and Chinese menus (with American Chinese food on one, and real Chinese food on the other).  The girl at the counter was very enthusiastic about explaining the menu to us. She made several recommendations and she knew everything that was in every dish on the menu. Totally different from most Chinese restaurants.  *Update: The food was great. My tofu in the stir fry tofu with black fungus could've been crisper, but the seasoning was perfect. The whole dinner portion comes with unlimited rice, unlimited side soup, and hot tea for under $8! I will definitely be back again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Cravings used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the CU area. However, over the past few years, I have noticed a significant decline in quality. For example, I  used to order the spicy fried rice at least once a week, but I stopped after noticing that the quality of the vegetables had gone down and the flavoring had become inconsistent."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss CRAVINGS. This place is really like home away from home. The guy who runs the place is from my hometown in Malaysia. So usually when I walk in here I just ask him whats good today and I just take what he recommends.  For fans of uber spicy dishes, try the chilli chicken.  Yes the place is dingy, but its really cheap, especially if you split family style. You can call ahead to order."}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of dishes. The fried rice, noodles and chicken in garlic sauce are all deelish!  I love the tea too. This place is great."}
{"text":"Five minutes in I wanted to leave. So I did.   It wasn't very busy, walked in and sat down, didn't realize you're supposed to order and fetch yourself. Table was dirty, started to wipe it down as I noticed the manager was standing there watching me and not offering to help.  All the other reviews rave about the bang for the buck on tasty food and I'm willing to bet they're right. Maybe one day I'll come back and take it to go."}
{"text":"Pretty average and basic.  The menu bored me a little, the food was good not great.  I ordered beef with black bean sauce and it was good but nothing special.  Granted I paid like $7.  Overall, it was kind of boring considering the alternatives close by!"}
{"text":"Cravings is notorious among engineering students as the go-to Chinese restaurant on campus (Golden Harbor is a bit too far out for some people). It's located near the engineering quad, which makes it especially convenient for engineering students. Cravings has had many health violations (just check out the /r/uiuc subreddit for news on that) over the years, but I personally haven't gotten violently ill from the food. I guess that's a plus...  The most popular dish by far is the Jakarta fried rice. It's only about $5 and they give you a plate of steaming fried rice with some meats and veggies. I quite like the fish filet dishes, and their menu is pretty extensive. It's not the best Chinese food in Champaign-Urbana, but it's certainly convenient for me and my classmates."}
{"text":"Cheap Asian food (though on the oily side). Cravings definitely gets busy during the lunch hours though. The owner is a cool guy, he knows a ton of Asian languages and dialects.  Oh yeah, don't eat in the restaurant unless you want to go back to class/lab smelling like Chinese food."}
{"text":"I had heard many good things for so long but for some reason never ate at Cravings until today. Boy do I regret not going there sooner.  I may be a bit impulsive with the 5 stars after only one visit but I went with 2 friends and sampled everything they ordered and it was all delicious. Add to that the fact that the prices were great, the food was prepared fresh and piping hot, the wait was short despite a good crowd inside and it all adds up to 5 stars for me. The menu is enormous and you should have no trouble finding something you like whether you're a meat-lover, vegetarian or vegan. They also offer a sampling of Indonesian, Indian, Malaysian, Chinese and Thai dishes.  I tried Pork Gado-Gado for the first time and it was amazing! I've never had such good luck picking something at random that I'm unfamiliar with. This is an Indonesian dish with thin strips of pork, large slices of fresh, crisp, lightly sauteed carrot, onion and green bell pepper in a not-too-thick, spicy peanut sauce.  I plan to go back often and work my way through most, if not all, of the dishes."}
{"text":"Clearly my Chinese cravings were going nuts, and I had to satisfy them with some of the best deals Champaign has to offer for UIUC students and the local area alike.  My friend and I were on our way back to Chicago from the deep red part of Illinois and decided to grab a late bite before reaching home. We were looking up restaurants around UoI since I had never been there before (yep!), and figured we'd find some good deals with the number of perceived broke college students around.  ...and what a gem we found in Cravings! The menu here is huge and so are their portions. I was very impressed with the wide range of Chinese options you could choose from, and their online menu doesn't include the Malay and other specialized items they have.  We ordered the seafood delight as well as their orange chicken. Yea we know it's basic, but it's Chinese fast food! Both of these came in large, piping hot styrofoam box along with a side of white rice. As we ate in the car on our way home, we were impressed with the quality and tastiness of the food. Seriously, what a deal!  If you want some great Chinese-American food for a really great price, I can't think of another place in Champaign but Cravings. Y'all got it made here at UoI. Treasure this because outside these corners lay higher taxes and smaller portions!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and quick. If you are looking for cheap Chinese food this is the place. Free tea as well!!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  The Thai Basil Green Beans are a favorite of mine.  The ordering system is a bit convoluted, and be sure to come when it isn't busy."}
{"text":"You can actually choose your own combination ! Chow mien and orange chicken! Huge portion!"}
{"text":"Living at the corner of Green and Wright, I should have seen my addiction to Cravings as inevitable.   There is a huge menu with a lot of great items. My favorites are the General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Jakarta Fried Rice, and the Hot and Spicy chicken. The food is delicious. The prices are great. You always get more than enough meat and a side of rice.   That said, the place is kind of sketchy. There are rumors that it was closed for a few days in Spring 2013 due to health violations. And I'll admit, I have seen a bug or two crawl around right on the menu. But with the delicious, greasy food that comes out of here, I'm willing to eat a couple bugs. Definitely worth it.   Pro Tip: Call in your order for pick up and start walking there. By the time you get there, your order will be ready to go and all you have to do is pay. Boom."}
{"text":"Very quick and cheap for a lunch between classes. Never good to actually sit down and enjoy your meal. Always busy. Owners are nice tho. Flavor is more americanized with lots of things just fry together."}
{"text":"Man. I was wary about this place, because it looks like every other Chinese food place ever and I don't like most takeout restaurants. But it's really really good. Sure, it's not the swankiest of places, but if that bothers you so much take your food to go!  First of all, the guy running the place is so cool. I told him I wasn't feeling well and wanted some soup. He was like, I have JUST the thing. Not long after, I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol' chunks of fish cakes, squid and shrimp. It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles, and it was nice and spicy. At most places, when they talk about spicy food, it's not really that hot. Not so at Cravings. I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose.  Gross, I know.  Anyway, the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge. They provide water and tea for free, which is great when it's cold outside. And they give great takeout containers for soups. I know, it's the little things. I'll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu. Hm, I wonder if they deliver..."}
{"text":"The employee or owner at the register recommended the hot & spicy chicken; but, if that is the best they have, I don't want to come back.  The chicken was hard and flavorless, as if it had sat in a freezer for months, before being thawed and stir-fried."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My girlfriend and I always get the spicy chili chicken and green beans with tofu gan.  Everything that we get here is amazing!  Great service!  However, your clothes tend to smell bad after eating here.  I wince at the people who come in dressed in suits...."}
{"text":"My second take-out Chinese experience in Chabana while here at school, and it wasn't much better than the first.   My roommates and I decided to order from Cravings after realizing the Golden Harbor might be too expensive. This was probably a bad decision as we had moved from probably middle tier Chinese to low tier Chinese food in terms of price and quality.  The General Tso's chicken was just OK, I've had better and it honestly more resembled orange chicken in both taste and looks.  Others got a beef dish and a seafood combination which was on the Chinese menu. I had no clue many of these restaurants have Chinese menus that are often more authentic and probably better quality and tasting than the regular menus. I need to order off those menus and not the Americanized ones for future reference.  The fried rice was pretty bland as well.   Eggrolls not very good, either.  They forgot to include a side order of crab Rangoon and when we called back they said next time we are in the Rangoon will be free.   I wasn't impressed with the food but in all fairness it was like $6.50 for a large portion so at least I wasn't hungry afterwards.  I still want to try some of the other Chinese places in Champaign as well as ordering off the non-Americanized menus. I think the cuisine is interesting but the quality just hasn't been there at the last couple places I've tried."}
{"text":"Customer service at this place rocks!!!  The food tho... The chicken had the taste of freezer. The green peppers also had a weird taste. The rice was good tho, and the teas as well. The miso soup could have been less salty and have some sea weed in them... This one had no sea weed, a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and very affordable. I have yet to try everything on the menu but I have yet to be disappointed. They have free tea and ice water and that has saved my life on multiple occasions. The owners are lively and the store itself is comforting in terms of atmosphere. I love eating with my friends here, or alone. The only downside is that there's no Wi-Fi, but I can't blame the owners for that because that's something difficult to install and likely not economical. The place isn't luxurious by any means, but it doesn't try to be and that's perfectly fine. It's more than enough for a college student like me!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese within campus limits.  The hot and spicy diced chicken is my personal go-to.  It's the perfect combination of greasy and spicy and the rice tastes great once it's absorbed the oil.  I've also had the fried rice, which is a solid and cheaper choice."}
{"text":"The food is just okay and wasn't meant as high dining. It's just no-frills Chinese staple food served fast and cheap. The restaurant interior is down-to-earth and unpretentious. The staff is friendly. I come here because it's a convenient lunch spot by the engineering quad."}
{"text":"Very decently priced food, with a with a wide variety of items on the menu. Menu size does not matter however as this place is all about the Jakarta fried rice. Once you've had Jakarta fried rice here, you kind of tend to never order anything else."}
{"text":"The prices are great, they have very quick service, and the food is what you would expect for American Chinese food."}
{"text":"Food is salty as hell. 3 stars only because the owner there is chill as hell. Food definitely went downhill. It's still cheap fast food if you really like salt."}
{"text":"Cravings? More like CRAMPINGS! Seriously, my stomach has never felt so cramped and twisted as it was after I ate here for dinner.   I ordered the fried fish with masala; it was very oily rather than crispy and the spice rub was overwhelmingly dense, and made up of SO much MSG that my head was throbbing after only eating about half of the plate. It must have been a seriously high concentration because I've never had this bad of a reaction to MSG in food before. I was feeling so sick that I threw the rest of the food away and went home. I woke up later in the middle of the night with intense head pain and stomach pain, got about 3 hours of sleep.  If you value your stomach, and mental health please don't go here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place it has good food, nice owners who want you to change your order up every so often and good prices. I had jakarta fried rice and meat with cilantro both were good. Although I would recommend not getting the sesame chicken its a bit too sweet but other than that I think they have the best chinese food here."}
{"text":"The reviews looked good, and a Chinese friend of mine recommended it, so I tried it. I went in during the lunch hour, and it was jammed, mostly with Asian students and staff. The owner was very friendly, and even with a packed house he offered me complimentary Chinese or chrysanthemum tea. My test of a good Chinese restaurant is to first order some Americanized dish, and if they make that well, then the authentic dishes have to be good. I ordered sesame chicken to go. The aroma driving back to the office told me something good was in the styrofoam container. I opened it, and there was the delicious smell of toasted sesame. The flavor was quite nice, but the dish was ruined by too heavy a coating of cornstarch and overcooking.Most of the pieces were very dry and hard to chew. I'll go there again, but next time it will be noodle soup or fried tofu."}
{"text":"Cravings is one of those restaurants that you would just find reasons to go back to. This place is really for what it offers inexpensive. There is no real service, and I don't seem to mind that one little bit. You order at the counter, and for your order you are given a card with a number on it. And a few minutes later, your food/number is called out which you can take back from the counter to your table. Oh yeah, you are expected to bus your own plates once you are done eating.   Now the food: they have a wide range of Chinese and adapted Chinese cuisines from Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Their menu is super long but surprisingly this doesn't seem to effect the consistency of the food made. Unfortunately, my food recommendations might not work for you as I am vegetarian. But anyway, Green bean or vegetables stir fry in Hunan sauce seem to my usual picks. Jakarta fried rice with tofu is also something that I really like. They have some soup and Chinese tea for free, which you can ask the owner about.   The owner is real friendly and always indulges in the occasional chat if he happens to be unoccupied. I did take a star out though, because sometimes the tables are left dirty. Because of the absence or regular cleaning staff, the tables are left dirty sometimes by inconsiderate customers. Be warned, the tables are packed if you go during the rush hours.   All in all, you have to love cravings!"}
{"text":"Some of the best take out Chinese food on campus with the best prices. Their hot and spicy soup is my fave and they have amazing tea. I usually get fried rice, but their entree's are really good and filling. There's usually enough food for multiple meals! Take out has a really fast turnaround time and the staff is always nice.   There are enough seats to sit and enjoy a very casual dining experience, but you order from a counter and they call your number when the food is ready. They have both an english and chinese menu."}
{"text":"I do not recommend going to Cravings. I went there last weekend and ended up going to the ER for food poisoning. I ate the orange chicken which came out surprisingly fast. It was also not even crisp and tasted undercooked. Also, I found out after that this place is known for shutting down a lot."}
{"text":"I had the so called famous Jakarta Rice, but it was not very satisfying.  However, for the price, the food is decent and the serving size is pretty big."}
{"text":"Cravings is hands down the best Chinese food in town. I have been going here since I was very young and have continued to frequent Craving exclusively to this day. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. The brightest spot of this establishment has to be the staff and ownership. They are always exceedingly friendly. It almost seems like you're part of the family when you come in. There's free tea and water to drink while you wait for your food which is also awesome. While the building is big with lots of seating, due to the popularity it can get crowded, especially after classes get out in the evening. All in all if you are looking for a \"go to\" Chinese restaurant, look no further than Cravings."}
{"text":"Tried the shawarma based on recommendation from others and I'm sorry to say I couldn't enjoy it. With only 3 places to buy food on campus, they will continue to thrive, but I won't contribute."}
{"text":"Generous portions and cheap price. A college student's dream. I got the chicken with vegetables for a lunch one day. They give a wide array of vegetables and the sauce was good but the chicken was okay. They give you soup along your lunch so that was nice (though I didn't really like the soup). The dish was yummy but I'm sure the other choices are a lot better. Such big portions so this could also be split between two people or saved for later.  Decent food but I do prefer Golden Harbor."}
{"text":"Cravings is one of the best cheap authentic Chinese restaurant on campus.  Their location, price, and portions are unbeatable in all of CU.  My favorite dishes are:  -Pork belly with preserved veggie -Fish with Shanghainese bokchoy -Fish Marsala -Mapo Tofu -Jakarta fried rice -Chicken and veggie (or chicken lo mein) -Crispy chicken/beef  The one thing I don't like is the smell inside so I usually get take out and it's always crowded so it's good to call ahead and pay with cash when you get there for that discount. However, make sure you pay the meter because I went in to pick up take out and when I got out there was a ticket :(  The only other comparable place is Golden Wok but it's a bit far on University so you'll need a car to get there (they have free parking)"}
{"text":"Last Sunday evening at around 5:30pm, my wife and I went to this restaurant. There were still a lot of customers there, then we had to wait in line. Most of the customers are UIUC students, but not necessary Chinese students. There are quite a few other Asian students, like Indian. And also  American students. This kind of remind me of my school time... The food taste very good, while a little expensive though.   There are also free hot water or tea provided."}
{"text":"Honestly the best Chinese food restaurant I could ask for - cheap and big portion of food there.  Do try for their three cups chicken.  Not a good place for dating or celebrating but yeah...let's face it. We are students and need affordable food."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes.  We went here on a whim after freezing our butts off at an Illini game and it hit the spot. It had every kind of Asian dish on the menu, and while I'm usually weary of places that have more than one kind of cuisine offered, this one delivered.  I ordered the sweet and spicy udon soup with chicken and it was amaaazing! My boyfriend also really loved his beef curry. The portions were also huge and everything was really cheap. I don't know how I've been a townie and not known about this place. Gem!"}
{"text":"When I brought my sesame chicken in to the lab today, it was met with a chorus of \"where did you get that,\" and \"oh, yeah, love cravings!\"    It's that rare kind of place that has both nasty, american, super fried chinese food, and real, actually eaten by some asian people somewhere in asia food.  And it's dead cheap!"}
{"text":"Cravings, the Worshipped God of the North Quad.   Similar to Maize, I think it's been overhyped. The menu has a wide selection of similar dishes that are cooked in an Americanized style with few varied sauces & spices. The amount of times this place has been shut down due to health violations is insane. Large portions, but at what cost?"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I try to call them and they just hang up on me. They are so pride and do not think the best for their customers. I do not want to judge the food there but service is really the reason I choose a restaurant instead of home cooking. Therefore, I will not go there again."}
