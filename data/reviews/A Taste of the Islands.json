{"text":"Just eating the White Jerk Chicken!!!  Fall off the bone, great taste!
The gentleman was very friendly, and when I asked how long for take out he said about 10min, and it was no longer than that.
Place was very clean, will bring the family back, ans they will do non spicy also.
Please try it!  Support the local small businesses!"}
{"text":"The address on yelp is wrong. This place is located on Bayview next to Pho Fusion. I had the goat roti and it was pretty darn good. The decor and seating are better than most restaurants of this type.  I will return to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Waited forever for my jerk chicken dinner- very little flavour, told I couldn't eat in bc they put it in a take out container even though I tipped as if eating in.  Definitely not worth the wait and then I finally leave to find somewhere to eat- great customer service, open up my take out bag and not napkin or utensils- WTH?  Also no plantain or oxtail and it was at the early dinner hour so ya-"}
{"text":"My top Jerk spot in Newmarket! Chicken is so juicy and flavourful! 

Spice is on point! 

I recommend calling ahead of you're getting take out.. 

Ox tail is also delicious. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just took out a chicken roti. First visit here. 
There are a thousand places to get roti in the gta. 
  Many are good. I have tried a lot of them.  
  This guy is good! Very good. 
 Good heat and good portion."}
{"text":"Amazing culinary experience! Barring the slow service ( that is because they have big takeout service) the goat roti was heavenly.. Liked the pepper shrimp app as well. Finally, as always, the island sodas"}
{"text":"I hit up this place for lunch alot of the time... anything \"jerk\" here is amazing but I definately favor the Jerk Pork, if you get a large... good luck finishing it... just mix it up into the rice and beans and enjoy! This is my go to spot for this type of food in Newmarket, got some others to try but this is yet to be beat no doubt about it!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! Love their jerk pork, it basically melts in your mouth. And the roti is jam packed with deliciousness. You can probably make 2 meals out of one Roti if you don't have a huge appetite. 
It can get very busy at lunch time, and service can be a tad slow so plan accordingly. But the staff are super nice and in my opinion good things take time."}
{"text":"This place is great, Ive always liked it. It is true that you need to call ahead for pickup as it does take a little bit to get your food. However, that is not really a bad thing. Just call ahead and you are good.

Ive had the jerk chicken, curry, curry roti, and jerk pork. All are damn good. I suggest getting the jerk chicken with the jerk pork gravy. I dont know if it matters but its damn good ;)"}
{"text":"I love Jamaican food, and what's not to love about this place!

Excellent food, a good selection of food and island drinks.

It's been a while since I've been.  My diet changed years ago, and I could no longer eat many of the foods that I grew up with and loved.

I ordered the curried goat and the salad.  I have to eat gluten free, so these are the things that I know are safe to eat here.

I can usually tell how much I will love the goat by how many potatoes are in the bowl.  There wasn't one.  Just all tender moist morsels of goat hanging off of the bone with some nice black pepper corns scattered about!  I'm in heaven!

I was spoiled by many years of great Jamaican cooking over the years.  This food ranks up there with me.  

A beautiful salad was served with the goat that was excellent.  I've had the rice and peas years ago and they were fine too!

All of the while mellowing to the tunes of the great Bob Marley.

Food so good I had to clean the bones twice.  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Mmm, their patties are just so good. I haven't tried anything else yet but the service is always friendly and the patties are always fresh!"}
{"text":"Family owned small restaurant. Price is fair and very friendly. So yummmy real Jamaican food and music! I will be craving for curry chicken roti again!"}
{"text":"I'm all about supporting local businesses so I ventured into A taste of the islands.  This is a nice cozy spot filled with regular dine in and take out patrons on a Friday lunch.  

I should of read the reviews on here and call ahead for take outs as I did end up waiting for about 10mins for my quarter jerk chicken take out.  I guess the chef is working on island time.  While I was waiting, I noticed a very friendly young male server or perhaps the owner was addressing some of the customers by their first name and thanking them for coming back.  While he was preparing my take out, I asked him how many years have they been in business and to my surprise, 8 years!  It's great to hear small business successes stories.  It must of been a combination of friendly service and the great tasting food to get customers coming back for more.  Oh and my quarter jerk chicken was delicious, perfect when pair with the creamy coleslaw on the side."}
{"text":"Restaurant opens at 11am, arrived at 11:07am. I wrongly assumed because its right after opening they would be ready to go w fresh food waiting for you. Nope
I walked in there was a male mopping the floor and of course I am patient so I waited at the front for him. After about 7mins or so he finally addresses me and says whenever I'm ready. Buddy you should have said that the minute I walked in. So I place my order, a large jerk w a chicken soup. The dry eraser board said it was the soup of the day and since it was opening i wanted to confirm, his response \" ya i guess so\" hmm fine
He finally puts my order through, extremely over priced might I add but then again its Newmarket so Caribbean food is scarce here. I was just visiting a friend at the hospital and yelped for a good place to eat and this was the top rated.
Anywho, I should have read all the reviews in full as someone mentioned to call ahead to place your order. I waited almost 30 minutes for my food, which I absolutely don't understand.
If they weren't finish cooking they should have mentioned it would be a wait, because 20 minutes when I'm the first customer of the day is ridiculous. After waiting 15 minutes I tried calling out to let them know I was in a bit of a rush so if its going to take much longer I rather just go. They just ignored me and continued talking amoungst themselves in the back and I called out 3 times. The female cook finally popped her head up and said he was coming. ugh never again. If the food is made to order I'd understand but that is absolutely not the case here.  The soup was meh barely any meat, lots of veggies and oily salt water. The jerk chicken was cooked very well , juicy/tender on the inside. Not spicy at all though.

Wont be back since I dont live here anyways"}
{"text":"So a co-worker and I happened to be in this area and stumbled upon this place. Once we walked in the door we could smell wonderful aromas coming from the kitchen. We were  greeted by a very pleasant young man and given the menu. I ordered jerk pork which came with rice and peas/beans plus a nice serving of coleslaw. My friend ordered the curry chicken. Once the food came to the table we took our first bite of one of the best Jamaican food I have ever had in awhile. As I savored every bite knowing this portion was too big for me I took my time to make sure I ate every single bite. The pork was so tender and my friend loved her curry chicken. I was stuffed but I was unable to stop eating. Absolutely delightful!

The d√©cor was very pleasant. The fellow that served our table/every table was so dang cheerful and pleasant. In between serving and answering the phone coupled with prepping take out orders he was bouncing around and singing to the music. 
I loved my experience here as did my friend.

I will be back. LOVED this place."}
