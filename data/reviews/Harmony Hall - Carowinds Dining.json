{"text":"Harmony Hall is the best place to eat during your visit to Carowinds. You'll be delightfully surprised by the quality of food. It isn't your average theme park food, that's for sure.   I'd highly recommend any of the BBQ items. They smoke everything in house and it's pretty great.   Prices are in line with any entertainment venue. If you're looking to save money on any food during your visit, consider getting one of Carowinds' meal deals. It can save you big if you plan on visiting and/or eating more than once."}
{"text":"I must say we were truly excited about dining here after hearing extraordinary recommendations from the site chef. We were sadly disappointed. It is a cafe style line (which did move rather quickly (a plus = half of a star) and there quite a few options to choose from (a plus = half star). My kids had the pizza which was hot and they seemed to like it (= one star).  So all of the other food was cold. The brisket was fatty and tasteless. The noodles and cheese were tasteless. The baked beans had good flavor but the red beans (kidney - maybe) needed to be cooked a lot longer. Drinks are not included of course - but for this quality and price they need to be.   I love the changes they have made to the park. It has been over 8 years since I visited. But this food was awful and not worth the price at all. I recommend to fill up on funnel cake and avoid this cold tasteless food."}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to eat at Carowinds. It's also a better value if you have the dining plan because there is a lot to choose from. My daughter loved the pizza and breadstick. I was expecting the Mac & cheese to be standard cheap Mac like Kraft but it wasn't. I was pleasantly surprised. It tasted homemade and the noodles were large. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was my husband's turkey leg. It was soggy from sitting in juice and it wasn't hot. My husband also said he thought it might be undercooked. Other than that, we had a pleasant experience. I really like the large tables. They have it really cool in there but it feels so nice after being in the heat. The rocking chairs and mini tables on the front porch are a nice touch. Another great thing about Harmony hall is it is one of the few places that have the Coca Cola self serve drink stations to fill-up your souvenir mug. The self serve station has tons more choices than the other stations.  I recommend the Dasani orange.  Overall, Harmony Hall is a great choice when dining at Carowinds."}
{"text":"Other than the cost this is the best dining inside Carowinds there is plenty of room for seating and it's cool for comfort and depending on the time you can catch live show while you cool down and eat."}
{"text":"Ok, my rating takes into consideration that this is theme park food, but for theme park food, this is the best place to eat in carowinds. I forgot to take a pic, but very generous portions, food looks like in the picks and many healthy options. Nice big well air conditioned hall and live music occasionally along with cooking demos. We're on the meal plan and this is the best spot with so many options from pasta, pizza, chicken quesadilla, ribs, pulled pork, fresh made salads to order and sandwiches."}
{"text":"If looking for a place with options and air conditioning - this is your place.   This is more of a food court - so the food quality can very greatly from station to station.   The salad station is very good.  The burger place is good and would be great if you could substitute side salad for the fries.  The pizza / pasta options are very well liked.  Caution - The smoked turkey legs are typically water logged and the smoked wings are very salty.   Summary - good atmosphere and some good choices - but choose wisely. They are so close to having a great option hope they keep listening."}
{"text":"For a park, food is pretty good.  Large sitting area too. Love the vibe and overall good vibes you get from visitors/vacationers.  We had the footlong hotdog, burger cheese quesadillas,  and chicken tenders.  Several places to eat but this place offers a good variety compared to others on the property.   Give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"This food hall is massively huge and has a great variety of options for those who are seeking some much needed Sustenance on those crazy Carowinds days!  They had a few options but I just kinda went for the pizza pasta section as that's just what sounded good for what was good!  Their pasta wasn't bad it was alright but the breadstick definitely made it better when thrown more sauce around in it but what I definitely enjoyed here was their pizza as it was actually pretty good for park pizza as most of them just aren't that great!  You get a big slice of pie with a breadstick I was happy about it and enjoyed the slice even more so when I found I could get a cup of nacho cheese to add to my already cheesy pizza slice because why not!  What else was scrumptious was that marshmallow cereal square I had like oh it was full of sugar cinnamon to make it yummy tell the last bite before I decided to take on that slice of berry cheesecake that was just as good for sweet yummies!  Next time I come here I'll have to try a different section of the food hall but as it is the pizza is good and you can watch some live entertainment wile you eat so you really can't go wrong!  Don't forget to show your season pass for a discount off your purchase!  Overall this a good eatery inside Carowinds that has options for everyone as well as an abundance of Coke Freestyle machines!"}
