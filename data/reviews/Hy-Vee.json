{"text":"Worst service of my life. They also say that they are 24-hour but randomly shut down for 15 minutes multiple times a night to \"update\" their system and don't allow you to check out during this time. Prices are also really high. Don't go here."}
{"text":"This store is alright, there's nothing real special about it. It's usually clean on the inside but always busy. The kids that bag your groceries are pretty horrible, they should try teaching them some bagging tips before sending them out on the floor. The cashiers aren't great either and do not know how to enter coupons... Try going across the street to Target if you have any."}
{"text":"I love hyvee! Everyone who works there is super nice! The meat counter is OUTSTANDING! They have so many varieties of meats prepared in various ways which makes dinner easy. 

They also always have really good deals.

100 stars!"}
{"text":"Top notch experience at hyvee thanks to Cedric the cheese connoisseur! We've always loved hyvee, appreciating the good selection of items as well as the awesome salad bar and bakery. Cedric took things to another level as we were choosing cheeses for a party. He took the time to give us multiple samples and recommendations, exactly the friendly, personal touch you'd expect from a hometown shop."}
{"text":"One word - brunch! $15 per person (check your mail for a bogo coupon if you live in the area). The restaurant area is separated from the grocery side and is very nice and clean. Lots of tables/booths. On a typical brunch day (not Easter), they have:

- Standard breakfast items (scrambled eggs, bacon, French toast sticks, waffles, etc.) - if you like potatoes, you have to check out their hybrid mashed potato/hashbrown creation which is super delish!! It's my favorite of the breakfast items. Make sure you get them while they're hot. 
- Station for eggs benedict
- fruit area/small desserts (check out the mini eclairs - so good)
- The entire salad bar
- Asian food section (good, not great - save your appetite for other things)
- Italian food section
- Gelato (!!!!)
- Dessert area (!!!!!!!!!!). Full sized pie and cake slices. Save room for this or you will be disappointed. 

When I'm feeling extra fancy I will be springing for the unlimited mimosas - at $9, that's a good price."}
{"text":"Always clean there. Everyone is genuinely helpful. Good variety of quality foods and organized well."}
{"text":"Pretty nice new atmosphere. It seems larger than the Westgate one. Staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We love Hy-Vee! The Market Grille is a full restaurant with delicious food. Then there's the quicker pizza/Chinese/deli food too. Grocery shopping is easy and the food is great quality. (With the exception of strawberries...found mold in 2 of 2 containers recently purchased. Might be a seasonal thing.) The store feels \"fancy\" and there are so many choices. Cookies and beef sticks for kids, too. I haven't tried their \"Aisles\" program yet, but grocery delivery service to your home with small children sounds like a life saver. Lastly, the \"Fuel Saver\" program is the best! We just paid $0.40 for a full tank of gas since we racked up a bunch of fuel saver points. Not per gallon, $0.40 total! (Just make sure the items are on your shopping list to begin with to avoid buying a bunch of things you don't need just to get fuel saver points. It can be addicting.)"}
{"text":"I apologize that I do not know the lady's name, but she works at the register for to go food by the salad bar. She's always friendly and smiling and offering things I may have forgotten!  Thanks HyVee! I love shopping here!"}
{"text":"Returns can be a hassle! Attempted to make a return at the Fitchburg store and was told the pots and pans are not in the system, even though they're Hy-vee branded. Thus, I would have to return the pots to the Madison West store, where I bought them. This is a huge hassle and only foresee this issue being more pervasive for others with the holidays. 

Stores operate 'independently,' thus certain items are exclusive to that store, even though they're branded with the Hy-Vee logo."}
{"text":"Love the new Fitchburg Hy-Vee.  Clean and bright, very friendly and helpful staff.  They seem to have just about everything I need, no need to bounce around multiple grocery stores.  Cool racecar shopping carts for the kids,their fast-food Chinese is decent, take n bake pizzas are good, bakery made an awesome birthday cake for me, and butcher helped explained meat cuts to me for a Pinterest recipe.  I could go on and on!"}
{"text":"We had a disappointing experience with having our flowers done at Hy-Vee. We ordered our flowers in advance. I went in to the store to make a change to the order. Additionally, I called back when the floral manager was in to confirm the changes - he confirmed and recalculated the price for me. The final order had a bridal bouquet, 5 bridesmaids bouquets, 2 wrist corsages, 2 pinned on corsages, and 9 boutonnieres. The day of the wedding, my sister-in-law went to pick up the flowers and they had not been made. The person working floral did work very hard to get our order together in an hour and a half. I commend him for pulling it together. For the most part we were pleased with the flowers, although I can't say that there was that much difference between my $175 bridal bouquet and that of my still expensive bridesmaids bouquets. We were disappointed with the tiny wrist corsages for our mothers, they looked nice on my 5 year old nieces wrist but not on the wrist of a grown woman. But it's as expected when a $750 flower order is put together in an hour and a half. The floral manager followed up with me the next week inquiring about the bill and offering an excuse that my cancellation of part of the order messed things up.  He offered $250 off our order. We settled on 50% off the order which I am sure means that they still made money on the flowers. Not a bad price for wedding flowers, but not worth it with the stress it added to the day."}
{"text":"I called at 7:30 am for 3 cakes to be delivered around noon.  They called back to say they would deliver by 1:00 pm at the latest.  I called at 2:00 to see where my delivery was at and was told that I had called the wrong store and needed to call another store.  After calling all of those stores, I tried the Fitchburg store again and was told that they forgot to deliver the cakes and would have to wait for a driver to come back and pick them up and they would probably be delivered by 3:00.  By that time, it was too late and I had to cancel the order.  It would have been far better if the guy in catering (Erick) had just checked into it the first time I had called instead of just assuming I was calling the wrong store.  Frustrating experience that will make me re-think about doing business with Hy-Vee, which is disappointing, because I have always had good service at any of the other Hy-Vee locations, just not this one."}
{"text":"Quick and easy, but gets old fast.  Boxed sushi is on the pricey side.  Like the eating area in the corner of the store.  Tv is a nice amenity if eating alone on a lunch break."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Madison grocery scene. Love the selection of fruits, veggies,organics, and local products. Usually offers samples and features a fresh salsa and hummus bar. Not a bad option for dining - Chinese and salad bar are my top choices when eating at the store."}
{"text":"Love the staff and selection BUT whenever I visit on a weekday before 11am there is only one cashier working. I'm not going to wait. I spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We love Hy-Vee!  The employees are friendly and helpful.  Kids can get a free banana and a free cookie at the bakery.  They have a great selection of produce, an awesome salad bar and cheap ready to eat food.  I also love their meat counter and natural food section.  They have Organic Valley, Siggi's yogurt, Kalona milk and yogurt and Fage.  It's hard to find all of those it one store!  The only reason they don't get five stars, is because of the higher prices.  I could never do all of my shopping here."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they built this as it's so much closer to us during our cold harsh winter. The place is clean, neat and the employees are so helpful there. Sometimes I stop at their salad bar or the Chinese buffet to eat before I shop or take out when I'm on the way out the door. They are a bit more expensive than other stores but it's worth it and they always have weekly sales items. I think all their employees know me as I'm there all the time! Their cashiers are great too as they run up and are at the cashier if they see more than 2 people in line. I just hate standing in long lines! Definitely recommend this place to others. It's much bigger than the one on Whitney Way and offers so much more with high quality produce, meat, seafood, etcetera. With it being so cold this winter I think we were all hibernating in our houses with our fireplaces going. When I run out I'm always running into my friends and we are munching away on their samples while we catch up with each other."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure where to start.  Over the past several months we have watched Hy-Vee's overall service steadily decline in several areas, but this review is focused on their godawful catering service.

Here's the background.  We decided to have a wedding party at our house this Summer, since our wedding was a private one in the Keys.  We spent a lot of time scheduling and planning this party, and several of our family members flew across the country to attend.

I suppose I should have known better, but what can I say?  We decided to go with Hy-Vee's catering service as they had a nice-looking menu and brochure, and the store manager (Lucas Glasgow) assured us that Stephanie's catering department is second-to-none.

Here's how the catering process was communicated to us.  First, we were to choose from a basic menu (we chose barbecue), and then could add the sides that we wanted.  Having done that, we were informed that Stephanie would call us the week before to confirm the number of guests and if any particulars had changed.  Great.

Unfortunately, Stephanie never called us back!  Being very concerned, we visited the catering department to make sure our service was still scheduled.  The first time, we were simply told that Stephanie was out, and to try back the next day.  My wife did check back the next day:  Stephanie was gone on vacation, returning after our party.  Not that this is a problem; we certainly understand vacations and as long as a backup is in place, there's really no concern.

Upon our 3rd visit, we discovered there was really no backup.  This is now Friday, the day before our party!!!  My wife, being the wonderful and reliable person that she is, went to find someone in the market since the service desk was completely unhelpful.  And indeed she did find someone, who was preparing our barbecue.  That's right:  cooking the meat the night before.  Now, anyone who knows barbecue can tell you that's NOT a good sign.

The party comes.  All the guests are assembled and having a very good time.  Hy-Vee shows up, and sets up the barbecue and sides on our kitchen bar.  Upon opening up the meats, it's clear they are overcooked and dry.  Completely terrible; tough, dried out meats that are difficult to even chew through.  Our guests, being the kindhearted and gracious people that they are, never complained to us of course.  But we were mortified.  It seriously ruined our party for us -- the very special day that we painstakingly planned for months.  Afterwards, we received a $100 discount (after some haggling), but that's not the point is it?

Please.  If you are considering Hy-Vee's catering, I respectfully ask you to re-consider.  We don't want this to happen to anyone else.  I wouldn't have taken the time to write this unless I was completely devastated by something.  Maybe you will get lucky, I don't know.  But if you hire these people, you are playing with fire."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by our hotel shuttle driver.  I was a bit hesitant at the idea of eating at a grocery store but when we arrived to the restaurant I was immediately impressed by the look and feel of the restaurant.  The food was delicious and the had a great selection ranging from American, seafood, sushi,  to Asian options.  We went on a Wednesday and they had 1/2 price bottles of wine.  I truly enjoyed my meal and wine. Would definitely recommend trying this place.  The grocery store attached also has a great  selection of cheese and meats."}
{"text":"Went in for a plain cake that I could have them write \"good luck\" on for a co worker. All cakes had hearts on them for Mother's Day or graduation things on them. I asked if they could write that on the one plain cake I could find but they told me no one was there that could do that. (This was at 7pm on a Friday) So I looked for plain cupcakes but again, no options besides girly or graduation so, for a male co worker who just got promoted, there were no options.  Very disappointed in the bakery selection and variety."}
{"text":"Grocery store is always bright, staff are always available and knowledgable for the most part. 

We asked the dining area for ingredients cooked with baked chicken and the u didn't know.

The produce is in great shape. I have never once seen any food item rotting, like some of that grocery markets. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"I really like the brunch here, and we've been a couple times. 

The space is separated from the rest of the grocery store, so you feel like you're in a completely different restaurant.

The service is excellent and attentive, and they even take reservations.

Buffet is $14.95/person and includes not just the special buffet items, but also the salad bar and most of the hot deli items that make up the typical buffet.

There is a nice, build your own, Bloody Mary bar and there are mimosas with freshly squeezed orange juice. These are $5 each or $9 unlimited. Great prices!!

Omelette station is excellent with many ingredient choices to build your own, or you can have the station chef build you a suggested omelette.

Along with the typical eggs, bacon, sausage, etc, today there was an excellent Chef's Choice item, which was polenta with grilled vegetables and marinara sauce. They have an outstanding mac-n-cheese and several different ways they do potatoes. There's also a prime rib cutting station.

I especially like the steamed shrimp, crab cakes and blackened salmon station. Really good!!

Bottom line, the food is excellent and the price cannot be beat. They take reservations, which is a good idea, as it is quite busy."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Aisle Online service. I was sick and didn't have the energy to go to the grocery store so I shopped the aisles online and picked up my order the next day. The fee is low (under 5 dollars) and they bring your bagged groceries out to your car. The lady who helped me was so sweet. I will use this service again! 

3 stars for the Floral Department. I ordered flowers for a friend and they did not look anything like the picture. I did agree that they could use substitutes if they did not have exactly what I ordered but it was a very underwhelming bouquet. Next time I order flowers I will use the Hyvee on Whitney Way.

3 stars for the Market Grille. The food was ok but the service was unfriendly and very slow. I will not go back to this \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"May favorite place to grocery shop besides Trader Joe's hands down. Good prices, amazing variety, nice in house brands and value. Great health food section. Tons of deals going on all the time. Great recipe ideas every season as well. Amazing salad bar, huge section of deli, pastry, hot food entrees to go or dine in. All day meal specials from market grill section. Super pleasant staff work here all the time. Very helpful people always willing to help you out. Feel very welcome here everyone I come home and swing by. Oh and do not miss their half price Wednesday sushi deal! It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"HyVee Market Grille!! Sushi & Cheesecake!! Yes, it was soooo good! We've been here before, forgot we liked it. Tried it again tonight & are making plans for our next meal here. Quite a variety on this menu, stylish decor, TVs with World Series on. Today is 1/2 off sushi, had to have it, yum! Check the photos, I posted the weekly specials. Don't be surprised to find us here on Wednesdays"}
{"text":"We have been to the Hy-Vee market Grill 10 or more times. It is very causal, kid friend and had decent food. One thing to note is that they are consistently slow. Plan to be in no hurry when you go. This can make it hard with a little kid. The brunch buffet is good and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"This place was really great.  Fancy, too!  I was without a car and needed to find a place that serves dinner late in walking distance from my hotel.

They close at ten and I rolled in at 940 on a Monday during Monday night football.  I felt bad coming into close to closing time, but the manager and bartenders were awesome and so warm and friendly.  They really made me feel valued and I had a wonderful experience.

I ordered sea bass with grilled veggies (around $19) and a local hard cider draft ($2, so cheap!).  The food was delicious and could easily compete with fancy pants restaurants that do not happen to be in grocery stores. 

The place is really big with tons of tvs.  The bar is really pretty and has marble countertops.  Pleasant atmosphere overall, good food for reasonable prices, and amazing staff!  There were 4 of us sitting at the bar, not in a rush to go anywhere.  I think this place could easily stay open later in this area and stay busy if they wanted.  If I lived in this city, i would see it as an opportunity to multi-task by eating dinner and then grabbing groceries at the same time.  :-)"}
{"text":"Love all the buffet options. Healthy to sinful. Seniors to kids. All leave happy and affordable."}
{"text":"Always get my groceries from here. Great prices and large selection! The Market Grille is a great stop for dinner before or after shopping. Lots of menu items and specials."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is always delicious and the service is always friendly. 

The price for the meals is fantastic. Brunch: $15 for buffet. $9 unlimited mimosa. 

The whole experience is fantastic. After 8pm, 1/2 off appetizers and tap beers. Please and thank you.

Need to eat and do a quick grocery stop?  Easy!"}
{"text":"I love me some Hyvee! They've got great tasting, and very reasonably priced, Chinese takeout in the store. They also have awesome pizza for takeout. They stock stuff that super target doesn't. Some stuff is priced right, some is overpriced. It's a decent mix that makes grocery shopping there worth while."}
{"text":"Good prices, friendly staff and good choices. Ready-made food is great for dinner. The dietician is nice to see. Customer service desk needs to be better staffed. Overall, a nice grocery store with above average extras."}
{"text":"Was is in town for a visit and stopped by for some to go food.   I was pleasantly surprised by the lady standing behind the counter making fresh sushi to go.  The taste was really good and would compared to some of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in LA.   The store had other items and other menu times that you could get to go or eat there."}
{"text":"Great place to shop.  They have special ordered meat for me as well as processed cuts for different types of meals I have made.  The meat counter folks are very knowledgeable and I do not find it considerably more expensive than any other grocery in town.  Good selection, limited in some areas but generally has everything I need."}
{"text":"The bar is amazing!!!!  Happy hour has draft beer discounts and half price appetizers. The bartenders are friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is relaxing and a great place to hang out with friends. And if you're hungry for a full meal, they have a thorough menu that I've always found something tasty to satisfy.

Been to the brunch once... make sure to call ahead for a reservation. The food was ok, nothing special, but the selection was incredible. You have access to a ton of normal breakfast hot buffet items, but also the whole normal hot food line in the store. If you like buffets with options, you definitely want to try this one out!"}
{"text":"Very clean, new, awesome place to shop.

Prices are a bit higher than Copps down the street, but I trust the meat and produce from Hy-Vee way more."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for more from a grocery store. Great selection, especially in the fresh meat and seafood sections. Store is incredibly clean and well kept, and the staff is much more friendly than your average grocery store staff."}
{"text":"Went for the brunch buffet on Sunday. Won't be back anytime soon.

Waited about an hour for a table of five, and constantly had to remind the staff that we were waiting, despite having a buzzer. The service was poor - after being seated, had to flag multiple people down to get silverware and drinks. Buffet style, but nothing really stood out. Bacon was cooked well and it was nice you could sample anything out in the store food area.

If you want brunch, head for The Great Dane at Hilldale or even Granite City at West Towne Mall.

:::::Update To Three Stars:::::

I went to the happy hour with some friends and had a much better experience. The waiter was great and kept my Diet Coke all night. The half-priced shrimp thing I had was good (although I think a bit overpriced if at full price). I'd head back again for happy hour, but probably will find other places for brunch buffet."}
{"text":"Never thought I would be reviewing a grocery store but Hy Vee warrants it.  Close to my home it is not only convenient but a pleasure to shop there.  Their staff are friendly and quick to provide assistance.  Produce is well maintained and fresh.  For a large store, I feel not only their bakery is solid but their seafood/meat counter is some of the best in the city.  Clean, bright, always well stocked.  What more can you want?"}
{"text":"This grocery store has almost everything you can imagine. Their pulled pork in the meat section is outstanding.  Prices are on the higher side for most items but you can find some deals. The Hy-Vee grille restaurant is also good. We went to their Sunday brunch buffet last week and it was fabulous.  There are so many options everyone gets what they want. Loved the salad bar and fresh coffee. The service was also great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food. I also like that they list calories. We've been a few times because the food is consistently good. However, the service is just so-so. We've never been when it was busy but getting our drinks and food takes quite a long time."}
{"text":"Bakery! The crusty breads like baguettes and round sourdough loaves are some of the best in the Madison area. Other stuff like pastries and sliced breads are just ok. 

Cheese counter! It's big, pretty, and used to have a great selection of cheese. Now, closer inspection will reveal that it's many different brands of a few cheese types, none of which are local. Cheese lovers should go to Whole Foods, where the cheese counter is half the size but double the selection.

Produce! Hyvee is the least likely grocer to force you to buy organic. Almost all produce is present as both conventional and organic. Produce quality is average.

International foods! The selection is steadily getting better, but it can be outrageously overpriced. They have fresh lemongrass! How many grocers have got that!? Actually, A-Mart on Odana does at 1/8th of Hyvee's price.

Service! Hyvee wants to be The Friendly Store. They coach their staff to greet and assist every customer. Well, Hyvee is very heavily staffed, and if you have a lot of shopping to do, you can be approached a good 20-30 times. The hurricane of insincere chit-chat becomes downright harassment after a while, and they can get pissy with you if you don't answer. I have been known to do evasive maneuvers so I don't have to talk to the son of a bitch! I suggest that Hyvee puts a basket of \"leave me alone\" flags by the entrance that customers can pick up and carry around. There are a few employees who are genuinely very friendly, and encounters with them are much different, and pretty pleasant.

Why three stars when I've been so critical? They now have the best selection and prices in Fitchburg, as Pick N' Save have been going steadily downhill since they quit being Copps. I loved Copps. R.I.P.

Advanced Tip! Lots of people know that you can buy liquor in the normal part of the store, but regular cashiers can be terrible at getting the security tags off. Well, if you go to the bottle that you want, squat down and look way in the back of the inventory, and you can often find some with no tag."}
{"text":"We've been to HyVee Market Grille several times at this point, mostly for brunch but a couple times for dinner as well.

The food, the service, and everything else overall is pretty average -- nothing really stands out as amazing or horrible. For brunch, you can order off the menu, but they also have a buffet option, too. The buffet food is, in my opinion, noticeably worse than ordering off the menu but I think that's to be expected.

I do appreciate the convenience of being able to get groceries afterwards, the reasonable amount of variety, and that the menu has some nutritional information for some of the items though."}
{"text":"HyVee is not an inexpensive grocery store. HOWEVER. there are certain things I will reliably purchase there simply for their quality or availability (and sometimes, they :are: actually the cheapest in the area.)

I have a lot of dietary restrictions to shop for in my household: we are gluten-free, mostly dairy and soy-free, and also eat very little processed food. 

Processed, wheaty products are cheap, and their allergen-free alternatives can be expensive (242% more, according to recent studies.)

At HyVee, I primarily purchase from the produce section (quality and availability,) meat counter (quality and price when on sale,) and their wellness/allergen-friendly section (selection and price with wellness discount.) The key for the first and last (especially if you prefer organic produce) is to go on a Wednesday, when all items in the wellness and organic produce departments are 15% off.

This, in addition to my regular coupons, often makes purchasing these items at HyVee cheaper than going to Woodmans (whose produce can be questionable,)  and FAR more convenient as well. 

(Staples like eggs, cereal, and canned goods, etc, are still cheaper at Target/Woodmans, though.)

Their wellness department staff at HyVee has also been very receptive to hearing about items customers would like to see carried, and I often see them on the shelves in under a month. 

The only major drawback I see for HyVee is its overall pricing being more expensive than your average grocery store - they do an excellent job of marketing food like most industries market clothes or other products, which costs money, and that trickles down to the consumer. It's incredibly effective though - if you can afford it."}
{"text":"Decent prices. Friendly staff.  My only complaint is the Bakery Department, I wish I could use them every week for my bread. But every time I ordered a loaf of organic bread, then picked it up....they were all very confused. Other times the order was never made. Other than that, they have lots to choose from and check out is usually quick."}
{"text":"I love Hy-Vee, especially the Fitchburg location. Their prices are not the lowest, but you can find great deals if you pay attention. The meat department has fantastic deals and the staff is super friendly. They are usually very well staffed and the staff is very willing to help. Store highlights: the natural foods department, salad bar, and meat department."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the Chinese take-out special that they had. A complete meal for 4 for $20. The food was pretty fresh and there were options for meat and non-meat eaters. The noodles and the fried rice were pretty tasty too. The egg rolls were a little soggy from the fryer and the crab rangoon did not have a lot of filling. It was mostly crunchy wanton.  I like that they have places for customers to sit and eat their food if they need to, but also the option of taking it to go if that works better. Their restaurant has standard fare of food and drinks (liquor and beer  too) and tvs to watch. While the prices of ready made food may be cheaper, the aisle prices for groceries is pretty high. They have a discount program for gas. I have found that the gas discount is not that great. I don't need 20 gallons to fill up my car, so I can't maximize that discount as some others can. They seem to raise the prices of those items, in lieu of the 'deal'. They seem to have a smaller selection of items. Seems that there are only the top sellers in the different categories. Sometimes your taste buds are looking for something more obscure than blueberry yogurt. I understand that the blueberry yogurt is a bigger seller, but I may want to try something a bit different than the norm."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to buy fruits for my daughter because she just came out of the hospital she asked me for a gelato I didn't even get to the cash register when it was already melted with no top and the worst is that I bought mangos when I go to cut it at home it was rotten inside also some bugs  i threw it away saying it just was a bad one I cut another one and the same thing rotten black. At this point I threw 2 away I decided to call the store asked for the general manager but they weren't there so I spoke with someone else, I explained the problem and wanted my money back on my card she said I have to go to the store with the receipt and she said she would give me fresh produce and I say who's going to pay for my time and gas she said the only thing they can do is give u fresh produce with receipt. I did end up going and was returned my $3.96. And that's all. It was very bad customer service like they didn't care i can't believe such big store having old  rotten fruit when I go for fresh stuff. Won't be returning again"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Hyvee restaurant in Fitchburg twice. Both times we have had absolutely exceptional service and the food rivals any sit down restaurant we have been to!  We have been greatly impressed by the manager's obvious training of the young staff. These young people have great work ethic. We have had burgers which were very good. We have also had a steak dinner and a chicken dish (I can't remember the name. It had chicken with prosciutto and cheese with sautéed spinach and tomato) which were delicious.  The hot honey rolls they serve while you wait are unbelievably good AND they sell them at the adjoined Hyvee. The pepperoni pinwheel appetizer was HUGE!  Yum!  The great thing is when you are done, you can go grocery shopping!  We went to the Hyvee restaurant on Whitney Way and it sucked. Obviously a completely different management style. I highly recommend this place. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"We initially went to the Hyvee on Whitney way to order our sons birthday cake but they denied it due to graduations and weddings order. It's okay because Hyvee at Fitchburg took our order. This is our second year getting a cake from Hyvee and I must say it met or expectation. The kids loved it! One thing I wish was that the cake was a little bigger! That's all!"}
{"text":"3 of us came to watch the Packer game. Some things I seen I didn't like we're:

1) our server had the guest check book tucked inside the back of her pants. I certainly don't want anything from anyone who had anything tucked down their pants. I talked to the manager on duty and expressed my concern. I, too, am a server and know better.. 
2) Our server later had a towel over her shoulder, walking around...this too is a health issue. 
3) I didn't see any proper hand washing being practiced.
4) Our food (2 orders of unlimited wings and a scramble) took quite awhile to get delivered to us. We would've initially done the Sunday Brunch if we knew we'd have to wait the way we had to. I would've gladly paid the extra $6 if it meant to get food faster. 
5) A gentleman came in for lunch, also had wings, and had his food faster than us and we arrived minimum 15-20 mins prior than him. 

I am unsure if our server or management are aware of the health violations.. I'm hesitant on eating here again."}
{"text":"We come here for the Sunday brunch and it's a great price for all of the things you get to have. 

You have access to the breakfast items they have in the restaurant proper, the salad bar, Chinese bar, pizza bar, and gelato. They also have a station for omelettes, eggs Benedict, and prime rib. 

They offer bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's for (we think) $9. 

The rub for me is the dessert bar. Nothing is labeled and the people who work here never have an idea of what it is and what's in it. So, for a person with an allergy, it's kind of a roulette wheel. We come maybe once every other month, and I bring it up each time that they really need to label the food. I haven't won yet, but I'm going to continue nagging."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that a restaurant within a grocery store would be this good. 

Its proximity to the Fitchburg AMC has helped to make this our go-to for premovie dining. They also have great specials for football games and so for non-night games (because they unfortunately close at 10pm) we've also been staying there for the games.

I've been there about 9 or 10 times and rarely get the same thing every time but their food has been consistently excellent.

What really knocked it out of the park for me was their brunch.

They have a wide array of standard brunch fare, they carve prime rib, make omelettes to order, and if that isn't enough you can order items from their kitchen and their sushi / Asian food section. 

My wife was absolutely crazy about unlimited mimosas for $9, as well.

The execution isn't flawless -- when you're making so many different things you're going to have a weak spot here or there (for example -- their chicken strips were very dry the last time I had them) but on the whole I've been very impressed with their consistency, quality, and their value."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I didn't know what to expect when we stopped to eat here. You can expect to have a well-prepared meal well worth the price of a good meal apparently cooked to order. We chose a half chicken with garlic herbs and a mango glaze. The soup was cheesy brocolli with ham. It was loaded with ham chunks. Our main course came on deceptively small plates filled with the chicken, asparagus spears, and potatoes. Neither of us could finish more than half the meal.

As we waited, various wait staff kept stopping by to see if we needed anything.

The atmosphere is nice with pleasant light jazz in the background. Yes, one can see the grocery store but we didn't find it obvious or distracting. All in all for a nicer meal, the price was well worth it. We will be back."}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have Hy-Vee in Fitchburg!  Before Hy-Vee, I would have to go to several different grocery or specialty stores to get all the items I needed.  Now, I only need to go one place.  Hy-Vee has everything, including specialty items that other stores generally lack. In addition to carrying specialty items, they have an impressive variety.  For example, at other grocery stores in Fitchburg, I have struggled to find coconut milk, and the stores that carry it have a limited selection and supply.  In contrast, Hy-Vee had a wide variety of brands and flavors of coconut milk to choose from! 

Another pleasant surprise was how quickly I was served.  At 5:30pm on a week night, I did not have to wait in line to get deli meat or to get fresh bread sliced at the bakery.  At other grocery stores, I typically wait at least 5 minutes to be served. When I was ready to check out my groceries, I did not have to wait in line at all!  

The staff was very helpful and friendly."}

I guess the thousands of people from Green, Iowa, Rock and Columbia counties are not welcome.  Indeed the best view of Madison and Dane county is in your rear view mirror."}
