{"text":"Lil bar on the corner! Cheap drinks & good bar tenders!!! Had the cheese wedges and they were very, very , very GOOD !!!  Smaller bar, but worth stopping in !"}
{"text":"This used to be my happy hour bar when I lived in the Westpark neighborhood.  The food was surprisingly good, and the drinks could be had on the cheap, too.

The crowd is decidely blue-collar, and it's not uncommon for a fight to break out amongst themselves about who has a bigger pickem' up truck.

It's on the smaller side with maybe about 15 seats at the bar and about 5 tables.

The parking lot can be an issue since it's tiny, and there's always a few F-250 trucks taking up valuable real estate.  Be careful not to park at the other businesses as they will tow you faster then you can order a Jagerbomb."}
{"text":"It's one of those really great \"local\" dive bars with good bar food. Emphasis on the local because it seemed like everyone in the place knew everyone else by name. 

Food was greasy but tasty. And, be careful where you park. Parking at the cell phone store next door before 9pm will get your car towed."}
{"text":"It seemed like a nice place...bar maid was incredibly nice. Guy with white hair in the back watching me like a hawk..don't mind..get ready to leave and him and a couple buds wait in the parking lot....parked there plow truck behind mine as they wait in a car to see what I will do....Weeelll they left me some room....snow doesn't stop me....be careful they are trying to set people up...despite their efforts I escaped.....I'm not sure what is going on but BEWARE if your not one of them"}
