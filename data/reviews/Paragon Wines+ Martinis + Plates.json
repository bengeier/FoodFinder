{"text":"We decided to try Paragon after seeing it reviewed in the News-Herald. I was concerned about mixed reviews on this site. Loved the ambiance. Beer selection was adequate. We started with a tomato, mozzarella flatbread...looked great, but needed some garlic, pretty bland. I had to salt it and I rarely use salt. Hamburger was excellent. Grilled cheese, not so much....was a little charred and not too flavorful. Server was good."}
{"text":"I'm a new resident of Euclid & my husband & I were looking for a nice restaurant. We stumbled upon the Paragon, which was nice, great atmosphere.  We ordered the meatloaf entr√©e & when we received it noticed it had pork around the rim.  Nowhere on the menu does it states that there is pork served with the meatloaf. Neither of us eat pork for religious & health reasons.  My husband asked to speak with the chef & his response was meatloaf is a General Term, & next time we should ask if there's pork in it. REALLY!! He did take meatloaf off the order & my husband ordered the chicken instead.  The chef did agree to a free dessert, but was a little hesitate with that too. Unbelievable!  So for those, who do not eat pork Beware. Minus the pork experience, the chicken was Great & the apple strudel was to die for."}
{"text":"For a local neighborhood bar and restaurant, this place is fantastic!  Food - They occasionally change their menu to suit the seasons.  They use excellent quality ingredients. Salads, burgers and their specials are awesome.  Lots of homemade delights.  Service - Very good.  Music - They usually don't have live music, but there are good backgroud tunes.  Ambiance - Quite warm and welcoming.  They also have a fantastic outdoor patio.  Great summer dining!"}
{"text":"Busy Monday night hamburger special is quite a bargain at five per plate , including fries and condiments station. Not so last night.  Service was unbelievably inept. Waited fifteen minutes for beverages , and then totally ignored after burger arrived , until had to get up and engage another server or we would have had no beverage to go with food.  Fact is that it was not busy when we arrived , and remained slow until we left. Our food arrived cold , cold fries , really!! And the server stood across the room chatting with a ticket while we waited and waited for our beverage refills. She finally arrived well after we had received the beverages from the other server.  Three stars generous for this visit. Previous visits much better service and hot food. Still left generous tip . Hope the service improves , and the food isservedhot on next visit?"}
{"text":"Just left after eating on the patio.  What a great find.  Inventive menu with something for everyone.  Reasonably priced and our waitress had a total command of the beer offerings.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have had several nights out here. Their patio is relaxed and cool in the summer months. Weekly dinner specials are always cooked and served with care. Bartenders great at suggesting apps and wine selection pairing"}
{"text":"Ahhh time of the year to enjoy the outdoor patio. Love this place!  Best burgers in town, and great Monday special. Gloria is just the best.  Great waitress, bartender, promoter of EUCLID. Love that the owner's added THE STANDARD to the mix. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Best in Euclid.  Great outdoor seating and dining.  Great beer and wine selection.  Great staff.  We eat here often. The food is great.   We love the people and you will too."}
{"text":"This saturday I had a little lunchy  at beachclub bistro with the man, then furniture shopping with my buddy, then well why not a 2pm after shopping cocktail? Where better than paragon if you want a little wine or what have you....  Still a comforting place, refreshing to Euclid.... everyone is always really really friendly, and THANK YOU for keeping the prices real. Especially on the wine list. A bottle of \"J\" sparkly  is not going to break the bank at $23 a bottle. Very very fair, thanks again. We apparently had several :)  So thanks for another good time!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it is a great little spot.  My wife is a vegetarian and I am a meat-atarian so finding places that we can both enjoy is not always easy.  But Paragon really does well with their different options.  Neither of us drink, so I can't speak to the alcohol selection.  But we do eat so...  When we go, we normally just order a bunch of the snack plates and pick off of each one.  My wife enjoys the marinated olives, the hummus, and the bruschetta.  We both chow on the veggie spring rolls and fried brussels sprouts.    Which brings us to the house fries.  Quite simply the best fries in the history of fries.  In fact, I found some Renaissance art that would seem to indicate that the fries are God's gift to man.  The only nit to pick with Paragon is that the place is really dark on the inside.  Could use about 500 more light bulbs in the place.  Highly recommend Paragon!  Go eat there.  A lot."}
{"text":"The corned beef egg rolls were delicious, and so was the spinach salad! The salad had a hot dressing, which was surprising, but delicious! Also, the brussel sprout perogies were very yummy."}
{"text":"First time eating  here this past Monday  for the $5 burger special .  I don't  eat a lot of beef, but the burger was pretty  good. They have a topping station with your basic  that most places would normally just put on the side of plate; but having  to get up and choosing your  toppings was not  much of a problem. The only weird thing is, I  have  never seen  anyone put raw mushrooms  on a burger . ..it would have been nice to have grilled mushrooms on the  topping station .  The fries included with the burger special  were the best fries I  have ever had! I will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"The more casual sister restaurant to The Standard on E185th. It's a regular go-to for me for lunch or dinner.  Food is very good, love the Paragon Burger ($5 on Mondays!). Tuesdays are $1 tacos all day too.  A good craft beer selection too, draft and bottles."}
{"text":"This is a pretty hard review to write. There were pros and cons, which I'll outline here.  Pros: -Food. It was hot, delicious, and plentiful. Their fries are really, really awesome. Sorry Michael Symon, but they are a better version of the Lola fries. -Atmosphere. There were plenty of options, including two bars (one indoor, one covered outdoor), a patio, and plenty of tables and booths inside.  Cons: -Service. We were a large party, but the service was sporadic, not too friendly, and it. took. FOREVER.  And we were literally one of only two parties at the place. It was dead.  I think it's pretty easy to give a would-be three-star review an extra star if the service was stellar. However, poor service is just the worst and just puts a damper on the entire experience. Therefore, this would-be four star review is now just ok. I'd return, but probably during a different time to see if we could get a smile or some genuine emotion from another server."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went tonight to grab a bite to eat. Burgers were excellent, but service was so slow. Took 15 minutes for our server to come to our table to bring menus. Ordered 2 drinks, his beer came first. By the time I got my  martini, hubby was almost done with his beer. When we wanted another drink, I had to go to the bar to get them. A little disappointing! But again, burger was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are from the west side/downtown and looking for the same douchey atmosphere of west 6th street and don't mind the fact that your chances of being shot or stabbed have increased by 5-7% geographically-speaking, then by all means!  If you want a well-poured, expensive drink then you'd have a better experience having Michael J Fox pour you some maddog 20/20.   Mixed crowd..yes but since there is no BW3 nearby, I think they all flock here.....  Eastsiders trying to bring Rocky River to them......  Bleh."}
{"text":"The food here was about average. Flatbread pizza was quite delicious but my \"buffalo turkey\" sandwich had sliced deli turkey on it which was disappointing. It's mostly bar food so you should mainly come for their extensive martinis. Nice ambience for Euclid and good service!"}
{"text":"Wow. Decided to try their taco Tuesday. Was seated at a table, then ignored for 15 minutes before I had to ask the hostess (who was rolling silverware at the next table) where our server was. Didn't help that the entire wait staff was just hanging around less than 10 feet away. Watched as another couple did not have as much patience as I did, and left before the server even came over. (They waited about 10 minutes before leaving) I would save your tuesday for Taco Bell, and you're better off making margaritas at home, where you would actually find tequila in them."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat. Try the impossible burger. All vegetarian and almost impossible to tell the difference. Great date night spot or lunch with the family. Stop in and check the place out."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, having been to the Standard. Wanting to catch a Cavs game I decided to stop in for a couple of drinks. Unfortunately the male bartender working that night only seemed interested in his phone. I would reveal his name, but he was to busy facebooking to introduce himself. Save yourself the time and go across the street."}
{"text":"First of all the bartenders here are so unfriendly and rude they act like your bothering them when trying to order a drink. This experience alone ruins opinion of the place no matter what the quality of the drinks or food is. Been here 3 times with friends and got the same service every time. Note to the owner,hire some friendly bartenders who actually enjoy they're job and know how to crack a smile."}
{"text":"Love sitting out on the patio and drinking delicious martinis here. Not a whole lot of food options, but everything is good. The service is usually good. They also do a really nice job for parties. The food that they serve if you have a party there is always good. Only complaint is the one room is very dark."}
{"text":"HURRAH!  They have added more vegetarian options!  They even mark them on the menu so you don't have to play the guessing game.  :)"}
{"text":"Paragon is a breath of fresh air in the downtown Euclid neighborhood. (I know, I hate when people use that expression too. It's super cheesy.)  I had been to this space on several other occasions when it was Coppertop and Shaughnessy's -- back in the day. (The underage drinking day.)  I must say that Paragon has vastly improved the space and made it look warm, inviting, and cozy. Although, I'm not sure why there needs to be television screens everywhere. I think they would be just fine in the bar area only.   I was greeted by a very friendly, adorable gentleman named Chris who was working the bar. I'm not sure if he was the owner or not. He was very personable and conversed with me quite a bit during my time at Paragon which made it all the more pleasant.   They had a small but semi-adequate beer selection with a few really good ones on tap. I go nuts over Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale so I went with a few of those. I cannot comment on the wine list because I didn't even look at it. (I wasn't in the mood to sip anything.)  The menu was small -- which is JUST fine. Paragon's chefs are also former Dim and Den Sum guys which is a plus because I've never been disappointed with D&DS.   I started with the potato leek soup. That soup was pretty delicious. It may have even wowed me. I'm never, ever wowed by soup in a restaurant -- I guess I'm a soup snob? I can't wait to try their other soups.   After waiting awhile (which wasn't necessarily a bad thing) -- I had a flatbread pizza. Italian Ham, Brie, Roasted Tomatoes, and Spinach. It was decent but honestly seemed to lack flavor. It may have needed salt. Bartender was apologetic for the wait too. I appreciated that and didn't really mind waiting a bit.   This is another review where I'd like a half star. I would give them a 3.5. They're most likely still working out some small kinks with service and their menu. Overall, I liked Paragon and will return soon."}
{"text":"Love this place the the patio, Love side patio. The tvs are easy to see. The food is pretty good happy they finally added wings all time. I just need more flavors. Tammy one of the best bartenders on the Eastside. The price is not bad keeps it little upscale for area which is good.  They had a great supperbowl deal too.  They finally got suger free red bull ... They are now complete."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good prices, they had a band there the night we went ( which I heard is not frequent for them ) who was pretty decent too. All in all, it was nice to have a delicious meal and not have to drive far at all. I'd heard about this place before but this was the first time we tried them. Now I am just sorry we didn't try them sooner !!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations for this place. We love its sister on 185th, The Standard and expected similar results. We couldn't have been farther from reality.   We started off reasonably well with the chips and weekly dip. The chips were very good and the chicken enchilada dip was a nice match. Her Caesar salad was a different story. Tough Romaine, dried parmigiana and a bottled dressing (at least it tasted bottled) was simply difficult to eat.  The flat breads were acceptable. The Buffalo Chicken was better than the Tapenade, but each had its weak points. Our server said the Buffalo was not spicy and it was. The Tapenade was slightly dried out. These were not flat breads to dream about.  While working alone, our server was perhaps too busy and unfortunately of little value. She could offer only minimal assistance in selecting and didn't make it back to the table to check on our opinions.  We'll continue to patronize The Standard, but will be more cautious when we approach his alternate locations. In this case, the excellence of one does not cling to the other. Too bad."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time and found an opportunity, last Friday night.  Parking was relatively easy and the place was sufficiently full.  I arrived at approximately 8:00 and sat at the bar, since i was dining alone.  Initially the staff was a bit stand-offish, but warmed up over the course of my meal.  I ordered the Sangria, which was generous and very good for $7.50.  I then proceeded to place my order for the short rib sliders and an order of fried brussel sprouts.  The bartender returned a short time later to inform me that the kitchen was out of short ribs, which was a bit of a bummer, because the menu is fairly small and 2 of the entrees involve short ribs.  I quickly changed my order to the appetizer wings, to accompany the brussel sprouts.  The food arrived a short time later and everything was delicious.  The portion of brussel sprouts was more than generous especially for $5.  The sprouts were perfectly fried, not at all greasy, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  The wings were perfectly seasoned but not dipped in sauce, which was nice because that meant no messy fingers!  There were 2 dips, a bleu cheese and chorizo, to accompany the wings but wasn't needed because the wings were good without the dip.  I can't wait to return.  Those brussel sprouts were delicious and can't wait to try the short rib sliders on my next visit."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem in Euclid.   Very cute patio with a great menu. I ordered the veggie burger and it came in a pretzel bun. I never eat the buns well this one I did !!!! Delicious.   We were all pleasantly surprised by this find !!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the fried brussels sprouts which were very very good. Macaroni and cheese is awesome and the shroom flatbread was also tasty. Our server was very friendly and knew the menu very well to give us recommendations and I would recommend this place highly if you're in the Euclid area."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday. The restaurant reserved a table for us at the last minute on a Saturday night. Service was excellent and our waitress recommended drinks and entrees. We each tried a different martini and sandwich on the menu. The food was excellent. We came on a night that a local band was playing. We were able to enjoy the band while still having conversations among our group."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot that can go unseen.  I've gone there for many dates because the atmosphere is very relaxedn, the lighting is dim, and the tables are huge.  They have a lot of options for vegetarians. You have to her the fries it's a huge older for sharing and they are life changing(in a fry kind of way lol)."}
{"text":"Try the vegan Impossible Burger. I'm a meat-eater but tried the Impossible Burger because I've heard so much hype around it. Believe the hype. My goodness, it's a vegetarian's must-order. I was truly shocked how much a vegan plant-based burger tasted like the real thing. We also had tofu eggrolls that were delicious. Overall, as always, Paragon was a wonderful experience. It's nice to have an East Side foodie spot without having to go to Ohio City or Tremont."}
{"text":"Drinks were great, not so much the food. Waited almost an hour to be served and our \"short rib\" dinners were basically a lump of lukewarm meat with no sauce and very little taste. Brussels sprouts drenched in balsamic dressing. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Monday.  Place was pretty quiet.  Ordered the Margarita flatbread.  A lot of bread, and it wasn't the tastiest pizza dough I've had.  Service was very friendly and efficient.  It seems like one of the better options in Euclid, for sure."}
{"text":"Great place! I've been once for drinks and had an excellent experience. Last week, I drove by at lunch time and decided to stop by. I ordered the house salad with salmon and would 100% recommend. It was a bit over my personal budget, but the service and food made up for it. The man who took my order got me water as I waited and stopped to chat. Not to mention, they're doing wonders for the city. Love!"}
{"text":"I visited Paragon on a friend's recommendation (I'm not from the Cleveland area).  He said that he had never had bad food here.  Our server was Lindsey, and she was ok. She gave us the specials of the night and was willing to repeat them, since the place is so loud. For 8:30 on a Saturday night, the restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but the service wasn't quite up to par considering the lack of patronage. Great atmosphere, though! I like the pub scene; for me it's a welcome change of pace.  I gave this place three stars because 1) they don't have sweet tea, and 2) the pierogi entree was mediocre at best. I was expecting, for $9, more than 3 pierogies. They were overcooked, not hot enough, and too dense. It was like eating deep-fried ricotta cheese. Worse, these pierogies were absolutely tasteless. Not even bland; these pierogies literally had zero taste. In food, the two most capital offenses to me are food not being hot enough, and food having no taste. Even the Paragon sauce (think of it like a chipotle mayo) didn't help.  However, the pierogies came served on a bed of cabbage which was very, very tasty.  I'd give this place another try if I'm ever back in Cleveland, but I wouldn't recommend the pierogi dish, based on the tastelessness alone. My four friends all had burgers and fries and all four were very, very happy (except one of my friends asked for a rare burger and his came out as medium). It's not a bad spot by any means; I just can't justify giving four or five stars on the first visit when I wasn't happy with my food."}
{"text":"We were surprised at how good this was. I had a veggie wrap and my wife had a chicken sandwich. Both are cooked and prepared in a healthy manner. We also have the Apple strudel which was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food! The must haves are the Brussels sprouts and the fries. The flatbread was excellent. Can't wait until warm weather to go back and try the patio."}
{"text":"Another excellent lunch. Had the special...3 brat sliders with fries. Our server  took good care of us. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My dear friends are regulars at Paragon and have talked it up so, that I was jonsin' to try it out. IM SO GLAD I DID! We went in for dinner last night...and I LOVE the ambiance! It is so laid back and welcoming! From the dimly lit dining and bar area, to the thick heavy wood booths and bar, i love the feel of Paragon! And the service was wonderful! My friends know the wait staff, and the owner...and Chris stopped by to introduce himself too, and what a great guy! Friendly and cool :) And the food? OH HEAVENLY YUM! I had the lamb burger...and some of the Mac special. TO. DIE. FOR. I love the fact that all of the burgers on on Pretzel buns! A welcome change from all of the \"brioche\" trendies.   I will definitely be back, especially with the all night Monday special of $5 burger and $2 pints!"}
{"text":"Love this place,  tons of vegan options, great atmosphere,  great drink selection and it even has a covered  outside bar that is heated in the winter.  The Brussel sprouts are amazing and boy howdy do they know how to prepare tofu. If you are in the area, they won't dissapoint."}
{"text":"Now featuring an entire vegan brunch menu every Sunday in addition to their regular brunch menu. I had a tofu scramble with deep fried Brussels sprouts that was amazing. My fiance had a non vegan deep fried egg meal and loved it. Worth checking out whether you're a vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Really friendly service. Atmosphere is good- sort of an upscale bar or tavern. There is a decent selection of craft beers, wine and mixed drinks. The menu was lacking selection especially in appetizers but all of our entrees were really very good. I tried the fish sandwich which was excellent. The chicken blt was also good. Burgers good. Salmon salad was rated only a c+ by my sister so I wouldn't get that. Overall this place is good... For Ohio :)"}
{"text":"Paragon is a great place to go on a date, with friends or with family. A cozy atmosphere, with an extensive beer and wine list, full bar, and an excellent menu, with flatbread pizzas, yummy salads, and scrumptious desserts. They have a great cheese board, and great apps as well. The tables and booths are large and bar is off set from the dining area ,   so you get an intimate feeling. The staff is so friendly, and the owner sent us a dessert to taste the delicious cheesecake and caramel ice cream... to die for. A great addition to the neighborhood and the dining experience in Cleveland! Thanks Paragon!"}
{"text":"We had several small plates including short rib sliders, vegetable spring rolls, the Paragon board, Fried Brussels sprouts, and the house fries.  Everything was delicious. It's great to find a Tapas bar of this quality here.  Service was relaxed and homey. Melissa our server was very pleasant. We will be back to taste the rest of the small plates!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have been going here since we were in high school. It is a local place that is great for a group of friends or a family dinner. The food is OK but the fries are amazing! Their taco night use to be delicious but the more it happens, the less they are trying. The meats barely have flavor and the condiments are just your average, nothing special. They have great drinks but no real specials. If you want a food special, go for their burger nights and just order fries. Their burgers are okay but the pretzel bun is what makes it. I am giving this one 3 stars just because every time I go it is always a hit or miss."}
{"text":"My first review of 2011 goes out to Paragon Bar on Lakeshore in Euclid.  This used to be the Coppertop but thankfully that establishment has closed and now Paragon gets their turn at being a successful bar/restaurant in an area really needing a face lift.  I have officially been here twice and will probably find myself coming here more often in 2011.    My first experience was New Years Eve, during the afternoon hours, to try and scope out my options for last minute drinking in case my initial NYE plans fell through.  I stopped in, ponied up to the bar, and to my delight, $2 happy hour bottles.  I stayed long enough to consume 3-4 beers and eat a half off flat bread pizza.  Kudos on the cheap beer prices, but the flat bread lacked the flavor punch you would expect from fresh basil.  I understand that this is a work in progress but with 2 full time cooks / chefs, I was expecting more.  I went with the Margarita Pizza, slightly overcooked but it was cheap and did the trick.  Very limited menu but some of the food passing by my bar stool did look really good.  I will try something different next time.  I never ended up coming here for NYE but the bartender, 40's, looked like she was dressed to impress.  My second experience was Sunday night.  I decided to bring 4 friends along for the ride to see what they thought of the Paragon.  We all decided that it was a nice change of pace for Euclid with hopes that maybe this will be the beginning of something exciting to come.  The new owners really put some money into the place fixing it up which should make a great happy hour place and could have some potential as a Yelp event location.    Parking up front is limited so hit the back parking lot.  Try the martini's ($7.50), the dirty martini I had was well made and probably went down a lot quicker then it should have being the last cocktail of the night.  Try some food and leave feedback with the manager, now is the time for them to hear as much criticism as possible.  There is a Jukebox.  I didn't check out all the taps but it appears that most are imports.  I don't recall seeing Bud or Miller products on tap but definitely in bottles.  4 stars is a stretch, 3.5 would have been more fitting, but I'll give the extra .5 stars based on potential and that my main purpose for Paragon will be for drinks / happy hour.  Fits the bill just fine.  Remember:  This is Euclid, not Lakewood, so take that into account when reviewing.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Second and last time at Paragon this afternoon. I have them a second shot after being unimpressed the first time. I had the mushroom burger which was fine itself, though the bun was cold, with fries that were also pretty good, but the service was just terrible. The server was nice, but she never refilled our waters, even after saying she would, and never delivered the other drink I ordered. I had to go up to the bar just for a water refill. I would have mentioned this to her at the time but she never checked on us once outside of taking and delivering our food order. I had to go find her to ask for the check. They were not busy and all the staff seemed to be socializing with customers they knew rather than paying attention to the customers they didn't.   Additionally, there were several kids running around and yelling in the dining area. Now, I have a soul, so kids having fun is great. But they were *so* loud and disruptive and were blocking a big area where people needed to walk. The least the staff could have done was ask the parents to quiet them down. In summary, the mediocre food isn't worth the crap service or atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to go here when it was the coppertop, I'm glad to see that they still kept that aspect of the bar the same. Very nice decor and interior appeal, gives you the sense that you aren't in the middle of Euclid. We did not eat but the menu items looked very pleasing, and as a cool bonus, just for checking in I got a free desert. Go yelp! Anyway, the staff was attentive and the selection of drafts was very nice. We aren't big wine and martini drinkers so we were both pleased at the micro brews they had to offer. Overall the crowd was older, 30-40s which usually makes for a nice evening. I will be back to check the place out for the food for sure. Not one complaint on my Friday night there."}
{"text":"Best spot for a family meal...the fish tacos are my favorite but everything on the menu is delicious:) Great food, great atmosphere and a friendly staff! One of Euclids gems for sure!"}
{"text":"Paragon continues to be a great neighborhood place. Great food, large beer/wine selection and reasonable prices. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"First time in this location. Staff not attentive at all. Waiting to be served for about 8 minutes when there was no one else present to be served at the time. Was not told about specials. Over heard the server tell a male customer about the specials that came in after me. The sandwich I ordered was bland but the avocado mayo was amazing. Prices are reasonable but probably will not return."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks Sunday night and was so disappointed in the food. The atmosphere is warm and inviting just like the service. Our waitress was Lindsey and she was absolutely wonderful! Funny, personable, knowledgeable and attentive. The drinks, martinis and Moscow mules for me, and craft beer for my date were great. But the food, good god the food is bad! We got the Ruben egg rolls for an appetizer and it was normal greasy bar food but not bad. My date got the meatloaf which looked and tasted like cement. And I got the pierogi dinner. They were deep fried led potatoes w no flavor. Apparently they have changed the menu recently but not for the better. This place is good for drinks but that's about it."}
{"text":"BEST veggie spring rolls I have ever had! Drinks so tasty! Burgers are to die for! Was a little loud, but it was packed with regulars. Great local atmosphere! I live 2 miles away & never knew this little gem was here all along! Maybe my new fave restaurant!"}
{"text":"The wife and I did not know what to expect.  Don't fear first timers you will be glad you came just like we did.  Food great and what a very nice out door area even if it rains because they have an attached cover from one building to the other for cover.  Great times here for everyone.  Food is very good. The braised short ribs melt in your mouth. ( oldies no need for teeth). :)   Would recommend this to all."}
{"text":"Extremely noisy and slow service.  The polenta was cold and flavorless and the short ribs were tough. The wine list was boring. My husband had a corned beef sandwich, and he said it was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place: great cocktails, great beer selection and great food! I have tried many different many items and they never disappoint. However, I used to love getting the mac & cheese as a late night stand by. Not anymore. They changed the recipe! What used to be thick and cheesy is now a milky, runny rue sort of sauce poured over the pasta. The cheese used to cling to the noodles now it runs right over them and sits on the bottom of the plate. And I use the word cheese lightly, because it is a rather runny milky sauce. No more mac & cheese from here for me. Everything else is excellent. Oh, if you order the Brussels Sprouts, get them very well done, like the Standard does them. Too crunchy otherwise."}
{"text":"There's a lot on the menu that can change according to the \"chef's whim.\" I'm not sure how often changes are made, but my appetizer of pot stickers was one such dish. On the evening I went the potsticker snack contained general tso chicken. The potstickers were still soft, but lightly fried. The price of the appetizer was only $9 and was very reasonable like the rest of the menus' prices. Wines by the glass were really reasonable as well and happy hour (- $1) prices apply even to the dining room.   For a main I got the pierogis which came three to an order. They were on a huge pile of shaved Brussels sprouts mixed with onions and prosciutto. A drizzle of paprika sour cream was around the plate. All the flavors went well together. The hash bas in and of itself was delicious.   The mac and cheese entree is also a \"chef's whim\" dish. This night the dish came with chicken. The mac and cheese was very soupy, but the flavor was good and it was also a large portion.   The place wasn't very busy for a Friday night, but our server was friendly and attentive and the kitchen was really fast putting the food out - especially on the app.   There was free street parking right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a first time visit on Friday. Our bartender was Tammy. When we sat down she asked us what we would like to drink. I replied that I wasn't sure as this was our first visit. Tammy replied that she would get us a menu & that is the last word she spoke to us until we asked for our bill. She never came back & asked how our drinks tasted or if we would like food. Needless to say that we left after one drink and went to The Standard, which was 10x better! Atmosphere was ok, dark & very loud. That is about all I can review since the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect when I walked in. Dark...very dark lol. Paragon was pretty full...especially the bar area. When I first walked in, to my right there was a little spread (buffet maybe) of something...don't really know what it was. I found a stool at the end of the bar near the kitchen area.  It looked super small and cramped in there and I couldn't imagine working in such a small space lol. Anyway, my server/bartender was meh okay, not very customer friendly towards me (on my bill it says her name was Tammy). She was pretty occupied chatting it up with one of the male guest next to me, a little \"act like I'm busy\" and occasionally looked at her watch/standing around...definitely didn't even get the \"how's your meal/drink\" to me.  **shrugs**  I ordered a Pomegranate Mojito and Corned Beef Egg Rolls (something quick). As far as the eggs rolls, they offered three different types: corned beef, a pepperoni pizza one and veggie egg roll.  I thought the Corned Beef Egg Roll (with thousand island dressing) was unusual but pretty darn good, the mojito was a little strong and tasted like licorice.   The only reason why I gave three stars instead of two was the egg rolls...pretty good. My end result...one time visit."}
