{"text":"yes! made to order corn tortillas, oaxaca cheese in their quesadillas. been here twice and recommend the camarones taco and the campechano taco (sooooo good, great flavours and texture). friendly staff. almost over attentive service at times. the only things preventing a 5 star are i found the guacamole slightly bland, and the horchata a bit too sweet (the one at tacos 101 was better). love the decor as well. wish i lived closer to go more often!"}
{"text":"Found a hair on my order. Got an apology but guess it wasn't a rare enough occurrence  for them to comp the order.   Too bad, the place showed promise."}
{"text":"A little slice of Mexico and the best tacos in 'The 6'!  I've been on the hunt for a taco better than the fried pescado taco at Playa Cabana's Hacienda on Dupont St. and after trying about a dozen restaurants around the city, I have FINALLY found it!  This jem was recommended to me by a colleague and it doesn't disappoint. The dim lighting, traditional music and beautiful murals brought me back to Mexico and made me forget about the frigid cold. The menu is simple with a little over half a dozen tacos and although the fish taco beats out all other fish tacos in Toronto, the shrimp taco takes the cake for best taco EVER! It's spicy shrimp meets sweet pineapple at a party in your mouth. Honorable mentions also go to the sangria and the guacamole and chips (which are noticeably made fresh-in-house everyday).  Overall, the service, atmosphere and food were on point and I will definitely be going back to try a few more tacos and the ceviche. I don't know how I could have expected anything but Mexican perfection when the chefs were speaking Spanish in the kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"The appetizers are really not for sharing... Too small! The ceviche was great but not for sharing. They're also very stingy when it comes to serving tortillas... Like they served 6 pieces of tortilla chips for a serving of guacamole, please!  The tacos are amazing though! You need to order at least two I guess.  The service was not as good. He should've told us that the appetizers are that small when we were ordering.  The wait was too long for the main course. It took over half an hour for them to serve us."}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good, but a bit on the give you diarrhea side with the level of gooey sauce in them. Maybe people like that, but I'm more of a Tacos El Asador kinda guy. Get the fish taco at the bottom of the menu though. I thoroughly enjoyed that. I'd also appreciate it more if they made their own chips for the guac. I feel like they were Tostitos."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE taco place in the city! They only serve tacos but they sure do them well. Love their chips and guac! I tried their fish tacos and both of them were equally delicious! Hip and cute atmosphere. Convenient location. A bit pricy but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos, order a bunch to share, all very good...one snag, at 6 bucks the guac is quite small, however they did give us a refill on chips without us asking...very considerate"}
{"text":"Small place, BIG taste. Everything we tried was awesome, just the right amount of heat and seasoning. They do tacos and they do it well."}
{"text":"I heard from a friend that a new taco place recently opened at the corner of Adelaide and Portland, so decided to go try it out for dinner. No alcohol license or tacos al pastor yet. We tried most of their tacos, all of which were exquisitely spiced and simply delicious. The ceviche (sea bass) was fresh and served with lots of chips and generous helpings of avocado. I also recommend trying the agua de Jamaica (hibiscus tea), very refreshing!  Prices were very reasonable and the service was impeccable. The seating is cozy and the large pastel coloured wall murals added to the comfortable ambiance, could a nice place for a date."}
{"text":"Excellent guacamole and the most delicious lamb taco I've ever had...it will haunt me."}
{"text":"Good tacos. Terrible service and waiting times were ridiculous to even get one. Even drinks took forever. Guys, get your kitchen and bar together. It's not hard. It's TACOS!!  Es difícil entender porque no pueden sacar su comida en una manera más eficiente. Los tacos son buenísimos pero la cocina, bar y los servidores necesitan una lección en cómo funcione un restaurante."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh tortillas made when ordered.. This may be why tacos are $4 + each.. Small resto, really loud but delicious expensive taqueria..."}
{"text":"On our second visit, we were able to order the rib eye tacos. .. wow! Probably my favourite! I can normally handle Spice and this was definitely spicey!  Amazing tho!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night and they were clearly understaffed. We did make a reservation but did inconvenience them by adding an extra few people. They let us know that food would come out slower because we were a bigger group.   I ordered the chicken and steak taco. The chicken was decent and a good portion size, but nothing special. I didn't get a chance to try the steak as it never ended up coming out. A few other dishes for other friends didn't end up on our table either.   It took over an hour to receive our bills, and when the bills finally came, the items on each receipt were completely mixed up and we were still charged for the dishes that never came. When we asked for the bills to be corrected, one of the servers said that we were wrong and all the items ordered had come out of the kitchen.   We waited another 15 minutes for corrected bills that never showed and had to go up to the front to pay.   Overall, the food was average, but I can't give a good review for a restaurant that wasted 3 hours of my evening for just 1 taco."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, a definite neighbourhood gem. The only disadvantage is that you cannot take the tacos to go but for good reasons - the chef is particular about how he wants the tacos to taste! The chicken was my favourite."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give Campechano 6 stars - the service, food, and people were that amazing.  We were a party of six adults and three newborn babies.  We had an early reservation and the staff went out of their way to accommodate us and assist us with our strollers.  I know that it's tough when you have to serve a party with that many babies, but the staff were extremely helpful and very nice.  The ceviche and gaucomole with chips were top notch.  The Campechano and Pollo al Pastor tacos were wonderfully spicy and extremely delicious.  The serving sizes are generous, and the food is well balanced in flavour and spice.  My husband ordered the red sangria and even though he is not a big drinker, was tempted to order another - it was that delicious."}
{"text":"The good: it was busy, waiter found us a seat in the back (less noisy back there) and food came quickly. Tortillas (thicker than normal) are on point - tortillas can make or break a taco.  The bad: small portion of guacamole and ceviche for the price and they were out of jamaica.  The ugly: The chips are so incredibly salty, and there was major chipotle overkill on the shrimp taco and ceviche. Seeing ceviche on the menu excited me, but instead of the light and fresh flavor and acid of lime, the overpowering flavor of chipotle decimated the flavor of everything else. It looks pretty in its little tower, but I was so disappointed after a bite or two I let my husband eat the rest.   Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming back - too many other great fish tacos up at Kensington Market at Seven Lives and El Trompo."}
{"text":"An unpretentious taqueria that chooses focus on food authenticity rather than hipsterdom.   The sirloin tip taco was incredible, the spicy shrimp, and the ceviche were both great. The ceviche at first glance was a little disappointing because of the small portion size, but it totally worth it after I tasted it.   The renovation from Sadie's went very well - it's now cozy, lit with candles, and clean."}
{"text":"Uncomplicated and delicious. Came here for an early dinner on a Tuesday. I ordered the guac and chips ,  the campechano taco( everything taco) and the camarones taco (shrimp). Tacos are $4.5 each   The Campechano taco was definitely the star of the night, but watch out for the spicy sauce, it is quite spicy and will leave your mouth on fire.  I also tried their feature cocktail with hibiscus tea? it was just meh.  Upbeat latin music plays in the background. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down, THE BEST TACOS & MARGARITAS IN TORONTO or ever probably. The tortilla was warm, the filling was a lot but perfect. More filling the better! It amazes me that the tortilla doesn't break apart because you get to eat the whole thing without any of the filling falling out. All of the tacos are great but my top two favourite is Carnita Taco and I forget the name, but the filling comes with mushroom, bacon, and some sort of cream. I'm not a fan of spicy at all, and the menu doesn't say it is spicy, but it was HOT when I had it. I couldn't not eat it because it was just too good.  Not only was the tacos good. But the margaritas were awesome! The last two times I've gone, I got 2 or 3 margaritas, because it was that good!   A little downside though, I just wish that they would serve you more chips with the guacamole. It is quite tiny, that you would have to buy another one, especially if you're sharing 3 or more people.  The place is quite small so I do recommend making reservations! Also, what's awesome is, my boyfriends family met the owner in Taiwan and if it hadn't been for them, I wouldn't have found my go-to taco and margarita place!"}
{"text":"New favourite taco place. Shrimp taco's are like nothing I've ever had before. Fish taco is large with a very light and airy batter so there's very little deep fried batter taste like most other fish tacos. Those 2 are a must. The pulled chicken was also very good. The steak and green pepper taco was dece. Small portions of guac, prob skip that. Squirt for a nice refreshing drink to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Have always had the tastiest food here to a point where you will order more than you want just to be able to try everything.   Originally did not have the best experience when I went back recently, but management reached out personally to apologize, and to me that attention to customer satisfaction can really emphasize what kind of place this truly is.   Will definitely be coming back and back again, as well happy to show and suggest to people new to the city. The Sope de Pollo is out of this world."}
{"text":"Food, drinks, service and atmosphere were all great.  Best tacos I've had in a long time and the guacamole is fantastic.   They also have a few dishes with some legitimate kick for those who like it spicy (all clearly noted on the menu).  I appreciated the simplicity of the menu and sampled a few different tacos.   They had a couple of very good veggie friendly options too.   Will be back and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, tasty and authentic tacos.  Their food is fresh and delicious.  I love their guacamole and ceviche - you can ask for extra nachos if you run out.  Prices are reasonable.  They have some awesome quesadillas as well to try.    Stop by for a quick lunch or dinner.  There is ample seating in the back. :)"}
{"text":"A tiny ceviche A hybrid quesadilla A crunchy taco A great decor  Ay ay ay... Campechano...  I went with high hopes and walked out satisfied on an average level.  I will help you guys out with some solid advise  1. The ceviche portion was tiny and when I mean tiny it was ridiculous I wanted to laugh. $9 dollars really? I am going to say it in Spanish so the owner gets my point \"no mame compa\" lol.....  2.- The quesadilla. Soggy. You need to leave the tortilla chilling on the flat top a bit more so it gets a bit hard. Texture. Also is this a quesadilla or a taco? Quesadillas have one tortilla on the bottom and one on the top. Simple  3 You can do better with the barbacoa. Keep working on it.  Keep it simple keep it real keep it your way....  Best  HP"}
{"text":"First of all I'd like to say that the food was absolutely delicious. Between my friend and I, we probably ordered one of everything- including the drinks, and none were a let down. (Personally I didn't feel like there was much alcohol in the drinks but this could just be because I've been a budding alcoholic since my youth.)  Campechano is a relatively small taqueria. Its cozy and narrow in the front (seats very close together) and extends to the back with more seating (there is a room with a long table which would be perfect for small get togethers or birthdays if I would ever return to this place which I wont for the following reason)  The service blew.   I was, am, (and as most other servers know) will forever in my heart be a server. No one tips better or is more understanding than another fellow server imo; so when I say the service sucked, it sucked. Our server that night (which was on a Thursday) was not particularly rude or nice, he just kind of floated in the middle. Now you don't have to be the belle of the ball here but its definitely a better experience if your server isn't so bland. Aside from this though, I got the feeling like we were in some kind of a big rush. He asked us immediately if we knew what we wanted to order and when he came back, literally two minutes later, and we were still uncertain, he seemed super irate with us. Throughout the night he was very short with us and I just chalked it up to stress from either too many tables or a UTI or something. But when I called him over to order my third drink that night, he told me it will have to be my last because \"they need the table for another group coming in\". My friend and I found this really annoying because we made a reservation for 6pm and it wasn't even 730pm when he asked us to give up our seats.   I don't really care if the establishment is a quick sit, eat, and go kind of place but if we called to make a reservation it could have at least been mentioned that we needed to leave by a certain time. We honestly probably weren't going to stay longer than another hour - and were sitting there buying drinks and appetizers, so it isn't like we were sipping on water.   I tipped 15% because I don't have the heart not to tip - knowing what servers make - but honestly in hindsight I don't know that I would again. $70 for barely an hour and a half, I feel like there are Toronto prostitutes cheaper than that.  Seriously good tacos btw. Like 11/10."}
{"text":"I'm really sad because this used to be one of my go-to lunch places, however I've noticed service and quality have been lacking the last few times I've been gone, and I think after todays experience, it will be my last.  1- Service: Always friendly, but there are certain servers who can't handle more than a few tables at a time. Our server today didn't put our order through, even though it was clear that many tables after us had been served their food. It was another server (not ours) that noticed we still hadn't gotten our food and followed up. No cutlery was given for a dish that required it, and I could not find my server to get any.  I try not to be too much of a nuisance, and had asked if it wasn't too much trouble for none of the sauce to be put on my taco as I don't like spice. Taco arrived with the jalapeno sauce, which he \"promised me\" wasn't spicy. One bite disproved this, and I had to send it back.  2- Food. Quality seems to have lowered in the past few times. My friend had a fly in her taco, and the delicious chips have been replaced with stale store bought chips. There also always seems to be fruit flies when I'm here, which doesn't help.   I want to love this place but all of the above has kind of ruined it for me  You will get some good tacos here but expect service delays and the occasional fly"}
{"text":"Cute space and tasty tacos. I had the chicken taco and it was very good. Also had the shrimp taco, which was good, but spicier than expected. Tacos are small, but not as bad as other places and they had a ton of filling. Service was great too. My only complaint is the guacamole and chips. Both were good, but such a small serving! I could've eaten the whole thing myself, but my wife and I shared it."}
{"text":"Cute and small restaurant with good tacos - however, a bit on the expensive side.   It might be me and my nonexistent spice tolerance, but almost all of their tacos had a bit of spice to it - even the ones without the \"Spicy\" label!   I would recommending 2-3 tacos depending how hungry you are. I wanted to have more variety and went with three. I went with a beef (first taco), the fish taco (Branzino) and a pulled pork. The fish taco was hands down the best one - agreed by everyone  who ordered it. The beef was a bit too spicy for me, while the pork was the 'safe' option, which also means it was the least interesting.   Also of note was the Sangria, which was great. Would definitely order again.   Although everything on its own doesn't seem to cost a lot, they do add up quick. With tacos and a drink it'll set you back approximately $40."}
{"text":"Loved! Loved! Loved this place!  Being on a constant quest to find great Tacos to satisfy my tastebuds, Mr. H and I landed here thanks to yelp.  It's a small place and was packed on the friday night and hence we were happy to sit at the bar. Since we sat there, our service was very quick and efficient.   The menu here isn't very long for drinks or food and hence it's easy to try almost everything on the menu. I ordered the margarita and I have to say it was one of the best I'd had, really well made. This was had along with an amazing plate of ceviche!  Mr. H and I had 7 of tacos and all were absolutely amazing!!! I loved the Chicken Tinga, a spicy one with beef and chorizo one as well. I don't recall their names but I don't think you'll be disappointed with anything.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Legit taco place. Went there for lunch, the crowd wasn't big, tacos are on point. 4 stars, if they are just doing tacos, I feel like they could do more with their tacos menu."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place! This is exactly what Toronto needs; a non pretentious and fair priced taco joint. Since I first set foot into this place, I went back with multiple groups of friends 3 more times in the same week. It's that good!  Service is excellent too! They ran out of tortillas this one time when I went really late and tried to make different things to satisfy my group's cravings.  Keep up the excellent work!  Ps. I was a little hesitant writing this review because I love this place and want to keep it a secret :P It's definitely going to be crazy packed soon."}
{"text":"Came here for girls night on Saturday and good thing we made a reservation! The place was busy! But busy usually means great food and the tacos sure didn't disappoint! We had the AAA sirloin and fish tacos (both highly recommended!).The flavours were just right and the spicy beef tacos definitely packed a punch. I liked how the server brought one taco at a time so you have time to enjoy it before the other one got cold. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Amazing meal!!! My husband doesn't like tacos but he enjoyed the food here so much, the mess on his hands didn't bother him. We tried the shrimp, lamb, chicken and beef. We liked it all. Especially the shrimp. It's spicy but sweet with the pineapple whixh I believe was grilled. We tried the ceviche, which was delicious as well.  The atmosphere is loud and bustling. Would like to sit in the patio next time but inside is nice and on a cold night is cozy. Window has a nice view of CN tower.  Really great spot. Eat well for cheap.  $45 tax and tip incld."}
{"text":"Not good for vegetarians, they only had one option on the menu (which isn't posted anywhere). It was pretty good, I like the texture of the taco, could have used more flavor. Asked for hot sauce and the server looked at us like we were crazy.  Service was slow and rude. We made a reservation and they told us at the time that we'd have 2 hours. Our server came up to us when we still had 45 min left and told us we'd need to clear out in 15 minutes. Which we didn't do.  Ambiance was ok, a bit too dim.   With so many great Mexican places in the city, no reason to come back here."}
{"text":"Water was on the table but it did take some time to get that margarita (and they were out of Dos Equis). It's loud. We were a bit rushed after being moved to a postage stamp-sized table that we were told we could linger at before being pushed along (and did I mention that I was waiting for that margarita). Not a lot of choice but wait...these tacos rock!  There's heat but not quite too much. You will need to order two. I recommend the Tinga de Pollo (shredded chicken on flour) and Pescado (lightly fried sea bass on corn) plus the guacamole and salsa platter. There are other hipster places. This is good but it could be better. And don't get me started on 'we don't take reservations, you need to give up this table for people with a reservation'"}
{"text":"I tried their guacamole appetizer and their campechano and tinga tacos.  The chips were nicely crispy and not greasy at all which was nice.  But the guacamole was very underwhelming as I could barely taste any lime, cilantro, garlic, or even salt.  It was like dipping the chips into a large bowl of plain mashed avocado.  The tacos were definitely better.  The campechano tacos had beautifully crispy pork skin in it that added some nice texture.  And the tinga taco had some smokiness that was pleasant.  I agree with the review that mentioned that there should be 2 corn tortillas with each taco so that when the filling falls out onto the plate, you have something to scoop it up with.  But overall, it's clear that these taco fillings were made with a nice amount of care and attention which I do appreciate.  Service was very pleasant and friendly but overall, I'm not so sure that this place wasn't quite worth shelling out so much money for.  If I do come back again, I'll stick with the tacos."}
{"text":"New fave place - made reservations weeks ago for a Thursday lunch for 4. Received a reconfirmation text day before. Arrived and had the sweetest waitress and she was accommodating to one of our friends \"cilantro aversion\" without judgment. Had the guac and ceviche apps, then each of us had 2 tacos - varying between shrimp, beef, chorizo, fish and chicken. Everything was amazing and well proportioned. And at the end our waitress asked how we would like the bill - for King Street regulars this is essential for work lunches and so appreciated. Can't wait to return and work our way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Nestled in a quiet neighbourhood near queen, this little place is a gem.  Tacos were delicious and the service was great!  We had the lamb, sirloin, short rib, and red snapper.  All were uniquely flavored and well balanced.  One thing I especially appreciated was their definition of spicy. Most places call things spicy with either 1) little to no spice, or 2) spicy heat with no flavour.  Their short rib had a good balanced spiciness to it that really brought out the flavour of the meat.  Didn't try the drinks that night, but will definitely return!  The Dulce de Leche dessert was spectacular!!! Definitely save room for this dessert!!!   One of the best Mexican places in the city!!!"}
{"text":"Toronto is known for not having good Mexican food which is echoed many times by residents and visitors alike. Campechano Taqueria is working hard to change that impression. With the lowly taco no less. Not easy... Early on a Saturday evening the doorway to this Adelaide hot spot was jammed with people keen on trying the taco of the day. Wait times were around an hour. With the two of us, it was less of a wait, with plenty of time to analyze the mural in an area of downtown known for street art and with Graffiti Alley around the corner. Why was she dreaming of Coca-Cola?, hmmmmm... This became an important topic which paired well with a Cuba Libra and its hint of lime. The menu suggested a chorizo, shrimp, and steak tacos and another wait was in store for us while we watched the chef in the open kitchen work like a mad alchemist combining and flipping savouries around like a game of shells with frying pans slid and flung through the air as the flames shot up high in the air occasionally waking us out of our reverie. Flanked by a couple young prep chefs she worked like someone possessed. The shrimp taco screamed out for a salty limey Margarita which was perfect with their fresh-squeezed lime juice and generously salted glass. Nice! The artistry came through in our tacos as we devoured them calling out for seconds, but another time, another time..."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Saturday night and it was a great experience. It was busy so they took our name and number down to text us when our table was ready. They said it would be a 40+ minute wait and it turned out to be much sooner than that. Their taco shells are gluten free and are very tasty. Between the two of us we had basically everything on the menu and I would recommend all of it. I had a margarita and it was very good, my friend loved her sangria. The prices are great and the servers were very friendly. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to go here for a while, and when I finally did - bam!  I love Mexican food. It's delicious, it's spicy (hurrah), and it can be either bite-sized or massive.  Campechano's tacos were not that large (anyone could eat 2, most would be OK with 3, and 4-5 would not be that crazy if you're hungry).   What they were is delicious. I had three different ones, and every single one was delicious and tasty in it's own right.  It on the more-expensive side, but absolutely 100% worth eating here. It's my #1 taco recommendation (with Tacos Al Asador #2)."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and we were not disappointed.  As good or better than Wilburs with great service and amazing tacos.  Best in TO"}
{"text":"PROS: - tacos were like a meal. Big portions. - service was friendly and kind   CONS - everything has cilantro in it. - drinks were TERRIBLE. I would never drink there again; I'd just eat and run across to Spirithouse for real alcohol.  Pre-mixed margarita that was like two sips and way too sweet. - SPICY AF.  Only one tacos had the word \"spicy\" next to it, so I just didn't order that one. I THOUGHT I WOULD DIE and my tolerance is medium.  OMG. - way too loud. Loudest restaurant of all time. - hot, no a/c?  -   I didn't use the restroom so I can't comment on that like I normally like to :)  So even though there are way more cons than pros, the concept was interesting enough that I'd try again.  Still prefer La Carnita, which I get isn't as \"authentic\" but I do love their tacos, what can I say....but better food than Macho."}
{"text":"Rating: This is a solid 3 1/2* with the bump of 1/2* for the circumstance of my visit.   I had this place bookmarked for a while but a recent review by a fellow Yelper (shout-out to Sammie S.) made me realize that I was walking by Campechano on my way for lunch to a different place.   So what was I to do?  I decided to get a smaller dish at the lunch place in order to stop at Campechano for a few tacos. Luckily, I have a wife and daughter that humours me in my food pursuit.   We arrived just after 2pm and the waitress informed us that the last call will be in 15 minutes as they close at 2:30pm. That was no problem since I was the only one interested in ordering something. This is a small place and I could see seating being an issue at busier times. Love their wall mural.   The wait staff quickly provided us with a menu. I was disappointed that there was no shrimp tacos for lunch. So I decided to order the Bistec (Top Sirloin) and the Tinga de pollo (Chicken Breast). There's no way you could just order one taco even though you kind of full.   The tacos came out fairly quick as you can see it being cooked in front of you as they have an open kitchen. I liked the Tinga the best. Both of the tacos had the Morita sauce which provided a nice little kick but the Bistec was overtly salty. Also the prices are a little steep but based on location, I can understand why.   My dining experience at Campechano probably took no more than 10 minutes plus it was right before closing. That's why I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and bump up the rating to 4*. I'm hoping to come back for dinner and ask if they offer shrimp tacos.   Solid tacos but not the best in the GTA.  #35 of 2018"}
{"text":"I struggled to write this review because half the experience was great, the other half poor.    Okay, let's start with the good stuff: - Arrived at 8:30pm on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. If you frequent this neighbourhood, you know that's a miracle because you're usually waiting way too long for a table on the weekend. - Menu is simple and straightforward - they do tacos and they do them well.  - Service - excellent, professional, friendly from start to finish - The lamb and shrimp tacos were phenomenal. The shrimp taco was tangy and spicy - SO GOOD.  Now the not-so-good:  - By 8:30pm they were out of a few menu items which put a big damper on things. There's nothing sadder than getting excited about food only to be told you can't have it, especially if it's dessert. - Guac was delish, but it was served in the tiniest of bowls for $6 - boo - Very limited cocktail menu, it was a little disappointing.  I wouldn't discourage you from trying this spot - I enjoyed the tacos very much and the price point is pretty much on par with other restaurants."}
{"text":"3.5  Everything was very hit or miss.We arrived and were promptly seated in the back at a communal table, which was fine. Ordered the first of a few margaritas and some chips and guac off the bat. Guac had pomegranate seeds, which was a nice twist, but not sure I loved it. Ceviche was ok. I prefer a little more fish to avocado, but it was tasty.  I think our server was new, or the kitchen screwed up the orders a couple of times. He was friendly, but we had a couple of small issues; My boyfriend ordered 2 tacos but got three (two of the rib eye and one of the pulled pork). Ribeye was good, but not as spicy as they advertise (at least not for me, anyway.) The ribeye taco that I ordered was curiously over salted. I rarely complain about things being too salty, but the first bite I took tasted like they'd dumped a salt shaker in the end of the taco and scraped it off.  I also asked the waiter if they had some hot sauce because I like things really spicy. He offered some of the sauce they put on the rib eye taco, but he didn't bring it at any point. Would have been happy to pay extra, but nope.   I ordered a fish taco, shrimp and rib eye. I got the rib eye first and then the fish, which was made with branzino and out of this world incredible!!! The fish had amazing flavour on its own and was perfectly cooked. Crunchy cabbage adorned the top. Truly and epic taco.  For my last taco, the server brought another fish taco, but I had ordered the shrimp and really wanted to try it. I called him over and he came back a few minutes later with the shrimp taco. I didn't love the sauce on it. Shrimp were ok.  I wouldn't get this one again.  Tortillas were fresh and delicious. You could tell they were made in house and the thickness was perfect to hold the taco fillings.  Our bill was over $100. The five margaritas were half the bill. Tasty, but very small, they were.  I would come back to Campechano. But I would drink a pitcher of margaritas at home first and then order three fish tacos and one rib eye. That ought to put me at about $21 + tax and tip. I could handle that. The fish tacos really were something else!!"}
{"text":"Goodbye Sadie's Diner and Juice Bar, where a meat-eater's dreams went to die, and ola Campechano! Even though it's still waiting on a liquor license and tacos al pastor are yet to appear on the menu, Campechano is a fantastic addition to the neighbourhood.   The menu is focused on tacos, their larger, cheesier cousins, quesadillas and a few smaller plates -- it's easy to try the whole menu if you're splitting amongst friends. Tried the ceviche, guacamole, a few tacos and a quesadilla. The horchata was good, but could benefit from a bit more spice. The tortillas and chips are obviously made onsite and were exceptional.   A local Diego Rivera has left his/her mark, with vibrant murals wrapping around the space, and the candlelight makes for a casual, intimate setting. The figure painted closest to the front windows of the restaurant looks uncannily like Nicki Minaj - pro or con? At any rate, I will be returning, and wish nothing but the best for this shiny new establishment."}
{"text":"Good tacos and the sope de pollo was good. I got the barbacoa and it was really tasty - probably my favorite of the night.  My girlfriend got the white sangria and her eyes lit up on the first sip. I was tasty.   Get reservations on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Classic taqueria, no fuss.  The other day I experienced a perfect, quick lunch cooked in front of me:  I tried two tacos, the tinga de pollo (morita chicken) and camarones enchipotle (chipotle shrimp) taco.   Holy. Who says we're bored of tacos here in Toronto? As long as they are this good that won't be happening.  They make their tortillas fresh in house (roasting Mexican corn to make the masa, etc.) and you will definitely notice it. So delicious. Like the rest of Toronto, I love me some Seven Lives, but dare I say that I found these tacos even tastier?!  For drinks, I had a house-made agua fresca, Jamaica, which is basically a cold hibiscus flower tea. Not too sweet; fragrant and refreshing.  Simple menu, fine prices and a bright atmosphere. They are already popular which isn't that surprising."}
{"text":"The Barabcoa alone is to die for!!!! The guacamole was great but I'd add a little squeeze of lime if you get a chance. The tacos aren't overloaded and makes it easy to eat.... and easier to eat more than 2!"}
{"text":"Very good service and accommodated my requests, which was appreciated. The food was mediocre. Guacamole and shrimp cocktail were on the sweet side of the palate and there was guacamole on each of the 4  tacos we ordered. If you don't like sweet food this can certainly affect your enjoyment. The branzino was tasty but so very fried with more batter than fish. Not impressed. Overall an average spot at best."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food! Great staff and service.  Unfortunately they do not offer delivery nor takeout.. I wish they would reconsider the take out thing."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing.... The tortillas from scratch and the flavours bring me back to Mexico 0-100"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the tacos here are pretty darn good. Maybe some of the best I've had in the city so far. They do justice to the tortilla which can sadly be overlooked elsewhere. But... damn are they on the pricey side. Ranging from $5 - $7.50 I think you would need at least 3 to make a meal. I had two at lunch, plus sharing a guacamole with my lunching companions and I wasn't exactly 'too full'. The Carnitas was really good and the Barbacoa (braised Lamb) was pretty good as well (if not a touch on the salty side). Since when has the humble taco been turned into a luxury food? The service was good and the place is nicely appointed (maybe a little too nicely).   But I have to say - please stop serving your beer pints in enamel tins cups! Maybe it looks cool (it doesn't), but every sip of beer is going to have a 'tin' taste to it.   I will be back, but I have to save up some money first (and I'll bring my own beer glass)."}
{"text":"Okay so I used to love this place, and it was my go to for a taco fix with delicious margaritas. Every time I've been it has been brimming with people, but on my last visit it was half empty on a Thursday evening. I ordered my favourite (the sopa) with a number of different tacos- steak, chicken, fish, etc. The sopa arrived lukewarm for some reason, and the steak taco was tough as if it was cooked earlier in the day and reheated. Otherwise the chicken tings and fish tacos were relish as expected. Maybe it was an off night. Too bad because this was my favourite Mexican in the city and has otherwise been consistently amazing."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This place is known for their tacos, which is made with corn tortillas so they're gluten-free. I got a carnitas and a costilla taco, both of which were good but a bit too salty. The other people I was with also said that their tacos were salty, so it wasn't just me. So if you go here, make sure to ask them to go light on the salt.   They are also accommodating of allergies. I asked for a modification to my tacos, which they complied with.   The service was great when we first arrived and the place was half full, but it got packed very quickly and our waiter struggled to attend to each table. It was hard to get his attention most of the time. Our food came out pieces at a time and they didn't always tell you what the taco was so it got confusing trying to determine whose tacos were whose. At some point there was a mix-up over the tacos at my table and people ended up getting other people's tacos. When we notified the waitress who brought it out she snapped at us saying she gave the taco to the right people, but still had the kitchen replace the tacos that were accidentally eaten by the wrong person. She brought out a replacement taco fairly quickly, but her attitude towards us was off-putting. Our original waiter was really friendly though, when we managed to see him.   TL;DR tacos are a bit too salty, slow service"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this tiny Mexican restaurant while deciding what to eat as Aloette was full and didn't want to wait. Have to say though we made a decent call coming here while there were so many options all around. No expectations coming... Only that we were hungry.  Food: Got the entire taco section of the menu. What stood out for me was definitely the pork shoulder, lamb and the fish taco. While I did think everything wasn't bad it wasn't much differential aspect between each taco. Cilantro being heavily utilized. Spice levels were perfect, most the dishes we had gave a good amount of heat without it over powering my taste buds.   I also ordered margarita which was nice and refreshing while having the tacos.  Service: Our server was attentive and cleared our table regularly. Service was coursed in 3s rather than just bringing everything we ordered all at once. Definitely a plus that the server understood what we were going for without having us prompting him that we wanted to treat our dining experience like a tasting.   Ambiance: Recommend sitting by the window if you want good lighting. The establishment is small and definitely have that hip vibe behind it. Restaurant is also sectioned off into two dining area with a open kitchen.   Final verdict, it satisfied our goal of the day which was fill ourselves up. Good service, good food... Definitely would recommend to others and come in for a quick bite if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"1 star removed due to pricing but this might just be one of the best fish tacos in the city. Ceviche was incredible too. Really good food."}
{"text":"Had a really nice dinner here. We had the guac to start, followed with the shrimp/chipotle and mushroom tacos and a quesadilla. All were well presented, well cooked, fresh and tasty. The hibiscus tea was refreshing. The servers were prompt and pleasant. The ambience fit well with a dinner date. The bill was reasonable.   I'm bummed about Sadie's being gone, but Campechano is a great replacement and I hope they do well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Expensive, but the tacos are bomb. There's a beef one that's really spicy, but worth the heat. You can't go wrong with the Baja taco! The drinks are also good."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Campechano is a hip Mexican sit down restaurant that serves a selection of tacos. I got the Carnitas and Tinga de Pollo for $5 each and we also shared guacamole ($7) with the complimentary chips appetizer.  Campechano Taqueria appears very modest from the outside, and it's fairly easy to miss it, but definitely a place to try for locals. I came here during lunch and although there's not many spots to sit, I didn't see anyone needing to wait at the doors. Sometimes, you may be seated at large picnic tables, of which, you may have the chance to share this with another party. The environment is hip, with fiesta music, casual and lively. If you don't have space to put your coats, they have coat hangers located next to your seats, so you won't have to worry about needing to hold your stuff while you're enjoying your tacos.   The chips came in a cute blue mug and there was a ton of non-salty but seasoned guac on the side. The tacos are slightly spicy, but down-diggity delicious. A soft shelled taco wrapped with meat, veggies and drizzled in delicious sauce. The sauce is rather viscous, so for the most part, this was one of the cleanest tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend the Carnitas. The Tina de Pollo wasn't a favourite of mine, but it was still delicious! I recommend ordering two tacos without the guac, or just one taco with the guac because it can get super filling!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service. Daniel is a very creative and wonderful chef. The menu is always changing. Each taco is unique and different we couldn't decide which one was the best. A fun experience, highly recommended.  Neil W."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here as he recommended that I try it out with him. He is a lunch regular during the work week as his office is just around the corner. He did warn me that it could get busy given the amazing food and small space. I was concerned when we walked in as all the tables were taken in the front. But to my surprise, they had some tables in the back area and we were quickly shown our table.  Table for 2s were quite small when ordering a few tacos, drinks and some appetizers. I'm not the spicy adventurer so my buddy had the exotic stuff like spicy lamb taco which was the special for the day. The guacamole in the beginning was very addictive. I had two tacos which were the combo and the beef which were the safe choice for my palette. They also have juice, wine and a unique selection of bottle beers that I have not seen before.  Despite opening for a few weeks, they have their process down pat with excellent service.  I would return to try the rest of their menu and the daily specials. It's on the way home but having more people join for the meal makes it better."}
{"text":"I regret not taking a photo of the menu as it is different from the one posted here in photos. Note that they do not take credit, but debit is accepted.  Ceviche - 4.5/5. White fish and shrimp ceviche was the special for that night. Mmmm, it sure was tasty. Note that the ceviche comes with a serving of guac on top of it. I was surprised to see the guac when the plate came to the table as our server didn't mention it when describing the dish.  I have an avocado sensitivity so I avoid avocado when possible. I asked for all the tacos to be made without any avocado or their avocado crema. I ended up pushing off the guac that came on top of our ceviche.  We tried a variety of tacos including the chorizo, lamb, bistek, chicken, and carne asada. Our server recommended 2-3 tacos per person.   Top picks - lamb and the bistek tacos were delicious. So flavourful and moist. 4/5 to 4.5/5  Disappointing - carne asada. I found it lacked flavour (maybe because I asked for no avocado?). 2.5/5  Dessert - flan. 3/5. This was a very dense flan with dulce de leche on top. If you enjoy creamy and very sweet desserts, this would be right up your alley. Unfortunately, it wasn't to my taste.  Service - 4/5. Servers were all very nice and accommodating.   Ambiance - 3.5/5. Maybe it was because we were in the back room, but it was pretty cold and half way through our meal our server came by to set up a space heater to help warm up the room.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food, even without avocado! :) That is sometimes a challenge when eating Mexican. I really encourage you to drop by this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Great little taco place with authentic mexican style tacos.    A tad on the expensive side, but very good.    some of the tacos are very spicy....  almost killed me.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tiny portions! And not enough menu options for vegetarians/pescatarians. If you're vegan the only item on the food menu for you is guacamole lol. We came on a Friday night around 8pm without a reservation and got extremely lucky to be seated right away. Super packed in here, and pretty loud, so definitely make a reservation for the busier nights if you plan on coming and probably not the best place to come to try to catch up with someone because you really have to yell across the table to be heard.   The price range here is higher than many other Mexican places, like Wilbur Mexicana that's a block or two east. The guacamole was fresh, but tiny for $8. The only vegetarian tacos on the menu last night were poblano ones with cheese and cream $5/taco. Again, super basic and I found it odd how they served my partner these one at a time (he ordered 3) lol. I love shrimp tacos, but these were not on the menu and the only seafood one they had was a beer battered branzino. So instead I ordered the ceviche $15, which was pretty spicy and salty! Although small, it did come with a cup of pita chips and I found it sufficient more or less for the night.  Service was spotty - nice server, but he was covering way too many tables, so we rarely saw him. Had to ask for napkins and never did get that water refill.   Next time partner and I will source our tacos from elsewhere, like El Local Loco (the shrimp tacos there are great!)."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 9/10 Drink: 9/10 Service: 10/10 Value: 9/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 9/10  The service here was great, courteous and attentive. Nothing to complain about.   Food ordered: Guacamole: I wasn't overly impressed by the guacamole, it just didn't stand out. 7/10 Ceviche (Shrimp): The ceviche more than made up for the guacamole, the jalapeños giving it just the right kick but not too spicy. The tartness was just right, and really brought out the taste of the shrimp. 9/10 Pescado (Fish): Probably the best taco here, really crispy and flavours are on point. 9/10 Bistec (Rib-eye): Good all around beef taco, flavours were good. The beef was a little too chewy. 8/10 Barbacoa (Lamb): The texture and taste was just right. It was also the least messy out of all the tacos. 9/10 Camarones (Shrimp): The shrimp was cooked well and the sauce was great, but there was a bit too much and it overpowered the shrimp. 8/10 Costilla (Spicy Beef): This has a good amount of heat on it, but it was a bit messy to handle and the flavours didn't combine as well as I would've liked. 8/10  This place has some of the best tacos in the city. If I want Barbacoa, this is probably the best. It offers a great variety of tacos and they're all well done. I just wish they had lengua tacos.  We had beer, and margaritas. Nothing to complain about for the Margarita, it was good. I do appreciate the tin mugs that the beers came in, just adds a refreshing experience.   The decor is simple and chic. The centerpieces are small and simple, so you're not fighting for space.  I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in Toronto. Without question.   The tortillas are house made, the flavors are incredible and the margaritas are perfect.   The Pescado is my go to but you literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Go with some friends and order one of everything. You can thank me later.  Great food, great vibe, great time. Stop reading this review and just go.   Honestly wish Yelp had a sixth star to give cause Campechano would get it!"}
{"text":"I decided to walk into Campechano as I saw on blogTO they have a cute little patio in the back of the restaurant. We waited about 30 minutes and finally go table on the patio.   We ordered:  Guacamole and chips - guacamole was so fresh and seasoned well. The chips were fresh and not overly salted which went well with the guac. The other dip it came with was a bit on the salty side I think it might have been some sort of liquidity spicy salsa? I could be wrong. I would have preferred a more chunky salsa.   The tortillas for all the tacos were soft and held together well with all the toppings and sauces inside.   Costilla - Rib Eye beef - Flavour was okay, it wasn't anything special in my opinion and had a nice kick of heat. The meat was tender but overall a little on the salty side.   Pescado - They give a very generous portion of the fish, it wasn't overly battered and was still light and flakey. Probably one of the best ones. It paired very nicely with the pickled cabbage and sauce.   Pollo al pastor - Chicken was tender and the flavours were good. The sweetness and tartness of the pineapples helped cut the spice and also the saltiness.   Carnitas - The pork was a little on the dry side, which I didn't really enjoy. It was way too salty for my liking and lacked other flavours.   Bacon and mushroom one - forgot the name - The best one by far - the mushrooms were so fragrant and paired so nicely with the little bits of bacon. There was a nice light dusting of cheese and a creamy white sauce. Not your traditional flavours for tacos but very tasty!   Overall I think many of the tacos were too salty. The place itself is really cute and very busy. Not sure I would go again as I feel like there are better taco places in DT."}
{"text":"Finally i came to this restaurant. The menu is limited, just tacos. When i arrived there were not guacamole anymore, so i tried 3 tacoscostila, carnitas, barbacoa.. three of them were very delicious. Carnitas was a little bit oily for me. Barbacoa was very very spicy that i couldnt feel my lips after eating it  i had margarita with food. I give 4 out of 5 for tacos, 3 out of 5 for margarita.."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Toronto, I searched fruitlessly for a great taco place.  Sure, you'll find plenty of hipster North America style tacos joints with their bulgogi variations and endless hot sauces but nothing beyond the mediocre.  And then Campechano opened up on Adelaide and I was blown away.  Authentic corn tortillas packed with an array of incredibly tasty choices on their small but ever changing menu.        The best tacos in Toronto bar none.  It doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Great ceviche and tasty tacos. The tortillas were cold though and the chips would taste better if they were warm (like at Playa Cabaña). Good service and cheerful music. The place is small and gets packed really fast. Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Get there early.  Space is tight. But the food is amazing.    Also make sure you have cash on you - no Credit Cards."}
{"text":"Tacos are by far one of my favourite things to eat. I love how messy it is, the toppings and the different meats. Tortilla's should be made fresh and in house and the meats have to be tender and juicy.   I walked into Campechano not really knowing what to expect. It's a small causal taco spot on Adelaide and Portland, I honestly would have walked right past it. We sat in the back on the patio which I really liked. We decided to forgo the usual Guac and Chips starter and go straight for the Tacos.   Service here is great. Each taco comes out as soon as it's made. I ordered the Carnitas, Chicken Thigh & Bisteca Tacos. The Bisteca was good, I really liked the sauce on top, the tortilla is fresh and definitely made in house - I wish the meat wasn't as chewy as it was but overall I liked it. The chicken thigh was good minus the thigh, there were a few fatty pieces but I ignored that because of the spicy pineapple topping. My favourite taco was the Carnitas. It had a delicious smoky flavour and the meat was perfectly cooked.   I would definitely come back. 3 tacos cost me 20 buck which in my opinion is not bad.   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"Great tacos with a good spice level! The food at Campechano is tapas style and they have a wide range of tacos.   The guacamole is served with a side of spiced nachos - they were a little dry and stale, but the guacamole was fresh. The ceviche is an European bass, with a nice kick of spice as well. I ordered the fish taco which was freshly deep fried and simply delicious.   The restaurant has a patio with outdoor seating, as well as bench like seating for larger groups. Unfortunately, the service is not as great as the food thus meriting a 3 star."}
{"text":"I had 4 different tacos and they were all excellent, my favourite being the tinga de pollo. The shrimp taco is fairly spicy.  Service was good, with the tacos served one by one, not all at once.  The price range should be changed from $ to $$, it's not cheap. They take only cash and debit."}
{"text":"Ordered a guacamole to share, a couple tacos each, and a couple horchatas to wash them down.   The guacamole was small, and according to the waitress, one whole avocado is used to make it, which is why it fits in a ramekin w/ room to spare. Since avocados are on sale at Metro, 5 for $3, I'm assuming the huge markup is to pay for the huge amount of time and effort needed to make guacamole. After all, if it was so easy and quick  to make, they'd make it fresh right at your table, right? /sarcasm Taste was about as good as you'd make at home.  Campechano taco: basically the everything taco, tastes good, but make sure you specify a spice level since the default is about medium which could be spicier than you'd like as my SO learned.  Braised lamb taco: better than the campechano IMO, it was the daily special. It was also pretty drippy and could've benefitted from an extra tortilla.  Horchata: needs more cinnamon and a bigger serving would be nice. It's rice water after all.  Tl;dr: pricey Canadian influenced tacos in a painfully hip interior served by organic, locally grown servers. No al pastor, carnitas, cecina de res or fish tacos. $6 guacamole. For my taco fixes, I'd probably go elsewhere, or I'd just stick to the tacos and maybe a Mexican Coke."}
{"text":"Service was good. The tortilla shells were amazing! Funny how we were still talking about the tortillas the next day. Too bad what was on top of one of the best tortillas we've ever had wasn't amazing.  The problem was that the tacos that we had - lamb, rib eye,  fish, shrimp. They lacked a certain finesse and most importantly,  texture.  -the lamb was perfectly lamby. Very down homey and barrio style. I'm fine with the fact that there wasn't anything else on the tortilla but the braised lamb.   -the rib eye was greasy. Like oily. The flavours were good. No contrasting textures with whatever else was on there.  -the fish was not the best. It was limp, and boring. At $7 that's too pricey for such a blah taco. La Carnita, Grand Electric and even El Asador have way better fish tacos for under $5.  -the shrimp taco was a hot mess. Says in the menu that it's spicy.  It's not. Had all sorts or pineapple on it. Too much. Was too sweet. We overheard our neighbours on the patio say the same thing.  We also had some sort of tuna app. No texture as well. Tuna mixed with some sort of orange mayonnaise without flavour, topped with a whipped guac and some shredded iceberg lettuce on top. Poor tuna. It deserves better than that. Couldn't taste the fish. Mush on top of mush.  Service was was good. Good thing I tip for service and not food."}
{"text":"3.5*. Pretty good! I still prefer Wilbur around the corner, but this place was decent, and is definitely a King West-area spot you should try at least once! We arrived around 6:30 PM on a Friday night and it was very busy. We reserved in advance and we were seated right away.   First, ambiance and service. Good, attentive service, but almost to a fault. Our server tried very hard to upsell their menu, even though we clearly tried to tell her we didn't want to order anymore. Ambiance was casual, lively, with a very neighborhood/community feel to it - some tables are pretty close together, so it makes for a nice intimate environment.   Second, the food. We ordered Guacamole ($6.00) to start, and 3 tacos (Tinga De Pollo ($4.75), Bistec ($4.75), and the Campechano ($5.00)). Overall, pretty good but not the best. We've definitely had better guacamole elsewhere - it lacked flavour and value to portion size wasn't the best. The tacos were decent and portion size was fine - our favourite was the Bistec. Good flavour, but not the best tacos we've had.  Overall, a good spot for a nice casual dinner out - the place was full of families, couples, and groups of friends. It's a nice spot for a nice easygoing meal."}
{"text":"Everything tastes as good as it looks and they really know to set the mood. They have perfect-sized starters, tacos, and quesadillas. The vegetarian/pescatarian options are mouth-watering (ie. rajas, camerones, and pescado). If you're looking for a refreshing beverage, the jamaica really quenches that thirst. To put the cherry on top, the staff are amazing and the prices are extremely reasonable!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in the city. The space is light and airy and the service is great.  Each time I come I try to order something new but I always have to have the costilla taco - it is so spicy and delicious! The drinks are fantastic as well - I highly recommend the pineapple mojito. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday, the atmosphere is very cozy and the waiters are friendly. I've had many fish tacos in my life and their fish tacos (pescado tacos) are definitely on my top 3 list. The fish taco had the right amount of zest, crunch and flavour. They serve one taco to you at a time to ensure each taco is warm before eating. I did also try the portobello mushroom taco, not my favourite but an interesting flavour. The dessert was also very good, we had the tres leches a vanilla cake soaked in milk - sooo delicious! Would highly recommend if you're into tacos and want to try another restaurant. I don't eat meat but many of my friends really liked the al pastor taco (meat taco) as well!"}
{"text":"Favourite taco place in the city. Delicious and fresh. Service is good, prices are good, food is amazing!! A definite must go when and if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Venue - seating in front and back, although slightly tight. Great ambiance, with low lighting. Not loud like La Carnita - perfect if you enjoy hearing what others are saying.   Service - good, attentive.   Food - While i do think Toronto is getting taco'd out (Mexico has so so much other delicious offerings..why we are still stuck on this taco thing is beyond me), Campechano does try to set itself apart with the quality of their tortillas. Unfortunately I've been spoiled and have been to some great places in Mexico (if you are ever in Oaxaca, go to Itanoni...those are tortillas to rave about!), so while yes the tortillas here are slightly better than those thin discs served in some places, the offerings failed to blow me away.   Had the Raja con crema - was okay nothing memorable, very creamy (side note - unattractive to eat...not an ideal date night choice lol).   Quesedilla - they only had the Sencilla which is just Oaxaca cheese that nihgt. This should have highlighted the tortilla, but I wasn't blown away. It just seemed a tad over priced for a tortilla with Oaxaca cheese in it.   Price - slightly more pricey than similar taco joints."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The tacos and quesadillas were delicious- they literally came off the grill and were so hot and fresh. We loved the guacamole and ceviche (halibut), too! The tortillas are made in house from imported Mexican corn- they are super authentic. This place gives the other taco joints in Toronto a run for their money. It's a really cute date spot too- candlelit/soft lighting, amazing mural when you walk in and super trendy decor. The servers are really cute and nice too!"}
{"text":"Bright, bustling, clean and friendly. Let's add not expensive to boot!  Wandered in for lunch on a Wednesday mid afternoon while shopping nearby. We had: Doors with chicken Chicken, pork and rib eye tacos Guacamole. All were enjoyed by all, but the rib eye taco was exceptionally yummy. So juicy.  Be prepared to get a bit messy. The chicken is a bit spicy but my kid liked it any way."}
{"text":"Great place iffffff they are open.  They close randomly and while I used to recommend this place to people, I don't anymore because there is no guarantee they will be open"}
{"text":"Just a quick note.  Me and my father arrived at 2:31 and were denied service.  My father has a bad leg and cundo only walk slowly. I send so many people to your establishment when asked what the best tacos in the hood.  They could of been a little lenient. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and incredible service. They fit a big dinner reservation last minute and were incredibly helpful. Food is absolutely delicious! The quesadillas were probably my favourite but honestly, everything I tried was exceptionally good :)"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious taqueria in such a cute spot! Went on a Friday night, the place was packed and had sangria, ceviche, guacamole and tacos! Would definitely go again, fun upbeat energy and the food was made with love."}
{"text":"There's a tremendous amount of competition in the Toronto taco space, and Campechano's entry is one that has been designed to appeal to the general broad tastes in Toronto.  That's not a detriment to the restaurant, either. The sometimes-maligned Tex-Mex is still a success story in America, and California-style tacos are, without question, one of the great fusions of culture (don't @ me).  My order at Campechano included two tacos and a drink: the Pollo Al Pastor, Bistec, and a Mexican Old Fashioned.   Overall, my experience was decent - I had the Pollo Al Pastor first, and was impressed with it. The salsa, a thicker, creamier, and certainly more American style, was well spiced, and added a great kick to the taco. I missed the crispness I have come to expect out of Pork Al Pastor, but no worry - this was a solid entrant as well.  The Bistec, meanwhile, was too strong on many fronts: too salty, too spicy, and with too much that wasn't meat. While the spice worked well with the Al Pastor, to have a similar spice for the Bistec was a letdown.  When picturing a Bistec taco, I picture a slice of meat on top of a tortilla, with a side of salsa. Now - my ideal is far from what a Bistec taco SHOULD be. But Campechano's version of the Bistec was not executed with enough restraint, making for an overall mediocre taco.   To me, Mexican and its American variants are hands-down one of the greatest cuisines in the world. Part of what makes it great are the complex flavours and spices, something that I missed here.   Importantly, the tortillas here were quite good - but a taco like the Bistec made it difficult for them to shine. Corn tortillas, just the way I like it.  Lastly, the Mexican Old Fashioned was nice and spicy, and was generally a pleasure to sip."}
{"text":"Drove downtown yesterday to eat with my hubby. Asked him to pick a restaurant I haven't tried, he chose Mexican.  It's a tiny little joint, and very busy.  They took our name and phone number saying that it could be a 15-40min wait.  They texted us about 20mins later to tell us that a table was ready.  They have a small and simple menu.  We ordered the guacamole with tortillas chips and five different tacos (the Bistec - sirloin cap, Chorizo - sausage and potato, Tinga de Pollo - chicken, Pescado - fish with coleslaw, Costilla - spicy ribeye).  The guacamole was chunky and you could taste the various ingredients (e.g., avocado, tomato, lime, etc.) and the tortillas chips were absolutely delicious!  They bring you more tortillas to finish your dip if you want them.  I've had tacos at other restaurants and they're always dry.  This place has they're on flavourful sauce combinations for the different tacos so that they're not dry. Love it! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile. My friends and I decided to check it out one Friday. It gets busy so definitely recommend making reservations! What can I say about this place? Love the atmosphere for sure. It smells good in the restaurant too. Even the washrooms were super cute and clean. They had candles lit on the tables and in the washroom which for some reason made everything seem better?  Anyways onto the food and drinks. Friends and I shared sangria, good typical sangria. I also tried the pineapple mojito I think it was, and it was so good! Our table ordered about 2-3 tacos each. I'd say for myself 3 was good enough. We also shared the ceviche appetizer. I would have to say the tinga was so good, the chipotle shrimp, and I also had one of the beef ones which I can't remember but they made it mild for us. Some of them were still spicy but it had a good kick. They are a bit on the salty side though.   Will definitely be back. Really enjoyed our dinner. Saw some big groups there so I'd recommend for a large party! Ps. They also have a patio but didn't get to see how big or nice it was."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service and some seriously good tacos. I really liked this place. Simple concept, tightly composed menu of tacos done well.  If ur looking for a quick bite a great option."}
{"text":"A few notices: - cash and Canadian debit only (should not really impact too many people) - no reservations   Food (4.5 stars): + very high quality tacos. - expensive. Tacos range from 4.50 to 6.50 Each portions comes with a single taco.   I ended up ordering european fish taco (4.5 star) and a shrimp taco.  The shrimp taco (3 stars) was super spicy but tasty.  The fish taco was good.  I also ended up ordering and splitting guacamole (5 stars) as well.  The bill came to $15 before the tip.   Atmosphere (4 stars): The atmosphere is very simple and cosy, the front room with the open kitchen has seating for around 20 people. There is also a backroom is a bit more spacious with 3 tables for 6, and one table for 2.   This is not a great place for large groups, but a good place to go with a few people for lunch.    Service (5 stars): The waitress got us right away water with 2 bottles on the side so we can refill it ourselves.   After we ordered, she gave the appetizers first, then the first taco to everyone, then once we finished the second taco.  Due to the table not being super large this helped the dining experience."}
{"text":"Moved to Toronto recently and I've been trying every taco joint I can find; Campechano is in the running for the best so far! Every single taco I've tried has been flavourful and delicious.   My all time favourite taco is Carnitas, and at Campechano, they have a good one, just happens to be a bit too salty. If the chefs are reading this, please tone the salt down by 1/3, you'll have one of the best Carnitas taco in the country if you do!   Having said that though, the lamb leg taco was amazing. With the Pescado, you can't go wrong. So far every taco I've tried has been yummy! Definitely coming back, especially to keep checking that salt level of the Carnitas :p"}
{"text":"Their tacos are some of the best in Toronto. The lamb taco is amazing...The tortillas are homemade and it makes all the difference. I highly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Came for all the positive reviews on yelp but this place didn't really impress me.  First, their service is not bad but definitely lack of organization skills. We called the place at 5:30 or 6 pm, see if it's possible to make a reservation at 7pm. But we were told that the place gets really busy on a Thursday night, so they didn't let us make a reservation until 8:45 pm and surely that's so late for a dinner! So me and my friend decided to show up at 7:30 anyways, if we couldn't get a table we would dinning in elsewhere.   So we arrived the place at roughly 7:40, the dinning area (inside) was completely empty, and even the patio only has like 5 tables (two persons per table, so I0 customers?). I would not call this busy but perhaps they have a different definition in terms of busy.   The atmosphere though, is lovely. when you walked into the restaurant you would see most of the wall has hand paintings on. I found this pretty attractive. And sure this place would be a great spot to hang out and grab a drink.   It's nice weather so we sat at the patio, and between the two of us we had 5 tacos, two drinks and a guacamole to share. Their taco is average size and you probably would need 2-3 tacos to make enough for a meal.   Let's start with the guacamole ($8). I think it's a little pricy but I like how they had pomegranate seed in it, love that touch of sweetness. I found the chips thou, is a little too hard, but it's free to refill!! And I do end up liking the guacamole more than the tacos they served.   They only serve corn tortillas shell. And they only served two tacos at a time (one for each of us) so the table wouldn't be filled with plates as the tables there are tiny.   We had Bistec (sirloin), Carnitas (pork shoulder), Barbacoa (braised lamb), Camarones (shrimps) and Pescado (beer battered branzino, fried fish).   I think both Carnitas (pork shoulder) $5 and Barbacoa (braised lamb) $6.5, had the best value and they also tasted the best. Chunks of juicy meat, and the lime juice balanced out the flavour. But the lamb taste is a little plain, need a pint of salt perhaps to kick the fav more.   Bistec (sirloin) $7, slightly pricy. With this price I expected there would be a little bit more meat or the meat were not so grounded. They chopped up the meat into very small pieces, but I guess this is how people make authentic Mexican taco? But the most surprising part is, I'm pretty sure I ordered the non spicy  one. But one bite of this taco surely burnt my month and stomach. I admit I have a very low tolerance, but maybe they should warn others that even the non spicy sirloin taco is sort of spicy?   Camarones (shrimp) $7, the shrimp didn't came in a whole pieces but they chopped it up into small pieces! And the portion they gave this time was nothing like what the others post on yelp before. I'm sure there is probably only 2.5 -3 small shrimp in the taco. But that's not the worst part, this taco was another fire in the mouth. It was so spicy I couldn't even tastes what's in the taco honestly. They should really adjust the spicy level.   Lastly we had the Pescado (beer battered branzino, fried fish) $8. I think $8 is pretty pricey for taco and also because it didn't taste great. The deep fried layer was so hard,  it's almost like chewing fried cardboard. And pink pickle radish on top was super sour! I didn't like this at all. But I guess it was a mistake to order fried fish in a Mexican place, although the taco itself looks gorgeous.  I cannot say I'm a big fan of Mexican food or I really know what's authentic Mexican food, but I know next time if I want taco I would go seven lives and or else where. Just because they have better value. But this place for sure it's still a great spot to hang out."}
{"text":"It's a busy place with okay to good tacos. A bit pricey but the service is good and attentive. It's a hip place for youngsters on a first date or something, but not where you go if you want to sit very comfortably or talk quietly."}
{"text":"The tacos here are exellent - doesn't matter which one you get it will all be good. It is well priced as well. I would recommend making a reservation for this place as seating is very limited. We were also pleased with the service."}
{"text":"Slightly tucked away from the busyness of King Street, I would likely not have ventured up to Adelaide. And even if  I did, probably would have just walked by this joint without giving it another eye as the outside isn't as eye-catching. Glad I gave it a try because the food is definitely worth checking out, and would recommend others to come by!   My friends and I split the apps (guac and ceviche) - these were great! The halibut ceviche was very fresh. We also ordered one of each tacos, and a quesadilla as well. MMMM.   Their tortillas are home-made, and are so soft and so good. The fillings were plentiful and very tasty as well - the pork belly one (Campechano) is my favourite. The only thing though was the tacos were slightly too spicy for me... However since the business was new, the server noted that they were thinking of implementing a spicy level customization (hope to see that soon). Reasonably priced tacos at $4-5 each. You'd probably need 2-4 to be full.  We also split the two desserts offered at $4 each - the coffee flan and this frozen-ish cake (I cannot recall the name unfortunately). I'm not a flan person, but this flan was done very well. Loved the cake as well.   Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos was one of my top places for tacos, but now I'm adding Campechano to the list, if not even higher. Those tortilla shells!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good But they randomly close shop So fuck eating here  That's my review in haiku"}
{"text":"A new taqueria always draws my attention and when I read on A local blog that their current menu is gluten free I knew I had to go. Now.   We arrived early (6pm on a Friday night) and managed to score a table for two in the back before two groups of seven came in. We ordered one of each of the tacos and the cheese quesadilla. The tortillas were fresh, warm and flavourful. The grilled Oaxaca cheese on the quesadilla was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed all of the tacos and the house made chorizo was tasty. Our only complaint (from two people who enjoy a bit of heat) was that a few of the tacos had so much heat that it over powered the otherwise amazing flavour layers of the tacos. I also found the margarita small for $9 and far too sweet for my taste.   We will definitely be back to check it out again!"}
{"text":"Great service in a cozy place (too cozy imo) but just not my cup of tea.   I have to admit, I don't like corn tortillas even though it's authentic therefore, I didn't really enjoy the tacos or the chips that came with the Guacamole.  Tortilla aside, I didn't find the ingredients to be worthy of the price charged. For example, I ordered grill chicken ($6) expecting chunks of chicken but instead, it came with ground chicken.  It didn't taste as good as I expected but the meat quantity was plenty.  Be careful of the rib eye taco, it's super spicy!!! The guac and portobello mushroom quesadilla were my fav.  As for dessert, there is only one item on the menu, slice of bread soaked in condense/custard milk with pineapple pieces on top. You can skip this and get better dessert else where."}
{"text":"If you hate Campechano's tacos, you don't know tacos....  ;)  Kidding aside, this place has some of the best carnitas I've ever had. Juicy, unctuous, with the right ratio of crispy bits. Also, pescado- OMFG. Crispy batter, pickled cabbage a great foil to the fish and avacado crema... I saw the face of God in these tacos. Hyperbolic? Just barely.  Seriously, if you're kicking around the Queen West area, go get some tasty eats at Campechano. Tacos and a damn fine margarita will be the cure to whatever crap this city may have thrown at you during the day."}
{"text":"The tacos are all made in house, fresh and flavourful toppings. The taco shells are made in house, I saw a chef working the masa. Amazing tacos, I tried 4 and they were all good. This place is going to be one of my taco go tos in the city"}
{"text":"Great food, tiny space, friendly service, amazing sangria. The only con would be how loud the music was; difficult to talk."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive because I love tacos SO much and didn't want to get my hopes up. Thankfully Campechano is awesome. The restaurant is nice and cozy with super loud music that didn't irritate me for some reason and only accepts cash and debit.  The earliest reservation I could make online was for 9:45 pm on a Saturday and we were out of there in 35 minutes! I would recommend making a reservation as they were a lot of people waiting for tables on our way out.  The food came out as it was prepared and they timed it perfectly so my husband and I each had a plate in front of us. The tacos were just so good - juicy meat, perfectly seasoned sauces, the right amount of messiness. I'm so in love with these tacos.  My ranking from what I tried this visit: beef cheek (juicy and flavourful), campechano (I love chicharon), pescado (perfectly deep fried fish, salty sauces) and the sope without meat (kind of whatever except for the nice soft, doughy base). My husband said the barbacoa was his favourite but he didn't order the beef cheek so what does he know? :P  We ordered two cocktails - pina mojito and spicy margarita - and then shared them because each was good and went well with some tacos over others. The pina mojito goes well with the lamb tacos and is as equally refreshing as the spicy margarita (yes, it's SPICY).  With two cocktails, seven tacos and one sope the bill with tip was around $80.  We will definitely come back for a chill date night, small birthday party or to try out the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Campechano Taquería makes their tortillas from scratch and tops them with a variety of moist, flavourful, mouth-watering meat options that are good enough to satisfy my tastebuds. There's a cool, intimate vibe in here during the lunch and dinner hours that I personally find very inviting. They've got a decent selection of beverages to wash your meal down with, including beer. Be prepared to stuff your face.  Must-try items: Guacamole Tacos: Tinga de pollo (chicken breast), Barbacoa (braised lamb leg), Bistec (sirloin)  The tacos range from about $4 to $7, but come in generous portions that are well worth the price. On an empty stomach, just 2 or 3 tacos might leave you stuffed. The staff here are friendly and attentive, and the food comes out rather quickly. I'd put this spot on my list of top 5 places to get tacos in the downtown area, for sure."}
{"text":"Sure, I haven't tried every taco joint in Toronto, but I've hit all the major players. That makes me feel pretty confident in saying that the tacos at Campechano at the best tacos in Toronto.   I love that the menu offers more than 3 standard style tacos. I also love that the tacos are legit tacos and not some sort of weird hybrid taco/sandwich/nacho type situation that I've come across at other restaurants (coughLaCarnita). Yes, they're slightly more expensive than other tacos, but you're paying for quality. On top of the serious taco game, you can also enjoy decent cocktails and Mexican beers."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos, homemade tortillas, non-hipster atmosphere and reasonable prices.   Reminds me of Empellon in NYC more than any other Mexican place here. The set-up is equally conducive to dinner with friends or dropping in late night at the bar (once they get their license).   I hope it does well so I'm giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"This taco restaurant recently opened just up the street/around the corner from Valdez, Gusto 101, and other popping King Street favourites, on the quieter corner of Adelaide and Portland. It's a small, cozy establishment that is bursting with personality - bright murals on the wall, and the entire time my friends and I were there, they were playing the most fantastic reggaeton jams, so good times abounded.  Their menu is pretty small right now (about 6 different tacos and maybe 4 different quesadillas), so if you come with a medium to large sized group, you can try pretty much everything. With two other friends, I tried the following:  Apps: guacamole and ceviche - These both came as decently sized portions, lots of nacho chips on the side, and were good for sharing. In the end we even requested for a refill of chips, which they gladly obliged for free. The guac was very fresh (although could have used a bit more seasoning), while the ceviche was a little heavy on the vinegar or lemon juice or whatever they put in there, as there was a bit more sourness than I was expecting. It wasn't bad though, and the fish, which I think was halibut, seemed decently fresh. The nacho chips might have also been made in-house, because they were very crispy and fresh, although had a bit too much salt on them.  We ordered a whole bunch of tacos and one quesadilla. In the end I tried two tacos: one with pineapple, shrimp and chipotle sauce, and the other one was the vegetarian taco with corn, mushrooms and peppers, which I got on the recommendation from the restaurant owner. I enjoyed both of them - both were delicious and flavourful, and tasted very fresh. I really do think the vegetarian taco was the most unique I've ever had... it almost felt/tasted like I was eating cream of mushroom soup wrapped in a taco shell. Very interesting, I will say that, but it tasted good. The taco shells used were AMAZING though, they were thick and doughy and not dry at all... apparently they make them by hand here, starting by grinding the corn themselves and everything. SO GOOD.  We saved enough room for dessert just so we could try the two they had on the menu - flan, and a lemon cake of some sort. I really really enjoyed both of them! The flan was a bit unique, because as the owner explained to us, it was a bit denser than a normal flan and kind of a cross between a flan and panna cotta... like almost like a mousse cake. But it really worked for me, because I don't like it when the texture is too runny or custard-y, so this really hit the spot, and it was also not TOO sweet. The lemon cake was very zesty and refreshing, had almost like a meringue or pavlova-like texture (which I normally don't like), but it had enough cake-iness to it that I was able to enjoy it.  Overall, I REALLY enjoyed my meal here. Everyone working here was super friendly and very attentive, and as other Yelpers mentioned, the vibe is just chill and totally unpretentious, which was very refreshing. Since the place is fairly new, they are still working out some kinks and are very open to suggestions - we suggested that they either put sauce on the side or offer different levels of spiciness, because most of us found the sauces they used to be too spicy. I absolutely would come back here again though, as there are plenty of other tacos and quesadillas which I want to try! Also prices are very reasonable, as tacos are between $4-6 max each. I ended up paying around $20 for two tacos, splitting the apps with my friends, a juice/agua, and splitting desserts. All in all, a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"These are the only tacos worth eating in Toronto.  My biggest worry about moving to Toronto was the taco situation. It's dismal. People think hard shell is a legitimate option. There's nothing but Olde El Paso in the grocery stores. We need to work on getting some more immigrants from Central/South America, because this is a disgrace.  This would not necessarily pass muster in Sunset Park, but I can't just fly back to New York every time I want a taco. Campechano's is the only game in town for me.  I am confused about the other reviews here. Yes, other taco places in the city are probably cheaper, etc. but they are garbage. All these people complaining that their tacos are too spicy...it's true you'll be better off with your hard shell mild salsa nonsense. Those Taco Tuesday happy hour specials just make me sad. The things La Carnita serves up are pretty tasty, but they are not tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok but can definitely find better choice in downtown, some of them are really spicy!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place so went to check it out. The ambience is good, the service is ok, but the food and margaritas were soso. My biggest complain is the guacamole. Not enough chips are served. And they were not whole chips. We had to ask for another order of guacamole. I tried the beef and the fish tacos and they were average. Overall, not sure what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Cute place. Great casual atmosphere. The beef tacos had a nice flavour but are way too salty. I like salt but this was so much that I won't go back. Fix this and you've got a great place."}
{"text":"Came here Wednesday dinner time with a friend, and we were seated without waiting. I am actually intolerant to tomatoes and dairy, so the only item I could have was their fish taco. I kind of expected I wouldn't be able to eat most things, which I was okay with!  I ordered 2, and I wish I had 3! The taco shell itself was delicious, the fish was fried nicely, it had a good portion of cabbage on top, and it came with guacamole/chipotle sauce.   I only wish they had more variety on their food menu apart from guac/chips, ceviche, 2 sopes, 10ish tacos, and a pie. But that's only because I have dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"This place definitely has potential!   Went on a whim on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty busy. Nice staff, great atmosphere - chill and not pretentious, and would probably be a fun date spot.    The tacos were fairly tasty, but the taste was overpowered by the saltiness. It would be nice if the tacos had two shells instead of one, but the filling portion is pretty generous, so it's not that big of a deal.   The ceviche was a-mazing!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Portland Street strip.  Replacing the fading Sadie's, Campechano delivers a great fresh product at a reasonable price point.  For about the same price as the higher turnover Mexican inspired restaurants in the area, you can stop here and get a great fresh taco lunch for ~$10-15.  I tried the signature Campechano and Crema tacos, both were excellent and delivered to the table as soon as they were ready.  The flavours remained relatively simple and crisp; and dishes are offered without extraneous salsas or sauces, as it should be.  Service was great and incredibly friendly.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I grew up in Nova Scotia, so my love of affair with real tacos has been a slow burn. I still sometimes ask for sour cream, embarrassing my Californian husband, I still sometimes wish ground beef was the norm and I still think mole sauce is pretty silly. However, slowly but surely, I've come to appreciate a good taco, and the goods at Campechano Taqueria are great.   I popped in for lunch with 3.5 friends and we snagged a lovely table at the back. This place gets pretty pretttty busy at lunch and dinner, but I still felt like we had our own personal space. I was feeling bold, and told the server to bring me three of his favourite tacos. He #blessed me with a pork, fish and finally steak. The pork was my favourite. So saucy and salty, with hints of spice and lime. Delicious. Next time I'm going to order two of those bad boys and try the shrimp. My friend Kent P was positively giddy about his damn shrimp taco."}
{"text":"I visited Campechano on a warm friday night on the first day of fall so i was able to sit on the patio.  We ordered the guacamole to share.  It was a small portion.  It needed some lime juice and i would have liked some cilantro.  Its served with heavily salted house made tortilla chips.  I also ordered the carnita tacos which was pretty much just shredded pork.  Also heavily salted but the flavour wasnt too bad.  I then tried the camarones tacos.  Chipotle coated cut up shrimp with pineapple.  Again a bit too salted for me.  The menu is limited to ceviche and tacos mostly.  For my taste it was heavily salted but i suppose when you are drinking beer it goes down better.  I had grapefruit soda to balance it.  Its a very out of patio in between King and Queen St"}
{"text":"I live in LA, born and raised in Southern California, so without meaning to I get a little condescending about Mexican food in other parts of the country.  And then I stumble on this place!! Oh man, this is a must if you're looking for amazing Mexican flavors. Start w the chicken taco and then go from there. If that doesn't change ur life, I'm not sure what to make of u. I'll be back here every time I'm in TO!"}
