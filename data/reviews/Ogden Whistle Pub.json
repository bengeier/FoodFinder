{"text":"We went to Lynnwood for dinner last night before another event.  The food was pretty good, very reasonably priced, and I was super-impressed with the service.  Wish I'd thought to ask for the server's name, as she did a great job."}
{"text":"We've gone here a few times when we didn't want to make the trek to Mug Shotz, which is always horribly busy. Lynnwood Station isn't fancy by any stretch of the imagination but the wings are decent, the servers remember what we drink and the price is right. Two orders of wings, a small veggie plate, onion rings, one draft and clamato, and 2 or 3 glasses of wine and the bill comes in between $26-30. Can't beat that with a stick."}
{"text":"A pleasant little neighborhood dive bar in Ogden. $5 draft at the most, $10 triple well drinks on saturday night, and the food there isn't too bad. Also, please take note that a dress code is in effect: no colors or patches are allowed."}
{"text":"Went to there Jam today, very impressed with the talent. Good Pub food, reasonably priced and friendly staff."}
