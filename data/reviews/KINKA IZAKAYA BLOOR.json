{"text":"Can I get a Whopper? Not anymore...

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.

Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...

This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.

With that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.

Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.

A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a souffl√© of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.

One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.

Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it."}
{"text":"Personally I prefer the church izakaya over this, but my friend argued sakabar has a better selection of drinks. The two locations do have different menus, and I've found izakaya to have a better selection and choices to go over. Another thing that kinda bugs me about sakabar (in addition to a longer waitline) is that, its the only restaurant I've been to in Toronto that asks for my ID. By all means totally understandable, just kinda an hassle when I'm aggressively looking through my bag."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  The hour wait (you can go to another bar and they will call you when your table is ready) is worth it.  Other Izakayas try, but you cannot beat the atmosphere at Guu.   And giant ice cold  Sapporo.  Enough said."}
{"text":"I was so sad to find out that Guu was gone! But then super relieved that the restaurant still exists, just under a new name!  I was there last night, love that you can make reservations online now, and two hour seating limit is more than enough time. 

I love this location because of the pillow seats.  It's quieter in that area and very cozy.  Brie Cheese is my favourite (the mango and berry sauce is delicious), as well as the Carbonara Udon and the Kinoko Bibimbap.  Everything is really tasty!  I recommend getting a bowl of white rice too. 

Frozen grapes when you get your bill, is a very nice touch :)"}
{"text":"It's pretty clear from previous reviews this place is absolutely fantastic. I've been several different times, great for a little pre-birthday dinner if you're trying to get rowdy considering the noise level is usually pretty high (unless they put you in the backroom which is very quiet and perfect for groups of four). In terms of food items, Guu has several things that are simply fantastic. I get the deep fried chicken and calamari everytime I go. The calamari is maybe one of the greatest thing I've ever eaten in my life and I recommend asking for \"dark sauce\" in a small cup to go along with the chicken if you aren't crazy about the mayo sauce it comes with. Can't go wrong with a giant glass of Sapporo, the drunker you get the more willing you are to try new things and the more delicious said things are. Call forty five minutes to an hour before eating, ask them to put your name down on the waiting list, they will send you a text letting you know the table is ready. Fantastic system despite not being extremely accomadating in terms of reservations. I love Guu and so should you."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice staff, atmosphere doesn't live up to its Church location. The summer special on beers is really good though."}
{"text":"I signed up for a Yelp account just so I could review Guu SakaBar. It was so much fun and a delightful experience. We were greeted by all the staff as soon as we walked in. Service was attentive and very friendly. There was a very positive vibe among the staff. Everything was bustling and so interesting! The atmosphere is loud, so be prepared to raise your voice if you want to have a conversation over dinner. If you want a slightly embarrassing and hilarious happy birthday moment, go there. The whole staff gets involved and has a lot of fun with it! 

The food was great! It was our first time eating a bibimbap, so the server let us know a few facts about the dish. We also had the grilled Mackerel which was lovely and fresh (bones in, be careful), and the green bean tempura. It was all great.

The sharing sized portions are good if you want to go have a little taste of this and that! 

The whole staff also said goodbye as we left. This place truly made me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Best food. Best service. Best atmosphere. Always leave with a happy mouth and happy tummy and a smile on my face. When you walk in you're greeted in the most wonderful way. If you're celebrating something you get an even better greeting. Always a fun time at the Bloor and Church locations."}
{"text":"We used to come to this location a lot. It's been two years since I visited this location until today. I was pretty excited about today, but what a disappointment:
-Salmon tataki not fresh 
-Ebi Mayo, cannot taste the mayo, the shrimp wrapping is soft after fried? Does not taste like anything like it should be
-Seafood sakamushi, recommended by the staff. Extremely untasty. It has 4 small tomato in it, and about 5-6 clam that doesn't taste fresh, and two frozen shrimp. Yeah it's bad, might as well just boil them in the water
-Baked oysters: there's like 1/4 an oyster in each baked piece 
-Yaki Udon: my old all time favourite, taste nothing like it at all... 

I've dined at other two locations often in the past two years, but I must say this bloor store brought me nothing but disappointment today. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, this place was packed with a 45 minute wait. The atmosphere was electric and inviting. Our server was attentive and brought us a pitcher of Sapporo. Shared 7-8 tapas dishes amongst 4 of us. 
my favorites were oyster bake, pumpkin dumpling and spicy seared tuna.

Dessert with green tea cheesecake, almond pudding and japanese tiramasu was a nice way to end off the meal."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Guu since I figured with a second location the line up wouldn't be as horrendous as everyone makes it for the other location. Walked in on a Wednesday night just before 8pm and were seated immediately at the bar.  The line up throughout the night wasn't bad - I don't think any group waited longer than 10-15 minutes.

Couple of dishes killed it for me as salt and more salt seemed to be the underlying ingredient of the night. 

Had (in order):
Gindara (black cod with yuzu miso sauce) - enjoyed it. Soft, tender and lightly seasoned with the miso. 
Hotate Butter (baked scallop & mushroom in garlic butter) - liked this and the carb lover in me wished I had some crusty bread to sop up the garlic butter. 
Fried Brie Cheese - good and the mango sauce worked well in balancing the savoury cheese but one was enough for me. 
Kushi Age 5 Kinds Assorted (onions, potatoes, mushroom, bacon and ham) - all things fried in a crispy batter.  Fried bacon was awesome though salty and then I erroneously followed it up with the ham. Salt overload.  I think it killed my palate. 
Salmon Natto Yukke - salmon sashimi with 5 of its overly salty friends wrapped by yourself in nori seaweed. Salt overload. Ech. 
Sake Tiramisu - liked it and yes, you really taste the sake. There's a strong cheese flavour to it that my friend and I thought tasted more like cream cheese than mascarpone. 
Salmon belly sushi - my friend saw this being ordered a few times (we were seated at the sushi bar) so we ended up ordering it. Fresh and lightly torched, it would have been better between the Kushi Age & the Salmon Natto Yukke. 

They yell louder here than the ones in Vancouver and their version of happy birthday song/chant is pretty awesome since (of course) the entire staff is singing/yelling it out. 

Overall disappointed with a couple of dishes that made me want more water than anything else."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food menu is great when you just want to order a bunch of small dishes and talk with friends. The place can get kind of loud but I really enjoy the energy at this restaurant. 

One of the cool things about this place is they have a hard wooded area where you can't wear shoes.  I thought that was kind of fun."}
{"text":"It's too loud, the food's good - not great.I left hungry, even after spending 30 bucks on food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Sunday night. I wasn't expecting it to be too busy given that it was a Sunday, but I was dead wrong. Thank goodness I made resos first. I sat comfortably with my group as I watched the queue get bigger. If you're looking for a quiet dinner spot, this is definitely not it. The staff is super high-energy, and prompt. The service was excellent, and the food was even better! I highly recommend the Kakimayo, and a round of Sake, of course (when in Rome, do as the Romans do)."}
{"text":"Loved it. Loved everything about it! Fun night out with the bf and brother.  We ended up ordering some of the same items twice they were so good.
Fresh, tasty and fabulous atmosphere! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ambiance - 3.5/5
Food - 4/5
Service - 1/5

I really don't like Guu now. 

The service is horrible. I asked for a seat for three people and they gave me a table for two and the server just added another chair. It wasn't like they were busy this day. Also, Guu has been in business for awhile now.. they should know how to be efficient. 

The way Guu operates is strange...this is what I observed. The cooks yell out the dish they made...and any server who has a customer(s) who ordered the dish takes it. It doesn't matter who ordered it first. I observed this many times when the dishes I ordered were being brought to customers who came in later than me. So your dish may not show up for 30-40 minutes. One time, my friend waited over an hour. It was ridiculous.

The place might as well be a self service restaurant. This other time, a table beside me didn't get served for 30 minutes.. I gave them my menu because they weren't even given a menu for 30 minutes. 

The food is still tasty but I can't stand the service. 

In sum, this place is becoming a disappointment. I used to love this place two years ago.

Goodbye, Guu."}
{"text":"This is pretty much a complete duplicate of Guu on Church Street so food quality is pretty much the same, however I prefer the atmosphere at the original and the menu as well. It seems easier to get seated here as I have never waited to get in ( I don't know if the volume is lees now at the original). 
The service is not as good here either...and oh I would recommend not being seated in the smaller rom with sit down tables as the service is even slower.....customers are not visible there so stick to the main bar area."}
{"text":"I went there with a big group on a Saturday night and loved it. It's as high energy an atmosphere as possible for a restaurant. Friendly staff and good food. The mushroom and cheese bibimbap was excellent.

Some caveats:

- Portion size is on the small size given the price
- If you want to have a quiet conversation, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Would go back for the food, not the service. We were 2 dishes into our order, waiting for our 3rd dish and to order more. We waited 20 mins after we finished the remaining food on our table for our next dish, but it seemed like our waitress had forgotten about us. Even though at the beginning she came around every 5 mins.

So when she was serving the table beside us, we got her attention to order the next round of dishes and kindly reminded her about our takoyaki we'd been waiting for. She apologized for the wait and said that the food was on its way. Then we waited while before we realized she forgot again. We watched as other people who had come later than us get the same dishes we had ordered before us. In the end, we got our takoyaki and umagi bimbimbap, but it seemed like she brought the bimbimbap to another table and mixed it before realizing that it was not theirs and bringing the dish already half mixed to us. 

Maybe it was just an off-night and we were unlucky, but the experience was really underwhelming."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a number of times and I have never been disappointed by the food or the service. Dining here is such a unique experience! As you enter and leave the restaurant the entire staff greets you in Japanese. I always look forward to it and love the confusion on the faces of new unsuspecting customers as they enter the restaurant. The first thing you notice is the communal style seating and the loud buzzing atmosphere. The energy is great in here on a busy night! It gets pretty noisy with the many conversations going on at once, the music, and the servers and cooks shouting orders to each other in Japanese, but that's part of the fun.

I always have a great time eating here whether it's with a large group or an intimate one on one. Everything on the menu is amazing! The deep fried brie is one of my favourites. The smaller portions allow you to have a variety of dishes to taste. Definitely order some food from the specials menu as these items sell out fast and will not be around permanently.

The japanese style seating section is something I have yet to experience, but I will absolutely be returning to try this out and eat more delicious food. You definitely have to check this place out if you haven't already. I guarantee it will be one of the most unique dining experiences you'll ever have. Come as soon as the restaurant opens or come during the week to avoid a long wait for a table. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to start...

Me and my girlfriend came to town to visit and we saw on here that this place was very highly rated. Boy, was yelp right!

The food:

Fantastic. No, seriously, fantastic. Worth every penny. 

We started off with the Deep Fried Brie and Kakuni Pie (Deep fried pork belly). Needless to say they didn't last very long on our plates. Being in a gluttonous mood, we went for a round 2; this time getting Gyu Tongue (Anus Beef Tongue Steak) and Kinoko Bibimbap (Rice, Cheese and Mushrooms). T

he deep fried brie is a must, if you're a cheese person, you can't not get this. Gooey center with the awesome batter they use makes for a mouth watering combination. The pork belly was incredibly succulent, tender and so good even the fat was edible, which for me is a big deal. The Gyu Tongue was amazing as well. Very, very flavourful and presented very nicely. Now, the Kinoko Bibimbap was especially good; as the waitress called it, it was very risotto like. The cheese melts and the rice crisps in the sizzling bowl that it's served in. One of the dishes along with the brie dish that would say are must eats.

The staff:

Super, super nice people working here. It's really nice to be in an environment where they're speaking japanese between one another. Not only that, upon leaving they have, was seems to be pretty much the entire staff yell goodnight to you as you walk out the door. Which is always a nice way to leave the restaurant!

Summary:

Just eat here already!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. My friend and I were going to dinner and she suggested Guu. I was a bit nervous as I have never had Japanese food before.  I was a bit overwhelmed at the menu  as there are a lot of options. My friend and I shared five or six dishes including calamari, ribs, tried chicken and a sweet potato and egg dish. Every dish was AMAZING but the calamari was my favourite.  

I would suggest sitting at the bar so you're up close and can watch the food being cooked. The staff are all very friendly and create a really fun eating experience by loudly greeting everyone who walks in. I was very happily surprised when our bill came. The prices are very reasonable. 

I haven't been able to stop thinking about the food since I left. I cannot wait to go and try the Church street location next.

I would definitely recommend Guu to everyone!"}
{"text":"I'd held out on trying this place for a long time, mostly because I tend not to give into hype. But my partner decided to have his birthday dinner here this year, so of course I went along! Before going, I had called to see if I could bring along a birthday cake I had baked, but they were going to charge me thirty dollars to bring it in. It wasn't until later that I would realize how happy I was I didn't bring it along with me.

Call me a cranky old man, but this place was terribly loud. Not the ideal place for a party of 8 when you're trying to catch up with people. Be prepared to be able to talk to only the person sitting across from you. And even then you have to strain your ears to hear. The experience would have been way better had they toned down the music and the yelling and dimmed the lights a bit. As someone who is sensory sensitive, I was WAY over stimulated.

The service was meh! 6 of us ordered some food, but then the server just didn't take the other two people's orders (one of them being the birthday boy). We hadn't realized the mistake until after the food started coming that two people had not been asked for their order. 

Also, order your drink 15 minutes before you actually want it. That's how long it takes to pour a mug of  Sapporo I guess.

The food tasted great however. Until I found a long black hair in my deep fried brie. I'm not really someone who gets freaked out my hair in my food. Having worked in the food service industry, I take things like that lightly. However, it's something to note.

They did a cute little birthday song and brought over a tower of shots when we were done eating. I would have preferred cake for dessert, but I guess I might be biassed. My partner enjoyed the evening and that's what really matters. However, I won't be going back anytime in the near future.
I give it two stars."}
{"text":"I wrote off Guu Izakaya (Church St.) after three visits.  The first was really good, but second and third went tumbling downhill at an alarming rate.  Yeah, the atmosphere is energetic.  Sure, the open concept kitchen is entertaining.  FINE, the Sake Mojito is highly chuggable.  But, very quickly the food went very sub-par.

A year later, I had a dinner to attend at Guu Sakabar in the Annex.  I was not excited.  I ended up pleasantly surprised.

1. There was no wait for 4 people (eek!).  
2. The space is really impressively designed.  
3. It's mandatory shoes-off (in a particular section), which is totally fun. 
4. Our endearing server was literally a Japanese anime character.
5. The food was, for the most part, really, really delicious.
6. It was shockingly grossly affordable ($100+ tip - and we ordered tons).

Gomaae is an unexpected standout.  Blanched spinach with sesame sauce sounds like something your Japanese grandmother might make, but there are lots of complex flavours for a simple dish.  Bright green spinach has a hint of bitterness that balances well with sweet-yet-savoury sesame sauce. 

While I hatehatehate ordering from a \"Deep Fried\" section (please call it something that makes me feel less guilty?), I'd recommend Kabocha Korokke (pumpkin croquette) and Ikapiri (calamari).  The croquette is my favourite dish at Guu.  It's texturally interesting, with a crispy exterior and smooth interior.  It's sweet, smoky and savoury all at once.  And, it's smothered in a sauce that's reminiscent of Mac sauce from McDonald's.  While awkward to eat with chopsticks, it's worth the struggle.  The calamari is perfectly crispy and tasty.  It comes coated in sticky ketchupy glaze and finished with a wasabi mayo drizzle.  A bit more heat from the wasabi would have been nice.

I lovelovelove raw fish and rare meat, so I found the \"Cold Dishes\" to be stellar.  Maguro Tataki, seared tuna sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips is a dream that money can buy.  But, Gyu Carpaccio, seared beef carpaccio with the same garnishes previously mentioned plus the wasabi mayo we saw elsewhere is... Out.  Of.  Control.  The table fought for it, wolfed it down, and contemplated ordering another, but we chickened out.

Here's what I would avoid:  Edamame that's predictably standard, Seaweed Salad that's more watery lettuce than seaweed, Gingara, miso-marinated grilled black cod, that's bland, and Kinoko Bibimbap, a vegetarian rice dish, that never became crisp from the sizzling bowl it's served in.

The only true complaint I do have was pacing of the meal.  Guu enforces a 2-hour maximum mealtime, but we finished shy of an hour.  Our abundance of dishes could have been more thoughtfully paired, served, and spaced out.  It would have made a huge difference.

If you're going to eat at Guu, go to SakaBar in the Annex.  It's also a more mature and diverse crowd, beyond herds of Ryerson students fighting each other with textbooks for octopus balls."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The atmosphere is loud and fun.

However, with 5 at our table, (which had a reservation) we were asked to leave our table as we were finishing up our beers to make room for the next guests waiting.  We were there for just an hour and 20 minutes.  I had never been asked to hurry out of a restaurant like this before, especially when we were fully and rightfully at our table for dinner and drinks so it surprised me.  $180 before tip, by the way.

I asked how long we had for a table and reservation and the waitress said 2 hours.
So, you are over-booking, then asking the people finishing their meal to speed it up, rather than ask the people coming in to wait 5 or 10 more minutes?

Unprofessional.  Not likely to return, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. The food, especially the Karuge beef side ribs or the The deep fried brie, garlic mayo chicken dumplings deep fried, the octopus balls and the Kimoko Bibimbap are all out of this world good. Try a bottle of Choya, a Plum wine made from the Umi Fruit, or a Calpico or even a Ramune soda. The atmosphere, the food, the authentic japanese dishes. Highly recommended! The staff are super friendly, and waiting 30 minutes for a table on a saturday night when they're over capacity is pretty good. No shoes on the bamboo floor btw.

Everything about this place is amazing. If I had to describe it, it would be Japanese fusion food. Some of it is North American inspired, and some of it is very clearly 100% authentic japanese food. All of the waiter/waitresses are off the boat from japan, and can speak japanese 100% fluently. When you walk in, everyone stops what they're doing and shouts \"KO NI CHI WA!!\" and welcomes you with enthusiasm. Definitely a different restaurant. The general manager is almost always walking the floor asking people what they think. Guaranteed good first date if you take someone here fellas."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at KI Bloor Street. There were 7 of us and we started with the 35 dollar tasting menu. Its a ton of food, and all so tasty. Highly recommend this place. Would return to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"It's hard to see a favourite restaurant fall from it's pedestal in your eyes. I still remember the first years of opening. The food was delightfully  novel and delicious. It introduced a whole new type of place with new food and a new vibe. I loved it, went there about once a week and worked my way through the entire menu many times over. 

Now, it's been 6 or 7 years (I think) and I am torn. The food is still delicious but it's the exact same stuff! Not just the same type of stuff, it's the exact dishes. The menu is a carbon copy of what they have served since the start. Even the daily specials are predictable. On any given day, you will see fried chicken cartilage, lobster sashimi, tuna belly and salmon collar.

What really kills it is that the prices have risen so far so fast. I understand that inflation is a thing, but hawking the same dish for 40% more money is ridiculous. The crowd has turned accordingly and it's rare you see someone not celebrating, because you can't justify the expense any other time. 

I will still go back, just not when I am paying."}
{"text":"So many love Guu SakaBar, and I'm glad I went, but I wouldn't go back.

Went with a friend and sat at the bar, and though there was only two of us, the place was so loud we couldn't hear each other speak.  Not, a good place for a first date.  Perhaps a good place to go with someone with whom you have nothing to talk about?

I supposed that the incredible audio stimulation was meant to focus you on the food, as the conversation was necessarily limited.  But the food, which was expensive, and  tasty, was nothing particularly original or exciting.  It was good, but I didn't feel like it was worth the price.  

One dish failed to come for quiet a while and we tried letting the waiter know, but he couldn't actually hear us.  We had to ask for it three times."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in downtown Toronto.
Although it can get crazy with the 'screaming' staff (who are actually greeting customers that come and go), crammed tables (as you share a long communal table), and occasional birthday bashes, it's really all apart of the original Guu experience! And of course, the food is unbeatable.

What I really like about the SakaBar location is that they offer a more private, semi-open space in the right section of the restaurant, where you are required to take off your shoes and sit on bamboo flooring. If you want to be at somewhat of a distance away from the communal tables/screaming open-kitchen, and be able to carry on a normal conversation with your party, I would definitely suggest this space. Also better for families, kids, and the elderly. 

Now, the MUST-TRY, Guu-originals:

KINOKO CHEESE BIBIMBAP (fried rice with cheese, nori, garlic sauteed mushrooms)
KABOCHA KOROKKE (mashed pumpkin croquette with a full boiled egg inside! drizzled with spicy mayo)
KAKIMAYO (baked oysters with cheese, garlic mayo, spinach)
and so much more... the entire menu really...

Their cocktails are also incredible. I recommend the Bamboo and Lulu Melon (haha).  Don't forget to check out their daily special menus as well!

All in all, this place is a gem. Definitely one of the must-go-to restaurants of the city that really defines Toronto. The best izakaya experience you'll get!"}
{"text":"Good food but service was out of the window. 
Also, please do get servers who comprehend English and the basics of being a waiter. Also, people do check their orders and receipts, so we notice when you add items that we had told you to cancel"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city! 

Everything about it is amazing...from the service to the food to the facilities and atmosphere. Guu is most certainly deserving of 5 stars.

First off...the atmosphere/service: You're always greeted in Japanese upon entering by the lively employees. (If only I could understand what they say!) Seating has been quite quick here in my experiences but I can understand that at peak times it may not be like that. There are three different types of seating setups here...bar-style seating by the cooking area, communal-type tables and then another seating area where you remove your shoes in traditional Japanese-style and sit by a sunken table. I've never had the opportunity to sit in the latter area but it looks like fun! It is a very loud restaurant so not exactly the preferred location for a quiet get-to-know-you date. GREAT location for birthday parties, as they take pictures of your party and give you a chalkboard to scroll down the birthday girl/boy's name.

The food...AMAZING! You can't go wrong with your choices. I've never been let down! The bibimbap is a favourite of mine as are the kimchi udon noodles. Beer is cheap here too! The Sapporo always helps give it a more Japanese feel :)

The facilities...very clean! A coat hangar area is provided which is convenient but I'm always skeptical about leaving my belongings where I don't have a direct line of vision. I'm still scarred by a previous coat-stealing experience elsewhere one fateful night.  As for the washrooms downstairs...they are impeccably clean. Each stall has its own beautiful sink (I know, I focus on little things like that hahaa) and amenities including mouthwash and cups (nice touch!).

An amazingly Guu'd experience is had here ;) Run to Guu!"}
{"text":"Loud, lively, and amazing food. 

We ordered the bamboo sake, scallops, octopus salad, tofu, seared tuna, green bean tempura e.t.c Ate like champs and will def. return. My mouth is still watering."}
{"text":"Delicious! That is the best dinner I've eaten out in a long time. We had the sashimi on greens, rapini with garlic and soya sauce, and udon noodles with beef and mushrooms, and the sake tiramisu for dessert and they were all great.

Really loud though with the waiters shouting hello and goodbye to everyone (or I assume that's what they're yelling) and the club music - not a place to go for a relaxing dinner. Sitting at the bar makes it easier to hear each other."}
{"text":"Nice flavors, high energy, but service can be super slow.   
Bring a big group so you can try all the different flavors off the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Delicious, divine, scrumptious, orgasmic. 

I would recommend sitting away from the bar - you'll know why when you come and eat here. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go with friends and family. Though there have been multiple Izakaya places popping up all across the gta this is still the best. The food is always really good quality and typically service is fast. Although the potions sizes are small because they are meant for sharif , they are well worth the price. Usually when my friends and I go, it will come to 40-50$ per person including tax and tip. That is all of us being fuller than we can bear with a generous amount of sake and beer as well."}
{"text":"Try the shabu beef salad and the takoyaki"}
{"text":"I took my soon to be wife here on our first date nearly 5 years ago. The atmosphere was perfect and the loud (made her cuddle in close to hear me). We walked by it while we were doing our engagement photos in the area and asked if we could take a few photos inside with our photographer. The atmosphere was beautiful and the staff were incredible. We came back after to eat and the food was amazing. We love everything about Kinka. 
It really does make for a great first date place ...or 1000th date. 
Big thanks to all the staff there."}
{"text":"Having been to Guu Izakaya before, I anticipated a very long wait here but to my surprise my boyfriend and I only waited 10 minutes to be seated! (we were here on a Thursday at 8:30pm). We were seated in the area where you're sitting sunken into the floor on nice circle mats. Word of warning, be careful when sitting down! I nearly fell lol

We ordered a couple things, the most memorable ones were: 
udon carbonara - soooooo yummy! It's a must try
deep fried brie - very heavy but also very delish
baked oysters - two big oysters with all the fixings on top, after trying this, I realized I didn't like oysters so my poor boyfriend had to eat both. 
And we didn't order any fish =( (hint: read my reviews to find out why!)

The menu is significantly smaller than Guu Izakaya's which is bit of a downer because there aren't as many non-fish items. I would go to Sakabar only if I don't want to wait in line for too long and if I was with some friends so I could order their fish items.

Service-wise, they were a bit lacking but I'll give them a bit of grace since they just opened not too long ago. Our food came in two distinct rounds, one round we got 4 dishes.... and then after waiting a good 25 minutes our last 2 dishes came. Our server was really good at checking up on us and refilling water which was great. Apparently it was his first night working which was a surprise because we saw him guiding the other servers.

So give Sakabar a try if you're looking to experience Guu and don't want to wait in the cold!"}
{"text":"a really great dining experience. loved the food, the seating was different and fun,  even the washrooms are thought out well! i found it really fun, and very yummy. too bad they dont have grilled mackerel sushi but the plain fried mackerel was super yummm. pumpkin egg ball was good, pork belly too, bibimbop was amazing it had cheese mmm...just try a bunch of different things.
we went for a friends birthday, his first time there, and had a blast, even got to drink sake out of bamboo."}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff is friendly. I love the beef short ribs and Japanese pancake, fried chicken, and baked Brie. Also love taking my shoes off sitting on the floor cross legged and stuffing my face! Who couldn't??"}
{"text":"I came here with 5 of my girls on Friday night to celebrate a birthday and everyone was very impressed with the whole experience! I had my reservations as I am gluten-free and Asian food isn't typically the most gluten-friendly fare. Our super friendly and patient server (she was amazing) took the time and care to make sure I was aware of what was safe or not and made modifications when possible. 

Some reviewers are complaining about the size of the portions - remember it's a tapas-style restaurant, therefore portions are supposed to be small!! The 6 of us ordered a bunch of items to share including: the seared tuna, seared salmon (both were memorably delicious), the cheesy baked oysters (ordered that twice), BBQ pork tacos (didn't try but heard they were good), udon carbonara (again, didn't try but the rest found it delicious and it was a large portion), grilled steak (yummy, but very tough), plus many other dishes that I cant remember...

Half of us also got some sake and tequila shots, and got the staff to do the whole birthday charade which was fun. I thought it was so cute how they took a group picture of us which got uploaded right to their Instagram page! The total bill came to $200 including drinks (but before tip) which was not bad at all for 6 people! 

All in all, great experience and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This is an all around excellent dining experience. The social atmosphere, the physical layout, the staff and above all the food is extraordinary."}
{"text":"It was the second time I've visited the Guu. The food is good, however the portions are oh so limited. I spent 45$ and came home hungry. 
This is a good place to come for drinks with friends, but make sure you eat beforehand. 

Staff are very friendly, and promptly take your order. Service is quite fast, just make sure you make reservations (they now take reservations), otherwise, you'll be waiting for over an hour. 

Overall I enjoyed the experience, I just found them to be overpriced and they serve very tiny portions. So you won't get your bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday recently (my first time ever)  and had a great time! I love the atmosphere, very lively and they were playing 90's hip hop on Friday night (who doesn't love 90's hip hop?). Everything I ate was delicious and my friends all enjoyed their food as well. The portions are smaller so you can eat it all or share it all, either way you're left satisfied. The drinks were great as well. I got a Sake bomb which was accompanied by my friends and Kinka staff singing happy birthday, taking pictures and knocking on tables! Kinka knows how to celebrate birthdays guys. So if you're looking for great food, drinks and an experience I highly recommend this place. PS: booking a reservation was easily done online and their staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and it was nothing short of awesome! The food was on point, the energy level was high and the birthday celebrations were super enthusiastic. Sat in a more private area (shoes come off) and wasn't disappointed. It has a really authentic feel from the kitchen sounds to the decor. Noise level was a little louder than I'd have liked it to be, but almost exactly what I expected from an Izakaya anyway. They were really accommodating with dietary needs as well (lactose intolerant) and offered to either make something else or modify the menu. They also have the best birthday celebration I've ever seen! 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So far so guu'd!

Went for a quick bite to eat on a Wednesday night for an early dinner, at the recommendations of friends who had made it out before.  Sakabar is bigger and more spacious than Guu Izakaya.  We were seated right away. 

Since it was a quick dinner, we opted to order dishes that were new and different at this location.   Servers were attentive and food served quickly.

Temari Zushi was good.  I am normally weary of cream cheese being associated with raw fish.  This was done quite well, because it was a small dollop of cream cheese, lightly torched on top of the salmon.  Just enough for extra flavouring, but doesn't overpower. 

Carbonara Udon was a surprise!  It sounds weird on the menu, but they make it work.  Tasty!

Brie Cheese was ok, though people seem to like it.  It's fun to try.

RICE BURGERS!  I was so excited to hear that these were added to the menus.  I haven't been able to locate rice burgers since my trip to Asia a few years ago.  There are two - one with beef and one with miso cod.  Both were delicious and brought back fond memories.  My only suggestion is that it comes with a small wrapper, because the rice patties start to fall apart.  Messy, but I'm not complaining!  

I like that it's located in the Annex - more interesting in terms of places to walk around if you need to wait.  But in general, now that I know weeknights are better and minimal wait, I'll just avoid Sakabar on the weekends.  

Will be back - so much more to try!"}
{"text":"We had booked a table from 6:00 pm until 8: pm.  They rushed us out of there at 7:45 with the bill coming 15 minutes earlier.  I wasn't even finished ordering.

It's an expensive place and I hate to be rushed through an expensive meal.  I gave it a star because you can't go below one."}
{"text":"Fun, festive atmosphere for a rowdy HH or light meal with drinks.  As many have mentioned, this place is loud - get ready for the shouting.

They have a good selection of small Japanese dishes (okra with octopus, chicken knee cartilage, beef tongue....you get the picture) as well as a few staple entrees (miso black cod which seems to show up at every Japanese joint around).

This place will pick up your spirits and is a great spot for a group of friends.  The servers could be a little less quick with the pressure to get in and out of the place, but overall do a good job of getting food and drinks moving.  Try the sit-down area if you want to avoid the boisterousness of the benches and Japanese-German beer house format."}
{"text":"Had a nice mix of different foods that were all delicious. Very good spot to share a bunch of food with friends."}
{"text":"Wow. Where has this place been all my life? Granted its only opened recently but still wish I knew about it sooner. I love Japanese food and this is as Japanese as you can  get. Its quite hidden so you wont see a giant sign that says \"guu\". It has that quintessential izakaya feel. The moment you walk in, the staff welcome you(irrashai mase), so be ready for that. Japanese enka music plays in the background but you cant really hear it since its quite noisy).I really like that enthusiasm, its very nice to bring your friends. Certainly not suitable for a romantic date however as it gets really loud and crowded. However, for a birthday party,girls night out,etc its perfect! I love the gomae(which is a type of seaweed drizzled in peanut and soy sauce) and the Kimchi udon was lovely too. Finally, I had the Salmon Natto Yukke which has a very strong and pungent taste(not much of a fan)but most people either love or hate natto. In any case, the food was great(somewhat of a small portion). Price is not bad too. Love it and look forward to coming here for my birthday.:)"}
{"text":"I really like guu for the food for the service and the atmosphere. However , I don't like all the menu items..but thats just my own preference. Some may like items, yet I find them just okay.

Some popular items that most people like is the ebimayo dish. When I had this, it was just okay and it didn't really \"wow\" me. To me, I am indifferent between the ebimayo here and the ones from an AYCE japanese place. I am not saying this dish is good, its just that I probably wouldn't pay $8 for this dish since it wasn't that great to me.

Next, the takoyaki is was just okay. Nothing special about this takoyaki than other takoyaki dishes from other Japenese restaurants.


My favourite dishes include:
carbonara udon
kinoko bibimbap
gindara"}
{"text":"I love everything about it. My favorite is Mackerel sushi and okonomiyaki. The food is very authentic; the fresh sashimi is of excellent quality. The atmosphere makes you feel like going out in Japan."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my birthday here and it was fantastic. Amazing and very authentic Japanese food. The staff is so full of energy and seem like they have a great time serving guests. I recommend the samurai shots for those celebrating, it's a great experience! Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Headed to Guu SakaBar on Boxing Day at Bloor and Bathurst. The location use to be home to Burger King. Its 1 of 2 locations in Toronto. I had no warning on how this place operates. 

I arrive to meet some friends only to enter to cheers from all the staff. Alittle caught off guard my first thought was is this a Japanese Licks? The place is packed and buzzing with conversation.

I locate my friends and walk to their table which is sunk into the floor. Quite unique. I've already failed the Japanese culture as my friends tell me I was supposed to take my shoes off at the door. Are you kidding me? I look down at their feet. OUCH. Had I just broken some sacred rule? Remove my shoes quickly and return them to the front of the restaurant.

The uncomfortable feeling goes away as I am served a double pint of Saporro Beer in a giant stein. I had checked out the online menu before I went so I was aware that this would be a night of trying new things. It ended up being just like a Japanese Dim Sum. We ordered a number of dishes to share between the 4 of us. Firsts for me were Octopus and Oysters which I have managed to stay away from up to this point in my life.

Service was fast and attentive. Beer was cheap. Food was slightly above average. 

The restuarant had a neat promotional gimmick which had us filling out New Year's postcards which they would then mail out for us to a close friend. Mom and Dad ended up getting the postcard. Who else's address do I know?

Anyway, definately worth checking out if you want to try something completely unique and different."}
{"text":"Best place in town. Have nothing to complain. And a hundred percent satisfaction on the foods."}
{"text":"Food was alright, nice place but LOUD

I get it. The theme probably just isn't for me. They are very loud. The servers scream when people walk in, they scream a lot.

Its done nicely inside. Someone had spent good money on this place. Its a tapas menu. Portions are fairly small. Food quality is good though. Not great but good.

The loudness just is not for me. I find it exhausting. The guy running the seating was a machine. He warns people they have a 2 hour seating limit. Steady stream of people and it was packed. 

Just not quite my thing because I don't like screaming. I found much of the attitude very Japanese except the screaming, that was more fat American to me."}
{"text":"Went to Guu last week in a party of 5.  Didn't really know what to expect because the only Japanese restaurants I have been to previously were AYCE sushi places.  The atmosphere was awesome at Guu.  The staff were energetic, loud and friendly.  The menu wasn't very well-suited for me personally as most of the items seemed foreign and/or unattractive, but I tried a variety of items and everything was quite tasty.

4/5 stars, I'd go back occasionally."}
{"text":"I had the temari gozen lunch special, which was fantastic from start to finish. Atmosphere was great, service was fantastic."}
{"text":"The menu's are confusing and there are too many if them. Very expensive for very little portions particularly with the entree meal options. My dish was $23 for four pieces of sashimi, the garnishes took up most of the plate. 

Having said that, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is great. I'd  recommend doing the \"Tasters\" for best value at $33 per person.

I wont be going there again, I left hungry after an entree dish. It was more like a very expensive appetizer."}
{"text":"I love Guu, and the fact that Sakabar takes reservations makes me love it even more!  Like Guu Izakaya, this restaurant is fun, loud and delicious.  I brought my foodie cousins from NYC who have eaten their way through all the best restaurants from the best chefs, and they loved it too!  

The staff is attentive and extremely helpful.  You can tell they like working there, which definitely adds to the experience.  Some personal highlights from their menu:  

Takowasabi - marinated octopus with wasabi stem.  I wasn't really in the mood for octopus but upon my cousin's insistence I wasn't disappointed.  It had a great amount of acidity and saltiness that I love and the wasabi balanced it wonderfully.  I'll definitely be ordering it again.

Kinoko Bibimbap - my cousin admittedly isn't a big bibimbap fan, but I insisted he try it.  Kinoko is my favourite thing on the menu.  I love the cheese, mushroom and rice combo, and in the end I converted my cousin.  It was his favourite dish of the night 

Also try the sashimi salad - a good assortment of fish and decent size serving

The only SLIGHT downside was that the guu carpaccio was a bit stringy and could have used a little more salt.  Nonetheless, that was such a small blip in the grand scheme of things and I can't wait to go back!

*continues daydream of their salmon tataki*"}
{"text":"Japanese style tapas - there's something for everyone here.  I can't leave with having at least one black cod."}
{"text":"Elaborate deco, enthusiastic service, friendly staff. 
Tried cheese  stone rice. The exact flavor I adored. 
The metcha cheese cake is mediocre.
Cheese oyster is good, kind of tasteless.
The sake tiramisu is definitely a surprise. Very light, unique flavor.
The dishes are all small, but over all in high quality. 
If you are not hungry and just want something high quality and tasty, it is a place to go."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place. Cool front dining concept... Staff are friendly... And sushi is fresh and amazingly presented. A gotta hit spot"}
{"text":"Great service, food was delicious! and the sake selection was amazing! Yes it was really loud but I think that's the ambiance of the place. Wish there were more vegetarian selections. Other than that, it's worth a try for a fun night out! Definitely would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Being a West Coaster, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of Guu in Toronto.  There are several branches of Guu in Vancouver, all of which have served some of the best food I've ever tasted.  EVER.

Guu Sakabar isn't as great as its counterparts in Vancouver but it comes close.  The menu selection is eclectic and exciting, always making for a fun culinary experience.  

The food items that have always been amazing are the kaki mayo (imagine two big oysters with melted cheese and other gooey, intense sauces), the grilled pork cheek (the addition of the yuzu pepper makes this dish excellent), the gindara (the yuzu miso sauce paired with the cod is mind-blowing), and the karaage (the mayo pairing that comes along with it rocks my world).  

Dishes that have mostly been delicious but have occasionally been inconsistent for me are the brie cheese (one time, the cheese was served cold), the okonomiyaki (it tasted undercooked the last time), the calamari (occasionally it tasted overcooked because it was too rubbery), and the ebi mayo (the pieces of shrimp were tiny).

Dishes that are a big no-no for me are the kabocha korokke (seeing an egg inside breaded pumpkin was weird texture and taste-wise) and the gyu carpaccio (oh-so-bland).

The point though, dear Yelpers, is that Guu has dishes for everyone, which makes it an ideal restaurant to bring large groups.  Yes, it's loud - commenters who decry it for being too boisterous have obviously never been to an izakaya bar before.  And yes, the service gets a bit harried, particularly during peak dinner hour, but I've never felt that the servers were rude to me.  But, in a way, the casual, loud, rollicking atmosphere is part of the fun.  Come with your posse, order a bunch of tapas, and gorge on the sake - that's what's guu'd about Guu (sorry, I couldn't resist)."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto! I've been to both locations for more than 10 times and I love this place! The service is superb, food is excellent and the ambiance is definitely energetic! Some people don't like this place because of the noise, but I think anyone would agree that the food is unique and tasty. Suggestions: Pumpkin croquette, baked oyster, beef sashimi, kimchi udon, lobster tail sashimi, bibimbap, brie cheese, and the list goes on..."}
{"text":"I came to eat here for the first time on Thursday night, thinking it might be less busy than a weekend night. However, it still took a good 20-30 minutes to even be seated. As you'll see, my opinion on this place is mixed.

Pros:
- The food was really good. Me and my friends tried out the karaage, gyoza, kabocha korokke, kinoko bibimbap, and the mango cheesecake with coconut ice cream. I'm surprised I actually liked everything, since I'm normally picky about my food.
- I was a fan of the music playing in the background.
- The staff was pretty nice and polite to me.
- Clean washrooms and coat hangers available.

Cons:
- TOO LOUD. I expected this place to be loud, but you simply won't understand just how loud this place can get until you visit. The staff is already screaming at each other to the point where you can't sit at the bar and may find yourself moving to a table further away. The worst part was that there were THREE birthdays being celebrated. And when there's a birthday celebration...everyone starts their deafening screeching and howling, pots and pans are banged, tables are being slammed repetitively. It was louder than a club, gave me a huge headache, and I had to scream to get my friends to hear me.
- I ordered a Calpico drink for $3.5, and it was pretty much straight up water with some Calpico diluted in it. I basically paid $3.5 for milky water. Just buy a can somewhere else.
- Full of drunk businessmen, which isn't normally a big deal but they were extremely annoying, constantly yelling and banging tables for no reason and using their dirty shoes to stand on the tables where people eat just to take selfies. Staff didn't say anything to them.
- Some of the food was overpriced, and my main meal took half an hour to arrive.
- Really busy. I recommend making a reservation, because even on Thursday it was hard to get a table and it was super crowded.

I might come back here to eat more of the food, but probably on a Monday evening. Along with earplugs."}
{"text":"Last night, six of us went to Guu for some after-work dinner and drinks. I've been to the Izakaya on Church and so already knew what to expect--the boisterous welcome greeting, the noise and bustle, the steady procession of dishes, the laidback attitude. It's a really refreshing take on dinner, particularly if one gets tired of the standard Toronto eatery experience.

The space is loud, warm, and inviting. As you sit down, the servers present you with heated, moist towelettes to clean your hands before you eat. We ordered two dishes each, including the beef sashimi, takoyaki (octopus balls), black cod, salmon, tuna, grilled tofu, scallops, baked brie, etc, along with glasses of Sapporo. Everything was delicious--my favourites were the takoyaki and the black cod. The service was steady and prompt, with dishes being delivered one after another, allowing us time to sample and share each one. 

We each paid about $25 and felt just the right amount of full, with a little room to spare for some Menchie's fro-yo."}
{"text":"Guu SakaBar is definitely a restaurant to try. It is right outside of Bathurst Station, which makes it convenient. It is extremely busy and usually there's a wait - but, as amazing as they are, they have a texting service to text you 10 minutes before your table is ready, so you don't have to wait around inside the restaurant. The hostess and servers are all extremely friendly. The environment is EXTREMELY loud, so don't fear to yell out to your waiter/waitress. They actually put a sign in the restaurant to ask you to do so. VERY PRICEY in terms of size of the dishes, but quality is amazing. Approximately an average of $5-$6 per plate, some even more pricer. In a group of 3, we split 6 dishes and two drinks; ended up with a bill less than $60. The octopus balls are a definite must try!!! 

Definitely recommend. You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening in a big group (10+), and didn't have to wait in line, which was surprising. The atmosphere is a really welcoming loud. Diverse group, but if you were smashed and yelling, no one would find you obnoxious. Sat down and tried the sake mojito, which tasted like a diluted, sweeter version of the mix...it was alright.

Then the food...was amazing. Since we had a such a big group, we pretty much ordered everything we wanted and shared the plates. Everything was really tasty, but some highlights:

Sushi roll of the day - don't know what the fish was but it was in between raw and smoked. Really good.
Takoyaki - they make it in a clay pot and was REALLY flavourful.
Seared tuna slices - broke apart in the mouth. So good.
Salmon sashimi - standard, but still different. Just try it.
BACON SKEWER - oh my god. We thought this was going to be like 1 piece of bacon weaver on a skewer and then deep fried. Nope. It ended up being something the guys from Epic Meal Time might appreciate. They basically stuck short pieces of bacon flat on top of each other to make a block the size of a big ice cream bar, then deep fried that. Managed to get through half of one and stopped. But so good lol.

Then we got the birthday samurai sake shorts for a friend, even though it wasn't his birthday to embarrass him =). The staff (like7 of them) come out to the table and start yelling in Japanese REALLY loud, and get the whole restaurant in to sing happy birthday. Then you pour the shots into the old school Japanese boxes and drink out of that.

When the bill came, it seemed higher than what we ate, but I guess stuff at a place like this will add up haha.

Really great experience and would go back for sure."}
{"text":"So, I have a new favourite! :) I loved everything about this experience. The atmosphere, the service, style, quality of the dishes...etc. This night could not have been made better in any way. Every member of staff that my party interacted with was a pleasure to deal with. We ordered many dishes to share and every single thing was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love fried things, in small portions. I love sake. This place has both. Recently went here on a double-date with some old friends and had the best time. We went through two bottls of the bamboo sake (it comes in a bamboo shoot! +1 for novelty value), and pretty much every food item on the menu. 

Highlights included the sauteed greens (sounds simple, but it was done so well. Beyond delicious), the fried chicken balls, and the foot-long pork cheek. To die for. 

I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"EDIT: after posting my initial two star review below, kinka graciously reached out with a generous voucher and my experience was much better. The food was great as always, and we even received a complimentary dish on top of our voucher. Great customer service in the end and because of that I will definitely be returning. :)


\"I have been to this restaurant many times. I love the food and the atmosphere.

I went this past weekend and the waitress spilled a beef dish all down my hair, back, and pants as I was sitting at my table. She apologized and left. I'm not sure what I was expecting her to do... but my white shirt is now stained and I was covered in beef juice for the rest of the evening. I'm a vegetarian. 

I would have expected at least a free drink or something to compensate.\""}
{"text":"We went to Guu Sakabar with my boyfriend's friend from Boston. I initially proposed the one on Church but they did not have availability for that time of the night. We were able to get reservations so that was nice. We went through several items of the menu and the experience was almost positive in all the dishes expect for the green tea cheesecake that for me was uneatable. 

My favourites were the fried calamari, and the baked BC oysters. I had a berry bear's belly cocktail and it was very sweet but nice. 

The sakabar does not have all the options you can get at the original Restaurant on Church but we still had several options to choose from. I still like the one on Church more as it has a more vibrant atmosphere. Nevertheless, the food was very good and we had a great time. I would easily come back!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a meal at a restaurant where every single dish was perfect? I'm talking exquisitely delicious with no flaw whatsoever? I can't even begin to think the last time I ever felt like that, but what I do know is that Guu has single-handedly made me believe that there is such a thing!

We ordered the Ebi Mayo (Deep Fried Shrimp with Spicy Mayo), Kinoko Bibimbap, Kabocha Karroke (Pumpkin Croquette stuffed with an Egg), Kakimayo (Oysters with Garlic Mayo, Spinach, and Cheese), and Stir Fried Rapini with Garlic and Soy Sauce.

I am not much of a rice eater, but hot damn. That Bibimbap was one of the best rice dishes I have ever eaten ever! Holy smokes, the combination of the cheese, mushroom, and nori sent me flying to umami heaven. The stone bowl that it came in was so hot that it crisped up the bottom of the rice, giving the entire dish a wonderful texture. A+!

The Kakimayo. Pure bliss. Creamy, rich, oozy, luscious, sinful. Get in my tummy now! God bless whoever invented this, because you have not lived until you've tried it. Not an exaggeration, it's true.

The other dishes were simple but ingenious in execution. I am still wrapping my brain around how they got that rapini to taste that damn good. I make rapini at home all the time, but it never tastes that good!

Oh, also, you can't help but be happy from start to finish of your meal. The staff are incredibly inviting with their collective Welcomes and Goodbyes in Japanese to every single patron that walks in. Seriously, where do they get the energy/drive from? I'm guessing they all have sippy cups in the back filled with Happy Juice to get them through the service, lol!

Overall, one of the most memorable meals I have ever had!"}
{"text":"My visit to Guu was already three weeks ago, but I'm still smiling when I think about it. Since friend expatriated, I have to go to Toronto to see him. Luckily, it's the funnest city. We were wandering around on Friday night, starving, because snooty Korean restaurant told us we needed a reservation, even though the place was pretty empty. Friend told me that we'd have to subway to Guu, and then we'd have to wait, but it would be unforgettable. 

The whole experience at Guu SakaBar is hilarious. We are old, and we don't like being uncomfortable or waiting to eat or excessive noise. Nevertheless, it was SO MUCH FUN. You walk in and the whole staff screams hello to you in Japanese (when you're on your way to the table). And goodbye when you leave. And in between, every table mysteriously happens to have a birthday celebration, and the waiters arrive with cheerful sake shots and merriment. Or something. We didn't have to wait too long either, because we were a party of two and agreed to sit at the bar. We didn't miss anything because it's a pretty small place, and the action happens all around you. Plus we could see them preparing the food and drinks, which was entertaining. 

So the ambience is awesome, and the service is great and not cheesy-feeling, but what's pleasantly surprising is that the food is excellent as well. We split a whole bunch of dishes, and each tried the interesting sake cocktails, and all was fantastic. Especially good was the salmon, as well as the boiled egg covered in squash and then fried, and the mackerel. Since dining was our main activity for the evening, I'm so glad we had an all-around amazing experience."}
{"text":"Guu Tuu is still Guud, but is definitely a different experience from its Toronto predecessor. Things may change with time. 

We waited over an hour on Friday night at 9pm for a seat at the bar. This was expected. Shout outs to the Adorable hostess that made it all much more bearable. There is a small area to wait, but we were stuck down the line right near the door and it was COLD. Our fault for coming on a weekend. 

The space itself is nice, about 3 times the seating of Guu One. Lots of communal tables and a ridiculously fun room with low tables and zabuton floor cushions. Shoes go in cubbys at the entrance. I wish we had been seated there, hopefully next time.

The servers were great, just not as on the ball as the other location, but I expect this is growing pains. 

The Food. The Specials here were undeniably the star of the Show. The Octapus Carpaccio was fantastic, as was the seared BC Tuna. We ordered Sea Urchin and Sweet Shrimp Sashimi which came very elegantly presented. (see photo.) The Torched Mackral Sushi was also fantastic, but the rest of the meal was not as exciting. The Octapus balls, which are my favorite at the other location, are served here in a creamy sauce au-gratin. The cheese threw me off, and the balls themselves were soggy. Terribly disappointing. My SO said the Chicken Kargage was incredible. 

This location is far louder and busier, but it is missing some of the intimacy that I like in the other location. It may also be the patrons, the people beside us were clearly not of the adventurous type and were slamming back sake mojitos and picking, noticeably unhappily at their food.  Not as much fun. 

I will return once the hype dies down (if it does) for more of the fresh fish specials. I still love you Guu, but I will likely stick to the other location. 

3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  I've been hearing about Guu a lot recently and some girlfriends and I went there last night for a birthday celebration.  That is what Guu is - somewhere to celebrate birthday's.  First off, it's extremely loud.  Not music, the staff yells every single time someone walks in of the restaurant, out of the restaurant, or to use the washroom.  It's a little too much...   There were 4 birthday celebrations there last night... and it was a Wednesday.   They make a big deal out of the birthday, which was fun, cool and hilarious.   I did appreciate them going the extra mile by actually printing out a photo of us and giving it to the bday girl in a card.
The food however, was mediocre at best.  Everything lacked flavour... when it should have had a lot of flavour.  We ordered about 10 - 12 different items .  
Honestly, I will not go back.  Despite great services, the atmosphere was annoying and the food was not great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and good food. Loved the squid pancake with the benito flakes on top. Also enjoyed the calamari with a super awesome sauce and wasabi mayo. The portions are small but it's a tapas restaurant so no complaints there. I would go back fo sho."}
{"text":"Favourite date spot. Best service, best music, best overall vibe, best food, best drinks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time here. It does get busy and loud, but it's a fun place to try every once in a while with a group of friends. The food portions were small but tasty!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and environment.

Moment you enter you'll notice the really loud and energetic mood. It suits it right as you sit there and choose from their fantastic sake selection.

The food is fresh and delicious, almost up to par with the other downtown location. There seems to be fewer line ups and a better alcohol selection.

It is a bit on the pricey side but the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for \"date\" night with my boyfriend and another couple. We are adventurous folk and were looking for something fun and new. If your looking for the same thing then you should try guu! 
There was four of us so we decided just to try a whole crap load of stuff so I will get to the highlights. We started with the shabu shabu salad, it was amazing. Lightly seared beef on top of an acidic salad great way to start the meal. Next we tried the tempura shrimp with chili mayo, the shrimp were nicely fried not greasy and the size were pretty large. The beef carpaccio was nicely done, not chewy with a wasabi dressing. Special note must go to the smoked monk fish liver, while I thought it smelled disgusting my boyfriend and his friend LOVED it. Said it was probably the best thing they ate all night. I couldn't get past the smell so I did not partake, if your a big fan of fish then give it a try. For those picky eaters you have with you, please take note the deep fried Brie is amazeballs, all gooey and warm, really who doesn't enjoy deep fried cheese. Overall the experience was great, the severs are energetic, they make it a point to shout HELLOOOO and GOODBYEEE when you come and go. A few people had birthdays and they go all out which is nice.  In the end we paid $220 (that included a sizeable tip), not bad for drinks - including a bottle of saki, several saki mojitos, and sakitinis - and about 15-20 tapas dishes. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I went to Guu, this time I tried the Guu Sakabar on Bloor. We went during lunch time, not many people, only a few tables. And they have a different menu for lunch, not many tapa dishes available and more just lunch sets. I got the GYU NABE TEISHOKU - Japanese sukiyaki hot pot with rice, soup, salad, pickles and 2 kinds of kobachi. It was delicious, the soup was very rich, so yummy with the rice. Beef, tofu and cabbage altogether. My only comment would be to serve with udon instead and that the tofu would be soft tofu. It brings back the sukiyaki taste I had in Japan."}
{"text":"We got seats as soon as we got there which was a pleasant surpirse. ( probably due to being an weeknight and this location had only been open for 2 days )

Stepping into this dimly lit japanese lair -- the restaurant is seperated in two main rooms. on the right  a golden room with recessed floor seating -- neat , on the left long communal picnic bench seating.  

i must caution you, depending on where you're seated (if you get seated to the picnic bench room) -- you'll go painfully deaf by the end of the night. 

the waitress' call out the orders to the kitchen chefs they acknowledge at the top of their lungs. this may catches you off guard, but this vocal ping pong becomes very tiresome over the stay...

it was so loud i started 'signing' with my hands to communicate with my fiancee sitting only 12\" from me anyways..

Guu offers a wide variety of tasty appetizers, a good selection of sake, cocktails and dessert. 

Each item we ordered (and we ordered a bunch) had a very unique  texture, flavour and color to it. 

The flavours makes your head snap because they are extreme.  Let me explain by what I mean extreme .. either the food is super smooth, to super salty, too oily. Makes for really good appetizers. Food here is definitely not bland. 

The highlight of the night was the desert. After browsing the menu we picked the Sake Tiramisu. OMG this is an incredible twist on the original -- every melting bite you get a shot of sake soaked cake. Amazing!  :)

There's no doubt this place will be popular. The food we tried was very flavourful. Next time we go we'll ask to sit in the quieter room."}
{"text":"Simply delicious, no matter how the food was made - in a stone pot, or fried, or grilled, or baked ... everything dish exceeded our expectations. Sashimi was so fresh. Only wished we had the capacity to eat more ... but will definitely be back to try the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Sizes are very appropriate, we left not too full but definitely satisfied. Carbonara udon  and gyu carpaccio are a must try, and sashimi salad is very light and delicious."}
{"text":"My first five star review. I've been there twice already for dinner and will likely return. This restaurant/bar has an amazing atmosphere. In case you were wondering what the screaming is, the entire staff welcomes you and wishes you goodbye in Japanese. If you are looking for a quieter experience, I'd recommend sitting in the no shoes, low table area.

You get to try a ton of different dishes since they come in smaller quantities rather than entrees. Basically every dish we tried we enjoyed. The ones that I wouldn't recommend are the chicken finger item since it's pretty generic and this mini pumpkin thing with an egg in it. I found the egg inside to be really overcooked. 

Regarding drinks, the only one we've tried is the sake mojito which was amazing. It comes with this cool glass carbonated drink bottle that you have to pop open and a marble comes out."}
{"text":"The food was good but a bit pricey. I would go just once at least for the experience its pretty loud and the ambiance is different. You have to try sake bombs!! So much fun"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere. Highly recommend the jellyfish and brie dishes.  On the down side it can get very busy and crowded. The menu was a little hard to read. Overall I enjoyed my time at guu."}
{"text":"Points for being different from all the other Japanese restaurants in the area.

Cool seating area where you have to take your shoes off and sit on the floor.
Washrooms are individual rooms stocked with mouthwash to rid you of fishy breath.  People shout greetings in Japanese when you arrive and when you leave.  More yelling as staff shout the orders to the kitchen staff.

I really liked this place but was a little disappointed with the food.  Presentation was great, but portions were small and a tad salty (like the other reviewer said; perhaps to get patrons to order more drinks).
Service was attentive.

3 main dishes plus 3 single piece items came to $36 for 2.
We ordered the mackeral, okonomiyaki and rice burger and pieces of taro, fish cake and daikon.

There weren't any line ups when we went - we wondered how long this place would last in the Annex area saturated with cheap Japanese restaurants full of $10 bento box specials."}
{"text":"Four star for food. Two star for service. Zero star for table sitting policy. We went to Bloor/Bathurst Toronto location tonight. Food/drinks taste generally good, but the two-hour sitting limitation thing was very bothering, against the spirit of Japanese Izakaya. We kept ordering new drinks and we liked to chat longer but still we were only allowed to sit for two hours  I went to the Church Toronto location and Vancouver locations multiple times  before, but none of above restaurants has the disappointing two-hour sitting limit per table as your Bloor Toronto location. (Maybe that is why Guu only exists in Vancouver now) We paid fine-dining izakaya price but we were treated like at fair-quality all-you-can-eat restaurants."}
{"text":"My two friends and I came here on a very busy Saturday night. Upon walking into the restaurant, I was immediately taken in by the lively atmosphere. Boisterous waiters and cooks frequently called out in Japanese as patrons and employees milled about the crowded communal tables. It was fun to simply sit back and look around, an activity that doesn't often provide much entertainment in the usually staid Toronto restaurant. While I do not usually comment extensively on the atmosphere or the service, this was definitely a special environment.

After a short wait, we sat down and proceeded to order about half of the menu. The highlights included the fried chicken skin (crispy, bite-sized pieces that went perfect with beer), blackened cod (tender, moist fish with a delicious skin) and amberjack yellowtail sashimi (incredibly fresh fish, especially for Toronto). While the vast majority of the dishes we tried were in the good to excellent range, there were a couple of misses. The fried chicken was bland and the mayo dipping sauce was pretty boring. In addition, the kimchi udon noodles had about one-quarter of the required amount of kimchi to properly flavour the dish. 

Overall, I was quite happy with the experience, both from a service and food perspective. I am excited to return shortly to try some more of the many bite-sized dishes."}
{"text":"We came on a whim and really enjoyed it. Shared a flight of three shot glasses of sake, based on some good recommendations from our server, and then tucked in to the five dishes we ordered, which came in swift succession not long after the glasses were cleared:

Blanched spinach in black sesame sauce: sooooo tasty! Served cold, the spinach nicely wilted but with crispy stalks, the sauce salty and tangy on the tongue. 

Seared tuna sashimi: small mouthfuls of fresh-tasting light tuna that balanced firmness with softness and were complemented by the crunch of tiny garlic chips, the sweet-salty sauce soaked up by the bed of shredded daikon. 

Calamari: perhaps a bit heavy on the sauce, but with great texture and balanced flavours, so not offensive. 

Kimchi udon: the kimchi was mild and there wasn't a ton of it, but it blended well with the somewhat fishy cream sauce that coated the springy udon. 

Black cod: the star of the evening. Fish like silky butter under a crisp skin, in a gorgeous miso/yuzu sauce. I could have eaten this dish all night. 

This was just enough food for the two of us. We could perhaps have ordered one more dish and not felt stuffed, but we felt decently satisfied having had five. 

The call-and-answer routine of the staff is goofy but entertaining. We sat at the bar so sometimes it was literally right in our faces. But since we expected it, we had no problem going with the flow. A fun place to have a lively date night AND enjoy good food."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends because I had fun at their Montreal branch.  We came in at noon and it wasn't very busy, so there was no pressure to order quickly and we had enough time to peruse the extensive menu.  My friends had been to Guu before and one of them ordered the  BC oysters which were terrific.  My vegetarian friend had the Tofu agedashi and a salad which she found very satisfying.  For drinks, we had Kirin beer and a sake bomb.  I've never had a sake bomb before and wondered why it didn't arrive with the rest of the orders.  Our server, very apologetically explained that the kitchen staff was small and there were not a lot of customers at that time.  I must have had a quizzical look on my face because she then gave us a briefing on what was about to happen.  When she says \"sake\", you say \"bomb\" and the whole place knows what you're drinking!  It's quite a spectacle."}
{"text":"Loved the variety, ambiance and food here. Can't wait to go back!

The atmosphere is like no other. The service is friendly and quick... and the food is AMAZING."}
{"text":"LOVE their wing nights on Mondays & Tuesdays!

You can get  1/2 lbs. ($5.50), 1 lbs. ($10) and 2 lbs. ($18.50). You also get to choose from the chunky salsa, spinach garlic mayo and black sesame sauce for your wings! We decided to share the  1/2 lb with the black sesame sauce. Note that when you order at least a lb, which gives you around 10 pieces of wings, you get all three sauces.

The wings tasted so good! They were fried well and not too oily! Next time I'll try the spinach garlic mayo sauce instead because the black sesame sauce was a bit watery and strong for my liking.

We went for wings but couldn't resist getting some of our favourite dishes to share as well:

Nama lemon drink ($6)- It's a DIY kind of drink because you have to squeeze the lemon juice yourself.  The good thing about that is you can control how sour your drink gets! !

Takowasabi ($3.80)- It's basically raw octopus in a wasabi dressing. It's a great appetizer to start with if you like wasabi but for those of us who are more acute to spice levels, the wasabi taste is definitely very strong. 

Okonomiyaki ($6.80)- When I was travelling in Japan, okonomiyaki was a staple in every city but each city tweaked their recipe a bit to make it their own. I haven't had it since travelling in Japan so I was pretty excited. Guu's okonomiyaki definitely lived up to my expectations and reminded me of Japan. It was a very generous portion and definitely good to share with a group. 

Carbonara udon ($8.80) - If you've only had carbonara sauce with Italian pasta, you really need to try this udon! There's something about the texture and thickness of the Japanese noodle that makes this dish so appetizing! The ratio of sauce to noodle was perfect and it wasn't too creamy and heavy like most carbonara sauces."}
{"text":"I have been to the other Guu location at Church and Carleton, back in the early days of line-ups in front of the door before 5pm.

I was excited to find this alternate location, a little easier for me to get to, on Bloor by Bathurst. The place is a little easier to get inside and seated at as well (though maybe the crazy lines have died down at the other location?).

I went with one friend back in October 2013. There was a prix fixe option for a 7 course meal (including ice cream for dessert) for $25 when we went. It was delicious. We ordered this and the kakimayo. My favourite was the seaweed salad, and my friend raved about the miso black cod.

We returned with a group of 4 in early December 2013 to order a la carte, along with some cocktails and a bottle of hot sake to share.  We got about 14 or 15 different dishes (with only 1 repeated double order of the mushroom bibimbap). We tried to get their veggies and raw items (beef carpaccio, sashimi, seaweed salad) but noticed that even then a lot of the stuff is quite heavy (fried chicken with mayo (karaage), baked oysters with mayo (kakimayo), deep fried brie cheese)... so just keep that in mind with what you select.

I also noticed that Scallops (hottate) used to be on the regular menu; but now they only make an occasional appearance on the specials menu.

They do have a large specials menu that seems to change regularly, so I will be back to try what's new."}
{"text":"Was seated at a table for two I reserved. The service was very fast and we were able to eat super quickly. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Me and my bestfriend went to this location for convience to visit Snakes & Lattes. I had the best time and food is awesome its the best tasty food I had... we order a set menu for $40 dinner. Its like a 9 dish course + ordered takoyaki separate = 10 courses. Damn... we got so full! But it was the best experience ever!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my favourite places to go to. I've tried everything on the menu. My favourites are the cheese  oyster, mushroom and cheese rice, and salmon tatakki. The environment is lively. It's quite loud as they shout Japanese phrase of thanks and welcome as you walk in and out of the restaurant. I wouldn't take anyone here if you're trying to have an intimate conversation. This place can get pricey depending how much you order since it is a tapas so the dishes are small."}
{"text":"Wen to dinner with a couple of friends. Ordered at least a quarter of the menu, so can't list all the dishes we had. 

Service was pretty good. Fairly close to what i'd expect. 

The food however was below what I expected. The pumpkin with egg inside was pasty and not tasty. The rest was just unexceptional.

Spoiled by the Vancouver ones I think, I just have no inclination to go again."}
{"text":"This place was great! We really enjoyed all the yakitori, takoyaki, and fried chicken. The service was friendly and enthusiastic. I hope this place does really well!"}
{"text":"Lively place! If you are ever depressed go here. Have no clue what the staff are shouting but it really adds to the fun and uniqueness of the place. Tapas style food was tasty. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"I went to Guu Sakabar in the Annex last friday and had a fabulous time with my friends!  I loved the atmosphere - it was noisy and chaotic all at once.  Food was great, consider it like tapas Japanese/Korean style food.  The mixed drinks were awesome - they have Ramune Sour and Aloe High, both my new favourite drinks.

This place gets busy, so I suggest factoring in wait time for a table.  I was going to give them a 5 stars but they gave us a time limit at our table when we were only there for 90 minutes!

I will definitely be back; I would love to check out the original Guu on Church."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Fish was so fresh. Sesame desert was amazing. Seaweed salad was perfect. Improvement suggestion: Grilled pork can be a bit thinner and Palm wine was too small portion with the price."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for casual dinner. I love their menu selection, Ive came here often enough to have tried everything on their regular menu. The restaurant also has a featured menu with different selections every month. I've been to both North York and the downtown locations, and I've never had a bad experience. The restaurant is very loud, as you walk in all the waiters and waitresses will greet you all at once. It's not a place to go if you are trying to talk a lot- The patio is much quieter as an alternative during the summer time. Tables are small, but doesn't change the experience. I don't have many places I go to frequently but I find myself coming back a lot because the food/drinks is great. 

I Would suggest to make reservations to minimize the wait.

My favourite thing to get was the Saba oshizushi that the waitress said was removed off the menu at the Church St. Location.. ( that was disappointing)"}
{"text":"I avoided the place for ages because it's such a circus but was pleasantly surprised to find that you can place reservations online. So all the lining up and griping about wait times is unnecessary. The food is very good. The portions vary widely from a generous heap of tempura green beans (a perfect blend of tender and crisp) to minuscule (a delicious ceviche of octopus with wasabi shoots) but the flavors are all exceptional. The only thing I dislike about the place is the noise level. Between the thumping music and the screaming staff it is nearly impossible to have a conversation. Expect to sit mutely grinning at each other or go home hoarse."}
{"text":"Love this place - especially for birthdays! They do a great and upbeat birthday song for you, and you get your photo taken with your group, which is then posted on their Instagram page, and dessert/sake shots (for a cost). 

The place always has great background music, an energetically loud vibe, and top notch food. Never disappointed! Plus, can't complain about the Sapporo Big Mugs for $9.80. Definitely get the deep fried brie, chicken karaage, bibimbap, grilled black cod, and tuna tataki - but really, everything is phenomenal! Their tasting menu is actually a decent deal, and a lot of the items are my favourites! 

Definitely recommend, and will always return!"}
{"text":"If you're one that is interested in a nice quiet dinner, this place is not for you. Stay the hell out of this place or just suck it up and enjoy the great food. Yes, this place is loud. As soon as you walk in, these girls will literally greet you (scream at you) in a boisterous and energetic manner which is not a problem in my book.

This place is very social and their food is served tapas style. Everything I put in my mouth that my girlfriend from work and I ordered was beyond orgasmic. I am not even kidding you. Not only yummy, everything was fresh and screams authenticity (given the fact that they're really Japs). 

My friend and I ordered the following:
- Chicken Karaage (japanese style fried chicken)
- Gyu Carpaccio (beef carpaccio with garlic flakes on top)
- Okonomiyaki (japanese pancake like thing thats yummy)
- Maguro Tataki (kinda like the carpaccio on top but with bc tuna sashimi)

I wish we ordered more, but my girl and I were saving room for our next stop at the pub, and yes we ate some more when we got there after a 20 min walk.

No complaints with this place. I literally could go crazy with ordering a bunch of random plates when I go here. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The cheerful welcome and waving hello's are very different from most restaurants! Although the atmosphere is quite loud, it is something very unique and quite fun. Three of us shared 8 small plates and sake. The bill with tax and tip was $110. We went on a Monday night around 7:30 and it was very busy the whole time. Other than the lack of space (we shared a large table with 8 other people), I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for something a little outside the box."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, this review is long overdue but this is my absolute favourite Japanese restaurant that doesn't serve sushi. I have never not liked a food item tried there - udon carbonara is my personal favourite. Always a line-up to get in, having to put in your name first before waiting. No reservations.

 If you're looking for an intimate date one-on-on, this isn't the place because it's very loud and meant to be group-oriented. You are always sitting very close to the other customers and the servers cheer when you walk in/out. That being said, if you have tourist friends/families over in the city and want to give them a good experience, this is a great spot. Nice bathrooms too.

I don't go too too often as I'd like because the bill for two people (with drinks) usually comes up around $75-100, so not an everyday splurge. The location here is also near a lot of other places in the Bathurst/Bloor area, so there are always options of things to do after a meal here."}
{"text":"I was there for a bday party of ten. We really liked the venue and enjoyed the food! Deep fried Brie cheese, unagi bibimbap, soy fried chicken, wagyu steak... you name it! On top of that, the staff are super nice and accommodating. We'd definitely go back and recommend it."}
{"text":"Great. Great music and vibe, Asahi black beer, and some delicious food. Highlights include the Black Cod (buttery and delicious) and the Tuna tartar. Also tried the soba noodles with beef - great flavor but unlikely to order again, as the beef to noodle ratio was a bit too light. Highly likely to revisit."}
{"text":"OK it comes from Japan via Vancouver, but this place is the closest Toronto comes to having a genuinely awesome place to dine and party without pretension.

a WARNING -- very unique kind of place where you dine on communal tables and the waiters are all shouting to each other in Japanese. Very loud and boisterous -- do not come here for a quiet tete-a-tete! But if you are feeling down in any way, you can't help but feel energized once you walk in the door. And the communal tables are a great way to make new friends!

Came here for a friend's birthday -- great birthday party food. Some traditional Japanese fare cooked to perfection and some really innovative fusion stuff that somehow works. We ordered the udon carbonara as a sort of dare -- and it was awesome! Ditto for panko-crusted fried brie. Nothing we ordered was in any way not top-notch.

A great imported sake list -- and they brought a tower of sake shots for my friend's birthday.

Next time you want to have fun with your meal -- and have top-notch food, don't hesitate to go to Guu SakaBar."}
{"text":"Great staff! food is decent...great sakie selection.... slightly over priced"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fresh we entered the restaurant and the waitresses welcome us loudly after we got on our table we had two hours to stay. 

We ordered our drinks and food and the food was absolutely amazing we ate everything from the menu almost cause the place is quite affordable. 
The tuna tataki was very nice. The calamari is very good and the shrimp tempura.
The place is very clean.
But it's a little bit to loud and I think it's not a place where you can go with babies cause all the time they welcome someone it's quite loud and after a while it gets annoying. 
So I think it's not good for small kids.
Would definitely recommend the place if u want affordable good food."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere if you're into it. We had a group of 16 for a birthday celebration and the reviews are mixed. 

The food: I would stay away from the fried foods (6 on the menu) as we ordered all of them and none were impressive. However, the sashimi and buta kimchi bibimbap were delicious!  Prices were on the higher side for the good stuff (Sashimi, signature dishes) and portions small but reflected in the quality. 

Service was mediocre, not very friendly and they seemed to be understaffed - attending to the larger parties (likes ours) first. We saw a table beside us of four who had to wait upwards of 35 minutes for anything to arrive, to the point they asked for things to be boxed without so much as an apology from the waiter. Also, it gets extremely-loud in the restaurant making it not the best place for a date or conversation. There also seemed to a be a long wait for smaller parties 2-4 people despite them having reservation times. 

The Fun: if you order Sake Bombs or the birthday shooter (like we did, 9 shots for the birthday girl), 4-5 staff members come around the table cheering, chanting, clapping with flash lights and bells! Depending on the group/ table, it was either super embarrassing (mainly smaller groups) or really fun (like ours). 

Definitely a unapologetic ally unique and loud restaurant! Would recommend for larger groups looking for a fun/ memorable night!"}
{"text":"The last time I was here, it was still Guu. I was pleasantly surprised to see the bigger portions being served for some dishes now. The agedashi used to come with one block of tofu in a small bowl. Now it comes with four. We also ordered carbonara udon and kimchi udon, which were rich and filling. I preferred the carbonara but I'll take carbonara in pretty much any way I can have it. 

The karaage took a while to come out, but it was worth it. It was perfectly cooked and not too salty. The takoyaki was okay. I think I just have to accept that takoyaki is not my favourite thing in the world, and that's fine. The black sesame ice cream was the perfect end to the meal. I'm glad to see that addition to the menu. 

The place was just as lively as I remember. Make sure to make reservations for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Great food, energetic vibe diverse choices and a amazing drink selection.  I had the wygu beef carpaccio that was perfectly done (wonderful layering of flavors) and the Gindara which was sweet and was another dish of layered flavors.  The raw shrimp were ok but not really my cup of tea.   I had a vodka drink and two glasses of Sake.  A truly wonderful experience."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I last visited this location... and now I remeber.  Guu is definitely A-OK, but not as good as the original location near Ryerson.  Too bad since I've been raving about Guu to friends and family in suburbia who are too afraid to go downtown.

My aunt and I came in around 5:30 on a weeknight for an early dinner. It was pretty empty, but it did fill up fast. We shared:

- Gomae: spinach with sesame sauce
I ordered it cuz we needed some sort of vegetable and it was a real highlight! It's so simple but flavourful.
- Ebimayo (battered fried shrimp with spicy mayo)
shrimps were flavourful and big, way too much mayo, better served on the side
- Takoyaki (fried octopus balls)
- Grilled Saba (Mackarel)
topped with onions, tomato and garlic chips. The fish was cooked well, but nothing special
- Grilled Gindara (Cod)
Buttery and sweet, cooked well.
- Grilled Tontoro (Pork cheek)
Lackluster... Izakaya Ju is way better.
- Karaage (fried chicken)
It was under-seasoned and the mayo didn't help
- Yaki Udon
The Saving Grace! It's what I remember from the very first time I ate at Guu. Prefectly cooked udon and O SO buttery!

Also had some sort of berry cocktail, it was ok, my aunt says it tasted like berry juice mixed with beer.

The staff is always friendly and quick, but the space get waaaayyy too loud especially with their 'hellos' and 'goodbyes'. But this is the same at any Guu. Bill came up to almost $100 including tip - It's pricey, another reason why I don't come here often. So from now on, I guess I'll stick to the original Guu... or a more peaceful Izakaya Ju."}
{"text":"Delicious food but subpar beer. I tried both the asahi and sapporo draught but both tasted very weak. Given that this is an izakaya and the price is a steep premium, this is pretty disappointing. 

The food on the other hand was fantastic. My friend and I had the spicy maguro, kabocha korokke, karaage, and kinoko bibimbap and everything tasted perfect. The tuna tasted fresh and seasoning across the board was top notch. Texture was also great - crispy skin on the karaage and the crispy rice bits on the bibimbap was delish!

Also, if you haven't been to an izakaya before, beware that it is extremely noisy and you basically have to yell to have a conversation."}
{"text":"The restaurant contacted me after my complaint and was extremely insistent on having my friend and I back to better our experience. I truly appreciated the gift card mailed to my home in efforts to have us come again. I unfortunately couldn't convince my friend to go back so I have passed the gift card onto a friend who likes the restaurant. I am updating my review to 3 stars due to the good customer service and response I received after my first review."}
{"text":"Guu on Church WAY BETTER than Guu on Bloor.

This location is twice the size of the one on Church, but half the menu. Disappointed they didn't carry all of the yummy goodness Church St. has."}
{"text":"As a Japanese person, I find this place to be OKAY and unnecessarily LOUD. It actually gave me a headache and I could hardly have a conversation. 

Favourites:
- baked oyster
- cod dish

Avoid:
- takoyaki
- karaage (you can get the best karaage at Don Don)"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a weekend for lunch with a group of 14 people traveling from the states for a long weekend - we fit very comfortably in the dining space and there was more than enough elbow room. With that in mind, I believe that this is a restaurant that caters mostly to large groups. The atmosphere is fresh, traditional yet trendy, and very open - the open dining space can get very loud and very obnoxious if you're not there with a group. Even in a group, the tables are very large and you're not likely to hear anything going on at the other end, or even the other side!

The service was just okay - the waitress was very peppy and took great care of us, but the food for the group did not come out at the same time. My boyfriend and I just ordered sashimi and fried chicken, but we didn't get our food until the entire rest of the table already had 2 or 3 dishes in front of them. Sometimes, it seemed like they just forgot about us until we asked (and even then, the waitress seemed surprised). 

Despite the average service, the food was on another level! The fish was fresh and vibrant and the fried chicken was crispy and delicious. I highly suggest getting the sashimi if you want lighter fare; the scallops were beyond compare! There was not a single disappointed stomach in the room, although there was some concern through the table about the raw beef dishes. 

One of the most important \"musts\" of Kinka if you're there with a large group is the sake bomb! You balance the sake on top of chopsticks over a glass of Sapporo and take it after banging on the table until the shot glass falls in. It's another excuse to be loud, obnoxious, and disruptive of other diners. Your Snapchat followers will be in awe! 

Overall, it was a fun and satisfying experience that became one of the highlights of our trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"They have a very upbeat atmosphere with a warm staff to greet you at the door.  This may not be the place for some if they're looking for quiet ambience, though.  My family has been here during our visit to Toronto twice and we love the food.  We particularly couldn't get enough of Gindara no Saikyouyaki (grilled black cod)!"}
{"text":"Hands down the coolest birthday dinner yet! A word of warning: if you hate loud restaurants, lively music, close seating, energetic staff, and eclectic dishes of raw fish, you will hate GUU. I, however, adore all and therefore adored this happening place. We had so many small dishes that were all just wonderful including the seared beef sashimi, deep fried brie, and bbq style pork. This devine feast was finished with a dessert tray of amazing cheesecakes, ice cream, and almond tofu, complete with an original happy birthday song featuring a chalkboard with my name on it!!! What could be awesomer, I mean really?!? Guu - Please start a restaurant in Denver, CO."}
{"text":"It was always a pleasure to go to Guu when you served by real Japanese servers. Today I went to Guu, I was told by a White Waitress that the waiting time is going to be 30-45 mins. I was like ok I will wait. There were few ppl lining up before us. The white waitress came to me and said I can not wait inside the store, asked me to go somewhere  else to wait because the store reaches the maximum capacity. And she was rude. She said it is the law, the people before us are moving into tables so they can wait there. WTF? If they are moving into tables, then no way the store is reaching the maximum capacity. This is the first time I feel the service is bad. Because previously I was served by other Japanese girls they were all nice."}
{"text":"Awesome. Every item is amazing. Wash it all down with their sake, or plum wine. Its a great place to have a drink. Get there around 6pm and you can get a table on a Friday. After that, your wait time can take an hour or so."}
{"text":"There is no such thing as indoor voices here. Between the greeting you get upon arrival from all staff, the singing of birthday celebration songs and chatter among patrons, you will leave with a soar throat from having to talk so loud and a ringing in your ears. But don't get me wrong, this place is a lot of fun... and the food is good - my favourites being the beef tongue, brie cheese, udon carbonara, yaki udon, mushroom bimbimbap, guu carpaccio, salmon tataki - you really can't go wrong with just about anything on their menu.  They also have a full page of specials and 2 coursed menus.  The servers do have a tendency of forgetting ordered items, but otherwise service is fast and they are super friendly."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, definitely a nice choice for hanging out with friends by night.
HOWEVER, their food is just so so. For a japanese food eater, it's just eatable. Guu's food looks fancy, but their taste is superfacial. not authentic.
the service is hard to judge, they looked passionate, but kept ignoring individual questions. they cared only about what u order,no any other communication, nothing else at all. (and it is not usual comparing to some other izakaya place)"}
{"text":"The food was acceptable but the overall experience was hideous on Friday night. The staff at Kinka are not capable of serving a large group of people. We were a group of 25.  They skimped on our meals because we all ordered the set menu for sharing.  So instead of one person getting a salad, we had a salad bowl to share between 6 people.  It was ridiculous.  They brought 4 ribs out for 8 people.  It took 1 hour and 20 minutes to get a drink, even though we asked where our drinks were every 5-10 minutes.  The food was a mess as it came out, they had no clue how many people were supposed to share a dish so in the end I'm sure, we got 15 set menus for the price of 25. The meal started at 8pm and suddenly at 10:30 they brought out bowls of bibimbap they forgot to bring out.   It was so horrible the service and then it took about 45 minutes to settle the bill.  I will never go back and the entire table left angry when it was supposed to be a post wedding celebration."}
{"text":"C'est un de ces restaurants ovnis devant lequel tu passes sans jamais te rendre compte de ce qui se passe √† l'int√©rieur. Pr√©parez vous √† √™tre accueilli par une pluie de \"ohayo gozaimasu\" par tout le personnel, c'est le protocole ici. Apr√®s 5 clients vos oreilles seront habitu√©es. Oubliez les sushis √† la cha√Æne ou autres sashimis servis par les innombrables restaurants \"japonais\" tenus par des chinois....
Ici vous d√©gusterez des sp√©cialit√©s typiquement jqponqises comme les tranches de pieuvres, algues assaisonn√©es, beignets de poulet ou encore homard : un d√©lice.
J'√©tais l√† pour l'anniversaire du restaurant ils proposaient donc un menu √† 20$ qui pouvait largement satisfaire 2 personnes. Comptez 5$ la pinte de Sapporo ce qui est tr√®s raisonnable.
PS : j'esp√®re pouvoir manger dans l'espace am√©nag√© o√π on peut manger assis en tailleur!

// Guu Sakabar is one of those places where you pass in front of everyday but never notices what's inside. Be prepared! Once you get in you'll be welcomed with a huge \"ohayo gozaimasu\" by all the staff. After 5 customers have came in your ears will be completely used to it ^^.
So forget about all these so called japanese restaurant managed by chinese personnel, here you can taste authentic japanese cuisine : Octopus slices, seaweed, fried chicken, and lobster. (mouthgasm : can I say that?)
I was there for the one year anniversary of the restaurant so I had the 20$ menu which was sufficient for 2!
For beer drinkers it's 5$ for a pint of Sapporo, pretty decent!
PS : I hope I'll be able to eat in that special area with huge tables and where you seat on the floor!"}
{"text":"Be warned: it's VERY loud, and if you're coming here you've gotta be into that. It's one of those izakayas where the waiters yell every order, and at anyone who comes in or goes out--you know the type. Don't expect to have be able to have a conversation here. Groups come here for the novelty and spectacle, but if we're judging the food and service alone, I'll rate it 3 stars. The food was alright, nothing spectacular, quite pricey. Service was extremely slow.

PS: This place was formerly known as Guu Izakaya"}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch with a friend. Everything was delicious and beautifully plated. The eel-cucumber-egg oshizushi was a particular standout. The black sesame ice cream was also amazing."}
{"text":"Bring Fun Back To Dining & Go To Guu Sakabar

Bring back the fun in eating and drinking.  Bring back the loud, the people, the unique dishes, the interactive servers and the memories.  Leave the stuffy, pretentious and candlelit white table cloths at home.  Go to Guu's second location in Toronto and sit beside a total stranger and start a conversation. 

The space at Guu Toronto's second location at Bloor and Bathurst has a new twist.  You will get the same general lively and communal seating area but will also have the choice of a more traditional single table in a tatami style.  Tatami being the sunken floors where shoes have to be removed.  I would never sit there as it takes away the core attraction to Guu but some may be stuffy and want \"their own table.\" 

As for my preference I like the Church street location better.  See my review here.  The portions are definitely better and the servers, if they stay, I find are more genuine and less English.  This is something I like.

This is one of the best dishes, though it is a tiny portion.  Takowasabi has the right amount of wasabi and vinegar and is reminiscent of an octopus ceviche

I would not order this again as the batter was too thick but the sauce was amazing.

Fried Chicken what?  Ooh I wish I has some right now.  Colonel Sanders is livid.

Spicy salmon, was spicy and salmony and that's all I have to say about that.

Maguro tataki, lightly grilled and raw inside.

An unimpressive picture of a really tasty dish.  Saba, saba, saba.

Beef tongue is really good and if you do not try it, you have no...!  You know what I mean.  Grilled to medium rare, tender, tons of flavour, every time I go I order every variation of beef tongue as it always delights.

Natto Yuke.  I will say it again, do not run from Natto, embrace it, talk to it and maybe ask it how its day went.  The bowl as shown is mixed and placed in nori.  Such a perfect dish.

Kimchi udon or spicy noodles is a must to fill your stomach. 

Grilles saba, over extra seasoned sushi is another must have. 

Don't forget to get your salmon neck on smother it with a sweet oyster

An unimpressive and overcooked Yaki Udon ordered for filler.  Do not order this dish.

A Rice Burger?  Yeah and it was so much better then what you salmon pizza lovers know.  This was fun and really messy.

Asahi Black beer is one of my top beers I have ever tasted and I wish I could get it at the LCBO."}
{"text":"You come here for the experience and atmosphere. It is a decent place to entertain and it will probably be a good time with companies. 
Food wise it is just okay. It was kind of greasy and strong in flavor; to a point that the essence of the ingredients are hidden. Nonetheless the dinning experience will be fun while trying different drinks. Price is average and you will probably come out a little buzzed and hungry after spending quite a bit."}
{"text":"Fun experience. Relatively Cheap. Great Service."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good food. Customer service is abysmal  and noise level is unbearable. If you're sitting near one of the two blazing speakers , or if you're need the expeditor for the kitchen, forget about having a good conversation. 

We also had a reservation for 4 that we made over the phone, we showed up early and they still didn't have a table for us so we had to settle for a cramped seat in the noisiest part of the bar (something we specified we would like to avoid). Honestly this place used to be better when it was still Guu."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here since it changed from Guu but it seems pretty much the same and that's a good thing :) Came here on a Thursday night and although it was half empty it was still super loud lol I guess it is always like this! Ordered salmon sashimi, beef udon, gyoza and short ribs. All were really tasty and the servers are very nice. Lots of very interesting dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite izakaya and sakabar place! Very friendly staff! Once you walk in.. It might be a bit noisy but everyone makes you feel so welcomed. Feels great on a cold wintery night. Food is in small portions but that allows for you to taste more and different things! I would definitely recommend their takowasabi. They always have specials and features! Those are worth a try.

Its homey but a bit noisy. Makes sense though for a sakabar!"}
{"text":"Food is OK, but the cocktails make me a fan.

Good things come to Ontario. I have been adamant about not going to Guu when it first opened its doors. It's like settling for what's available, rather than what you really want. But after the second one opened at Bloor and Bathurst, I couldn't ignore the cries. The cocktails were calling my name, and my next trip to Vancouver is several months away. 
  
My fellow foodie, his girl, and one of my bois got together this weekend and ate quite a feast. Guu was just as loud as I remembered and the cocktails were just as badass, so much so, the drinks alone could carry this place.  (The drinks also help you forget that you waited ONE hour for a table.)
  
In true izakaya fashion, the service is fun, loud, and loud. The cocktails are superb, seriously. Especially those with Ramune (a Japanese soda that is light, smooth and superfun to open - ya, superfun). 
  
A question I get a lot, apart from where should I eat, is what should I order. I can never answer that because it's hard to say. I can usually only suggest one dish because it's the restaurant's shining star, at least in my opinion. For Guu, that dish is the grilled saba: 
 
Who knew mackerel could be such a loved fish, it's such a simple one. 
  
Here's a random sample of a few other dishes we tried: 
 
Ebimayo - loved how big the prawns were, too bad they didn't even hold a candle to Gyoza King. 

Ika - deep fried squid - one bite and we looked at each other and said \"sweet and sour pork\" aka fail. 
 
Okonomiyaki - it just was okay.  
   
Udon Carbonara - Bacon, cream, egg...perfect. *smack lips*  
A couples hours, a few cocktails, a bottle of sake, and many dishes later, we met a little bowl of dessert heaven: black sesame ice cream, sesame balls and sesame mochi - a sesame trifecta. 

You know...a sake mojito would be great right about now..."}
{"text":"Understaffed on weekends. We were seated for 15 mins before anyone attended to us. Food came to us luke warm and the fried dishes were no longer crispy. By the end of the meal, 15 mins passed and we couldn't make a waitress notice us so I went to her to ask for the bill and she looked mad and asked me to sit back to my seat. Really? I've been visiting guu for years and I will not be back."}
{"text":"It is as excellent as the Church Street Guu, except this one has more capacity so the wait times are shorter (unfortunately for me, however, it's also farther). The kinoko bibimbap and baked oysters are deliciously divine, and pretty much everything on the menu is a safe and scrumptious choice as well. You can't go wrong with Guu, which brings some of the most authentic Japanese cuisine to the western world."}
{"text":"Guu was very guud. I went the day after opening, and fearing a line, showed up at 5:30pm. There was no line at all. Perfect. Yes, it's loud, but that is what you expect, right? It's loud in a fun way.

The sashimi salad was excellent (as it was when I went to Guu in Vancouver), as was the black cod with miso. I'd recommend the Sake mojito as well. I probably wouldn't order the deep fried lotus root again. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't exciting either.

Pro: Our meal for two with 4 drinks and 6-7 plates came to only $65. 
Con: I was hungry 2 hours later.

Lesson learned. Order more.

Oh, and gentlemen. If you're seated at the tables at floor level towards the front of the restaurant, and are not sitting with your back to wall, please be aware of your low slung jeans. I saw MANY butt cracks. A wide variety even. It was funny, but it did not add to my dining experience."}
{"text":"Very Japanese! foods were great and the waiter/waitress were friendly."}
{"text":"For those who are sensitive to loud noise, DO NOT sit at the bar, because that's where most of the staff greetings come from (the kitchen right behind the bar). That being said, I've sat at both the bar and the inner room where you have to take off your shoes. I person liked the no shoe area, for some reason it felt more homey and free that way. Unfortunately I was sick on my visits so I couldn't try the interesting cocktails, but I shall return another time! Food wise, I've had a good variety, hoping to try it all eventually. If you wish to be full at minimal cost, I recommend ordering things like the oysters (kakimayo i think), okonomiyaki, or any of the carb dishes with udon/rice (my favourite being the kioko bibimbap). Servers were great, and very polite. If you want easy access to servers it's better to eat near the counter cause they are always passing by. I found that eating in the shoeless area made getting a wait staff's attention very difficult. Overall, wonderful place, and reasonable pricing when compared to many izakaya places.

**sidenote** My friends and I went to the bathroom after we paid, BEST WASHROOM IN A RESTAURANT EVER. Clean, personal sinks, free pads for girls, and MOUTHWASH. We also tried to sneak out without being noticed. Nope, doesn't work. Their greeting system is definitely the most affordable yet effective security system ever."}
{"text":"I love being yelled at by the entrance...lol
Love the energy and big ass sapporo mug they have here!
2 hr seating limit is a sadness though."}
{"text":"First of all I think we can all admit we love how they yell out a warm welcome to you every time you come. Staff is super attentive and it's always good service. Extra points for sake specials and shot specials. It's definitely more of a tapas joint. So go for a predrinks or fill up before hand elsewhere just because it can be pricey if your hungry. Great location easy to get to by subway. I love it! I used to down on the reg when my bf worked at the second cup in this hood."}
{"text":"recommend: tako wasabi, fried brie cheese(must) and fried calamari 
the Goma Zukushi is also delicious.
I wouldn't recommend saba(grilled mackerel), it has a strong fishy taste. Black cod is a better choice.
Today's special, ocean treasure is pricey.
overall, great service and atmosphere.
sure will return"}
{"text":"Celebrations were in order and my friend recommended to go to Kinka, I've had this restaurant bookmarked for a while and was super excited to try it. It was a Friday night, but pretty early and we thought we'd try our best to see if we could get a table. First recommendation, don't do this, make a reservation if you can. We asked for a table for two, looking around the restaurant more than half of the tables were opened but they said they were reserved for people who had reservations... at 9:30... it was 6:30. They seemed really scattered about not having a reservation and they lacked time management with seating people. We waited for about a 45 minutes (with tables opened) and were placed at the bar. Sitting at the bar was actually a fun experience because you can see all the hype that takes place in the open kitchen/bar. This place is LOUD, but it has an awesome atmosphere and I would consider coming here for a birthday. 

The food was decent, it's a good place if you want Japanese food thats not sushi. We ordered Gomaae which was very tasty and adgedashi tofu, tasty but the tofu portions could have been cut smaller. Looking at yelp reviews we ordered the kakimayo, baked oysters, and they were amazing and easily the best tasting thing we ordered, its a must if you come here! We finished off with the Kinko Bibimbap which I didn't like at all, although our waitress mixed it at the table for us which was a nice touch, it just didn't taste like much. We ordered the house sake which came in a real bamboo flute which was fun and seemed never ending! We noticed everyone was ordering these drinks that came with a hand juicer and half an orange, or grapefruit. It's called a Nama Orange, it's like a vodka soda, but again with a whole orange, fun and super fresh and tasty. Overall, if you booked a reservation, this place is FUN and I would recommended checking it out. Go with some people who are willing to split a bunch of food and drinks and this place is a blast!"}
{"text":"More space than Guu Izakaya and a slightly different menu.  Allows you to pick between the two without eating the same thing again.

Great atmosphere if you like a loud and roudy place to drink and have some good food.  Best if you don't mind spending a little more money to have a great time."}
{"text":"I was invited to this location for a free tasting.

I was startled when I arrived and heard lots of yelling. After awhile I caught on...Every time someone arrives or leaves, the staff all yell a greeting or goodbye in Japanese. So enthusiastic! This is not a quiet place, if that's what you're looking for.

We were seated in the private room by the entrance. You removed your shoes when you enter and the seating is sunken in the floor. You sit on the pillow at your table, but there is space for you to put your legs, like you are sitting in a regular chair. It's a beautiful room!

Here are my favourites from the Tasting Menu....

Karaage was the tastiest, juiciest fried chicken I've had in a long time(and I've been eating a lot of Korean Fried Chicken latetly!). It came with a side of garlic mayo to top it all off.

Kaki Mayo, a oyster served with cheese, mushrooms and spinach, was almost my favourite item. Served on a giant clamshell, it was salty, savoury, cheese and interesting all at the same time. I almost started laughing when it arrived because I thought I had to slurp down a giant oyster. Oops! They do give you a spoon. You've got to try it.

The Gindara, grilled black cod marinated in miso was my favourite. The cod absorbed of the flavours of the miso right through. So good. I could eat a lot of this.

The beef short rims, Karubi, were also marinated in miso and they kept me coming back. So tender and sweet. Miso makes everything taste good! 

Service was great, but this WAS a tasting. I still plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Did not know they take reservations at the Saka bar! But well it wasnt a planned trip. We had an hour wait at Snakes & Lattes, so came by here to get some food and knock it off my list!

Ordered the marinated jellybeans, deep fried brie, the beef ribs and baked oysters. Everything was super delish - i've taken a new liking to brie cheese and you can never go wrong with anything deep fried. Even my not such a fan of asian cuisine boyfriend enjoyed his meal 

Loved their cherry blossom setups for spring. I'd go back to sit in the back area in traditional japanese style on the floor without shoes!"}
{"text":"Don't fall into all the hype.  This place is fun and the atmosphere is out of control, but keep in mind that if you want a full satisfying meal, you won't find it here.  In general if you want to come out of this place full and satisfied with your meal, you're looking at spending upwards of $40-50 per person.  

The small dishes are meant for sharing and ordering a lot of things at once to share with your party.  These add up quickly at $6-12 per dish and of course Saporro on tap is a must as well.  Most of the food is served up quickly and as soon as you sit down on a weekend, you feel rushed as they are trying to compensate for the huge line up at the door.

Nothing really compares to the vibe and atmosphere in Toronto, but if you're looking for a filling dinner where you can actually hear the people you're sitting beside this place may not be it.  If you just finished a hard day at the office and are looking for a few snacks and to hit the Sake bar, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Fun experience but still needs to improve something.

I haven't been in the restaurant since 2013! However, I've heard about many good things here for few years. So, I wanted to give it a shot!

I reserved a table through Yelp only a day before.  It was easy.  They will email you to confirm the reservation and remind you again when it's close to the time.  I also received a message to confirm my reservation 3 hours before the time. So you can cancel it if you change your mind. It's easy like that.

I chose Kinka Iyasaka because I wanted my college friends to have great and fun experiences. I was glad that they like it. 

Food was great.  I gave 4 stars out of 5 stars.  We ordered many dishes for sharing.  Here what we had;
- Gomaae, balanced spinach with black arsenic sauce. This one looked very simple but its taste was incredible. It was a tiny portion but very rich. 
- Takowasabi, this dish was tiny too however i always love takowasabi. 
- Salmon sushi, it came with 6 pieces of sushi. It was ok but I would recommend other dishes.
- Takoyaki, deep fried octopus ball with tonkatsu sauce and mayo. My friends really like this tako thing lol
- Karaage, deep fried soya sauce marinated chicken with garlic mayo. It was simple fried chicken. If you like fried chicken and want to try something new, go for Torikawa! 
- Almond tofu, it was very soft, not too sweet. It's good for a dessert. However, we didn't know that. Our server also asked when we wanted her to serve it. We thought it was food so we had it with other dishes. 
- Saba, grilled saba mackerel with dill,garlic, onion on a sizzling plate. 
- Torikawa, deep fried chicken with sour sauce. I wasn't sure what the sauce was. But I love it. 
- Okonomiyaki, deep fried Japanese pancake. If you like takoyaki, you would love okonomiyaki too. 
- Kimchi udon, udon noodle with spicy cod roe and kimchi. It was an interesting taste. Glad to try it. 

Drink, we didn't have any fancy drink. We had a pot of Sencha green tea, orange juice and ume mojito. The mojito wasn't good. I wasn't sure if they added liqueur less than 1.5 or 2 oz.  I'm sensitive to alcohol and always turn into red every time I drink even a quarter of glass.  However, I felt nothing for this ume mojito. 

Service was good. The ambiance was the same. Nice decoration, loud and fun environment!  4 stars was perfect for them. Only one issue before we started to order our food and drink. While we were waiting for 2 more friends coming, we wanted to start with drinks.  We waited for at least 15 minutes and tried to grab someone attention.  It was very loud so it was difficult to make them hear us. I didn't to flag anyone down. lol but we tried few times. Our server didn't even know in the beginning that we existed I thought. She was around us, took care of other tables but didn't know we were her table?  Her coworkers called her for us. After that, everything was great. She came often and it was happy ending! lol 

The end."}
{"text":"Just a fun place to be. Great food and friendly, fun service. I always order the chicken karaage and the beef tongue, and the large Sapporo - it's huge! Go here with a small group of friends and get there early cause the lines will be long."}
{"text":"If you want true, authentic Japanese food, this should be your first choice in the city. The food is amazing, the atmosphere and decorations are even better. However, it might be a good idea to do some homework before coming as their menu can be a bit confusing. Also if you are a fan of westernized sushi, you will probably not like their sushi."}
{"text":"i find that guu is great if you're comfortable with sharing food & drinks with other people. every time i went was with a group of 5-6 friends, and it's always a positive experience.

on different occasions, i've tried the following and they are all delicious!
- food: karaage, ebimayo, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, grilled saba, & salmon tataki

i also discovered a couple of drinks that i really like that i was able to share with friends: takara plum wine, you's time yuzu flavoured sake"}
{"text":"This is a best izakaya experience so far. The place is best for group and birthday party. I always enjoy the carbonara upon and draft beer here! The tasting menu and special are nice when you are overwhelming by their menu."}
{"text":"This place is sooo fun, very lively energy and the dishes are always unique.

Go here for a fun time with friends. There is a communal setup here, last time we were here met some strangers from Montreal and had a great time.

The portions are small so come I recommend coming here for a snack not a dinner."}
{"text":"(4.5*) 
Came with three friends on new years eve. Before anything our main waitress was amazing, the other waitress that helped the main waitress out lacked communication and since me and my friends liked to take pictures before we eat she kinda ruined the natto yuuke we ordered ;/ 

Onwards we orderd a pitcher of sapporo and the 35/p course meal (along with a salmon natto yuuke bc it wasnt included and i wanted some lmao). 

They all came in this specific order.

1. The chinese spinach slightly boiled paired with a sesame like sauce was such a good refreshing start. 

2. Followed was the tofu and seaweed salad, was pretty good but wasn't like eyegoogling amazing or anything. 

3. The salmon tataki was a definate melt in your mouth and the ponzu sauce wasn't overpowering or anything like it usually is and i cant taste the fish at all over the acidity. 

4. The karaage came annd omg was it like so fucking juicy after you bite into it just like i hd it at the Church location; garlic mayo always onpoint. 

4.b. This is where the natto yuuke came in and it was okay, i liked the church street one better because it had kimchi and  okra ;/ this place had cucumber and the yellow pickled radish meh lacks flavour compared to Kinka on Church

5. THE OYSTERS ARE ALWAYS SO FUCKING HEART MELTING GOOD.

6. The black cod literally melted in our mouths and using our chopsticks to cut the flesh was like cutting tofu 
wtf.

7. The galbi was pretty melt like in your mouth too, was expecting it to be rubbery but it wasn't.

8. The kinoko bibimbap's bowl was  too hot do it burnt our rice ;/ so if it was intentionl then i guess the char flavour was okay??? but the rice was way too mushy for my liking and I would've liked less cancer inducing char (it was pretty black tbh)

9. Matchaa mouse was another melt in your mouth goodness and the matcha flavour wasn't that bad.

At the end I realised... I really feel asahi wouldve been the better pick for this meal than sapporo but itsokay next time i know."}
{"text":"I was feeling all Goo-ey on Friday so decided to pay another visit to Guu SakaBar. I'll say that it's definitely fun, but I should maybe prime up at home before I come here because the noise doesn't do it for me until I gots a buzz on. 2 bottles of Sake in and I was having a blast! I always sit at the bar because it's more fun and more social.

The Black Cod is to die for, although I'm not sure I remember it having bones the last time I was there. 

Seaweed and Tofu Salad had a delicious sesame dressing and qualified as a much needed vegetable serving among our gluttonous choices. 

Always incredible is the Deep Fried Brie with it's ooey-goo-ey goodness flowing forth from the breading when you crack it open with your chopsticks.

Deep Fried Chicken was okay, but nothing outta this world.

Beef Tongue was soft like buttah with an exceptional beefy flavour and topped with bean sprouts and green onions.

There were several birthdays and we sang along with everyone else. My friend, who lived in Japan for 4 years, advised me of clever things to say in Japanese to the cooks. I though this was funny until she told me that I had said \" I want to ride you.\" I looked at the cooks and said \"bicycle?\" to which they roared.

Guu SakaBar is a great place to celebrate and kick back after a long week at work and get your drank on. It seems to be a popular spot for birthdays, as well. Definitely not a good choice for a romantic dinner cuz there's no way you're going to be able to converse or have any privacy.

I take stars off for the fact that they kicked us out of our seats after 2 hours. It was almost 10 pm and there were lots of open tables. We would have been happy to order another bottle of sake or some additional giant Sapporos, but were not permitted to do so. I get the policy when they're busy, but it was their loss.

Overall a solid good time!"}
{"text":"Guu recently changed their name to Kinka due to the ending of a franchise agreement with the parent company. That is pretty much the only thing that's changed. It's still a boisterous place with delicious, shareable plates. If it's your first time at Kinka, here's what you should try:

Kakuni - braised pork belly ($8.8)
Kakimayo - baked oyster (8.5)
Brie cheese - (7.5)
Karaage - deep fried chicken (7.8)
Salmon tataki -seared BC salmon (7.8)

I would also recommend the Unagi bibimbap but only if you're into BBQ eel. 

The list above is a decent amount of food for 3-4 people. 

The creme br√ªl√©e pudding is divine. 

The service here is excellent. I was recently here for a birthday and requested a birthday dessert special. Our server was lovely and made sure everything was perfect. They even sing for you and take a picture for you to keep."}
{"text":"LOUD! That is the FIRST thing you will notice if you go here on a friday night or weekend (or maybe even weekdays, but I never went back to check). We were here with a bigger group, and the first thing we found was that booking reservations is a bit difficult and you need to call pretty far in advance. So keep that in mind. Now in terms of service, it was medicore. They were not really friendly, in fact I felt that they were a bit rude at times, and the funniest thing was they wouldn't allow a friend of mine to charge his iPhone (even though he had the charger and cable, just needed an outlet). They gave the reason that it was too expensive to use. Lol.

Anyways, the food wasn't bad - I like it better than Guu (been to the one on Queen) but it still isn't the best Japanese food I've had (maybe because I've been to Japan and I'm a bit spoilt). I really liked the Mojito drinks though (I tried Lime and Peach - Lime was better) and I think that was my favorite part of the whole experience."}
{"text":"I came here with 7 other friends and we waited for 2 hours on a Friday night which I expected . . . but given the wait and the hype, I had high expectations . . . however, at the end of the night I was disappointed.

I thought it'll be AMAZING like my first Guu experience at the orignal location but none of the dishes were memorable but at least the two menus were different and the food was still good and fresh, just not OMG . . . which I was expecting . . ."}
{"text":"Meh. All of the usual dishes are here but none of the flavours. Soy-based sauces are watery, daikon is bitter, sauce on many dishes is just thousand island dressing. Plus it took three tries to get a pot of tea that was even hot even to be bath water and they brought our non-drinking friend a vodka when she'd ordered a plain sofa water. Give it a miss."}
{"text":"Love Guu! Some of the most innovative Japanese food in the city. Try the baked avocados, and the sashimi is always perfect."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The entire staff welcome you when  you enter and then bid you farewell as you leave. This can get a little intense and loud as there are lots of comings and goings, but I liked it. 

The are a plethora of Japanese tapas to try. The server was able to give great recommendations,  which was helpful because I'm not well versed in Japanese food, but I will say that everything was delicious! You should definitely try the baked oysters."}
{"text":"All of the food description sound amazing but the actual dishes were mediocre. Bland flavour. When I saw the incredibly cheap prices I suspected that it couldn't be that great. 

The Sapporo was served in an enormous, ice cold glass which was really nice. 

Saturday night was really loud but that's part of the reason you're going. 

The serving staff is friendly and on top of a really busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was super tasty, listen to the waitstaff for recommendations. I'm not usually a fan of fish, but tried the recommended blackened cod, it was fantastic. 

We enjoyed every dish we had, and ordered a second round of at least one :).

Dropping a star for the seating process. We arrived a bit after 7 on a Saturday, we were told to expect a 30 minute wait. No problem. We gave them our phone number and explored Midoco next door. We went back 45 minutes later to find out they weren't really using their phone list, just seating people who were standing there. When we pointed our name out on the list we were seated next, but had clearly been passed over for a while."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable. Bronwyn introduced me to it last year, and its now one of my top 5 places to eat.

The atmosphere is unlike anything you've ever witnessed. As soon as you enter, the entire staff (including the kitchen) erupts in Japanese at the top of their lungs, greeting your entrance. A host eagerly asks how many seats you need, and if there is a wait, they take down your phone number.

Drinks come first. We always order two big Sapporos (32 oz. for something like 8 bucks, so cheap) and a big bottle of hot sake (Geikkeikan). Then comes the fun! Guu boasts a large tapas-inspired menu, and every night there is also a different feature menu. It's best to order dishes in chunks of 2 or 3 at a time. Any more, and you find your table rammed with too many plates. 

The feature menu starts to run out around 9 or 10 usually, so come before that if you want to try the daily sashimi (always delicious). Don't panic though, the standard menu offers many sashimi choices as well. 

Finish the meal with green tea ice cream!

Getting the bill is never a scary ordeal either. It always arrives with a handful of frozen grapes (yum) and the bill is always less than you expect. It really is CHEAP to eat here.

Guu is a must try. Go tonight."}
{"text":"I love Izakayas! 
When people think of Japanese cuisine, they usually think 'sushi' and half of them immediately proclaim \"I don't like raw fish!\"

Wake up, people! Japanese food is more than just sushi and sashimi (and if you've never tried sushi or sashimi and think you don't like it already...well, your loss. more buttery raw ahi for me)

Traditionally, Izakayas serve drinks (sakes, beers) and create tapa-size dishes to go with the drinks. Like a really social and fun pub. 
But being Asian, the emphasis on food is much greater than a typical bar where the focal point is tons of watered-down well drinks and pub food is an (unappetizing) after-thought. 
Gotta love an Asian establishment.

And in typical Izakaya fashion, we were Loudly and Exuberantly welcomed into the restaurant by no less than 5 chefs and all the servers. 
We felt like Superstars when we entered the place. 
Throughout our dinner, anytime a new party arrived or someone left, it was exuberant chaos with the folks @ Guu...and my friend and I would turn to each other, and just burst out laughing. 

We were seated at the bar, right where the action was- in front of the small but efficient kitchen. We also walked away smelling like caramelized garlic- awesome. 
I may not shower tonight just so I can relive the great experience @ Guu

Here's a rundown of our dinner:
- Fried Ebi (shrimp) with spicy mayo: Wow. the shrimps were huge and juicy and fried Just right in a yummy tempura. 

- Carbonara Udon: My absolute fave dish of the night. Who knew udon could be made into such silky, creamy carbonara? Amazing! The bits of bacon were perfect with the carbonara...and honestly, I could graze on this dish All.Day.Long

- BiBimBap: Not my fave; it wasn't as flavorful as other bibimbaps i've had. But honestly, we had it right after the carbonara, so that was probably unfair to the poor bibimbap

- Fried Brie: generous serving of 4 pieces of deep fried brie. SO good. Crunchy on the outside, cheesy, melty brie goodness on the inside. Would have been great spread on a cracker, bread or pretty much anything, including recycled paper. 
It'd have been amazing in Any.Fashion

- Baked Hotate (scallops): served with sauteed mushrooms in a scallop shell. Yum!

- Karaage (fried chicken): one of the best karaage I've ever had. much better fried chicken than any self-proclaimed fried chicken establishments in the US

- Sake Tiramisu: creamy and really tasted more like an ice cream cake. not that i'm complaining

- Black Sesame Ice Cream with Black Sesame Mochi and Sesame Balls: I love black sesame ice cream and this dessert was a dream come true!

Service was great; our servers were so nice and friendly...and the chefs were a hoot. 
Guu was so loud...that when we spilled onto Bloor after dinner, it felt deathly quiet on Bloor. ON BLOOR!

I've found a new fave restaurant in the TO (and frankly, in recent memory)...I'll be back with tons of other friends"}
{"text":"Delicious little place with great reverie (lots of friendly cheering in Japanese throughout the night) and food.  Our favorites were the:

+ Maguro tataki - fresh tuna sashimi in a beautifully light ponzu
+ Saba oshizushi - essentially giant nigiri blocks topped with torched mackerel.  falls apart a bit, but like any good relationship, you just got to put back together the pieces you love and enjoy it all the same
+ Kimchi nabe - kimchi, pork, and tofu hotpot with added udon.  hearty goodness that warms your heart in the coldest of winters

We enjoyed the deep fried brie, but do not recommend for couples (way too much deep fried cheese for two), especially when you're trying to stuff your face with just about everything else.

The house sake, served warm, was light, so cheap! ($20) and a nice complement to everything.

My absolute favorite thing though was probably the sesame on sesame on sesame dessert that had sesame balls with red bean filling, mochi dumplings filled with black sesame and a dome of black sesame ice cream because you just need more black sesame in life.  It's amazing. It melts into a giant mess, but who cares, just spoon it in your mouth and love life."}
{"text":"I had a sushi bibimbap. We had takawasabi and kurage for appetizers. All were good tasting and nicely presented."}
{"text":"Their food is good, but their service is kinda poor. I made a reservation online for my friend's birthday, showed up on time. They said they didn't receive my reservation. Showed them my email confirmation, still didn't get seated. \"Sorry, you reservation is not in our system\", and we waited for another hour. I have been in this place quite a few times, I feel their service is getting wrose, and I probably won't go their again."}
{"text":"You haven't been properly greeted at any restaurant until you've stepped foot into Guu! 

All the staff seem so pumped and excited about the job they're doing, and they're not afraid to shout it from the rooftops - or right into your face if you happen to be sitting along the sushi bar! I love love loved all the energy, noise, and excitement, but by the time the cheque rolled around, I was ready to step outside.

Then there was the food. The presentation was beautiful. We had some sake based cocktails, and shared edamame, rapini, fish tacos, and kimchi nabe - all of which was delicious!

Just don't go if you have a headache.
What an experience!"}
{"text":"A taste of party-hard Japan in the heart of Toronto

I came by a few weeks ago with my friends after dinner, and I've got to say it's been one of my favourites so far since arriving in the city. The atmosphere of the place and the staff made me feel nostalgic (my Japan trip last 2016) in every great way.

The servers were accommodating and entertaining, the food came after 15-20 minutes of waiting (as we expected), and our meals were BOMB.

Speaking of bomb, you've got to try a few rounds of the SAKE BOMB. After a few bites of food (and a glass of Sapporo), order your group a round of sake + beer bombs. The staff will come with pots, pans, and the loudest voices they could muster, and chant until you and your friends down those shots. It's the best.

My must-tries: Kinoko Bibimbap, Karaage, Maguro Tataki

My tips: Best to go after a hard work week, for a friend's birthday (who you'll get sake-bomb drunk), or when you're craving for GOOD Japanese food"}
{"text":"...this is the 3rd guu location i've dined at (been to guu original on robson and thurlow in vancouver and church street in toronto) and they all seem to hold their quality and enthusiasm quite consistent at all 3 locations. 

i love the setting and atmosphere the most here - not as cramped-feeling as the others and there are actual individual 2 and 4 seaters rather than long tables and benches where you have to sit besides strangers."}
{"text":"When I showed up with my date, we also didn't wait at all in a line. We were sat in one of the benches but that's because the dropped tables were already busy. Must come back and sit at those next time.

The most overwhelming thing inside this restaurant is how loud it is. Whenever someone comes in or leaves or makes an order all of the staff yell things in Japanese. I had to use my extremely loud voice to overpower the noise. At least it's one thing it's good for.

The food was great. Tried the deep fried brie which was delicious. Also tried the pork intestines and they were yummy too if you can handle the texture. We tried several types of sake and I definitely would like to get more into this delicious drink. I liked the more fruity ones like the pear variety and the plum variety. Also we enjoyed they way the oysters were served, very non-traditional because it didn't have the customary horseradish/seafood sauce/hot sauce combo like all the other oyster places. They served it with a asian hot sauce and a delicious flavored vinegar."}
{"text":"very very good. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. Make sure you order the Takowasa. You won't regret it. While the food was awesome the service left something to be desired. The servers were very inattentive. I'd also avoid the seaweed salad. It's not worth the cost."}
{"text":"I guess I haven't been to many Japanese restaurants  back home in San Francisco but I have to say this was such a fun experience. Started off the meal with a sake bomb. Our waiter was so awesome and accommodating. He was energetic and enthusiastic when he acknowledged my party and taught my relatives how to drink a sake bomb. The food was also really good and great for sharing. Loved the lobster ceviche and jellyfish dish. 

Also commenting on the washroom. The toothpicks and mouthwash were a nice touch. Definitely gonna come back again when I am back in Toronto."}
{"text":"High energy environment with friendly staff. The seating is a bit tight, but the restaurant itself is beautiful. I love the wood and warm lighting. I highly recommend the seaweed salad with tofu, the gomaae, and the vegetable gyoza which are amazing, and this cocktail with cassis and oolong tea which is extremely refreshing. My boyfriend loved his karaage too. We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is really amazing! The atmosphere is crazy in a good way! After a long day of work and coming in this place is worth it. I would recommend this place and also will keep coming back. They have an amazing service and also good combo of flavors in the food. They take pride on what they do to let the customer feel the authenticity of japanese food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I've been wanting to try out Guu for so long, so I was extremely excited when one of my dining group members chose it as our destination last month.  It's the first restaurant we've done where we were unable to make reservations, but luckily on a Tuesday night it worked out just fine.  

I arrived to the expected yells and found my group sitting near the back.  Even though it's communal seating, I didn't feel crowded by the strangers next to me.  The service was pretty decent, although as the only person who ordered just water I was left waiting through half the meal - after asking at least two more servers.  The food and experience made up for that though.  

The ambiance is definitely not intimate and romantic, because of the above-mentioned communal seating and the general volume of the place.  We were having to yell to be heard across the table, and there were only 5 of us.  

The food though, was pretty great.  My stand out favourites were the Black Cod (Gindara) and the Kimchi Udon.  Both dishes were consumed completely, and I likely would have licked the plates had I been in the privacy of my own home.  Honourable mentions to the deep fried brie which was also pretty amazing.  The only thing I didn't like very much was one of the specials, a smoked salmon quesadilla.  It was a little too fishy.  Also the bibimbap had good flavour, but was mostly rice - more so than I had hoped.  

All in all it's a fun atmosphere, perfect for a party (although might be difficult due to the no-reservation policy), with not amazing service but pretty fantastic food.  I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Kinkalicious! Came for the special promotion after a friend recommended. Made a reservation for 5:45 on a Saturday and was seated promptly. Server was friendly and introduced certain items and drinks. If you're going for the Kinkalicious event, it requires a minimum of two orders (29/person). It was a 7 course meal so here goes.....

Sashimi sampler: My fav - lobster tail, salmon and scallop. Was nice, cold and fresh. 

Seaweed & tofu salad: Light and not too saucy. 

Fry plate (karage & takoyaki): didn't try the takoyaki, but karage was fried nicely and had a good crunch

Grilled pork cheek skewers: A bit chewy for me, but the taste was decent. 

Baked oysters: Nice and cheesy! Had potatoes mixed in as well which complemented well. 

Mushroom & Cheese bibimbap: Was quite big considering the size of the other dishes, more toppings would have been nice.

Matcha ice cream: nothing too special, but at least its a dessert! 

Service: expected the almost non stop shouting and enthusiasm, did not expect to be that rushed for time. We were told it was a 2 hr limit (understandable) but were promptly given the bill after 1 hr and 15 min.  

Will return to try the other locations as well!"}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya Bloor is located near the south east corner of Bloor and Bathurst in the Annex/Koreatown area and borders a now named alley called Loretto Lane.

This business name is all in CAPS, how appropriate...

As with most Izakayas there's that general greeting that is loud and welcoming.  If you don't know about this it may catch you off guard.  Generally speaking the interior of this place can be noisy and it can definitely become elevated at any given time.  At the area near the front there's a sunken area where shoes are not allowed and they'll even supply flip flops for you.  There's a compartment for shoes to the right of this area before entering.

For a table of four we ended up getting a couple cold bottles of the house sake to share as well as some small plates.  Salmon tataki, edamame, fried brie, karaage, kakimayo (oysters), and yaki udon.

To end things we each had a sake bomb.  The sake bomb is basically a small shot of sake resting on chopsticks and the thing is an entire ritual.  \"When you say sake, we say bomb!\"  Eventually the table is pounded and hopefully the shot falls into the beer and then you drink it.  It's all in good fun with some small plates on the side.

Izakayas are fun but if you've not been this is not a modest sit down Japanese restaurant.  Consider it a party place or a place where you'd be allowed and encouraged to make as much noise as possible."}
{"text":"Okay wow, I totally should've figured Ken S. had already started a review page.  So this is my repost from the one I created.  

I don't think I've ever been as excited about a venue as that of last night's Guu Tweetup hosted by Ken S.  I was lucky enough to have gotten a last minute invite to this event and it made my Tuesday.

Unfortunately I arrived late and so I missed the bulk of the evening, but still got to see familiar faces and made some new friends.  

@Ken S. - When are you hosting the next Tweetup?  I'm already looking forward to another one.  And I still thin you should've won for best socks!

@Paul H. - You are a man of many talents, and apparently Japanese is one of them.  We shall call you sensai!

@Jen C. - I've stumbled upon your blog many times, and I should've known when we were both madly snapping photos at Herbal Infusions that you were the mastermind behind foodpr0n.  

@Eve C. - Thanks for sharing your insights on industry with me.  

@Q H. - I'm glad I can finally put a face to the name instead of having disillusions of you being a black and white cartoon character that holds a balloon!

It was a great time.  Special shout outs go out to Guu's staff also for being so energetic.  I don't think my water glass was ever empty."}
{"text":"I love Guu any way you slice it. But particularly after my recent string of well-documented izaka-tastrophes, returning here was an epic occasion not dissimilar to the end of Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity (except Sandra Bullock is me and Earth is deep-fried Brie).

What you're in for at either location:

+ Noise
+ Inventive, flavourful food (I've never met a dish here I didn't love, but my favourites are the explosively tasty pumpkin croquette [$5] and the fresh Maguro Tataki [seared BC tuna, $7.30] which, also like the film Gravity, is out of this world)
+ Decent (albeit slightly watery) drinks even if you skip sake
+ Fantastic atmosphere, from the lobby down to the water closets
+ Appropriate for all dietary restrictions
+ Speedy service
+ Awesome staff
+ NOISE. I'm serious, if you don't like it loud, go somewhere else.

Who you should bring:

+ Me
+ Someone you want to celebrate with
+ Out-of-towners, who will be impressed
+ Your parents, who will be too overwhelmed by the ambiance to ask why you're not married yet
+ People who are nice to look at but terrible to talk to
+ Second dates, who will think you're super fun
+ Forever dates, because they deserve return visits to Guu
+ Last dates, because no one will hear them crying over the noise

Kanpai!"}
{"text":"Went to Guu SakaBar for the first time last weekend, and I loooved the food. I'd been wanting to try either this Guu or the Izakya for a while, but never got around to it, but now I'm so glad I have.

My friends and I tried the Gomaae (spinach salad), Karaage (deep fried chicken), Kabocha Korokke (pumpkin croquette), Gyu Carpaccio, Gyu Beef Tongue (the best beef tongue I've ever had), Carbonara Udon and Kinoko Bibimbap. 

My favourites were the beef tongue, carbonara udon and deep fried chicken. I definitely want to go back to try more of the kinoko bibimbap."}
{"text":"For obvious reasons I had high hopes coming in here and I was not disapointed! While it takes second place for me compared with Guu Izakaya, Sakabar still managed to be a 5 star experience for me from it's food, service and atmosphere. Came here around 6 ot 7 on a Friday night and didn't have to wait at all with the \"Japanese\" seating section being almost empty. I'm not sure why because the Japanese seating area is certainly the place to be. You take off your shoes and are more comfy in your socks (thank god no one had smelly socks while I was there) and the food there certainly rocks. 

For 3 of us we ordered around 8 or 9 dishes and let very satisfied without feeling a heavy effect on our wallets. I can't recall everything we ordered but I remember the bibimbap being extremely tasty.

Since we were a little ways off from the kitchen, the atmosphere here didn't seem as loud and alive as in Izakaya but compared to any other restaurant the atmosphere was still very lively and enjoyable. 

This is exactly what I enjoy about dining out in Toronto, exciting meals, great service, good food and a great location.
I can't wait to see what else the people behind Guu has in store for Toronto!"}
{"text":"Kinka is such a great place for good eats and great atmosphere. The cuisine is like asian fusion meets soul food... we had the kakimayo, karaage, and carbonara udon, which were all great. The staff are quick, attentive, and do a great job getting everyone hyped up for sake bombs. The place is loud but in a charming way, and makes for a fun alternative for date nights/girls nights/birthdays. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What keeps me coming back is the atmosphere! The second you walk in all the staff harmoniously shout a greeting at you. I once came in to get take out lunch and was the only person in there and all the staff still yelled the greeting at me. It is awesome! It is tapa style, and every item on the menu is delicious. I highly recommend the fried chicken!

It is casual inside with two seating areas. The large table area is communal, then the room off of that has cool seat in the floor. You have to take off your shoes to which is pretty different!"}
{"text":"We came here after eating kbbq for drinks and it was super welcoming and casual. The atmosphere is super chill and relaxed and everyone is there for a good time. We each got a sake bomb which was super fun because you line up a glass on top of a another glass with chopsticks and bang the table until the glass falls in the cup and take the shot. We also tried the samurai bomb which was the craziest thing I've ever tried. Try it out if you're there! Our waiter came out with a mask and hit a gong for us! Really loved the atmosphere, didn't try any food but would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"@GuuToronto 
I was asked where in Toronto is the most memorable meal. This was my first thought and where we brought our out of town guest for dinner.

Did you know that this location takes reservations??? Call between 12pm and 5pm and put your name down! Although each time I've come here, I've never had to wait long, with a group of 6 people, thought it was best to take advantage of this on a Sunday night. Around 7pm the line ups started, and I think about 30 mins from what I saw. But come before 6:30pm or after 8:30, and you're probably good. 

The service, as always was excellent. Food was brought out very timely. And although we only had the table for 2 hours, she did inform us of our 'last call' for food, which was nice and very helpful. I'm not sure how they keep so organized!

The menu is almost the same as when we first came here one year ago, with some changes and some portion sizes shrunk. My typical strategy is to order about 2 dishes per person, whatever we'd like, then mid way, repeat the best ones. 
Includes must haves
 - Salmon Natto Yukke
 - Spicy Negitoro
 - Cheese BimBimbap (I like this more than the chilli one)
 - Takoyaki
 - Beef Short ribs
 - Kimchi and Carbonara Udon
 - Goma Zukushi (black sesame dessert, best!)
 - Sake Tiramisu

There's so much energy in here, that it's impossible to fall asleep. Everything seems to happen at a hurried pace, so you need to take extra effort to take your time and eat. 

I prefer this location because I feel like there is less fried dishes on the menu, and more variety in unique foods to try. 

Lots of copycats in Toronto these days, but I have yet to find one that lives up to Guu (both locations) in terms of food, energy, and experience."}
{"text":"Love the food, but I likely won't come back if we have a bigger group. In some ways it seems perfect for groups since the sake bombs are really fun. But they will only give you one bill, it can be a pain to figure out if you have a large group, we had about eight people. It would be okay if you could just tell them what you ordered but that wasn't the case for us so calculating the bill was painful and it took so long for them to come with the machine (waited twenty minutes to pay).

One member in our group was celiac so she asked about what dishes she could eat - they just gave her a confusing binder that didn't really clarify what dishes she could order. 

They were also out of one of the tempuras but didn't tell us so some people were waiting for food that never came. My friend's bimbimbap also didn't come until everyone's meal was finished. 

The salmon oshizushi and the bimbimbaps are among my favourite things, I'd just be wary of service if you have dietary restrictions or come in a larger group as communication and accommodation aren't their strong points."}
{"text":"*** FUN & GREAT FOR SHARING ***
Went to this restaurant for mine and my brother's birthday and we had an amazing time. Food was great, service was quick & extremely friendly. And because it was our birthday they sang to us, gave us an assortment of desserts, and took our picture for their Instagram birthday account @kinkabirthday.
Portions are small but it is meant for sharing. Perfect for a night out with friends and trying something new. Almost everything we ordered we enjoyed! Definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"Guu is awesome. I have been to the location on Bloor in Toronto a few times and Guu with Garlic in Vancouver, and I have never been disappointed. 

It is a fun, lively atmosphere with staff yelling to each other and the food is fantastic. Between the selection of deep fried dishes to the lovely sushi options, you really cannot go wrong. 

Last time we went it was my friend's birthday and they came out and sang the funniest, loudest birthday song you have ever heard. 

The only downside can be the noise. The place gets packed and it can get very loud, especially if you are sitting in the front room with the low ceiling. 

If you can handle the noise I definitely recommend this place for a fun time."}
{"text":"I normally don't go to Japanese restaurant/bar because I can cook those foods. And if you see my reviews for J-restaurants/bar, they are usually hard on them, but not this time.

I went there in the mid December in 2014 with my partner. Little bit too loud for me, but I can't deny the positive atmosphere they creat. Stuff was supper friendly, too. 

Their seats were tiny. It could be hard for some people. 

Food was good. I particularly liked Kabocha korokke (deep fry pumpkin) and Ramen salad (salad in which has egg noodle). 

I'll come back for special occasions because the place is very entertaining."}
{"text":"Over priced! Far too loud.  Weak drinks.  The food was just ok....I've had much better in TO."}
{"text":"**WARNING, if you dislike communal tables, loud music, fast service and excessively cheerful staff, this is NOT the place for you** 

If so, read on!

On a Sunday night during the Hot Docs Film Festival, my boyfriend convinced me to come here, at my behest, to try out the food that he had so long desired. I was a bit intimidated at first because I knew the noise level would be high and the bar service was a bit in your face.

But we didn't wait at all to be seated and after the first loud \"irrashaimase\" I knew I was hooked.

A pint of Sapporo to start and as it was the 'Tuna Festival' that week, I knew to get down to business and ordered every item from the tuna special menu!

Tuna Tartare was this deliciously thin sliced sashimi and I just wanted mooore. 
Magutata seared tuna  had a hot garlic taste and a cool fresh tuna contrast, yuuuuum.
Calimari, the savoury topping and nori complimented it and was a perfect early starter dish.
Isobeage, fish cake, was my FAVOURITE THING THAT WE ORDERED. A lightly battered fish cake sliced diagonally and served with dry wasabi powder and with nori in the batter made for a perfect flavour. LOVED IT.
Temari zushi was salmon wrapped in a cream cheese ball and seared with a torch, it sounds insane and tastes even better. 
To top it off, we had the Gyu Kati, a beef sashimi with a delicious serving of green onion to top it off.

Basically, this night went from great to better, you've got the contrast in patrons, some were ordering like crazy as we were, others were drinking mostly and nomming as they went, but the communal atmosphere was more pleasant than at some other environments.

Also, the BATHROOMS? Amazing. Clean, well stocked with girly things, mouth wash, toothpicks and calming music, a real contrast when you head downstairs. 

It's not the cheapest place in the world, we came to just under $60 with tax and tip but we were also stuffed to the gills, so it's worth it. My suggestion is to head there, not counting costs, but by enjoyment level!

Will. Be. Back."}

{"text":"I've been to Guu on Church and I've been to Guu in Vancouver. Both are unique and different in there own ways. 

Guu SakaBar is a great addition to the Guu family. It's a Guu no doubt, but it's a new experience as well. I'll tell you why.

Like all Guu's, it's noisy, rowdy, exciting and certainly a culinary experience to remember. There is the open kitchen behind the bar, there are the shouting cooks and servers. Everyone is a FOB and extremely polite. The menu is a two-parter: original regular menu + specials of the day. The specials actually run out and they are actually fresh and well-prepared (more on that later). Items are a combination of traditional Japanese bar food/snack food with good flavourful twists.

SakaBar has a two dining rooms, one which is really cool. At first it looked as though people were sitting on the floor. At second glance, the seating was actually lower into the ground and the floor was raised like a mini-stage.  So it looked traditional, but was a bit deceiving. 

I ordered a Chu-Hi to drink. A combination of potato alcohol and another beverage of your choice, in my case, ramune. Tasted mostly like the ramune I poured into the alcohol and the taste diluted quickly from the ice. Of course the best part was popping the bottle open with it's cap and shooting the marble into the drink. 

As fun as that was, the food was tastier.
First my gf and I had the Mushroom Bibimbap. I've had this before and it's still as delicious as I remembered it to be. My gf thought it was fantastic too. She's not a picky eater but she rarely has a medium rating.

Next we had deep fried brie. And yes it tastes just as good as it sounds. Gooey melted brie in a panko golden brown encrusted shell served on berry and apricot sauces. Really good stuff.

After that we had the okonomiyaki. It wasn't different in anyway but had all the fixings there.

Last we had the baked oysters. These were my favourite. Cheesy, creamy and mushroomy topping on large fresh oysters. Amazing stuff.

Overall, I had a great dinner at Guu. My gf loved it and she immediately wanted to bring her friends to try. I thought the food was great as usual and the atmosphere comfortable and lively. Make sure you get there a bit early or go with a smaller party. They don't do reservations and there are lines usually.

When you get in, it's all worth it."}
{"text":"I really don't know why I put it off for so long.

Wow!

I can see what all the hype is about...it is completely justified. 

My friend insisted that we go here for dinner (after being told we would have a 30 minute wait for Fresh). So off we trotted on a chilly Wednesday night. 

When we arrived we were seated immediately; despite it being super busy and not having a reservation. 

We were welcomed in what I was advised was typical Guu style (everyone shouting hello and then goodbye as we left).  I love the atmosphere; it's busy but the staff are on the ball.

We ordered various items but the stars of the show had to be the black cod in miso sauce (we ordered it twice, it was so good); the special menu item which was a pork gyoza soup...this again we ordered twice as it was amazing, full of flavour and perfect for a cold night.  All the dishes were delicious; I avoided the fried menu for my waistline's sake! Beef sashimi is a must, for sure. 

I just have to refer back to the gyoza soup...if it is on the specials menu then try it...you will not be disappointed. The broth has salty, smoked bacon depth which is cut perfectly with crisp bean sprouts and bak choi. It is divine! 

Ok so it is not the place I would go for cheap eats but it truly is fantastic. Now to head to the Church St location!"}
{"text":"Tough review to write. Went there on an impromptu dinner date w the wife. I liked it she didn't. We'd been to fin izakaya and loved the creativity and taste of the dishes. 
Were looking for the same here but Kinka didn't quite make the cut.
Ambience was great, drink selection creative but food was a little hit and miss. 
Sashimi was excellent but the sauces on some of the other dishes were a little too ketchupy...
Id probably give them another shot though not sure wife would be game..."}
{"text":"Love it! Their specials change all the time. Must try the takowasabi, my fav. Be prepared for the loud greeting and order passing from the staff. Loud music as well, but awesome vibe :)"}
{"text":"Warning - this is a loud restaurant. do not come here expecting calm.

Visiting toronto, i wanted to take my mum to izakaya japanese food and yelp brought me here and the experience and food did not disappoint.

Every little dish we ordered was amazing from the loaded oyster to the fried brie.

Sake bombs were being dropped left and right with the staff and friends of participant cheering on. Great vibes, great food. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"For years I've witnessed countless glorifications of Guu restaurants, but never found the opportunity to experience it first hand.  Overall it was a wonderful experience with some of the best foods I've ever tasted.  We visited on a Friday night at around 7pm, and were delighted to get seating immediately (albeit at the bar - but we didn't mind).  It was a loud environment - but the good kind of lively and exciting loud.  Our waitress was very happy to serve us, and came at the right moments to take our orders.  Despite the full house, we didn't have wait very long for our dishes.  We ordered:

Akami - bluefin tuna, special of the day
Takoyaki - deep fried octopus balls
Kabocha Korokke - deep fried kabocha pumpkin croquette
Chili Mame Bibimbap
Kakuni Pie - pork belly pastry
Cheese cake - green tea

The akami was alright, but not quite worth the premium price.  The takoyaki was very delicious, and I was tempted to order it again.  The kabocha korokke was surprisingly tasty, considering I don't usually have much pumpkin dishes.  I was very impressed with their level of service and great food - would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm certainly not a Toronto local, but after reading all the great reviews, I decided to check this place out. Let me tell you, the energy here is off the charts. All the employees are so enthusiastic, and you see it right when you walk through the doors. 

Onto the food, all great tasting and huge portions. I was thinking that since this a tapas place, each serving would be one or two bites, but boy was I wrong. There's plenty of food to go around for each serving.

On top of all this, the price is insanely affordable given the quantity and quality of the food they give you. I'll be sure to check this place out again if I'm ever back in Toronto."}
{"text":".... It was amazing !!! We tried karaage carbonara udon yaki udon... And seared pork belly . I was kind of disappointed They didn't have my braised porkbelly vital the food we tried were superb! The karaage and yaki udon are a must! Great atmosphere ; so great that I ended up speaking Japanese. I don't speak Japanese. A must."}
{"text":"So Guu SakaBar is not the most traditional izakaya place. I was quite disappointed as I was expecting to have a paper menu with grill items I can check off. If that's what you think this place be forewarned - this is not that place! 

Instead, there are some fusion-y asian offerings that are decent, but are a bit heavy in flavor which is understandable since they do serve alcohol. Since it is an izakaya place I don't recommend the sushi or sashimi here - I feel that it's never quite as good as if you got it from a real sushi place and this is no exception. Plus it was sort of expensive for my taste. 

The carbonara udon was quite delicious. I do recommend it. It's best if split among three people or two people with large appetites. The udon is al dente, the carbonara flavor is on point and creamy and it's delicious. 

The pork belly had a good flavor to it, but I felt it could be a bit more tender and stewed for a longer period. 

The miso black cod was just so so. I wasn't too impressed with it and have definitely had better. 

This place is also LOUD. Almost overbearingly so. Come here if you don't want to talk to your date I suppose or if you're going to have a night of eating and debauchery or are pre-gaming for such. Although the restaurant is pretty solid - I believe there are better places for this type of food, especially at the price point."}
{"text":"Yumm. This place is extremely lively. Once you walk in you get greeted by the entire staff. I came as a group of 3 and we were promptly seated. 

-----About the service-----
Very friendly ! One of our dishes came out 15-20 minutes late but we came on a friday night so it was expected to be busy. They were very apologetic and I completely understand. 

-----About the food------
Yummm. We got the cold noodles and also the clay pot, both were delicious! The noodles were quite refreshing. We also got the beer margarita which was way worth it because they made it extra strong :) 

Overall, cute place to eat at. If you want a serious conversation with someone, I don't recommended it because it is extremely loud. Staff is friendly and food is on par ! Cheers ! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this Guu location many times. It is hands down one of my favourite places to go for a great dinner with friends. I have never had a negative experience here - always consistent!

Ambiance: Such a fun place to go. I never feel rushed - a great place to go out and hang out with friends, enjoy food and drinks! This place is very unpretentious and laid back. Quite loud but that is part of the vibe!

Service: The service here is awesome. The staff is attentive, friendly and very informative. For the volume they serve, I have always found them to be very quick. 

Food: The food - my gosh! I have never had anything not super delicious on the menu. They have a regular menu as well as specials - thus one can never really get bored of Guu!

The only criticism I would have is that the vegetarian options are not overwhelming. There are options but not tons and tons.

You also have to know your friend group when you go to Guu - go with open-minded eaters :) All the food is meant for sharing and their food has a lot of unique and unconventional combinations - great for those who enjoy trying new things - not so good for picky eaters.

5 stars hands down!"}
{"text":"\"We remember coming here last time and not knowing which dish to try from their square grid menu. The taste menu option is certainly a great alternative as an introduction.\"
\"Kinka means Golden Flower we were told, something which bring happiness to everyone. It definitely did to us.\"
\"As much as the deep fried breaded chicken with garlic mayo on the side sounds simple and fastfood-like, the dish left us in awe. The meat was very flavorful and soft which was aided by (presumably) long marination in soy sauce and a dash of sake.\""}
{"text":"I came here around 5/6pm and it was already a little busy. We were seated in the area where you had to take your shoes off, where it made getting up/leaving the area a little more inconvenient. The menu is really easy to read and pretty straight forward. My favorites from the meal are: Karaage, Brie Cheese (my boyfriend didn't like this though - so it's not for everyone), Maguro tartare, and I'm not sure what it's called - I can't seem to find it on the menu, but it's a deep fried egg w/ pumpkin and it's AMAZING. The food came super fast and the service was really friendly. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and attentive and the restaurant has a nice ambience and great decor. However, I found the food to be average, at best. The friend I went with visits Japan frequently, and generally, loves all kinds of Japanese food. He too found the food here average."}
{"text":"Food is really delicious! Five stars for that. What you SHOULD KNOW is, that it is VERY loud. As part of the restaurant culture, all people are screaming all the time, for instance when new guests arrive, leave ect. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is EXTREME there! Hard to keep a conversation at a big table. If you don't mind and find that amusing, you'll have an excellent evening! But keep that in mind when taking guests... Overall still 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food was great, apart from a lukewarm black cod. I think it needed another minute of searing. Tatakis are great. And the beef carpaccio also excellent. It is loud. And you have to flag down staff for service. But definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Oh Guu, I love yuuuuuuu!

This is Japanese food redefined! Imagine tapa sized orders of your favorites reimagined by decadent sauces - deep fried or seared to perfection then paired with an exquisite array of sake choices. Sure, you have to get accustomed to the shouting at first but once you have a couple delicious sips of yummy sake like Izumi Nama Nama (Ontario Spring Water Sake Company) the shouting becomes welcoming - and you may even find yourself yelling with them!

After spending a couple hours sampling their sake and food list I can honestly say this is way of the future for Japanese cuisine. I am a sake convert. I always thought sake was this warm, alcohol beverage that lacked all imagination. But, have since learned by way of Guu, that actually sake can be served chilled and hold sweet flavors such as pear, vanilla, and melon. The sake I had that night left me with a warm glow of heavenly bliss. We had two bottles. One was 300 ml and the other was 385 ml's. Sitting at $22-25 each. The one named above and another one I can't remember it's name (sadly!) but it was unpasteurized and brewed in the US. 

Recommend food wise: octopus balls. Does an octopus have balls? Not sure. But, needless to say, they were delicious in their deep fried batter and topped with a sauce that took the balls to whole new level (lol).

Cold items: seared BC salmon with green onions and garlic chips. Yes, I could have had at least three plates of this!

Hot: BBQ Pork Belly paired with a mustard with a similar taste to wasabi. It was joyful to eat. 

Each food item is between $5-8.80.

Seating: we sat at the bar which is good if your on a date or are in groups
of two. But, anything larger than two you may find yourself waiting if you don't get there early. 

Guu is a foodie heaven Those looking for a typical sushi experience will not find it here. But, if you are in the mood to try something different that will make your taste buds dance and your senses awaken, I highly recommend you make your way over to this cheerful dining haven."}
{"text":"A bit loud and fast-paced but manageable. Service is very friendly and the food is very good. We had this raw steak tapa thing and it was different but amazing. Cr√®me brulee was good, coconut ice cream was average, but the tiramisu wasn't the best. They even have this birthday special for dessert where they give you a bunch of different desserts in one dish and they dance and sing happy birthday to you. A nice gesture for that birthday boy/girl or just for fun ;)."}
{"text":"I have gone here so many times I can't even remember.  But one of the things I really really, I mean REALLY enjoy is the consistency in terms of food and service.

If I were to give a name to Guu SakaBar - I'd call her \"Old Reliable\".  I've probably had their entire menu a dozen times over. Much like the original location, the energy level with their high energy welcomes is through the roof. 

The music is always upbeat, and it always makes me want to drink more for some reason. Strange."}
{"text":"I'd been to the other Guu location, and was excited to hear that a 2nd location was opening. I ended up going on opening night. Guu is an ideal addition to the bleak strip of sushi mile on Bloor, where each sushi restaurant is worse than the last.

They have a daily special menu, and this is where the highlights of our meal were. We had a lightly seared BC tuna sushi. The texture was amazing. We also had the daily special squid. The seasoning was perfect. Everything was really fresh and delicious. 

I had the Nama Lemon to drink (a vodka soda, served with a whole lemon). The ritual of squeezing your own lemon juice was a fun quirk. 

The atmosphere is really loud and fun. Glad I got in again before the epic Guu lines begin!"}

{"text":"Went to Kinka Izakaya Bloor with my Grandson and his friend Friday evening Feb 26.  We had a great time.  A little noisy but that is all part of the great atmosphere.  There are wonderfully loud greetings for everyone coming in or leaving.  The food and service was GREAT!  I highly recommend Kinka Izakaya Bloor if you are looking for a really enjoyable Japanese evening.  Parking was no issue as there is a public lot on the next block.  Looking forward to our next dinner there."}
{"text":"I have returned after visiting Guu Sakabar more than two years ago. Service continues to be good with overly enthusiastic Japanese servers. We made a reservation for 7 on a Saturday night, which was absolutely necessary as it was very crowded. Everyone at the table opted for the tasting menu. I should mention that there's no either or option - if you want the tasting menu, your DC's have to be cool with that. For $30, you get a lot of small dishes to try. By the end of the meal, I was completely stuffed. Some of the very memorable dishes were: the karaage (them again, who doesn't like fried chicken?), black cod with miso, and sake flavoured foam cake. I would say skip the baked oyster as it was too cheesy and couldn't taste anything else.

Can't wait to return and try other items on the menu.

Good for: groups, tourists, night out"}
{"text":"Yes, the greeting is fantastic and makes you feel really good! The staff are equally friendly and efficient when serving you. The ambiance is cozy yet lively at once and not overly loud. BUT, the food for me was pretty average. The dishes are certainly unique-sounding but they were somewhat oily and left that greasy feeling in my mouth (and stomach). They have a large deep-fried section so maybe order only one of those. I also have to wonder where the beef comes from if its $7 for a generous serving. That said, I may come back if I have an out-of-town visitor looking for something different."}
{"text":"I'll show my small town roots here and say that I have never experienced anything like this place. I am now addicted, though. I can't stop remembering and salivating. 

I went on a weeknight around 7 PM with three friends from work. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, not bad now that I've read some of the wait-time horror stories. 

The most startling part is that the staff is constantly yelling. Apparently they are greeting people entering and leaving and things like that but I was shocked. I thought it was severely annoying and a stupid gimmick at first. After a drink or two though it started making me smile. 

Drinks were good and the place seems to be all about drinking. I had a huuuuge mug of beer, some warm sake, and sampled my friends' grapefruit sour and oolong tea drinks. All met with approval.

The food is where the place really blew me away. I'm pretty fussy so when I read the menu I was scared. I had been promised sushi but this obviously wasn't THAT kind of Japanese place. I let my friends do the ordering and tried to keep an open mind.  The brie cheese was so delicious. Like a grown up mozza stick with nice contrasting fruity sauces. The karaage was juicy and tasty, really good portion size. The pumpkin and egg croquette thing was one of the oddest eats I've ever tried but it was still tasty. The beef udon tasted like bacon. Who doesn't like bacon? No complaints. The baked oyster was the star of the show. So salty, so creamy, so cheesy. Damn. The only \"complaint\" about the food is that a lot of the dishes are sodium bombs but I like it that way.

Staff was efficient and friendly. Explained to us the tapas-style concept. Quick to bring drink orders when asked. I honestly can't wait to get back to Guu."}
{"text":"Last year, to celebrate me writing the LSATs, my wonderful girlfriend introduced me, and took me out for Guu (Church location) and I was wildly impressed. The service was terrific, the food was superb, and the drinks were delicious. I immediately proclaimed it a potential favourite, and couldn't wait to return.

Fast forward to yesterday: we decide, last-minute, to make New Year's Eve dinner plans. As we scrolled through potential reservations on Opentable, we suddenly remembered Guu. We checked the website, and discovered they were now taking reservations, and amazingly, had an open table for 2 available at 9:30. We booked immediately.

We were seated the second we arrived, and simultaneously greeted boisterously by their entire staff (as is their standard policy, which I completely welcome). We picked two drinks:
1. Ramune Highball
2. Northern Dancer (don't recall the ingredients, but for Calpico water) 

The Ramune was as expected, and I gleefully popped the mystical bottle ball after the second try. The Northern Dancer order came with a disclaimer from the waitress as being a strong drink, and we were not disappointed there either.

We ordered as the drinks arrived, and our food came in what felt like under 10 seconds. We received two dishes at a time, in the following order:

1. Salmon Nattu Yukke
(Salmon, Crab, Egg and various veggies, mixed at the table, and you roll it yourself in Seaweed) 
2. Kabocha Korokke
(Crouching deep fried pumpkin croquette, Hidden egg) 

These dishes worked well in tandem with eachother, one hot, one cold, and both egg-centric. I adore the Nattu Yukke dish, as it features almost exclusively raw ingredients and thus focuses on the quality and flavour of those ingredients. The Pumpkin ball was delightfully fluffy and tasty, and considering the complexity of the cooking required, we were very impressed. It's served over what appeared to be a thousand island dressing, and I'm excited about pairing these three flavours together in my own home cooking.

3. Maguro Tataki
(Seared BC tuna with ponzu)
4. Ikapari
(Deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup) 

These two dishes didn't pair together as well, but individually they were both phenomenal dishes. The BC tuna was, as my girlfriend put it \"Redonkulous\" [SIC] and the calamari and ketchup combination was very unique. 

5. Kakimayo
(Baked oysters with mushrooms, cheese and spinach)
6. Deep Fried Brie Cheese
(Self explanatory, served in a mango & berry sauce)

These two cheese-based dishes were a great ending to the meal. I can't imagine a guu meal without the deep fried brie. 

We decided to sweeten up with an order of the soft Almond Tofu, which was surprisingly enjoyable - a nice little cup of pudding-like sweetness.

In addition to a flawless flow of fantastic food, our waitress warned us that she couldn't process our bill just yet. She was busy preparing for a choreographed dance routine the entire waitstaff had prepared just for New Year's. Incredible. 

Oh! And if you thought I was done raving, think again smartypants, because on our way out we decided to stop in the washrooms before slugging onto the TTC to our next destination - as we reunited outside our respective lavatories, we compared how great the contents of the bathrooms were: toothpicks, mouthwash and disposable cups, beautifully designed sinks, and more. I always appreciate these little touches most restaurants don't think to add, despite their minimal cost. 

I've never left a happier customer, and in addition to sharing a meal with my favourite food companion, it will be tough to top this all time best NYE restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner.  The place was decorated for Halloween which was quite amusing to see body parts / dead baby dolls around the restaurant.  We went with the set menu but I think next time it would be better to just choose the entrees.  The salad is plain.  But the entrees especially the eel was delicious.  The atmosphere is quite loud and busy.  Which is fun but not a place for a quiet night out.  Our waiter / waitress were super nice.  The please was also pretty clean.  They had these baskets beside the tables which I assumed is where people can put their purses / jackets."}

Environ 30$/personne pour un repas de roi, avec le la langoustine cru tr√®s bonne, et pleins de sp√©cialit√©s japonaise qu'on ne voit pas souvent dans les resto jap traditionnels."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on the phone. The lady really struggled to get my brother's name and his phone number. I'm guessing she's ESL. 

My first time here. I thought their lunch menu would be the same as their regular menu, as their lunch menu is not posted anywhere I can find. Turns out I was wrong. No regular menu available at lunch.

Lunch ranges from $9 something for a bowl of ramen to $15 something for a sashimi lunch. We ordered their weekly lunch special (katsu don), their tempura/fried lunch, their beef hotpot lunch and their tempura lunch. Total damage was $53 something before tax and tip.

Each lunch is presented on its own cafeteria style wooden tray. It's kinda cute. Each lunch came with a miso soup (which had lotus root slices as well as some other veggies, tofu and seaweed) and a potato salad (cold mashed potatoes with small bits of cucumber in it). All of the regular lunches came with a Japanese side dish (sliced root veggies marinated in sweet soy and sesame oil) and a bowl of rice. The katsu don did not come with the side dish. Portion-wise, the bowl looked like it could have contained more pork for the amount of rice. That being said, we had enough food between the four of us. The hot pot beef was beef brisket. There were a couple chunks of brisket, but it was predominantly sauce. The sauce was delicious, but I wish there was more substance in the sauce. The tempura/fry included fish, shrimp, eggplant, green beans and a croquette. It came with wasabi mayo (my mom loved this), some sort of green salt that looked like matcha powder, and tonkatsu sauce (tastes like thickened worcestershire). The sashimi consisted of salmon and tuna tataki, tuna, scallop and octopus. There may have been regular salmon sashimi in there as well, but I forget. The sashimi was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth. It was lovely.

All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I'd come again, but next time, I'd like to order from the non-lunch menu."}
{"text":"Chose this place for my last dinner in Toronto.

Atmosphere is like any other Japanese yakitori joints. If you're trying to have an intimate/serious dinner...please opt to sit in the shoes off dining room. It is almost impossible to carry a conversation on the main floor without saying, \"what, huh, i couldn't hear you -- could you repeat that\". 

All the food was decently priced...we ordered a bottle of sake ($20) and beer with 6 items and the bill was under $80. 

Salmon Tartare was so fresh and clean tasting
Beef Udon was my second favorite dish.
-Do not order the baked oyster...all you can taste is the slab of mayo on top-"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. I enjoyed my experience here.

Interior and exterior of the place is pretty dope. I loved how they blew up photos of the chefs as you walk inside. I love how the kitchen is open and you can see the chefs at work doing what they love. And I really enjoyed how there is one section where you can sit on stools and on the other side it looks like you need to kneel but you can actually sit on the pillow and you're like sitting on the edges of a square/ rectangle. Idk if I'm making any sense lol. 

It's pretty loud. So it's hard to make conversation. Customer service was wonderful. The servers are really nice, greets you when you enter and when you leave. It was my friends bday and they kindly switched our tables so we can be seated at the unique seats with the pillows I mentioned. They also enthusiastically sang happy birthday and the sake ball chant! 

My party of 7 ordered the set menu. 

$36 for: 
Gomaae: blanched rapini with sesame sauce. Presentation was cool but the taste was okay. Not something I'd order again tho. 

Karaage: deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken with garlic mayo. This was the bomb dot com. It was soooo delicious. I'd definitely order this again. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. And they gave us a good size portion considering each chicken was huge. Top three dishes that I loved. 

Karubi: salt and pepper short ribs. It was okay. Could be more flavourful. 

Sashimi salad: it was good, fresh, colourful and tasty. 

Kaki mayo: baked oysters with spinach, mushroom and garlic mayo topped with cheese. Omg. The bomb dot com again. The oysters were huge! Came to us hot and the cheese so melty. Combo of the veggies and oysters were a hit. So good. My top three dishes that I loved.

Kinoko bibimbap: in a stone bowl, rice, mushrooms, cheese and seaweed. The serve mixes it for us. This was another good dish. 

Gindara: grilled miso black cod. The skin was crunchy and tasty and the meaty part was so tender and delicious. Careful of the bones tho. My top three dishes that I loved. 

Salmon tataki: seared Atlantic salmon sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips and scallions. Melt in your mouth. So yummy. The garlic chips gave a nice texture and the wasabi mayo gave you a really good hit with flavour. 

And ice cream: coconut, green tea or black sesame. 

In addition I also got the matcha cheesecake. It included a matcha green tea cheesecake on one side of the plate, whipped cream in the middle and a cute bowl of green tea ice cream on the other side. It was pretty delicious. 
Pretty good. But some dishes could be amplified more for better taste."}
{"text":"We were a party of 20 reserved for a 3-person combined bash. Kinka killed it with their friendly upbeat service and it was definitely as I remember comparing to the visit I made four years ago. They reminded us of the 2 hour seating limit and 15% gratuity so there wasn't any misunderstandings. We came during their meat fest which had special menu items involving barbarian size amounts of meat and towers of roast piled high. 

Food - always a fan of Kinka food : ebimayo, kakemayo, bibimbap, pressed sushi, karaage, eggplant
Drinks - I don't remember much after the Samurai sake bombs we had...accompanying festive wait staff banging on pots and pans included :) 

7 samurai is also a good choice - mix of fruity and traditional alcohol coloured with red, blue, lemon-lime 

A big group is always how you come to izakaya; definitely makes the experience more enjoyable! 

Will be back again - hopefully sooner than 4 years"}
{"text":"I haven't had the opportunity to go to Guu Izakaya so this location is my only experience with Guu... and wow! What an experience Guu is!

It's loud and it's hot, but I think that's part of what they're trying to do in there. Maybe just don't come if you feel a headache coming on ;P

Our food took a while to come out and there was a point where it seemed that our waitress forgot about us (as it was a very busy and packed Saturday night) but all the food tasted amazing so in the end, it ended up being quite worth it. Prices i would say are reasonable... it would probably be equal to having a nice dinner at The Keg and that was without sharing things with the rest of my party (we each ordered 3 dishes). Needless to say,  I was very very full."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here in a private room. This place is formerly called Guu. Had a pretty nice private room where you take off your shoes and sit down in a very Japanese like setting. The menu was preset with 6 tasting menu items including dessert. I ordered a very some Saku served in a Bamboo type container. It was very cool and the sake was nice and smooth. First, we started off with Edamae. Can't really say much about this as they all taste the same. The next dish was the Osaka Fry which is Japanese poutine. I thought it was okay. It was definitely missing one key ingredient in poutine which is the cheese curds and instead of gravy, it was more of a special soy sauce. The Karaage was nice, hot and very delicious served with garlic mayo. I requested the spicy mayo and it made all the difference. Next was the Kakimayo which is the baked BC Oyster. Personally, this was my favorite dish of the night. Very delicious, nicely cooked and baked with cheese and mushrooms makes me feel like I'm in heaven. The next dish was Kinoko Bibimbap which is a fusion take on Korean cuisine. i thought this dish was okay as well. I would have preferred a protein with the rice like beef or eel. Lastly, to finish off our meal, we got the black seasame ice cream. It was nice and creamy and a good way to end the dining experience. Overall, it's a nice place to eat with friendly staff. Food is moderately priced here. It does get busy during weekend nights."}
{"text":"Went there for my 21st birthday. I absolutely loved the energy and everything that I had was delicious! I also enjoyed the staff serenading me as I blew out my \"shots cake\" (a stack of coloured shots with candles stuck in the limes). The only complaint that I had was my waiter. He kept giving us side eye and he didn't seem very happy serving us."}
{"text":"I gave Five Stars for Guu! My 1st perfect score in Yelp! Despite the prices, they served high quality of food. The dishes are well prepared and in small portions. I like the way they presented their food in small dishes, just like Dim Sum. So I get to try a wide variety of choices and they all satisfied my taste buds! The waitress / waiter welcome you as you step in. I like to sit on wooden floor but you need to remove your shoes. Definitely will revisit again.

Food Quality: Mouth watery food
Service: Very good, but always busy place
Price: Upscale price, but also upscale food
Overall: 5/5"}
{"text":"YES guu is still as good as it gets. (I love both guu locations). Deep fried brie is mandatory, I also really like some of their tofu dishes, the tofu steak for example is really good. The seared tuna also amazing. oh ya and the bibimbap. You just can't go wrong at guu! On top of that they have AMAZING birthday celebrations!!!!! They put your name on a chalkboard and sing to you with tamborines, you get the idea. There were several birthdays while I was there and it was awesome, it just added to the happy vibe. Oh ya and the $10 1L beer is a must."}
{"text":"The food here pales in comparison with the Church st location. I've been here on more than one occasion and the food is usually room temperature with the rare exception here and there. I also usually come here with large parties as the other location is too small to accommodate groups larger than 10-15 people and nearly all the food that was presented was cold or borderline cold - as if it was sitting on the counter for a while. Also, my waiter the last time I was there consistently got our orders wrong and either forgot a few dishes completely or brought out the wrong drink order. 

Overall I wouldn't come back here unless I was forced to go (i.e. for a birthday celebration)."}
{"text":"Make a reservation because they fill up fast! 
Great place to try Japanese dishes with friends, definitely order a variety!

Their baked oysters were delicious, huge, cheesy, and had a lot of mushrooms inside. 

Their raw items are very fresh. 

Service is very enthusiastic and loud; the whole place is very lively so you can talk as loud as you want!"}
{"text":"The ambience is great and very reminiscent of izakayas I've been to in Japan. However, the service is slow, unattentive, and impolite - they made mistakes with our order and were reluctant to correct the bill, and the food was lacking in flavor, overpriced, and small portion-wise. Would not return."}
{"text":"Having been to Guu in Vancouver many times this venue is no different from its siblings. Loud and busy, people always moving, yelling, laughing. I brought two French friends with me there. While they loved the food there they were a bit stunned by the atmosphere. 

The portion of the food is consistently small, which is no surprise to me. Quality of the food was good. But I was a bit disappointed at the Sake list, after all, it's an izakaya, where people come to drink! And it was just a bit too noisy, while it is a fun place to be, I got a bit of a headache towards the end. And I was never ever the fuzzy type!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of its kind. Hospitality is nothing short of amazing and the concept is very well executed. 

Service is great, food is quickly served, menu is pretty straightforward. The fried brie cheese and baked oysters are worth trying. It can get a little pricey, depending on how much you order. 

Quick tip: do not show up an hour and half before closing in order to avoid daily specials being sold out!

ALSO, to the men out there debating about where to take a date...from a lady's (I am using this term very loosely) perspective, it is an impressive place if you'd like to make the impression that you're hip, fun and adventurous. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is so loud and lively. As soon as I entered with 4 of my friends we were acknowledges by all the staff with a Japanese welcome (they all yelled at us in Japanese waving) LOL I thought that was cute ^_^.
Even though the place was quite busy we were not kept waiting and was served right away. The drinks were delicious. I had a lichee mojito which I enjoyed although It was quite watered down. We also ordered some apps like gyoza, pork belly spring rolls and fired chicken skins. The Japanese style bar food was yum and delicious as well. 

It was my friends birthday, so we requested the special birthday song and it was pretty awesome and hilarious lol They all sang loudly with party blowers and a tambourine. They had a personalized board that said happy birthday in Japanese with my friends name on it and they also took a picture for us and emailed it to us later that night. In stead of a slice of cake we did 8 shots ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now. Such an amazing experience. Great environment.  Very busy I suggest making reservations! My table enjoyed multiple sake bombs!  
Food was delicious servers were awesome!"}
{"text":"Good location
Good selection

BUT

Food is a hit or a miss
Uncomfortable seats
Loud and crowded during dinner
(They scream in Japanese)

i prefer the Church location."}
{"text":"Came here to try Natto! They were kind enough to let me have it as a side order, not part of the menu ensemble in the cold sashimi salad, as I couldn't eat raw foods. 
Also tried the Sabo dish with nori seaweed in side. delicious mackarel grilled and the whole meal really nutritious!! Ambience awesome, friendly chefs say hello as you walk in and waitress kind enough to explain foods to a newbie. Music excellent slow feel reggae."}
{"text":"This place was our favorite restaurant we tried on our Toronto vacay. Eating here was a true experience and the food matched the fun atmosphere. The Japanese \"tapas\" surprised us by how big the plates are. We started off with a lychee mojito and Sapporo. We ordered the salmon salad, pork on a stick, takoyaki, and the Kinoko bibimbap. 
The salmon salad came out in a pretty big bowl and my boyfriend enjoyed how the fish was a little cooked. My favorite dish of the night was the bibimbap! I've had several fusion takes on bibimbap and was a bit put off by the cheese aspect but everything mashed so well together! I don't even like seaweed but this was so delicious. It was like eating Asian risotto.
I loved the drinking specials each day and it was Thursday so we got sake bombs. I was a little afraid of what they'd do for a performance because I'm shy and don't like attention but having them sing and chant for you was really fun. Some dude wore a Canada flag headband which was a highlight of the meal/trip. If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place delivers amazing foood with amazing dining experience. I have had almost everything on the menu and loved every bite.I always end up ordering MORE and frequently checking out what the tables around me are eating and ordering what looks good. I love the stuffed oysters,so incredibly rich tasting. Fantastic pork cheek! You have to get it. If you want the deep fried brie get it for the table, you can only eat a bit. Amazing calamari with spicy ketchup! The staff is always friendly and accommodating and their washrooms are very private and clean. IT IS LOUD! I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking to catch up with a friend,but if you are looking for a unique and fun time! This is it !! 
ps. the ceasers were watery(the only thing that was less than perfection)....get the sake champagne instead!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic atmosphere, and always great menu items! I love the gigantic frosted mug of Sapporo beer, it goes with anything! This location is much easier to get a table at than their Church street location."}
{"text":"really small portion size but it was good
-fried calamari and okonomiyaki"}
{"text":"Fun place to check out. Have to make one more visit to give full review but so far I like it. Love the atmosphere, love service and love their fusion japanese food. Avoid if you are looking for quite conversation or big portion of food tho. This place is really loud and up beat, and they only have small appetizers (around $5 per dish) so expect to spend around $50 at the end of meal. Their cocktails are quite interesting to check out. 

Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place is so energetic. Great food! My friend and I did the tasting menu ($35 for about 8 dishes). The tasting menu is really worth it and you get the opportunity to try their top dishes. My absolute favorites were the baked oysters and the miso glazed black cod. These two are MUST haves. 

Drinks are reasonably priced as well!

Definitely a Toronto classic experience!"}
{"text":"After putting up with years of friends raving about how Guuud Guu is, I finally got around to going to one... the SakaBar on Bloor though, not their more popular/well-known/much-hyped Church Street Izakaya.

The presence of Guu in Toronto I think has set the tone for the way many of the newer other Japanese restaurants in town set their atmosphere, because you walk in you are greeted with !!@$?&%^%!!!!! (Don Don Izakaya will even beat a drum), and you order something and it's like !!!#@?&^$^!!!!!. When you leave it is like $^%$#^&?!!!!! You'll still get that famous memorable rowdy and happy treatment even though you walk in and it is less than an hour before close.

The front part of the SakaBar looks like a true traditional Japanese style dining experience, where you take off your shoes to enter the dining room ('toilet slippers' are provided if you need to head downstairs--and I will add that their washrooms are very well-stocked with toiletries). And you are sitting on the floor... except the sitting-on-the-floor part is an illusion, as your legs goes into a hidden trench and the table isn't lowered.

Food is served tapas style, in small tapas portions, and is meant to be shared with others like a real Japanese izakaya. Food comes very quickly, and is guuud--I enjoyed the salmon tataki (large sashimi chunks), as well as the ikapiri (calamari coated in spicy ketchup, and it was savoury like barbecue sauce). The drinks were more guuud, and I highly recommend the sake mojito, which is made with sake and a refreshing pouring of Ramune, the marble-poppin' Japanese soda. !!&??#*$!!!

That being said, each food item ranges from $3-4 to $10-ish, you will order multiple times, and the bill does add up quickly. #%#*?@&!!! I think we figured out about $40 of our hefty total can be attributed to one person: me. Try try all you want, but don't come in with an empty stomach.

I really really really wanted to like Guu, but going here when it is close to closing (they close around 23:00 for crying out loud) on a weekday, and there are not a lot of fellow diners, it was actually much, much quieter than I expected. The staff, though helpful, were not so attentive, mainly because they were in closing duties mode by the time we made our first orders. But eh, no lineups. &#@!@!!!?

{TTC: around the corner from Bathurst subway station. If only boarding a streetcar was as exciting as entering Guu...}"}
{"text":"Get off this site and go eat here. Amazing atmosphere, ridiculously delicious food, and hey, the bathrooms are cool too! Sitting at the bar is always a good option, sometimes you get extras and the random company is always a pleasure!!"}
{"text":"I've probably been to a Guu (either the original location or here) at least 30 times in the last few years?

What can I say, this place has the best environment, fast service, delectable cooked Japanese foods, a generous selection of Japanese alcohol and cocktails, a boisterous atmosphere year round. It's like there's a party at this place day in and day out.  Sometimes there are sushi selections too, like the lobster tail sashimi.  

I've probably had every single item on their menu at least once or twice, some thrice, some many, many more.

I go here so often we have a set menu scribbled down on my phone that we just hand over to the waitress. It's just that g'uuuud!

You must try the yaki udon, my favourite dish from this place. It's tapas style so portions are big enough for just one person, but between sampling their other foods, it may be enough. Me, I like to order at least two plates of this dish everytime I'm there. It's a pan fried, perfectly seasoned udon noodles with sprinkling of sesame seed, scallions, seaweed and beef!  Basked in their secret sauce of course. It's to die for! 

We always have a helluva time going here, whether it be just the two of us, or a grand party with 20 of our closest friends for the gf's birthday.  They will also sing you a overly, loud and rambunctious great birthday song, hell, the ENTIRE RESTAURANT will when it's your birthday. Your photo is taken by the staff, you're given a copy and it's posted on their Facebook page!  

Going to Guu is a experience all on its own, from the moment you are enthusiastically greeted at the doors to when you leave.. it's a true gem of Toronto that originated from Vancouver.

Until then, my gigantic mug of Sapporo and I bids you kanpai!!! (CHEEERS!!!)"}
{"text":"Guu is always a fun, loud time. The food is delicious and well priced and the fun, jovial atmosphere of the izakaya (shouting, cheering, singing) will make you smile. Sometimes there's a long wait, but they can txt your phone when a table is ready!"}
{"text":"I came herewith my best friends and had the best experience ever! The moment you come in you are welcomed warmly and taken to your seat. The food is amazing we ordered 9 dishes and every single one was delicious! My favourites were the calamari and the udon noodles so creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I started our night with dinner here and had an amazing time throughout. Although my friends are not adventurous, I told them they had nothing to worry about with the food. They were not disappointed! We had the kaarage, Tapoyaki, some Udon dish and torched sushi (can't remember the name). The cocktails were excellent! My friends did have to squeeze their own juice, but it was part of the fun. 

Be sure and order a sake bomb!"}
{"text":"Like my other guu review on church street. Excellent good, great service and if your in the mood for loud go here. No reservations so arrive early. I haven't had an item on their menu that I didn't enjoy. It can get expensive order so many items."}
{"text":"I don't know about \"small plates\" for the 30$ pp prefix meal it was more than enough we had to take some home! 

Here's what's most memorable 
- spinach with black sesame sauce- amaze balls 
- fried chicken- like mcnuggets but waaaay better 
- black cod on a miso sauce- flaky and decadent 
- mushroom cheese rice?- idk the exact description but is wear on everything you will swear you died and gone to heaven eating that shizznit 
- baked oyster with mushroom- cheesy mixed with like mushroom soup (I like mushroom soup tho) 
- beef ribs- nom nom nom 

Like I said in previous reviews I'm not much a lover of desserts soooo this dessert didn't do it for me it was a cake with whip cream. Mehhhh 

Overall- very very loud atmosphere like deafening slightly slow service"}
{"text":"I caved........... being from Vancouver - I told myself that I would not walk into a Guu in Toronto-.. only because I loved it so much in Vancouver and that's where it originated from! Plus I know how loud each location can get and knowing that the Toronto locations were at least twice the size, I wasn't sure my ear drums could handle the night.
At 7pm, the place was hustling and bustling with one area with long tables and a mini upper floor where shoes are not allowed.

My gf and I ordered a bunch of dishes to share.... some better than others, but we wanted to heighten our tastebuds with the eclectic variety of japanese food.
Her fav was tuna tataki so I was down for ordering it. To me, the texture and flavour was not anything different from what I had tasted before. I was not overly impressed but not disappointed either. It was on par and we were off to a good start.

To get some veg in our bodies, we ordered a side of rapini which was nicely sauteed... not overly oily. It was nice.

I had been craving the mushroom stone bowl and it was definitely my fav dish of the night. The server mixed everything in front of us but it was toasty, tasty and delicious. I could have finished that thing by myself if no one was around! We also ordered ramen for some variety, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The broth and noodles were very ordinary, nothing memorable.

I had ordered the japanese pancakes, which from photos, looked very appetizing but turned out to be very doughy. It had a good sauce, but unless it was piping hot, I felt like you were eating fried dough with flavour. 

I really wanted sushi so I ordered the boxed mackerel - I know many people find this to be very fishy, but I really enjoy it. The fish tasted fresh and it melted in your mouth. The rice wasn't too heavy and each piece was very memorable.

I couldn't help it but had to order dessert to share. There was a minor miscommunication with the waitress but on a good note, what she recommended was very tasty. It is soup dessert balls, but deep fried. There were two varieties - the soft mochi soupy kind with sesame (deep fried), and the original deep fried sesame coated balls as well. To top of off, there was a scoop of sesame ice cream (drools) and a chocolate wafer. Considering how much we ate, it was a little too much but I didn't care - it was sesame!

The noise level was definitely LOUDDDDDD but once in a while, it can be bearable. I would want to try the Church Guu now that I've stopped at Bloor.

GUU Toronto - you are very GUUD, but I still miss GUU Vancouver too!"}
{"text":"Have to update my review since they made some changes. Now they take reservations ( Bloor location only), and the service was much faster this time. 
I'd love the restaurant to change their policy about the prefix menu, because when you have about ten people it's hard to make everybody eat the same thing.
The food was still amazing! No complains!"}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya is an authentic Japanese restaurant that serves Starters, Cold Dishes, Salads, Deep Fried Items, Grilled and Baked Items, Rice and Noodles Items, and Sweets. The restaurant has dimmed lighting and popular hip hop music playing. There are a bunch of photos of Japanese geishas on the walls. The basket woven wall had empty beer bottles hanging from it.

My party of six shared items from each category. I liked majority of the items except Unagi Somen and Sashimi Salad because I am allergic to horseradish and they mixed in the wasabi mayo.

For drinks, we shared pitchers of Sapporo beer.

For Starters, we had Gomaae, which consisted of blanched spinach drizzled with a thick black sesame sauce and sprinkled with white sesame seeds.

For Cold Dishes, we had Maguro Tataki, which consisted of seared British Columbia tuna sashimi served over shredded radish in ponzu sauce and garnished with crispy garlic chips and 
Salmon Natto Yukke, which consisted of chopped salmon sashimi, natto, takuan, shibazuke, Scallion, cucumber, garlic chips, and raw egg yoke. Like a bibimbop, it came unmixed. It reminded me of a tartare because you would put the mixed ingredients on a piece of lightly salted nori.

For Salad, we ordered all three - Seaweed and Tofu Salad, Sashimi Salad, and Gyu Shabu Salad. My favorite one was the Seaweed and Tofu, which consisted of fresh mixed greens, silken tofu, and marinated seaweed tossed in a sweet sesame dressing. The Sashimi Salad consisted of fresh mixed greens topped with wasabi mayo drizzled assorted sashimi. The Gyu Shabu Salad consisted of fresh mixed greens toped with shabu shabu beef and julianned bell peppers tossed in a black sesame dressing.

For Specials, we ordered the Unagi Somen, which consisted of cold somen noodles served in dashi broth with BBQ eel, soft boiled egg, shredded egg omelette, scallion, and nori. I didn't like how the BBQ eel was drizzled with wasabi mayo. It didn't make consuming at an enjoyable experience.

For Deep Fried Items, we ordered Takoyaki, which consisted of deep fried octopus balls served in tonkatsu sauce, drizzled with mayo, and topped with bonito flakes, and Agedashi Tofu, which consisted of crispy deep fried tofu in dashi broth. I think the Takoyaki would be better if not drenched in tonkatsu sauce.

For Grilled and Baked Items, we ordered Kakimayo, which consisted of two large baked British Columbia oysters topped with mushrooms, spinach, garlic mayo and cheese, Gindara, which consisted of a grilled miso marinated black cod served over yuzu miso sauce, and Karubi, which consisted of grilled miso marinated beef short ribs. The Kakimayo reminded me of Oyster Rockefeller. I liked that the beef short ribs weren't too fatty. 

For Rice and Noodles, we ordered Saba Oshizushi, which consisted of blowtorched cured mackerel pressed sushi with grated daikon radish, and Salmon Oshizushi, which consisted of blowtorched Atlantic salmon pressed sushi with wasabi mayo. I loved the Saba Oshizushi.

For Sweets, we ordered Matcha Mousse, which consisted of Green Tea Mousse with a graham cracker crust served with a scoop of red bean paste and a scoop of Matcha ice cream, and Almond Tofu, which consisted of cold, silky smooth, strong almond scented tofu gelatin served in a cup topped with whipped cream and garnished with a gojiberry."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is alright. Many good options to choose from. 

However, my experience was horrible that they don't allow single diner to try the set menu, which cost $40 per person. The guy is trying to charge me for $80, what a joke man. I am not stupid. 

To me this is straight discrimination...wow against single diner. This is just not acceptable.

FYI, $40 per person is already expensive."}
{"text":"SUPER DUPER LOUD. If you're looking for a super welcoming and screaming/excited environment, this is your dining opportunity. They bang on pots and tambourines when people get sake bombs -- which was often. Wish I had known it was THIS loud; you've really got to learn how to read lips cuz I could barely hear my friend yelling at me from across the table.

As long as you're aware of this kind of scene, this place is great! I'd recommend the food!! Got yellowtail sashimi, unagi bibimbap, takoyaki, salmon tayaki, and a version of Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"I liked the food, a lot, but as per usual I am going to complain about the noise. This place is amazingly loud! As in, every time someone walks in the door, all of the staff yell something incomprehensible. There are large communal tables to share with strangers, which adds (or subtracts, depending on your opinion) to the atmosphere. Went here with a couple of friends, and we ended up leaving early because we couldn't hear ouselves think, and my friend apologised for suggesting it! As we headed out, we saw a room where everyone was sitting on the floor - it looked quieter, maybe worth a try? The whole experience just made me feel really old. So, if you are in your 20s, you will probably love it."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets! (Couldn't think of anything else to start off my review...)
But honestly, this place is amazing. I've also been to Guu at Church and I can't say I have a favourite; they both are! 

The difference with this Guu is more seating and a bit more of a convenience location for me as I live in the west end and this Guu is near a station. 
They also have a different menu, but of course its all really good. 
We were coming in for a party of four, but me and my friend were super early, but even though it was busy, they sat us and waited until the rest of our party arrived. 

We ordered a bunch of items including

1. Karaage (6.8) (who doesn't love fried chicken)
2.  Maguro Tataki (7.3): I absolutely love raw food.. so this dish hit the spot perfectly for me It's seared tuna sashimi on top of a bed of greens with garlic chips.
3. Saba Oshisushi (11.8): Literally meaning \"Mackarel Delicious Sushi\". It's already seasoned so DON'T DRENCH IT IN SOY SAUCE. IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF SUSHI. Take a  moment and actually taste the sushi. It's like a poem in your mouth. 
4. Kinoko Bibimbap (8.8): Not too much of a fan of rice... or cheese.. so this dish wasn't my favourite. But if I had to eat rice and cheese together, this would be it :) 

As for drinks, we got .. almost every cocktail there haha. The only thing I WOULDN'T recommend is a Caesar.. But that's expected. The best was the Ramune Grapefruit; you got to squeeze your own grapefuit juice to put in it! 

Overall, I would come again. It's a fantastic atmosphere and so much fun, especially with a big group of friends!"}
{"text":"I should've reviewed this place weeks ago but here I am ready to write up about this amazing place.

The decor of this place has a very traditional Japanese vibe going on, with wooden chair, wooden tables and wooden everything! The other half of the restaurant has a no-shoes seating area and it looked more spacious and comfy than the other half of the restaurant where it was just a bunch of crowded tables (but you're closer to the kitchen and you get free entertained by watching the awesome interactions between the colleagues here).

The beer here is fresh, crisp and delicious. Sapporo & Asahi, yum yum but Asahi all the way! Their cocktails are good as well and if you're feeling adventurous, they've got all sorts of unique Japanese cocktails to try from!

Now onto the food, one word, DELICIOUS! The menu can be hard to read because there are no pictures at all but the descriptions of each dish is crucial, especially if you're not adventurous and want to stick with things that are common to your palette. I've been here twice and the food did not disappoint. I've sampled a bunch of dishes here but the ones that really stood out was their carbonara udon, karaage chicken, kakimayo and green tea cheese cake!

Their carbonara udon is heaven on a plate. Smooth, creamy and packs a flavour. This italian-japanese fusion flavours works really well together and you definitely won't be disappointed.

Their karaage chicken is pretty standard but it's a super popular choice and if you're not feeling too adventurous with trying new things and you want to play it safe, chicken wouldn't hurt and the way they fry these bad boys is perfect. Combined with the Japanese mayo they give you, absolutely delicious.

Their kakimayo is also another great dish, two pieces of giant B.C oysters topped with mushrooms, cheese and pesto/garlic like sauce on top, incredibly flavourful. The shell is enormous but the oyster piece is tiny, shame but this dish still hits the spot for me.

Dessert...dessert..definitely get the green tea cheese cake. IT'S AWESOME. I've never had such a good piece of this before. Most places that sell them, you can barely taste the matcha green tea flavour but Guu does it right! Smooth and light, you'll be back for more.

Overall, this place is a great for a little get together with friends. It can get loud in here and every so often, you'll hear all of the waitresses/waiters + kitchen staff shout as their customers enter and exit their restaurant. It can get quite expensive but if you order the right dishes, you'll be fine but if you're going to experiment and sample the food, prepare for an expensive time. The more people the merrier and you guys can split the bill amongst each other. 

If you come to Guu, you'll definitely be in for a treat!"}
{"text":"It's loud. It's awesome. The drinks are great. The food is even better. And it's not as busy as its other location."}
{"text":"I went on yelp to find a good japanese restaurant, because generally I don't like Japanese food. Too much raw stuff, and too much fish. 

Their food is like Japanese meets New American.

Anyway, when I read \"And what's their obsession with spicy mayo on fried food. It really starts to get old when all the dishes come out swimming in grease and spicy mayo.\" in the review below, I thought this is the place for me. I love japanese mayo and I love greasy Chicken Karaage. 

None of the food was what I would call greasy. They use oil, yes, and if you're expecting most of your food to come out uncooked and bland like at most Japanese restaurants, you're not going to like Guu. 

We had Bibimbap (leave it for a few minutes and it gets a crust on the bowl), which was Rice with seaweed, cheese, mushrooms, and egg). I don't like seaweed but it was sooo subtle yet sooo delicious!

Chicken Karaage was A+

We also had rice bowls with sweet soy, deep fried brie (too much brie for just two people, and you should try and eat it a tiny bite at a time). 

There was a line up at the door when we left. The whole staff greeted us when we arrived and said goodbye when we left, which put an immediate smile on our faces. 

I like going where people are. There was so many people in this place, it was like a cacophonous symphony of people really loving their night out!

It was noisy, as a restaurant should be! This is a great place to take a date if you want to impress them with your slick style, but don't want to spend too much money. If you're not sure about how the date conversation will go, best to take her here where you can't hear what the other person is saying anyway =)

The best thing was the service. We asked for our bill and after we paid, she filled up our water glasses so we didn't feel like we had to leave. 

Dinner for 3 (2 Rice bowls plus four mains and pop) $42!!!"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant.
Great loud atmosphere, great food and drinks.
Very different from other Toronto restaurants, In the way they greet/say bye to everyone that comes in and leaves the restaurant (Not only are they doing this all night, they also do it with some excitement which is very hard to keep up all night).

Will definitely be coming back, hopefully I get to sit in the \"special\" room next time. Seems like it's allot more quieter, and it's definitely allot more prettier/more of a Japanese experience."}
{"text":"I finally went to Guu. It was everything I had imagined and more. Walking into the restaurant is like walking into a serious-ass party. The atmosphere is loud and boisterous. Everyone is having a good time too. You will as well.

The food is amazing. They have a tapas menu which features all sorts of great stuff. Get the black cod, because it is delicious. Get the seared tuna, for the same reason. Really, I don't think we went wrong with anything we got.

The place is packed. You will most definitely need to line up, possibly for ages. They'll also kick your asses out after 2 hours because the place is so packed. They want everyone to get their turn, which seems fair.

I already want to go again."}
{"text":"I am probably one of the few people that are not exactly wow'd by this place overall.  Hey I like the energy, and the concept is good.  What I don't like about it is that there are no pictures of the food.  Everytime I have gone I feel intimidated when I look at the menu, is this what non chinese people feel like when they go into a chinese restaurant?  More onto that later...

First off, the food is not bad.  The prices are somewhat reasonable and it matches the portions that you get.  The prices are around $6.80 - $15 but for what you get it's not bad.  Don't expect huge portions for the lower end of the price point.

Seating - if you plan on going on a Friday or weekend you better be prepared to wait a long time unless you like to eat right at five.  We got here at 6:30 and didn't get a table until an hour later.  When we inquired how much longer it would be approximately, we were told that there was a table of 17 and a table of 8 ahead of us.  Fifteen minutes later we got our table.

If you want the authentic japanese (sitting on the floor style) eating they have that option here.  You take off your shoes and leave them in the shoe area.  ***If you plan on sitting in this area make sure you are wearing socks because no one wants to smell your feet!  Be careful as you make your way to your seat because it can be slippery as you glide your way to your seat.  Don't get me started about trying to sit down.  The table is located close to the floor and they cut out the bottom so you can dangle your feet.  Getting up is tricky because you almost have to sort of get into the middle fo the aisle as you try to get up.  Make sure there is no one behind you when you try to get up because you wouldn't want to collide with a server who has food or plates in their hand.

Last time we were hear the three of us spent $79 and I was left feeling hungry.  This time with an extra person I decided to order a whole bunch of stuff and double some reliable dishes.  After a $117 plus tip (ouch) we were very full and I actually over ordered.

Some really good staples are the fried chicken $6.80 I think, and the squid.  The Brie cheese is good if you eat it when it's hot but afterwards it tastes like fried cheese whiz.  Fried shrimp with spicy mayo is good.  Service can be lacking when it's busy but later on it got more efficient.

I would avoid the Udon noodles, it tastes like a fettuccine sauce Ala Asian style.  Not a big fan of that.  

When you leave everyone shouts (my sister and her friend think they are saying thank you come again but it didn't sound like \"domo arigato, sayanara\")  It could very well be \"get out\".  Who knows."}
{"text":"I'm glad I waited awhile to visit the second Guu location, because I did not experience any of the service issues noted in earlier reviews. Service was excellent!

I will even say that I like this location better than Guu Izakaya on Church. This could be because the Annex is \"my hood\", plus the fact that there is no wait to get in at Sakabar certainly sweetens the deal. We walked straight in at 7:30pm and were seated within a few minutes. 

We were a bit foolish with our food selections, but we tried 5 dishes:

Shrimp sashimi (special menu) - beautifully presented, very fresh, but not something I would order again. It's pretty hard to get full when the dish is 5 pieces of raw shrimp and you are sharing.

Tuna sashimi - completely delicious, just like I remembered at the other Guu location

Buta Shabu salad - another delicious one. Tasty peanut/sesame dressing with pork over salad greens.

Deep fried tofu (special menu) - this was Guud but not great

I forget the name of the last dish but it was another fish dish off the special menu, some kind of deep fried cod strips. It was very good too but not amazing.

I really enjoyed THE DRINKS. The LIMOJITOS (lime mojitos) were delicious and not badly priced at $6. The sapporo was good too (served in either a small girl-sized mug or a large man-sized mug)

We also saw someone getting the BIRTHDAY SAKE which looked awesome! They bring you a tray with 5 sake shooters (displayed on some kind of pyramid looking platter) and they come out singing happy birthday and banging some kind of huge drum. It's only $18. Next time I might pretend it's my bday.

What really makes it a unique experience (besides the food) is the atmosphere - chaotic and lively, you can't find anything else like it in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fun place to try out lots of different Japanese pub food. Karaage chicken, takoyaki, and the sesame ice cream are my favorites here."}
{"text":"IN-CREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.

The food was GREAT - everything was just perfect - in proportion, flavour and even the presentation was delicious- except ONE but even that weird little soup with salmon rice ball and a wonderful broth!

This place is certainly out of the ordinary in the western culture; little baskets for your belongings, waitstaff screaming in Japanese that seem perpetually happy and the music that really just made me want to get up on the table and dance.

I haven't a clue what it is my friend ordered for me here but everything was delicious - the staff were friendly and prompt and adorable. In the traditional Asian fashion they embarrassed the life out of the poor folks who had friends who let the staff know that it was their birthday.  With the exception of the birthday thing, this reminded me of the time when I did visit Korea and Japan - very lively, happy and I swear digestion happens so much faster when you're happy.

The screaming may not be the type of place y'all would eat; but really you're not necessarily going  to pick HERE for just the food; this place provides an entire experience. An experience YOU SHOULD HAVE."}
{"text":"This place is great and quite the experience. I came with my boyfriend and we had a nice time sampling a few different plates. It's hard to describe as Guu is the very essence of fusion food. It's definitely not for people who lack a sense of adventure with their food. If that's the case, you'll probably have trouble finding something on the menu that sounds safe and familiar.

I'm not a big sake drinker and wasn't really feeling a cocktail so I stuck with water, until my boyfriend's Sake Mojito arrived and I tasted it. It was fantastic and very refreshing, so I ordered one of my own. 

We tried to order a different parts of the menu. Sorry if this gets redundant, but it was all good: 
-From the starters we opted for the takowasabi (marinate octopus). This had a kick to it, but was flavourful and delicious. The octopus wasn't too chewy either, which it often can be.
-From the cold dishes we tried the salmon tataki (salmon sashimi). This dish was beautiful and came with nori and rice so you could roll the fish into pieces of sushi. Also very good.
-Because of the yelp reviews, we ordered the deep fried brie. Absolutely incredible. The brie was wonderful, the breading wasn't greasy or overpowering and the sauce it was in was sweet and delicious.
-The kakimayo was our selection from the grilled/baked section and this was easily the highlight of our dinner. The baked oysters were enormous and both of us were scraping the bottom of the shells. I want to try other things on the menu, but I certainly cannot resist ordering this again.
-We were still hungry after these and ordered the Yaki Udon. Very good. A dish I wish I could eat every day. I live right down the street now, so I guess I could! 

Nice experience overall, though it was hard at first to flag down someone to take our order. Well worth the confusion though."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Guu for ages now, based on the hype and fun reviews this place gets. 

The food was decent ( I enjoyed the seared tuna, the beef carpaccio and the yaki udon best) and the prices are reasonable (about $25 per head-not including alcohol-to fill your boots)  but the service we received was embarrassing. 

Sitting for ages with empty water glasses, we were planning on thirstily ordering some mojitos, but no one came to check on us. 

Eventually we ordered two portions of dessert, \"green tea steamed buns with vanilla ice cream\". When they arrived they were nothing more than green, dry crumbly muffins with ice cream on top, not what we anticipated. We wanted to order something else, but no one came for 30 minutes. Our ice cream was a puddle at this point, and no one was touching it. Eventually, a new server arrived to whisk away our untouched, soggy desserts.  We inquired about our server, and we were informed that he had gone to \"clean the bathroom\". Bad form. 

Apparently Guu has a policy that once you have a bite of something, they can not take it off of your bill, even if you did not enjoy it. I've never heard of anything like this in all my years of working in restaurants. We wrestled with this for an astounding 20 minutes or so, while the waiters went back and forth three (!) times to the managers, insisting that we must still pay for them. Finally, they got permission to take the two $4 dollar desserts off of the bill. After this, it took another 15 minutes to receive our final bill.

We were not being cheap by refusing to pay the $8, but would have liked to maybe order something else in its place given the opportunity. The fact that getting an item taken off the bill is such a laborious chore speaks more to the cheapness of the restaurant than the customer. 

Will unlikely return."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favourite places in Toronto for years and my favorite Izakaya (haven't been to one in Japan yet...) 

My favourite items have to be the Kabocha Karokke, a pumpkin mash hiding a hard-boiled egg inside with a sauce similar to Big Mac sauce drizzled on top. Second favourite would be the Maguro Tataki, a tasty well-marinated tuna seared around the edges and served cold. 

All dishes here are well-marinated and full of flavour. 

This place is loud! So don't come here if you want an intimate date. This is a great place to come to celebrate a birthday and have some fun."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, the atmosphere is amazing. When you first walk in everyone greets you so be prepared cause its loud! The food was amazing, a unique spin on familiar dishes! Thank goodness my cousin ordered everything for us or else I'd be lost, everything she ordered was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Ah Guu - the everyman izakaya - it is the all things to all men.  Affordable, decent quality, fun atmosphere, appropriate for a date or just slamming down mega Sapporos with your boys.

So I have to do it - I have to play the Vancouver card here... something is off.

The food is similar in quality to Vancouver Guu's - small portions of tasty morsels to go along with drinking.  It's a winning formula:  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The beer is surprisingly a wee bit more expensive than the Vancouver Guu locations.  Only slightly - $9 for 1L of Sapporo has such a nicer ring to it - but I didn't think it was possible to have higher liquor prices than BC with all it's draconian liquor laws.

And the space seems too big - sure, most Guus are loud as hell but it still manages to feel relatively intimate.  SakaBar is laid out like a cafeteria.

But what throws me off is the atmosphere.  This is the first time I've ever heard background music in *any* izakaya (in North America or in Japan) I've ever been in.  Izakayas are loud and boisterous places already - why pipe in crappy music when the loud din of drinking patrons is all you need?  I want to hear loud cursing in English or Japanese from the patrons - that's what I want to hear in an izakaya.  Not shitty ambient music.  Cut that shit out.

It's the least favourite of all the Guu's I've been to - but it's still Guu.  It's safe, consistent and nearly everyone knows it.  3-stars."}
{"text":"Insanely loud and awful top 40 music blaring non stop plus all the usual yelling by the staff make this an extremely annoying experience. The food is very average izakaya fare. Nothing really special here whatsoever."}
{"text":"Four of us were at Kinka for their Kinkalicious menu. The food was very good but came out a bit too fast. We had a two hour window to eat and we could have been done in less than an hour."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Monday night for a dinner for two. We had a reservation but it wasn't so busy on a Monday night that you couldn't walk in without one. 

Ordered a 1L mug of Sapporo for myself and a Matcha au lait for my girlfriend.

For food, we got a recommended Shima aji (striped jack) sashimi from Japan, which was OK, not my favourite fish, but a nice start. We also had tako wasabi (her favourite) and the salmon natto yukke. I was interested to try the yukke cause I hadn't tried natto before. Not sure how much it came through, the taste was more of the garlic and it was the textures that stood out. Interesting though. We also had the unagi bibimbap and karaage. These were both good and flavourful but I thought our plate of karaage seemed kind of small compared to our neighbours'.

Finally we had a almond tofu as a light dessert, which was nice, light and sweet.

Altogether ~$80. Service is good, the waiters/waitresses and atmosphere loud but friendly."}
{"text":"I guess as really looking forward to this place as the menu choices looked great and the 4/5 stars in Yelp.
It was busy but the two of us were quickly seated.

We walked out. We got no service; perhaps the young staff only serve those under 40 as the whole crowd was young.

The main reason we walked out was it was so loud we couldn't even talk to each other being sat across from each other and had to converse by texting each other on our phones.

The staff, especially kitchen staff, should spend less time coming out and banging pots and yelling and cheering customers with birthdays etc and more time serving them!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute bomb. The tuna melts in your mouth. The short-ribs are to die for. Can't go wrong with the grapefruit vodka. Environment is loud and upbeat and fun. 

This is true Japanese cuisine delight."}
{"text":"Amazing experience from start to finish! Service was great and the atmosphere was something unique yet comforting. I couldn't begin to specifically choose what dishes are the best because they are all worth trying! This place is a must try. The staff is amazing, they really take care of you. My drink never had a chance to sit empty on the table. This is one place I cant wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Another Guu! In Toronto!  We want more!  My friends came here on a Saturday evening to check out the new Guu SakaBar tucked away in the little corner at Bloor and Bathurst.  We waited for about 50 minutes to grab a seat for 4.  We got to sit inside in the zashiki room - a nice touch to a make the place more \"authentically Japanese.\"  

Energy and service was awesome.  It was quite loud - so I wouldn't suggest to go on a first date here.  The group next to us had a birthday, so they got everyone to sing happy birthday to her.  It was really fun.

Food-wise, I was a bit disappointed.  I was wow'ed like how I was at Guu Izakaya, and I guess you can't really compare the freshness of the fish like the Guu's in Vancouver.

We ordered the following: 
1) KABOCHA KOROKKE:  The pumpkin wasn't as big as the one at Guu Izakaya; not only that - I felt like it was much \"chunkier.\"  The other Guus that I went to had a \"melt in your mouth\" kind of taste to it.
2) TAKOWASABI:  Perhaps it's just me, but I found the wasabi too strong, and the octopus wasn't as fresh as I hoped.
3) EDAMAME: The salt was a good touch but I think a bit too much of it was on it.
4) 5 KINDS ASSORTED (SKEWERS):  I wasn't a fan of this at all.  I don't know why, but I really didn't enjoy having ham, root lotus, onion, etc. fried.  It felt like they just wanted to grab whatever and deep fry it.
5) YAKI UDON:  I thoroughly enjoyed the udon, but my friends said it was a bit too salty.
6) EBI MAYO: Can't complain about this one -- the fried shrimp worked very well with the sauce that they had provided
7) CALAMARI:  I enjoyed this one as well.  It was a bit on the saltier side, but I liked the little kick that they had with the octopus.

Surprisingly, we didn't order any sake (we should've.. considered it's a sake bar).  

Overall, it was a fun experience.  But I liked Guu Izakaya a lot more (and I think I was just spoiled by the Guu in Vancouver that I went to recently)."}
{"text":"I had a set menu of nine items for 35 dollars. I understand that at an izakaya the portions are supposed to be small but I felt that some of the items were really small.

The food itself was good, a lot of good flavours and fresh seafood. In my opinion for the price of the food I dont think it is a place I would frequent."}
{"text":"Same great menu as Guu Izakaya.  Went on wings night and also had great selection of fatty fishes.  Grilled fishes too, Gindara, Hokke, awesome.  

Kabocha korokke, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, buta kimchi bibimbap...everything is good."}
{"text":"Love the hot bowl mushroom rice and pumpkin egg dish.  Super friendly service, topped off with giggles!  Udon noodles were good as well.  Overall liked the ambiance and worth the wait!  Definitely would recommend.  I don't eat seafood so didn't try the sushi but the cooked meat and veggies were yummmmm!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge guu fan ... being from vancouver. So naturally my izakaya standards are pretty high but this one wasn't the best, i must say. 

3 stars for effort, atmosphere, and overall.

It's definitely not a cheap place ... everything is tapa portion and tiny, so you're gonna need many plates (or a half-satiated appetite!). We started with a pitcher of beer, close to $20 ... the total bill was $70 w/tax+tip for two people. 

I read something about a fried brie cheese? YEAH i would skip that ... totally not my thing. it sounded intriguing? but also weird? should've gone with that instinct initially!

we also had the okonomiyaki ... which was a lot of fun. but TINY! tiniest portions I've ever seen. the beef carpaccio was the best ... thinly slices of raw meat. can't go wrong. we also had this cha-siu pork dish? the meat was GOOD but ... the dish lacked. it could've used something else with it instead it was just ... pork. 

we also had the kimchi udon which was average and not spectacular for the price.

was i unhappy with the meal? not entirely.  would i come back? probably not."}
{"text":"The food is very good but I feel like I'm going to lose my hearing after going to this place. All of the staff literally shout out the order. I had one staff came right beside me and start yelling her  order. It sounds like that one of the staff is going to lose ber voice. My friends and I were so annoyed how noisy the place is. We were shouting as well just to have a conversation. 
I could be wrong, maybe some people actually like it that way. It's going to be a difficult choice for me to actually go back if my friends invited me again.

I would love to recommend the place but it's very hard to do so."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is savoury and I love it. Their kakimayo (baked oysters) are to die for!"}
{"text":"Such a good experience at Izakaya!! despite the high volume of people, the servers are always around!! It's a good place for those who are looking for a jap culture bar, and just enjoy the hyper atmosphere..  

The fries food are really good! Just wasn't enjoying the balled-sushi very much 'cause personally I'd prefer more fish than rice on a sushi.. 

Overall, 4 stars & I'm definitely returning again!"}
{"text":"Everything here is just great. Many many vegetarian options that are just as carefully put together as the meat items. 

I had a very satisfying meal here with good drinks (OMG the pear sake drink is crazy good). 

One note is that it gets extremely noisy, and while that's part of the fun atmosphere it does get annoying as it's just the waiters communicating with the kitchen. They could keep it down a little bit and still have a fun restaurant. 

I didn't think they took reservations, but according to Alison I. they do. That would have made the experience a bit better since they have a Tatami Room (I think..) which is a bit farther away from the kitchen and generally quieter seeming. 

But all in all, this is a great place to celebrate and get a Satrurday night started!"}
{"text":"GUU!!!is!!!so!!!awesome!!!

That's what I told my dinner date when we had a dinner at Guu SakaBar last weekend. 

My experience with Guu was wonderful: I loved the food, the staff and the boisterous atmosphere. I loved that when my friend A and I sat that the bar to observe the high-paced kitchen action, we were greeted by all of the staff. I loved it when we left, all of the staff waved us goodbye. Can every restaurant be like this? Because I'm so coming back! 

There's about 103 reviews describing this place to a T so I will keep this review short and sweet. Here are my tips:

- It's worth it to arrive early. Throw out your ideas that a restaurant must be pretentious if you have to line-up early because that's crap, especially about this place. Guu SakaBar has delicious food and great staff and not at all pretentious. 

- Do sit at the bar. It may not be as cozy or comfortable as the tables but it's so entertaining to see the kitchen staff work cohesively and having fun in the process. 

What we drank:
- Ume Mojito
- Three Samurai
- Guutini

What we ate:
- Sashimi Salad
- Sea urchin sushi (from the specials menu)
- Salmon Natto Yukke: chopped salmon sashimi, cucumber, garlic chips, natto, takuan, scallion, shibazuke and raw egg yolk)
- Kakimayo: baked oyster with mushroom, spinach, garlic mayo and cheese
- Karaage: deep fried chicken with garlic mayo
- Beef tongue tacos: these were a special so I can't remember what they were called but they were tasty!

Overall, my experience was a great one and because we were celebrating my friend's birthday, it was a lovely night."}
{"text":"I think I might have been the last Asian person in the city to try this place and I finally did. Finally! 

I don't remember exactly what my group ordered but there was not one dish that I did not enjoy. I'm not even a big fan of oysters but the baked oysters with garlic and cheese was delicious. 

My favorite item was the spinach. Sounds underrated but it was so simple and the sesame was refreshing. Everyone loved this dish. 

Other things that are mentionable:
Kaarage: typical dish, pieces are big enough so that you don't have to eat more than one. 

Oyster with garlic and cheese: perfection. And I don't even like oysters. 

Udon carbonara: nice twist with thick noodles. I liked this better than the kimchi Udon.

Kudos to the staff for the last minute reservation for a table at 7 for a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Fun, loud, & frenzied, but in a good way!
Japanese style 'tapas' servings, and cheap beer are a good combo! Definitely try the okonomiyaki!"}
{"text":"I sent my son a list of restaurants with good reviews on Yelp before his birthday and he chose to come here for his birthday.

We made reservation in advance and therefore we got seats as soon as we walked in. 

We ordered:
1. Gyu Carpaccio
2. Maguro Tataki
3. Salmon Tataki
4. Takoyaki
5. Karaage (This is the best Karaage I have ever had - We ordered 2)
6. Tontoro (excellent!!!)
7. Yaki Undon (so tasty!!! I didn't expect it this good)
8. Saba Isguzushi
9. Kabocha Korokke (really good)
10. Okonomyyaki
11. Assorted dessert for my son birthday (Almond tofu, matcha ice cream, matcha cheesecake, and hojicha brulee)

They came and sung happy birthday to him which made his day.

On the way driving back home, the restaurant called us (we made reservation, so they know our phone number), but we didn't recognize the phone number, so we didn't answer.  When we got home, they called again and apologized to us.  They said that they gave the wrong bill which we paid more than what we supposed to pay.  I thought the bill was highest than I expected, but since it was my son's birthday, I didn't complain nor look at the bill line by line.  So they told us that they will not charge us for our dinner.  We said that they can just charge us the correct dollar amount, but they said that they made mistake and therefore, won't charge us.  That was so honest and extremely nice of them.  If they didn't call us, we had no idea that we were paying for someone's else meal.

I really appreciate the honesty of this restaurant. We definitely will come back to support them beside enjoying good foods and fun atmosphere. 

Happy yelping!!"}
{"text":"Not as busy as the Guu Izakaya on Church. Even since this location opened, I have never gone back to the other Guu. There are so many Izakaya's now in Toronto but Guu has always been the one I go back to because it never disappoints me.

They have a good variety of dishes with the special menu updated daily. The price is reasonable but I would like to see more variety in the dessert menu though :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I like more at Guu - the food or the energy. Both are incredible every time I've been there.

I'll start with the service. Part of the fun of going to Guu is having 20 employees yell at you in Japanese when you enter the restaurant. They're yelling because they're happy to see you! The key is to embrace this and roll with it. It's a lot more fun if you interact with the staff. The servers are always really busy, but I've never had an issue with waiting for food or assistance.

The food is amazing. Some days all I can think about is their salmon tataki (my boyfriend and I each have to order our own because it's too good to share). Other favourites include the udon and the kimchi hot pot. Deep fried brie is also an item we usually order (it's hard to pass up deep fried cheese). 

Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone that's looking for a place to have a good time at (it's pretty popular with the drinking crowd it seems, although I typically just go for dinner). I also think it's a great date spot if you don't mind going to a place that gets a bit loud."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm hesitant to give a 5 because I do have some issues, but there's really nowhere else to go if you want this kind of food/atmosphere. seriously, they have almost ZERO competition. plus this strip of bloor, despite being lined with restaurants, is actually pretty bleak in selection if you want something other than pork bone soup or mex-fusion breakfast. 

I prefer this location to the church one, they have more seating options, (A tatami room where you can actually hear each other!) less waiting, and is located only 5 minutes away from my house, but the church guu has better food options.

what i recommend ordering:
kakimayo - oyster in spinach cheese sauce, must have! just don't get ahead of yourself and start licking the salt on the shell

tuna tataki - goes down so creamy and smooth. there's a joke in here somewhere.

kinoko bimbimbap - i actually dislike most bimbimbap in general but this is a new take if you're used to the korean version. the nutty, crunchy flavour is addictive. scarf down while piping hot, scalding of tongue optional 

beef sashimi - its thinness is comparative with tissue paper. It was delicious, at least, I think so because I think it dissolved before I could fully comprehend the taste

almond tofu - at first I thought, how great can this be, you can get almond tofu for a dollar at T&T. but guu's version is so much more flavourful and silky, a perfect finisher after all the grease and deep-fry consumed. it also has a lingering aftertaste so you can eat it slowly and savour.

otoro lovers - i think this is on the special sometimes. it's a bunch of tuna sashimi. i mean, it's OTORO, so you really can't go wrong there.

salmon natto yukke: salmon and 7 friends. I think I'd like to be their 8th friend. The only real way to make natto taste good.

other good options: cow tongue, pork cheek, pumpkin korokke, brie cheese (share with a lot of people, one of these almost gave me a heart attack)

----

service: hit and miss. sometimes we have to wait forever for our order (over 30 minues for a piece of fish), other times they whip them up so fast we don't even have room on the table. In my experience, I tend to get served faster when I go in a larger group. at least their attitude is always perky and friendly."}
{"text":"Poor service, and expensive for what you get. They ran out of their main dishes and we had nothing to eat but the little tapas style dishes"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday with a group of 20 for a friend's birthday. They take reservations and was very accommodating. Do only do separate bills in groups of 6 ppl not individually. However food came relatively fast even though we had a huge group. Also they didn't miss any orders. Atmosphere was awesome. It is a little on the pricier side but with a group you can try many things.

On weekdays they have special set meals for $23. 

Overall great for groups and would come back"}
{"text":"This place is just...wow. From right when I entered, all you hear are all the employees (literally ALL) shouting welcome (presumably) to me. I expected a grand entrance, but that just blew me off.

I got a seat in the counter, as the table section was relatively full (although by the time I arrived at around 6:30pm there were more people leaving than arriving, and the place was never really full even when I left at 7:20pm). As I was sitting, all the chefs started shouting at us, presumably welcoming us to the counter. By all means, thank you.

Since we weren't that hungry (hence why we came here!), we only ordered 4 dishes: Tacoyaki, okonomiyaki, carbonara udon, and yaki udon. The tacoyaki was about as par as Kenzo (which had the best tacoyaki in my opinion), but cheaper at $5 and one less piece. The okonomiyaki satisfied me, although my friend said Okonomi House does it better. The udons, however, were our favourite dishes. The udon was very chewy, the sauce was just good enough for both of us, and the ingredients were overall very delicious (except the fact we kinda cracked the egg yolk before even attempting to eat it).

I'll definitely come back here, though I wonder how electric the Izakaya place is...PS: Guu is open for lunch now! Bonus!"}
{"text":"If you want a light-broth shoyu ramen, this is the place to get it. My favourite ramen in the city."}
{"text":"Really not impressed, service was horrible! Not just bad, horrible! Half out food came out on time, the other half two AN HOUR AND A HALF! Server could care less and even dared to say after \"we'll, wasn't it worth it?!\" Actually no. No it wasn't. Food is alright. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Loud, lively with delicious Japanese food! Great for a large group of people. Loved the calamari, Karaage and baked oysters(highly recommended)!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Kinka after work with our friends. Food is great and staff is friendly!  Will go again soon. 

For drinks we had mojito (sake and ume)
For food, we had karaage, ebi mayo, okonomi, udon, beef skewers and especially liked the oshizushi and wagyu onigiri."}
{"text":"I took my parents on their anniversary  a couple years ago.
We ordered almost 100 dollars worth of food and everything is absolutely delicious.  We had the pressed torched sushi which was phenomenal then the taoyaki balls melts in your mouth.  The udon noodles were really good with a touch of seaweed I can keep coming.back to.this place forever"}
{"text":"Again, another hit for guu. (Hit out of the park?)

I am in love with the room to the right, where you go shoeless and sit on straw mats, while the tables are close to the floor. I know, I know, it's basically like a normal table and chair, but the chair is built into the room...but hey, don't knock. It's still cool.

As with the other location, great food. My friend and I got the ribs and the mackerel to share (need to brush up on my nonexistent Japanese skills...so don't know the official cultured names of these dishes) and they were scrumptious as always. The mackerel in particular was tender, juicy, and seared to perfection.

I had the sake mojito this time around. I love mojitos. I love ramune. (Both tables beside us turned to watch as we caused a commotion releasing the marble.) I loved the sake mojito. Pretty easy to understand, I think.

No munchie goodies with the bill, but I will gladly trade those for the awesome mats on the floor.

(Oh, probably obvious, but it's LOUD. bring a megaphone.)"}
{"text":"Izakayas were our favourite style of eatery in Japan, so we couldn't resist the chance to try one out when we found this place in Toronto.  Service was exuberantly friendly, and we were reminded immediately of being in Japan the way the servers and chefs call out greetings and goodbyes as you come and go.  The atmosphere was lively, even on a Monday night, with another table doing sake bombs.  

Disappointingly, the food fell short of what we had experienced in Japan - not a surprise I suppose, but we did have high hopes.  The karaage (Japanese fried chicken) was delicious and much like the real thing.  The okonomiyaki, a seafood-laced pancake with sauces and stuff on top, was nothing like what we had in Osaka.  It was deep fried and served in thick wedges, and wasn't nearly as tasty as we hoped.  I'd give this dish a miss for sure.  The tontoro was a long skewer of grilled pork cheek.  The meat was tender and tasty, but quite plain as there is no sauce.  The only flavour is from the numbing pepper, which we did enjoy, but the overall dish seemed a little dull to me.  A surprising highlight was the Gomaae - just steamed spinach in sesame sauce - but there was just the right amount of sauce to elevate a seemingly plain side dish to something fragrant and lovely, and this would make a good accompaniment to any meal.  We finished with a big bowl of yaki udon, which was okay - tasty beef, and thick slurpable noodles, though the broth could've done with a punchier flavour.

I didn't even have to ask my husband how he felt - the fact that his biggest reaction during the meal was to the side dish of spinach said it all.  Everything was good, fine, passable, but the fun and authentic atmosphere had us expecting something more.  It satisfies a craving, but ultimately falls short."}
{"text":"Guu Sakabar has resulted in me secretly fantasizing about moving to Japan, becoming a Japanese businessperson who spends every evening in an izakaya. Sigh! A girl can dream right? 

Guu was a great experience, although I most definitely would NOT recommend it if you're looking for a quiet, romantic evening out.  However, that being said, it's a great place if you want a fun, entertaining night out.  

We ate and drank enough to feed a small army. But if I had to boil it down to our top 3 favorites from that night, they were the....

1) Torched salmon with cream cheese- the combination sounded weird the first time, but I am still dreaming about how amazing it was. Highly recommend!
2) Udon noodles - Definitely recommend getting some noodles with what you order. We tries ours with mackarel. 
3) Blackened cod with miso soup sauce: As someone who is generally wary of cod, I am now completely converted. The flavors compliment each other beautifully!

Loved Guu Sakabar and I'd highly recommend it to everyone for the friendly staff, vibrant and fun ambiance and the excellent food!

(As a tourist in the city, I was especially excited when I discovered how close it was to the subway stop line. I definitely appreciated how easy it was to get to!)"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the Guu restaurants and had a particularly great experience at Guu in Vancouver (Thurlow). Although I enjoyed aspects of the meal, the food was just meh. The restaurant didn't have that true feel and I found the menu selections weak. Drinks were plentiful and I tried this cucumber, vodka and water selection. It was just OK. Service was efficient on a relatively busy night. You could try Guu SakaBar, but be prepared to be disappointed.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Fun, relaxed atmosphere! They yell at you when you walk through the door. I went on a date with someone who had been many times before so he took the lead with ordering, everything was divine and meant for sharing."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour or more for my food and had the smallest portion.. WAY too loud to have a conversation with someone."}
{"text":"This is actually the original Guu. The one near College is newer, but this one is much larger, so you have a greater chance of getting seats. I went with a group of 5 on a Fri night, and we only had to wait 30 min. The location is close to a bunch of shops and quite close to Koreatown, so it's not like you have to sit there to wait.

We were seated in the wooden floor area, so we had to take our shoes off. We didn't mind at all though, it was an interesting atmosphere. This is why most people go to Guu - for the atmosphere. It was slightly crowded since we were seated at a 4 person table with 5 people, I was literally sitting right behind another table, but it wasn't too bad.

The waiters can speak Japanese fluently, and English decently. It is also extremely loud in the restaurant. You can see and hear the Japanese culture right as you step in. Someone will yell out \"irasshaimase!\", meaning \"Welcome\" in Japanese. Then, you will hear constant back and forth Japanese between the workers and waiters. It's actually quite interesting.

They had a pretty large food menu and drinks menu. Our group ordered a lot of random dishes. PS. If you're looking for sushi, this place is not it. Authentic and higher class Japanese food is served here, sushi is kind of considered cheap and lower class food. 

We ordered takoyaki, calamari, beef short ribs, and fried chicken. They were all delicious, but came in small portions (5 for each dish). Also ordered some sashimi, which was 6 pieces (I remember this being $15). We ordered some drinks too - Asian Peach sake, which went down smooth. There was also another where it was 3 shots - with banana, blueberry, and a 3rd flavour (probably strawberry), which was interesting. 

Guu is pretty pricey for the amount of food, so it's best to go in a larger group to make it your money's worth. If you're a girl, you'd be alright. If you're a guy, you probably will need to have a second meal elsewhere (we went to Pizza Pizza right after :P). 

Overall a great place to eat and drink with a group of friends or family. Not the best place to go on a date as it is on the expensive side, and very loud (hard to hear and talk over the noise level)."}
{"text":"I was going to make a reservation for 20 people for a birthday, they advised me that they would charge me $30 for bringing my own birthday cake. So I decided to promptly cancel the reservation. Unfortunate since other restaurants do allow you to bring your own birthday cake."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last evening. Great experience and atmosphere. Service so so but friendly enough. Not overly attentive. Good wine too! Will go back!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive but i find the food little too sweet. Food was hit or miss. High energy all throughout the restaurant but not sure it is all everyone to enjoy"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant is taking a downhill

The service was never the best to begin with but now the food and prices are going down too.
They are charging more for weaker drinks, smaller appetizers. The tako wasabi is a dollar more and you get 3 spoons for $5. WTF
The chicken and other items come with more garnish than serving. Guys consistency is important. I have been disappointed in my last 2 visits. I used to come once a month but now I am not so sure..."}
{"text":"Words can not describe how incredible the food and experience is at GUU. Everything from them yelling at your arrival, to sitting on the floor like an authentic Japanese Sakabar...GUU is above all expectations. Everything on the menu is absolutely stunning, and the weirded and more unique the dish sounds, the more savoury and pleasant it is. My favourite restaurant of today. 
GET THE PUMPKIN CROQUETTE! And the Mushroom Bibimbop...mmm....."}
{"text":"I think the food at guu is great. The menu can be overwhelming for some, but I find it best to go with pals so you can order more things to share. The baked oysters are incredible and must be ordered!! 
The cherry blossom cocktail (red wine based) is delicious and affordable (around $7).  

The atmosphere is very fun, especially
If it is your birthday! The servers will come over with a chalkboard birthday message, sing to you and then take a picture of your table and give you the picture in a hand drawn card. Mine has help kitty on it. 

If you want a fun dining experience guu is the place to go."}
{"text":"Loud and chaotic but we like that.
Each and every dish was amazing from the raw fish to the bowls.  Sadly, I do not remember the names of everything we orders as we ordered A TON and it just kept coming.  I believe that the Kimchi Nabe was one of the biggest hits.  The sticky stone rice bowl with curry in it that was stirred at the table was epic too.
Can't remember what it was called, but we had this sesame, spinach ball that was amazing.  
After reading reviews I was excited to try to fried chicken.  Honestly, I've had my fare share of legit fried chicken in my day.  I truly didn't feel as though this ranked at the top. It was good, but not nearly as good as the above dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch on good friday. The restaurant was about half full so there was no waiting. It was the lunch menu so the prices were reasonable from $5 appetizers to $20 combo sets. 

We ordered a jelly fish salad ($5.50), sashimi lunch combo ($15.50) and steak don ($13.50). 

The jelly fish salad was really yummy. Loved the texture of the jellyfish and was really refreshing being cold and chewy.   

I ate the sashimi combo which came with rice, miso soup, small mashed potato thing, pickled veggies. There were 5 different types of sashimi: salmon, tuna, octopus, some magenta coloured fish and a white one. All were fresh and pretty tasty. Nothing orgasmic though. The salmon wasn't those that melted in your mouth but if you're down for a good lunch sashimi this is a good choice. 

My bf said his steak Don was decent. A good portion but was a little hard to chew because they didn't ask how we would like the steak cooked. 

Overall, I would come here again for lunch. Great atmosphere for dates because it's not too quiet that it's awkward and the food waiting time is just enough time to get to know your date. But if you are like my bf and I trying to squeeze in a nice lunch during exam time, the wait time for your food might seem a little long."}
{"text":"*due to a contract ending with Kitanoya Marketing Corp., all the Guu Izakaya locations in Toronto will be renamed to Kinka Izakaya - which means Golden Flower. Don't worry though, the staff and menu remained the same, and of course the food never failed to disappoint me.

*I got the tasting menu for $33/person. If you don't want the set menu, all of their dishes are available a la carte as well so you can go either way! Do note that the tasting menu is slightly different between all three locations as well, so do check prior to going!

*If you dislike all the shouting and loud ambiance, the Bloor location actually have a tatami room that is far away from all of that so we can all finally carry a conversation without the constant yelling!

*My only complain of the night was perhaps the flow of the courses. I'm not sure if the order of the dishes on the tasting menu remain the same like how we received it, but it would have been better if a salad dish was served in-between the heavy courses to refresh the palate. 

-Gomaae - blanched spinach with sesame sauce
I honestly didn't think I would have liked this dish due to its simplicity, but it was surprisingly tasty! The thick black sesame sauce provided a nutty and saltiness to the freshly blanched spinach, which was a really nice way to start the course.

-Maguro Tataki - seared BC tuna sashimi with ponzu & garlic chips
The tuna sashimi was thinly sliced and seared, then garnished with garlic chips which was just enough to not ruin the delicate flavor of the fresh tuna. The acidity from the ponzu sauce brighten up the dish and don't forget the bed of daikon at the bottom that was a perfect palate cleanser.

-Seaweed & Tofu salad - marinated seaweed & tofu on greens
Sadly this was our least favorite dish of the night. Though I loved the combinations of the salad with the ponzu soy vinaigrette, I thought it was a bit bland and there was too much greens (iceberg lettuce if I remember correctly) underneath.

-Karaage - deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken with garlic mayo
As always the one at Kinka was tender and juicy with a crispy-light surface. I thought the mayo tasted just like a generic mayonnaise and the garlic was nowhere to be found, so it would have been nice if there was more garlic or spices to add a kick to the chicken karaage.

-Kaki Mayo - baked BC oyster with spinach, mushrooms & garlic mayo topped with cheese
I always like oysters and I much prefer them raw for the most part, but I wouldn't mind ordering this dish again. Though the kaki mayo came with two giant B.C. oyster shells, the oyster pieces were all chopped up and incredibly tiny. However the thick creamy cheese coating with plenty of mushroom and spinach still hits the spot for me, and I also recommend this as a \"filler\" dish to get full as well.

-Karubi - grilled miso marinated beef short ribs
Though the beef short ribs lacked the charred grill marks that would have added a bit of smokiness to the dish, it was still flavorful and tender.

-Gindara - grilled miso marinated black cod with yuzu miso sauce
he fish was grilled perfectly and had just a slight crispy skin, finished off with a nice yuzu miso sauce to cut the fattiness of the dish. It was so soft and just melted in your mouth like butter.... 

-Kinoko Bibimbap - rice, mushroom with cheese w/ seaweed sauce in sizzling stone bowl
The combination of the cheese, earthy mushroom and subtle nori was just incredible. The sizzling hot stone bowl crisped up the bottom of the rice, giving the entire dish a wonderful texture! In my opinion the dish would have been better if there was a bit more cheese, because who doesn't love some gooey creamy cheese with each bites.


-Sake Tiramisu
The cakes had a strong taste of sake, unfortunately it was a bit too grainy for both C and I so we couldn't finish it. I thought the almond tofu cake (?) would have been a better choice to end the course as I remember it being really light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Such a fun environment and great food! After a night of skating we decided to come for $3 sake bombs and food. We shared a bunch of dishes the only one that needs a critique is the beef ribs which had way to much fat on them. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 (even though I'll definitely be back) is because I took a long time to get the waters we asked for before we ordered shots and drinks, also with the napkins."}
{"text":"I choose Guu as the location for my birthday this year. Despite the fact it was -10 degrees and snow was blowing in every direction, my group of 16 made the trek down there. I was so excited to go since I had heard so many good things about this place, so excited that I had placed an online reservation two weeks in advance. Their reservation policy for weekends is quite strict, reservations can only be made for 5:00 and seating is limited to 12 people if I remember correctly. The restaurant called me two hours before 5:00 on the day of and when it became apparent my group would not make the reservation on time, their staff was willing to put us on the waitlist for 7:00 for a bigger group with no problem. When we arrived, we were seated immediately despite it being a Saturday night. 
Now regarding the food, what I remember most notably was the fried chicken which everyone at our table agreed was excellent. The fried brie was also great and the cheese had the optimal temperature and melted consistency. I really can't wait to be back with a smaller group and sample more of the menu. Awesome dining experience and so much more fun and casual than a sit down dinner with appetizers and entrees. 
No split bills so remember the cash, or be prepared to be very generous!

Sidenote: I read a lot of reviews hyping up the washrooms. Maybe I visited the wrong ones but they were just alright, albeit very clean and rank just \"ok\" on my non-existent favourite washrooms in dining establishments list.

UPDATE: I was here for lunch and it was great too! Loved the sake mojito and the fried chicken lunch set I got was huge and so delicious. The general consensus among my friends was very positive."}
{"text":"The place is way too loud - last thing I want are people yelling at me when I enter a restaurant. If I wanted that, I'd sit under the Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland eating a funnel cake.

And what's their obsession with spicy mayo on fried food. It really starts to old when all the dishes come out swimming in grease and spicy mayo."}
{"text":"Alright, here it comes.....SO GUUD!!!

Now with that out of the way, on to my review. I hadn't been to any previous Guu location but had heard a lot of good things. So when I suddenly had some time to kill before a movie at the Bloor Cinema we gave Guu a shot. And had a fantastic experience.

Every item we got seemed to be better than the one before. We mainly ordered from the specials list and the people at the other end of our table finally got tired of looking longingly at our food as it came by and said, \"We'll have whatever they're having!\" The Temari Zushi and Tuna Tartar were big hits. As was drinking a Kokane in what is as much a BC resto as it a Japanese one.

If you're not into a loud and communal experience, then Guu isn't the place for you. Personally, I had a blast!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon looking for a quick snack. We had never been to any of the Guu restaurants before and thought we ought to try it out due to the popularity on Yelp. 

When we entered we were greeted by the staff behind the bar. It was very welcoming. The restaurant looked very empty though. Maybe they don't really have much of a crowd for weekend lunch?

The servers spoke english very well too! I love their menus, very artsy handwriting. I also loved the interior decor, so warm and woodsy. What I didn't like was how small our table was! It was very cramped I find.

We decided to get their 10$ weekend lunch special. It was a really carby set. There was fries, rice, canned corn, deep fried chicken pieces, a small salad and to finish the meal a tiramisu cake sampler. It was alright, but wasn't crazy about it, but for that price it was a very nice deal as the amount of food is quite shareable.

What I absolutely loved was their strawberry nigori (alcoholic drink). It is such a delicious drink. I wish it came in a bigger glass!!!"}
{"text":"It's really loud here and employees feel the need to greet everyone that walks in and out.  There isn't separate billing so be prepared if you're coming with a group of friends. Good selection of food but not really filling because they're really small portions.

You could end up spending $40 and still be hungry. But their food is okay. I'm sure you can find the same food at an all you can eat for half the cost."}
{"text":"After going to Guu at College I have a phobia of long waits....but apparently not so much @ this location. It was a relatively busy day (approx 8pm) but at least we did not have to wait over 2 hrs for a table. Phew ! :D

Food as always was unique & delish.  We loved the sauce for many of the dishes. Went here w/ 3 ppl and we ordered...

Takoyaki - deep friend octopus
Brie Cheese - no need for explanations. its to die for
Ebimayo - deep fried prawn w/ spicy mayo 
Salmon Tataki - seared salmon 
Kakimayo - baked oyster
Carbonara Udon - creamy udon noodles w/ bacon onion & half boiled egg
Cheese Cake - awesome but too small 

My favs were the Brie Cheese, Ebimayo (damn that spicy sauce!!) & the Carbonara udon. I'm usually not a udon person but it was so tasty u can't help but keep eating the dish!

Even though they're hella busy everything came just at the right time & they were also very friendly esp when we entered and left the place :) 

Located very close to Bathurst Station."}
{"text":"Ok great place. I like this better than the church location.

The idea is to get shit faced and eat. It'll be the best experience in this formula. It's also fun for a group of 10-12. 

The staff are super nice, funny, and awkward all at the same time. Almost like they got the ESL students from upstairs to work here, but they're all amazing. The reception and goodbye is worth it alone.

Drinks are good. Tonnes of unique things to try and beers are schooner portions like boston pizza. 
Food is amazing. I tried a crap load of stuff. I loved the miso cod the most, but their sake tiramisu was something i will be talking about.

At the end of the day, it's lots of fun. But the reality is the food is not exceptional. Great japanese food, but the ingredients aren't the best or the freshest. But a couple of drinks in, it's all amazing. 

the food could be alot better, but the prices would be much higher and the place would loose all its charm. 

oh and yes, expect to wait. a while."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the postive energy this place has. The food was good but I bit pricey. I would recommend to try it."}
{"text":"The food was great! I won't deny that.  The atmosphere was intensely fun.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I felt I was rushed out from the moment I sat down. \"There a two hour seating time, because it's Friday and it counts as a weekend.\" 

I like dining for the food and atmosphere, but I don't like being rushed out.  I'd go back on a weekday but certainly not on a weekend."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! Practically tasted their whole menu in one sitting. It's a bit loud but the energy is great and the whole place is very authentic. The food is worth it's price. It's super busy on the weekends so I would go and expect to wait. My favorite beef carpacio. Had 2 places. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Completely in love with this place! 

I loved the idea that the restaurant is divided into two as you have a choice to sit at the regular dining area or sit with your shoes off and sit on cushions! 

Food was beyond delicious, everything we ordered tasted unique. 
- Ebimayo\" (prawns), was ok as it was only lightly battered deep fried shrimp.
-\"Ikapiri\" (calamari), which was my least favourite as it had too much of the spicy ketchup. 
-\"Takoyaki\" (octopus balls) which was interesting! It looked like the flakes on top were moving on their own. A definite must try!! 
- \"Kakuni\" (braised pork belly), which was tender and had a small kick of spice
- \"Kakimayo\" (baked oyster) with cheese and mushrooms! It was an oyster of greatness. A definite must try!! 
- Kinoko Bibimbap (Rice & mushrooms in a stone bowl), where the waiter actually would mix it for you nicely, and it definitely had its own taste. 

The place does get really loud, so not ideal for an intimate outing. But thoroughly enjoyed the service and the friendly greetings. I recommend making reservations and going as a group to share."}
{"text":"lots and lots of yelling... which was great as we were a big group, and in all cases a big group usually means more  noise.

overall the food was great. I had order the wasabi octopus, which was amazing comparing to another restaurant I have been to in the past. also there baked oysters were delicious but be careful because the shell was so hot it burnt the tips of my fingers.

the atmosphere was great, very nice mood setting and the music was great, i just wanted to pop off as if i was at a club! LOL. good thing i didn't, that wouldn't have been pretty.

I would strongly suggest that if you like Asian food, and you like hip hop/rnb, and your down for some sake bombs with your friends that you hit up this cool hipster place, my friends and I had a great night."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Everyone has raved about Guu, so on one Saturday when I had a craving, I decided to meet a friend for a late night bite.  It's this kind of unassuming modern grey bricked building, but when you walk in, it's this loud chaos of screaming. Then I realized the staff was shouting at me! It caught me by surprise, but apparently this is how it goes.  It's like this as soon as anyone enters or leaves.  And as a result, it's hilarious but if you want to have a conversation, VERY distracting! And as we were there on a Saturday, someone was celebrating a birthday,  so we couldn't get a word in edgewise. It made for a good laugh but don't go here on a date.  Great for a group. Many university students and twenty somethings were packed at the picnic table settings. Quick and friendly staff, but not fun when they're literally grabbing the beer out of your hand because they think it's empty. I HATE that! 

I ATE 
Okay, it's been a while but the food is NOT all that! Fried brie on a Japanese menu? It was quite disgusting, but I was compelled to try it.  The takoyaki (fried octopus balls) were definitely different. I didn't really have a \"ball\" eating them.  I did like the Yaki udon, udon noodles with beef, scallion and mushrooms.  It was hearty.  Another note that because this is a tapas place, portions are going to be smaller than usual, and it can add up.  That's why this place is another reason it's great to go with a group. 

Drinks: Apparently, Sapporo is owned by Sleeman's made in Guelph. Not sure how authentic  that is! Beer is beer for the most part to me and I didn't mind it. 
In my opinion, Guu is overrated. I am not sure how the other location on Church is, but it's not my bag! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Guu = Guk. It's not bad, but it's not great. Or maybe I'm just being a snot. Whatever.  I think I would prefer a sushi joint to this. I like to have conversations without random bursts of joy peppered into my meal. Perhaps, the Church street location is different?"}
{"text":"Great food! I like the environment even it is kind of loud. 
Love it and will definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food selection is exquisite and the entire atmosphere is something straight out of a manga scene. My friends and I love coming here to eat dinner or to grab a few beers! It's definitely on the louder side so it might not be the best place to go to if you want to have a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"We came here on a rainy and humid Thursday night at about 10:30 pm and didn't have to wait to be seated. WooHoo!

It's similar in concept ( and decor: replete with the amazing bulbs) to the other location on Church. In the words of our amazing, 5 star server Julia, the Annex location focuses more on the sake content than the food as compared to the Izakaya over on Church.

I had the Green Tea Latte which was a smooth, delicious \"cocktail\". More Starbucks than Guu, in my opinion.
We also ordered:
Ebimayo (Deep fried shrimp in mayo sauce): Delicious as usual
Kinoko Bimbimbap: Smells a lot more delicious (strongly of garlic and cheese) than it tastes 
Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake): It's super good without the sauce, which is way too sweet!

It's a total party atmosphere. There were two birthdays being celebrated and each of the patrons recieved a shooter cake and a raucous rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" by the staff! We chimed in as well!

I enjoyed my experience, you definitely get your money's worth, especially with the large Sapporos.

Shout out: Julia, you are a total star!"}
{"text":"the food is inventive and delicious. the place can get busy and loud. service is fast and attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place! it's on the loud side, but that's a part of it's \"experience\"
The food is great, the energy is amazing and it really good for big groups. 

If you go by and it's busy, they'll take down your name and number, and text/call you when there's a seat open - so you can go somewhere else for a drink while you wait."}
{"text":"5* as it is less busy than its sister location @ church & gerrard. and because there's many places to walk around in k-town if you do have to wait :) 

also, it's a really good idea to come here for lunch, there's lunch specials ranging from $8-$15 that are totally delicious. it's usually empty at lunch (I guess people don't realize it's actually super affordable and high quality at lunch) but yeah, check it out!"}
{"text":"They sat us in the noisy main dining room but were accomodating enough to move us to the back when we said it was too loud.  The food was very good, if you're looking for something more intimate and cozy, don't count on getting a good table."}
{"text":"It was an interesting experience. I would try it out again for sure. Don't expect to go there to chat its pretty loud
Make a reservation"}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya on Bloor is literally as good as it gets!! I have an amazing time every time I visit this restaurant. I love that I can make a reservation 3 hours before and still be able to make it! (I say this because the Kinka -previously Guu- on Church NEVER takes reservations so the fact that this one does is fantastic). All the Kinka franchises are amazing and this one is no exception. Why? 1. the food is AMAZING. 80% of the menu is absolutely delicious. Couple things I order EVERY single time include the ebimayo, lobster sashimi if they have it, salmon tataki, kinoko bibimbap, their almond tofu DESSERT (omggg my fave) just to name a few of the best. 2. the AMBIANCE/VIBE of the restaurant which is always just super fun! 3. pleasant staff- I've met a couple that I wasn't too fond of out of like the 10 or more times that I've been but they are usually good. 4. Love that there is also a part of the restaurant where you can take off your shoes. Anyway, I don't want to write an essay but YES, definitely a returning fan. :)"}
{"text":"As far as izakayas are concerned, let me just tell you that i was a little bit disappointed with the menu size here. You see, in NYC, you have a thick menu. 

However, I was not disappointed.

Guu is short for Guuud. This place gets top marks for their execution of Japanese food, and that's because not only did it taste different, it was differently good from what I am used to. 

Guu is the kind of place for competitive dining, and I was ever so proud that my friend called in to place her name early, picked me up from the airport and when we got back our table was ready in 15 minutes.

Guu is lovely because you get to take your shoes off and eat in a sunken table. They provide you with slippers so you can go to the bathroom without having to wear your shoes again --- a must during the wintertime because boots are annoying to wear.

That being said, when you come here, be sure that you wear socks (if you dont want to walk with bare feet) or ask for a table where you don't have to take your shoes off - however WHY WOULD YOU WANT THAT? Why take away from the experience that is Guu?

There was some sort of pot pie that we had (if i remember correctly it was beef tongue pot pie) and that thing was AWESOME. it was in the specials, so pray that you get it.

Also, dining here was very affordable, and the neighborhood is happening at night. 

One tiny bit of culture shock - when you pay with your credit card, the waitress brings the wireless card machine to you and you swipe it yourself. I've never seen that in an NYC restaurant."}
{"text":"My first impression of Guu when I walked in the door? ALARMING! There should be a warning posted outside that you will be yelled at upon crossing the threshold. I mean, it's a neat idea I suppose (though, I can only imagine they have a constant supply of ricola in the back...not sure how they don't all lose their voices within the first couple hours of service) but it grows tiresome very quickly. This place was hopping when I went last Friday so there was someone walking through the door every minute or so!! If you're looking for a relaxing dining experience or if you really care what your dining compadres are saying than this is not the place for you! There was a lot of smiling and nodding going on without any comprehension as to what my friends were saying to me. Note to self: Get hearing checked. 

Volume level aside, Guu is a very unique dining experience that I definitely think is worth trying out. We sat in the \"traditional\" area of the restaurant where you are asked to take your shoes off (bring your least holey socks!) and sit on the floor. You could sit on your feet I suppose, but there is space underneath the table for your legs...so it's pretty much like sitting at a booth.

As other people have stated, the wait time for your meal can be quite lengthy so you shouldn't go to Guu ravenous - a pre-Guu snack would be wise! However, the food is well worth the wait! I particularly enjoyed the deep fried brie (A MUST!) and the pumpkin croquette.

The service was slow, but that's only because the restaurant was jam packed full of Guu-nies. In spite of slow service, the wait staff was very helpful when they were around so that made up for long periods of absence. 

Be aware that they do not take reservations, so you're going to have to get there early if you don't wait to wait for hours for a table. As we were leaving the restaurant around 8:30 there was a hoard of hungry people lining the entrance. It was madness!"}
{"text":"Although those who have only experienced the Church St. location of Guu might opine that this newer Bloor West one is too big or not cozy enough, I'll assure you that for a larger sized Guu, it's much more izakaya-like than a few of it's west coast predecessors. 

After the wild success of this Vancouver based chain caused Guu's to sprout up seemingly everywhere in the city (of Vancouver and later Richmond), the authenticity of the experience really got watered down. Therefore, it was with quite a lot of hesitancy that I visited Guu SakaBar for the first time. 

I have to admit that my initial experience was not all that I had hoped for. On a late Sunday evening not too soon after it's grand opening, we walked in to find more than half the tables empty and a seriously lacking atmosphere - You really shouldn't be able to hear your dinner dates without having to shout and repeat yourselves when at a Guu. Although the food was fantastic (as expected) and we were more than happy that we didn't have to wait in a thirty table line up, it just wasn't the same without the atmosphere.

A good few months (and a number of much more properly Guu-like experiences) later, I am happy to report that SakaBar has matured into the group/birthday-party central that it was cut out to be. The communal tables are perfect for squeezing in untold numbers of friends that you didn't tell the host about (in order to get a table sooner), the service is as quick and friendly as ever, and the food is still amazing. 

Finally, the \"new\" Guu is now spilling over daily with both returning devotees and excited first-timers. Arrive early with a smaller group or just bring your whole posse and enjoy the full on experience. Praise Guu!"}
{"text":"At 32$ pp Guu is an awesome place to eat and have a good time (ad another 15$pp for sake and beer if you want to drink)

This was my first time going to a traditional Japanese izakaya bar, and I have to say, I was a bit uneasy. If you're not particularly adventurous with food, don't worry, as long as you go in with an open mind, you're in for a real treat. Everything was delicious, no complaints on any of the dishes. The service was not only nice but also a lot of fun! They did everything to keep us comfortable even as our group got bigger and bigger with no reservation."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun, The servers were very upbeat and lively. They try very hard to make sure the place is very fun and friendly! The food is very good. It's a type of sushi fusion.  This place also has an area that you can sit on the floor and eat. Very cool concept indeed. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Guu Original in Vancouver so Kinka is a must visit for me when I moved over to Toronto. Much bigger than Guu Original in Vancouver, Kinka was SO LIT. Servers were yelling (cheering?), Sake bombs were everywhere, music was blasting and people were having a good time. Not idyllic if you're expecting a quiet and intimate date but very good for big group celebrations.

We ordered the Wagyu Beef Sukiyaki (very delicious and hearty, slightly saltier but still good), Pressed Tuna sushi, sashimi salad (loved it), takowasabi and baked oysters. Hands down, the baked oysters were SO GOOD - baked with cream sauce, cheese, mushrooms, the actual oyster and potatoes. I would recommend trying their daily/weekly specials instead of their standard menu since everything is really good here."}
{"text":"I LOVE KINKA! Right when I step a foot into the door and when I leave, the workers here make me feel very welcomed every time by greeting me (or yelling LOL) in Japanese. 

I came here on a Thursday for my birthday dinner and for the first time got seated in the area where you and your guests are sitting on the floor! Although you cannot wear your shoes into the area, I like that they have plastic bags conveniently placed before you enter the area so you can put your shoes in the bag and carry with you to your table. You can also place your shoes in the shelves they have too!

I love the lychee mojito here... Such a unique flavour for mojito and of course being asian, why wouldn't I love lychee!!

The food here is always so amazing - which is why Kinka is so popular and loved by so many. As an Udon fanatic, I love their Kimchi Udon - my absolute favourite dish here and coming in second is the Udon Carbonara (lol)! We also ordered their karaage, salmon tataki, gyu carpaccio and pork spared ribs which were all very delicious. Just typing this makes me want to go back right now and get some more! 

Our server was super sweet and tried her best to accommodate us. While we initially asked for split bills, we were told that she couldn't do that which was fine. But in the end she ended up splitting the bills completely even with everybody and that made everything more confusing because some people had items they didn't order on their own bills. We ended up just paying for the whole bill on one credit card, and have everyone pay back their share after when we figured it out properly at home. 

Overall, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ever hear the line \"If you're looking for a good time, call...\" Well, call Kinka.  I had the chance to eat at 2 great izakaya in Toronto back to back and both were very good.  I prefer Guu a little more just cause the food quality and presentation is just amazing ... BUT Kinka is definitely the more energetic and louder fun bar with still very good food!  I came in smiling the moment they started yelling and left with a bigger smile.

Making reservations here is easy through Yelp and I highly recommend it.  Even on a weekday night, this place constantly had people come through non stop and though the tables do turn over quickly, there were many BIG groups of birthdays just doing sake bombs.  I think we saw at least 4 birthdays being celebrated in a little over an hour.

If you're by yourself or just a twosome, try to grab the bar especially near the chefs.  It's LOUD but damn its fun to be near them as they constantly yell and shout.  It's not obnoxiously loud music thats being played but the 12+ staff just zooming around taking care of EVERY table and yelling with the chefs in response.  I've never had faster and still concerned service in a place like this.  The service here is 5+ from everyone... it's fast and fun.  It's never boring, cold, or disinterested.  

I will say that the food here comes out just as quick as the service moving around ... we got our first 4 plates in less than 15 minutes.  Thank goodness we were starving so we can eat through the dishes quickly... regardless if you can use chopsticks or not!  They do provide knives and forks here for those who aren't expert at chopsticks or needing a hand to cut.

Gomaae - This looks a little like \"the thing from the swamp\" when it first arrives with a black tar looking sauce covering the chilled spinach.  Just mix it up and let the bold sesame flavour hit your tongue.  The instagram trendy black carbon foods need to be sit down to this dish.  This one is a great even you think vegetables are not good.  4/5

Salmon Tataki - Solid sashimi dish with several lightly seared salmon pieces with lots of crisp garlic and light tasting ponzu sauce.  I think it could have use a heavier dose of wasabi mayo as it was pretty lightly applied.  It needed that extra pep of wasabi heat 3.5/5

Tuna Tataki - Similar to the Salmon tataki, this is another solid sashimi dish.  The fish was good if not a little light on flavour.  The garlic chips did add some but it could have use a bit more wasabi mayo perhaps. 3.5/5

Okonomiyaki - This is a solid okonomiyaki but I found the Guu one still the best one in the city. 
 Kinka's version was tasty but it missed the flavour hit that makes you go wow and it was not as crispy as Guu's.  Kinka was definitely more 'pancake' like with it's softer dough.  It wasn't sauced evenly with the okonomiyaki sauce and perhaps thats why it wasn't as flavourful.  4/5

Ikapiri - This was the stand out dish of the night and better than Guu for me.  Large but still tender pieces of freshly fried squid are nicely sauced up with a bit of heat and then topped with crunchy pieces (looks like shredded potato and wonton wrappers).  The sauce was nicely balanced and not really spicy to be honest.  Someone enjoyed this more than me because I couldnt cut it up fast enough to keep up with them eating it! (Disarmed ... riiight). 4.5/5

Karaage - Generous pieces of chicken deep fried and served crispy.  I thought the crust was nice and crunchy while the meat was cooked fairly well.  I think it could the karaage crust bit seasoned more as the mayo didn't have a lot of seasoning in it to flavour the entire chicken bite. 
 4/5

Sweet Almond Tofu - This reminds me of all the dim sum versions of the almond tofu.  It has a bit of a chew instead of a soft texture. Its tasty and light dessert but I would want to try another dessert next time. 3.5/5

Peach Compote - This came off their special menu.  It's a generous big peach that was poached in a sweetened syrup, cored out, and then filled with some cheesecake.  On top of all that, throw in some coconut ice cream. I liked the peach and the overall flavour but just found each component not quite optimal... icy bits in the ice cream, generous peach size but very little cheesecake.  Cool looking dessert through   3.5/5

Kinka is definitely one of those places that you keep on your mind when you want good food and a loud fun place to go with friends.  I LOVED the service here and the atmosphere is so great.  I'd be happy to return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Super fun, super loud, and super busy place to eat at. Definitely go there early so you don't have to wait in line, if you can. There are so many dishes and it's fun to share with a few friends. The drinks are creative and yummy."}
{"text":"Went her thinking it would just be another expensive Japanese restaurant. With high price and good presentation food. 

I was shocked to see that they server some amazing Japanese food. The baked oyster was amazing. They are freshly prepare by the open concept kitchen and are server right at your table. Creamy, moist and very flavorful 

Good vibes and environment for celebrating birthday and having a good time with some snack and sake.

There is parking on the side street of the restaurant. Make sure you pay as I was given a ticket thinking it would be free after 5pm, DON'T be FOOLED.

Washroom need some work, not that cleanliness I have been too"}
{"text":"Food was not great to be honest. I was looking forward to eating here after rave reviews from friends.

started with the bang bang chicken salad, and it was tasty. The tasty stopped there. Had deep fried bri, which was greasy and lacked flavour, then tofu...greasy lacked flavour. Pork dumplings tasted like something I get at costco..

The atmosphere is fun. But you are given a 2 hour limit...

Won't be back."}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another shot. It has since changed the name, but the menu and concept are the same. This time I had a much better experience. We were in a group of people, so we got to try different dishes. All the dishes were all tasty, if not very big. The standard menus is not very extensive, but there were many daily specials on offer. Here's the rundown:

Yakoyaki - Deep Fried Octopus Balls
Price: $5.50
Rate: 3/5.
Crunchy on the outside and nice and soft inside. But flavor was not big enough. 

Karaage - Deep Fried Soy Sauce Marinated Chicken
Price: $8.30
Rate: 5/5
Gorgeous nuggets of deep fried chicken goodness. Perfectly cooked, nice and moist inside. Rivals any Korean fried chicken. 

Ebimayo - Deep Fried Prawns with Spicy Mayo
Price: $8.90
Rate: 3/5
Nice dish, but somewhat standard. The spicy mayo is the best part of the dish.

Saba - Grilled Mackerel
Price: $9:50
Rate: 4/5
Very tasty and flavorful. 

From the specials menu:
---------------------------------
Oyster Agedashi - $7.80
Rate: 3/5
Deef fried oysters, tofu and eggplant. Not bad.

Seaweed roll of beef carpaccio with uni 
Rate: 5/5
There were only two pieces, but those were two perfect bites of deliciousness. Outstanding dish, the best of the entire meal.  

Taco Carpaccio - $9.50
Rate: 5/5
Outstanding dish of thinly sliced octopus with nice and smoky flavor. Delish. My second favorite dish. 

Miso Katso - $9.80
Rate: 5/5
Beautifully deep fried pork cutlet. Excellent dish.

Risotto with Porcini Mushrooms
Rate: 4/5
Very rich and tasty risotto. Who know you could get a nice risotto in an izakaya? 

Pumpkin Pie
Rate: 3/5
The pie itself was alright, but not the best pumpkin pie I had. It also lacked some sweetness. But, the coconut ice-cream on top was delish!

We shared the above between 4 people, and payed $27 per-person, after taxes and tip. It wasn't a lot of food to completely satiate us, but the price was reasonable. 

For drinks we had a sake. They do have a house sake ($6.5 for 150mL or $10 for 300mL), but we opted for the Izumi draft sake (from Toronto's Distillery District) at $20 for 300mL. It was served cold and was pretty tasty. There are other selections of higher-end sake as well."}
{"text":"Great food and lively environment, but seats are a bit uncomfortable. A lot more space than the other location, with a very similar menu."}
{"text":"This Guu is not like the other Guu...when compared to the Guu Izakaya on church this one:
- is a bit lacking in service 
- the menu is not as big, 
- the wait time is so much shorter (i.e., there was no wait!) In fact, this Guu is so much less busy, that when we got there at 6pm, we didnt have to wait, and the other half of the restaurant was not being used.

We got:
- baked oyster (SO good)
- Udon carbonara (I prefer the kimchi version)
- deep fried brie
- ikapiri (deep fried calamari with spicy mayo, ketchup and wasabi)
- kaisen (Seafood) bibimbap (omg so good)
- big sappporo
- umeshu (plum wine)
- gree tea ice cream

Yummy food nevertheless, and very enjoyable atmosphere if you dont mind shouting to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Guu is has a fun and LOUD atmosphere! 

It is a great place to go with friends. Sharing dishes and getting a taste of their many wonderful dishes makes for a great dining experience. 

I've loved everything I've tried here except for the \"SABA\" (grilled mackerel). The kinoko bimibap is great! Definitely give it a try. 

After ordering a few dishes per person (they are small sharing plates) you're looking at around 25-30 per person (including tip, but excluding alcohol)."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoy this location lore than the one at church. This place is bigger so the sound level was able to be spread out more. I've had the hardest time trying to hear what my friend was saying at the other location but this place was just fine. I enjoyed their tapes and their lunch menu isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Food and a show. The staff welcomes everyone coming in and going out. They sing for birthdays and for sake bombs. They must be tired from screaming. Great place to drink and eat small tape like dishes.  I don't remember what I ate but I do remember what I didn't like. I didn't like the fried brie. Some of the other people in the group loved it but it was a little greasy for me."}
{"text":"Came here both times around 10-11 pm Fri-Sat and they are always busy, as to be expected. Never made reservations, but also luckily never had to wait. Guu and Guu Sake bar are a mission for me and my friends, but we all love this place.

First off, I love the staff - they're friend and so nice. They always refill our waters, clear our plates quickly and always easy to flag down. Even at 10-11 pm when the whole restaurant is packed, they still sound happy and cheerful. Knowing that they probably have been packed since dinner time, I give them made props for being able to keep their voices and keeping a positive attitude.

The food - Kinoko bibimbap is hands down my favourite thing on the menu and thank goodness its on their main menu. It's cheesy, sweet, the scorched bottom pieces are the best. Other menu items I've tried are Gyu Carpaccio, Yaki Udon, Brie Cheese, Takoyaki, Steak, Kakimayo (baked oysters), Green Tea cheesecake, Almond Tofu (must try) and creme brulee. I also like that they have specials every week? or so often and do collaborations between the other restaurants. 

 I recently got the opportunity to celebrate my birthday at Guu Sakebar, and I got the Sake shots. They all sang me happy birthday (I think - it was in Japanese), they took a picture of me and my friends, printed it, wrote me a birthday card and decorated it!"}
{"text":"very good prices, a special greeting upon arrival and very stylish decor, it's no wonder people love this place. we got here around 5ish and one of the first groups here. we noticed it started geting crowded around 630 during the weekday. I like the idea of tapas cause of the variety of offerings. The octopus balls, deep fry brie, beef sashimi, and Tuna sashimi were very tasty. The Mackrel and Beef Tongue were very salty and was disappointing. The place has exceptional service and a very extensive drink menu including several selections of Shochu (Barley & Sweet potato)
Next time will try the highly regarded stuffed oysters."}
{"text":"I always make sure to come here when I'm visiting my peeps in Toronto. Everything is delicious; vegetarian friendly; I especially love the BC Tuna sashimi (drenched in the soy/wasabi sauce). The fred brie is superb (order it at the end since it is sweet). The salmon sashimi is pretty good, too.. Tasty bibimbap.. Great service.. Mm mmm"}
{"text":"I love Guu. It gets pretty busy on weekend nights so reservations are recommended. You are greeted with the team yelling when you come in and when you leave. Honestly I wasn't expecting that when I first came here so I was a bit confused, but my friend cleared that up for me. 

My favorites are: 
Kinoko Bibimbap
Deep Fried Brie
Kabocha Korokke
Takoyaki 
Gyu Carpaccio 
Gyu Shabu Salad
Ikapiri
Kimchi & Carbonara Udon"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends from out of town and they loved it.  It is definitely an experience as much as it is a visit for the food.  This location is bigger than the original, and has more seating, but has all the fun atmosphere and noise you'd come to expect from Guu.  The service here is great, friendly and our waitress was extremely patient as my group spent a good long time going over the menu.  Here's what we ordered:
- Okonomiyaki - a savoury pancake with veggies and squid.  This was good, but nothing too special to note about it.  The squid was soft and not overcooked though.
- Takoyaki - I think this is just the okonomiyaki in ball form (with less veggies).  Nonetheless, this was also pretty tasty.  
- The sashimi special - this one had hamachi, tuna and salmon topped with salad and dressing.  This was delicious, the dressing was very light and the fish very fresh.
- Grilled miso cod and also grilled kalbi - the fish was nice marinated and you could really taste the miso.  The kalbi was also very flavourful if not over cooked a little bit.
- Sukiyaki - this was a little too sweet for my taste. 
- The creamy udon and also the kimchi udon - both were very good and the sauces nice and rich.  
- Deep fried Brie Balls - If you like Brie cheese you will love this.  The cheese is crusted with some light breading and soft on the inside.  It was a little too much cheese for me, but the rest of my party seemed more than happy to have my portion.

Overall, this place is a fun experience and the food quality is pretty good."}
{"text":"Guu Izakayi is a great place to go with a group of friends. Small little, tappas-sized dishes perfect for sharing and socializing with friends.

The $4-$10/dish adds up really quick. If you come here starving, you'll spend about $40pp, if you want to drink,,,, well depends how much you can drink but a beer is average priced about $8.

The atmosphere is loud and fun. Once you come in or leave the restaurant, all the staff in the restaurant will scream a very welcoming HI and BYE in Japanese. Great to embarrass someone on their birthday by getting them the birthday package with all the staff singing to you with energy so high it might blow off the roof top.
 
This is definitely a great experience and I'm glad guu  introduce this to Toronto."}
{"text":"I am giving Guu SakaBar a second chance.. not because I have such a good experience the first time, but my Yelp Blogger Friend has never been to any Guu??!! How can that be? This has to be corrected and change! I willing to risk not getting any of food like my first visit just to make sure YBF has a taste of Guu.

Sunday 4:30 pm..coming in when it opens, I think I can for sure get in without waiting and have fast services since we would be the first and the few that would eat that early!

Services excellent!! Our waitress speaks perfect English with a cute Japanese accent and everything I said she would said FOR SURE with a big big smile.. For Sure I am impressed!!

Ume Mojito ($6.50) - still weak.. 
Sake Mojito ($6.50)
Magutata ($6.80)
Okonomiyaki ($6.20)
Uzurano Tamago ($1.90)X2
Salmon Natto Yukke ($6.80)
Amaebi ($6.80) - Fresh sweet shrimps!
Renkon ($1.90)
Matcha Cheese Cake ($4)
Goma Zukushi ($5) - yummy!!

Everything we ordered came in a timely manners..and all delicious but not too memorable.

Since we were here when the restaurant was only 1/4 full, it really lack the atmosphere of Izakaya but it is not really Guu's fault... But I should be used to be eating at half empty restaurants..."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Guu SakaBar - as always, I rate Japanese restaurants based on my experience living in Japan for 7 years. With that in mind, I found the continual screaming quite annoying as they aren't only yelling greetings to incoming and outgoing patrons but food orders and even small talk. Given the layout of the bar it makes it difficult to talk to other people at your table. For those of you wondering - this amount of yelling NEVER HAPPENS IN JAPAN. 

So why 4 stars? On the plus side the staff are all mainly Japanese which gives the food authenticity. Most of the dishes do have a Western Flare to them but they were all very delicious and as close to the real thing as you can expect given that ingredients for purchase in Canada are obviously a bit different in some cases. Further the music/atsmophere of patrons was amazing and definitely a contributing factor as to why there is a continual line at this place. 

FInal Recommendation - Definitely check this place out at some point if you haven't been, but it certainly isn't worth waiting an hour in line for."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is amazing. Tapas style works great for trying lots of things and sharing with friends.

try the:
okonomiyaki pancake
calamari
black sesame ice cream
warm guu'd sake"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. The food is beautifully prepared and delicious. The staff are fast and friendly, and they work as a team so your order is never messed up. I come here twice a month and each time it is so wonderful. Just great food and great service."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing atmosphere. Warning, this might not be the right place if you expect a quiet night out. I do recommend making reservations, as anything more than a party of two, could leave you waiting (or if you prefer, you can sit near the chefs, bar top style). 
The menu selection may seem small compared to other places, but don't look at that as a bad thing. Quality and taste is taste is there with every dish you order."}
{"text":"If you're ever feeling down, just walk into your closest Guu. The warm reception that greets you as you enter is worth it even if you never get a chance to sample their culinary offerings. But try the food and you'll be doing even better.

This is their second location in Toronto, and though it's almost twice as large it's just as popular. They have the communal-style benches that you would find in their Church street location, but also features a room where you can kick off your shoes and sit on Tatami mats on a raised floor. I jumped all over this, obviously.

I'm not going to rattle off names of Japanese dishes and describe them there. Frankly speaking I don't really remember the names of anything I ate, but every single item was extremely tasty. I will mention that five dishes for the two of us was _just_ about enough. Highlight for me: the takoyaki and the salmon carpaccio.

Oh, and while the concept of Sake cocktails might scare you (like they did me (for some reason)), I would shelve your reservations and grab one. Or even two. This place is a gem.

Obligatory Title Pun: SAKA it to me!

Menu Readability: It's all Japanese brushes, yo. KEWL.

Need to mention: I showed up two minutes after opening and got a table. I think that's what you gotta do.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'll do what it takes to avoid waiting in line."}
{"text":"Came here twice -- once a party of 2 and then party of 7 for a birthday. This place is very lively and also loud both times. Service was great for small parties but not as great when we came as a big group (they were also packed, so that's probably why). They do try to make birthdays special and come out with a sign and song when you order the special. We tried several things on the menu and everything tasted great. Really like their unagi bibimbap. The sake bomb is a must!"}
{"text":"We checked out this place on opening night.   Really great food: the daily specials are a wide variety of sashimi-ish offerings, all in the $7 range.  The miso black cod was amazingly tender and delicious.  Grilled squid was just perfect.  Grilled mackeret on sizzling skillet was good, but not a standout.  There were no disappointing courses though.  Had an interesting Barley vodka to drink.  This is a very noisy restaurant, which can be fun or possibly annoying depending on your mood.  The service was slow but that's understandable as they were packed on opening night.  The place has a beautiful decor with slate walls and a marble ceiling, all in a grid of little squares.  Fun place on the whole and welcome addition to that strip of Bloor, which has way too many mediocre restaurants."}
{"text":"Quality: 5/5
Taste: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5

Guu Sakabar is a branch of the parent restaurant Guu Izakaya. An Izakaya in Japan, is a place to drink and eat in the style of tapas. That being said, this is probably the closest thing to being in a real Izakaya in Japan. Upon entering, you are greeted by staff yelling across the restaurant in Japanese, letting everyone aware of your presence (loud Asians seems like an oxymoron). The tables are communal, which remind me of the establishments in Kung fu movies, especially as in \"Man with the iron fists.\" 

The food was spectacular. The pork belly wrapped in puff pastry won me as best dish by far. It was meaty butteriness inside of a crispy pastry with a delectable sauce. In addition, we ordered the flame torched mackerel on top of rice (similar to nigiri), fried prawns with spicy mayo, and cold spinach salad with a delicious ponzu sauce. The texture of the spinach was crispy, refreshing, and really simply perfect. 

The drinks were a let down. My date and I both ordered mixed house drinks featuring Ramune, a Japanese soda drink tasting like a blend of sprite and cream soda. Next time, I'll just stick with the sake. 

Overall, it was a beautiful experience that transported us off the continent and into Japan. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I was long due for a visit to Guu's newest location on Bloor and Bathurst. Thankfully, this location has an indoor waiting area. 

I ordered a Macha Coco (Malibu+Macha+Milk+Whipping Cream). This was basically a green tea latte with alcohol and it was very tasty!

I came with a big group so we were able to share many items. Here are the highlights of my meal. 

Assorted Japanese style deep kebab- includes quail egg, onion, mushroom and perhaps some other items that I did not try. It just wasn't special enough, and I wish they added some twist to it. 

Carbonara udon: creamy udon with bacon, onion, and half boiled egg. I heard a lot of good things about this dish beforehand, but I was somewhat disappointed. The dish didn't wow me like I expected it would. For me, the overall texture with the runny half boiled egg was too slimy.

Ebi mayo: deep fried prawn with spicy mayo. This was generically good, as anything deep fried and slathered with mayo should be. 

Hire Katsu from the daily special menu- rice burger with pork tenderloin cutlet, Taiwanese cabbage, homemade tartar sauce. This was my favourite dish of the night. The rice bun had an interesting texture that worked really well with the pork tenderloin cutlet and pink tartar sauce. I had a quarter of this burger and I wanted a whole one all to myself!

Temari zushi - torched salmon, cream cheese, sushi balls -definitely an enjoyable bite. The torching brings out the fattiness in the salmon, and the cream cheese added an extra touch of creaminess to the sushi ball. 

Takoyaki gratin- another favourite- creamy octopus balls gratin. I didn't actually eat a lot of octopus, but the mixture of cheese, potatoes, and mushrooms was delectable! 

Negi-toro: chopped spicy tuna with green onion, served with nori seaweed. I enjoyed the lightness of this dish, but the tuna wasn't very spicy.

Okonomiyaki: deep fried pancake with yakisoba noodles, tonkatsu sauce and mayo. I don't always love tonkatsu sauce, but in this case, I thought it complemented the pancake quite nicely with the mayo. It was also rather filling.

Onto the desserts! 

Almond tofu: he almond flavour was too overpowering, which ruined the dessert for me because I wasn't a fan of that artificial almond flavour. 

Goma zukushi: sesame ice cream with sesame rice cake and cracker. I felt like I could have put this together at home myself, because wafer crackers and sesame ice cream aren't that hard to find. Points for creativity, but it didn't impress me. The ice cream melted too fast and after a short while, all we had was mochi balls drowned in melted ice cream. 

Roasted green tea cheesecake- I loved this! The cake was perfectly creamy and not too cheesy, and the roasted green tea added to the flavour profile but didn't overpower the cake. 

I wouldn't say that I prefer this location over the old one, and I'm glad to see that the two places have different offerings. I would definitely go back to both locations, but I'd stick to the Sakabar in the winter to avoid the cold wait."}
{"text":"TIP#1: Check out the floor seated traditional room! But you HAVE to reserve & request this in advance!

TIP#2: Their $5 Sake bombs are super fun!  How to do the Sake bomb...
1) balance the Sake shot glass between the chopsticks on top of the cup of beer
2) once you're ready, the staff will make a ruckus and do the 'Sake bomb' chant with you & your friends
3) after the chant you immediately use your hands to rumble the table to make the Sake shot glass drop into the beer. 
4) CHUG CHUG CHUG! 


//SERVICE//
This was my 2nd time at the Kinka Izakaya chain, but 1st time at this Bloor location. The servers were super great. Since it was my friend's birthday, they helped me hide the birthday cake. The energy from the Kinka staff is seriously unmatched whenever we have a birthday celebration or ordering Sake bombs ! 

//THE FOOD//
Their izakaya pub foods are consistently great. I got my old favourites of Okonomiyaki (4/5), chicken karaage (5/5), ebi mayo(4/5), takoyaki (5/5), & karubi (4/5). It can add up to be very expensive but when you're sharing each dish with 2-3 people, it's much more reasonable ! 

Be careful with ordering their alcohol though! My friends ordered a small bottle of Mikan Shochu & didn't realize it was $41! Since Shochu is a liqueur similar to the alcohol content of vodka, sip it slowly !"}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU GUU!

My Tokyo trip is around the corner, so I cannot compare to the homeland country.. yet. However I do have NYC to compare to. In any case, wow! I was pleasantly surprised. I was in town and decided to look up all the places that had pleasant rating on yelp. This restaurant is located in a semi random location, not quite downtown, not quite residential. In any case, parking was done on the street, and a reservation is definitely recommended. They serve the food tapas style, and the prices are standard Japanese food fare.

We had no idea what to order so we just picked whatever sounded good off the menu. I will say the memorable ones included Oden (gott order this one)! it had a great flavorful broth that was different than any udon or ramen broth I've ever had. The pumpkin croquette was also very good. 

If I was local, this would be a definite favorite."}
{"text":"LOVED GUU. I was so excited that Toronto had a relatively large selection of Japanese restaurants and went to Guu the first night of my three day stay. I've been so used to going to Chinese or Korean owned Japanese restaurants that it was exhilarating to see that almost everyone who worked there was Japanese.

The dishes were great, a bunch of small things great for sharing and trying a bunch of the menu. I can only imagine how much more fun it would have been to be with more people than just my boyfriend, but even still we tried about 6 dishes. Each dish seemed to be better than the last so my stomach was supremely happy by the time we finished.

My only issue was that it was a bit loud so it was hard to have a conversation, let alone order food, without screaming, but that's not at the fault of the restaurant, we just happened to be there when there was about 3 birthday parties happening."}

Birthday cheer - GREAT

It's loud and fun when the waitresses gather to sing happy birthday.


Food - MEDIOCRE

I take several issues with the food, and that's taken into consideration this is an izakaya.

1. Small portions. The sukiyaki hotpot wasn't even 1/3 full. 

2. Taste. The fried chicken karaage was very bland, while the sukiyaki tasted sweet as caramel. There seems to be no moderation.


Service - SLOW, BAD

The service was the worst among any Japanese restaurants in Toronto. Here's why:

1. Ordering. The waitress took 1 order, then left without asking what the other 4 people wanted. We waited for 5 minutes, and had to ask a different waitress to take our orders. But since it wasn't her table, she had to go find the original girl... A lot of running in circles.

2. Ready time. We kept wondering if the restaurant forgot about us, because some dishes didn't arrive for 30 minutes. One of us didn't get her udon until everyone else was finished dessert.


Ambiance - DEAFENING

if you want to hear your friends, this is not the place. The music is what's the loudest, and then the customers must also shout to hear each other, so everyone is breaking their vocal cords and ear drums.

In essence, you can only shout to the person immediately beside you. No one else at the table can hear you.


OVER-PRICED

Keeping in mind this is an izakaya, the small portion sizes do not justify the costs. Between 7 of us, $150 barely counted as snacks.



Verdict: NEVER GOING BACK

If the place had quieter music and faster service, I wouldn't even mind the price and poor cooking. But there are just too many negatives.

I do recommend you go there once just to try the environment. But once is all you really need."}
{"text":"1.5 hour wait for mediocre food.

Service was great but the food was just a meh.

The stir fry udon was extremely mushy... would not go again"}
{"text":"We were hoping to get a table early on Saturday night without a reservation. Luckily, we walked in and were seated right away around 6pm in the floor seated room where you have to take your shoes off. It started getting busier right after that. It is LOUD, which is part of the experience. We ordered miso, edamame, hamachi, salmon tataki, gyoza, miso black cod (melt in your mouth) and deep fried brie (tried it once and never again). The salmon oshizushi was hands-down our favorite. This was a fun place for tapas-style dishes where you could try lots of plates."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant on a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed. We had a 30 minute wait in a makeshift waiting room which was freezing cold. 
The ambience, the servers, the experience was all great. However, the food doesn't live up to the hype. The deep fried brie was awful and the rest of the food was mundane. The tuna tartare was good but it was nothing special. 
The restaurant definitely offers a unique experience, it's very loud and lively inside. But the food wasn't worth the price or the wait."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit loud and distracting but the food and decor make it all worth the while. A great selection of Japanese tapas style food, I would mention what I had but we tried so much that it would take all night and to be honest with you, you really can't go wrong. Try anything and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time at Kinka last night! The energy and atmosphere was amazing. They were having a celebration so the waiters and waitresses performed a dance and they held a speed eating contest. Due to the festivities, the service was pretty slow but the servers were incredibly kind and welcoming. 

Not only was the atmosphere amazing, but the food was as well! We ordered the chicken karaage, lobster sashimi, spare ribs, salmon tataki, gyozas, carbonara udon, and deep fried brie. Keep in mind that these dishes are meant to be shared! I would highly recommend the chicken karaage which was really tender as well as the deep fried brie. It was resting on a bed of mango sauce which created an amazing combination of flavours for delicious gooey cheese goodness. For something lighter, the salmon tataki was very refreshing and had an great combination of flavours as well with a hint of wasabi. 

We ended the meal with the mango cheesecake and green tea mousse. The mango cheesecake overpowered the gentle flavours of the mousse but they were both pretty good. If you want a lit night with great food, Kinka is a great contender."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Toronto! I absolutely love all of the food on their menu. I am a picky eater and was reluctant to try many of the dishes, but everything tastes wonderful. My favorite is the Yaki Udon, and the Kakimayo (cheesy oyster) is a must try. I highly recommend the bibimbap (rice) also. The atmosphere is very loud but fun and good for groups. It gets really busy at times and sometimes you have to wait awhile for a chance to call the server over. I would recommend going with a group and ordering a bunch of dishes to share."}
{"text":"We came here at 6pm, no lineups! But the place was near full. We were pushed into some corner really...

The waiters SHOUT a greeting when someone enters and when someone exits. It's so warm and friendly! I really do love that! All waiters/waitresses speak Japanese, including the black guy. It's a fun atmosphere.

WARNING: The food was amazing, VERY small portions, highly expensive. $4 for a small pot of tea!

Takoyaki $5 - about 4 deep fried octopus balls, really yummy though.
Hotate $8.30 - \"baked Hokkaido scallop & mushrooms with garlic butter.\" This was so tiny but so good!
Yaki Udon $7.80 - smallest plate ever. It takes about 5 bites to finish! But this was sooooooo flavourful

No, you will not get full...

Mushroom bibimbap is my absolute favourite. Ok yes you may get full from this.

Be sure to come with friends who wouldn't mind the hefty price and the noise level. And I'm really looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"We missed our reservation because it was a Saturday night in the city and we couldn't find parking anywhere but we were able to get a seat almost instantly. 

The atmosphere is very loud and energetic so I wouldn't suggest bringing small children here. It was a little hard to converse with the people beside me because it was so loud but it was still a great atmosphere. 

The food was done really well. A lot of the dishes are small and sharable so you can order many different dishes for your table but they are a bit pricy for the size of the dish. There was a mix up in the kitchen with one of our dishes and we didn't receive it until we finished eating everything else but they apologized for the delay. 

Over all it was a pretty good experience, the food was great and I would visit again."}
{"text":"I got a random text from a new co-worker: \"How's your trip?\" she said. \"Where are you?\" \"Toronto,\" I said. \"Go to Guu,\" she said. I was agreeable without much to do so I ended there late that same night. And I was glad I did! It's a hip place with good sake, amazing salmon collar, and an even better staff. Skip the okonomiyaki and you'll be happy here."}
