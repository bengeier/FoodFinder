{"text":"Excellent food from pizzas to salads, hoagies to pastas. Great service, fast delivery and they're accommodating."}
{"text":"I order here alot of times only because every other pizza places around are terrible. Sometimes the food is great and other times it sucks. It's really too expensive for the quality. Mushy pizza in the middle and mushy hoagie buns. Don't order fried foods because their always overdone. Delivery times are awful too. Who wants to wait an hour for food. If I can find a better place for pizza I'd never order here again"}
{"text":"Dissappointed to say the least, delivery was quoted 45 minutes, 1.5 hours later still no pizza. Call back and talk to girl with attitude said i had a choice money back or new pizza. Wow i really guess you prefer not to have loyal guests. The sad thing is we are only 2 blocks away, but with kids not as easy to get everyone on same page. Parents can relate to this. So they broughr a new pizza, said they would take off the gratuity , and guess what the charge is still on there with gratuity, you lost another family in east mckeesport, i dont think you can honestly continue to lose business"}
{"text":"Food is good most of the time. Delivery times are pretty bad. Was quoted 45 mins for delivery a few times and ended up waiting 1hr 35 mins the first time, and over 2 hours the second time. When we called to see when our food would be delivered the girl on the phone said they \"got busy\" and put the owner on the phone who didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Finally found a pizza place that knows their own menu and specials! The girl who answered was friendly and smart. The delivery driver was quick and really nice. Most importantly, the food is great! Pizza was great, breadsticks, and Italian hoagie... Everything was great! Very happy customer"}
{"text":"Really good red and white pizza. Delivery is hit or miss depending on how busy they are. They say 45 min but sometimes it's 30-45 sometimes it's 45-60 min. Last time we got wings and they were not crispy but were huge. I didn't complain, just reheated them. Will ask for well done next time. The pizza calzone was amazing, pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese and sauce. Freaking delicious. I have had so so deliveries in the past so I cannot give a 4-5 rating. I also understand that busy times equal long delivery times. Good pizza. Will order again."}
{"text":"We have ordered out from here 3 times. Pepperoni, meat lovers and veggie pizza always delicious. The wings are also very good. The only thing that was not up to par was the hoagie which was part of a special promotion. Delivery time has always been as quoted or shorter and a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Ordered merlinos for the first time as I just moved across town to north Versailles. Order large pep pizza breadsticks and a 2 liter. Pizza is good , better than chain pizza delivery. Very good crust but light on sauce for my liking. Delivery wasn't bad for a Saturday took about an hour.  The breadsticks though are really bad. I love bread sticks but these are more like \"knots\" completely drenched and soaked in butter sauce. There is about a half inch of butter sauce at the bottom of the box. Would have preferred bread, made into stix , then baked.  overall decent experience just don't order breadsticks. I would order pizza from them again as the girl on the phone and delivery driver were friendly and the pizza is solid."}
{"text":"I own a Business in North Versailles we order lunch probably once a week. The delivery guys are always very polite and the food never disappoints. I highly recommend the cheeseballs!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an all around good pie and prices that are down to earth, look no further. Great food, great prices. Here is a tip though, always order your pizza extra extra well done. Trust me it's worth it."}
